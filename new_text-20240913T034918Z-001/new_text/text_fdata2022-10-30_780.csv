news analysis the u s treasury bond market has tumbled this year that s no surprise between the federal reserve s interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening 10 year treasury yields have increased from 1 6 percent to more than 4 0 percent year to date bond yields have an inverse relationship with bond prices but this doesn t feel like a regular bond bear market while the bond market appears calm on the surface increasingly there s talk of a liquidity crisis brewing from too many forces acting in unison in other words a functioning market no matter which direction it s going needs both active buyers and sellers today s market has been whipsawing with extremely low liquidity meaning very very few buyers at any price and high volatility and that could be bad news not just for the treasury bond market but for other financial markets earlier this month treasury secretary janet yellen expressed concern that she was worried about a loss of adequate liquidity on oct 20 yellen s staff even asked the treasury bond auction committee a consortium of investment banks that run bond auctions if the u s treasury should begin buying some less liquid bonds to provide liquidity that s an unusual and concerning request the ice bofaml move index the de facto measure of bond market volatility is at its highest since the middle of 2009 the thick of the last financial crisis yields on both two and five year bonds are at multi decade highs let s quickly examine what has been happening liquidity has been declining ever since the fed began raising interest rates the fed s ending quantitative easing buying of bonds and starting of quantitative tightening has worsened liquidity by taking out one of the market s biggest purchasers of bonds more interest rate hikes are expected to come the u s dollar will continue to strengthen as the fed increases rates to battle inflation that will cause other countries to intervene and defend their currencies to do so they will need to sell u s treasury bonds adding more downward pressure to bond prices in a vacuum these moves all make sense individually but all of these selling activities converging at once could likely seize up the bond market remember a sale can only occur between two willing parties it s unclear who will do the buying the financial times also points out a little known market structure problem that has yet to be tested previously the primary dealers i e big banks kept the treasuries market liquid in a crisis by acting as market makers but after 2008 a string of regulatory reforms made it expensive to play this role the financial paper noted in an oct 20 report as a result primary dealers transactions are now just 2 percent of the market down from 14 percent in 2008 in a note to clients bank of america analysts said that bond market liquidity is fragile and vulnerable to shock there are a lot of risks facing the markets today persistent inflation continued interest rate hikes the u s and global economy geopolitical challenges in europe russia ukraine and east asia china and their effects on businesses employment and ultimately the financial markets the surging dollar is also threatening a traditional source of demand for u s denominated assets sovereign wealth funds and foreign pension funds have historically been big buyers of u s assets both equities and bonds but the bear market in both of these asset classes coupled with a very strong dollar has dampened foreign demand foreign countries now need to sell u s dollar denominated assets to defend their currencies this is another under the radar source of liquidity drying up at almost 24 trillion the u s treasury bond market is huge but if this market seizes up and freezes the consequences could be wide ranging and hard to prepare for views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

fargo for more than half a century the art world was influenced by the voice and views of peter schjeldahl a longtime critic for the new yorker the village voice the new york times artnews and art in america among other publications he died on oct 21 at 80 after a long battle with cancer schjeldahl was born in fargo in 1942 but moved with his parents gilmore and charlene around minnesota to farmington minneapolis and northfield where he would attend and drop out of carleton college twice he eventually moved to new york in 1965 and found work as a critic for publications as an adult he would occasionally return to the midwest and in 1978 helped fix up the old post office in christine north dakota where his mother charlene hanson used to live advertisement in north dakota i m overwhelmed he told the forum in 1980 referring to the horizon and blackness of the soil i feel deeply moved in a way i can t really explain and i think about it a lot perhaps schjeldahl s biggest direct impact on the region came in 1979 when he was on the committee that commissioned texas artist luis jiménez to create a public sculpture for the corner of broadway and main avenue arts and entertainment sodbuster is heading out sculpture to be repaired put on display outside fargo after 13 years in storage the sodbuster is on the move the plains art museum on monday announced plans to restore the colorful sculpture and place it at the proposed fargo city hall civic plaza in 2018 on wednesday the 24 foot long we wanted something that would challenge local taste but that would be friendly in the long run he told the forum in 1980 the jiménez fiberglass sculpture sodbuster depicting a farmer plowing a field behind a team of oxen indeed proved to be challenging to locals when it was installed in 1982 some dismissed the work and one letter to the editor of the forum called it a piece of trash in the 1980 interview schjeldahl recalled how one of jiménez s earlier designs a rambunctious square dance scene was nixed there s a definite cultural gap between jiménez and fargo the critic said jiménez naturally assumed being chicano that people liked to see themselves having fun as a lutheran born in north dakota i could have told him he d be mistaken the late art critic peter schjeldahl contributed public domain wikimedia commons it seems he had little if anything to do with fargo moorhead arts after that but he continued to influence the national art world among those who have eulogized schjeldahl was alex greenbereger who in an artnews article stated the late writer s exuberant prose and perceptive mind made him one of the most widely read art critics in the u s advertisement in the many published memorials people pointed to schjeldahl s accessible way with words an extension of his work as a poet often his reviews were rid of art jargon causing them to be legible to a larger audience even when he was dealing with conceptual work greenberger wrote his prose was lush and buttery with sentences pocked with big words more likely to appear in novels than in art reviews if read aloud his reviews sound melodious and quite pleasing if read to oneself they can also be fascinating even amusing greenberger pointed to a passage fellow critic jarrett earnest wrote in hot cold heavy light 100 art writings 1988 2018 which included schjeldahl s works every painter i know would give a couple of fingers off their non painting hand for a good long review by peter schjeldahl not only for the recognition but because he unfailingly brings something new into the discourse earnest wrote not all artists may have seen schjeldahl this way of the popular contemporary artist jeff koons who set a record for auction prices by a living artist at 91 1 million in 2019 schjeldahl wrote jeff koons makes me sick he may be the definitive artist of this moment and that makes me the sickest the critic s words didn t always sit well with jonathan rutter director and curator of the rourke art gallery museum in moorhead and an accomplished painter in his own right peter schjeldahl certainly left an impression on me i would typically catch his new yorker articles second or likely third hand from james o rourke rutter says referring to the late rourke co founder more often than not i would vigorously disagree with what schjeldahl had to say but his writing was always a pleasure to read criticism joins poetry for me in having a civic duty to limber up the common word stock keeping good words in play schjeldahl said in a 2008 artforum interview my sidekick is the random house webster s unabridged dictionary advertisement still by the 1990s he had quit writing poetry the poetry dried up the art criticism ate the poetry he said in that artforum interview in 2019 schjeldahl shared the news of his lung cancer diagnosis in a new yorker essay the art of dying a raw unsentimental mini memoir at the time he was given six months to live but ended up extending his stay for three more years making his line all the more prophetic i always said that when my time came i d want to go fast but where s the fun in that he took his work seriously despite the cascades of self deprecation there were times when i think he knew how good he was but he was never self serious new yorker editor david remnick wrote in an appreciation he once won a grant to write a memoir he used the money to buy a tractor schjeldahl kept writing up until the end handing in a book review of a piet mondrian biography to the new yorker weeks before he passed that he wrote it through what must have been an unimaginably painful time is a testament to what great art and powerful writing meant to him and hopefully to us wrote christopher knight art critic for the los angeles times in a remembrance

price down 20 the downturn hit amazon founder jeff bezos by as much as 4 7 billion a day bezos had already lost nearly 60 billion in 2022 still leaving him with a net worth of around 134 billion the day before microsoft s earnings report showed dependable cloud computing earnings growth in its azure division was slowing resulting in a roughly 8 drop in the company s valuation this will affect bill gates whose fortune has fallen this year by nearly 30 billion to about 109 billion even the founder of tesla elon musk the richest man in the world and now twitter ownerthey were not immune to an economic downturn shares of tesla the electric car maker are down 43 7 in the year to date this likely reduced mars colonizer a fortune of 58 6 billion over the past 12 months to 212 billion is still astronomical but despite the stock market bloodshed this week 56 of the 65 tech billionaires survived forbes the list of magazines which includes oracle founder larry ellison google founders larry page and sergey brin twitter founder jack dorsey and former microsoft ceo steve ballmer is still richer than it was three years ago earlier this year chuck collins director of the institute for policy studies who runs its program on inequality estimated that american billionaires have seen their combined wealth rise by more than 1 7 trillion representing a gain of more than 58 percent due to the pandemic collins now says recent declines have reduced that to 1 5 billion or 51 percent if wealth is to disappear from the economy this is the best place to disappear from chuck collins institute for policy studies the gains were very unusual in the two years of the pandemic and they were almost pornographic he said billionaires are fundamentally disconnected from the real world and the real economy even if their wealth adjusts now who has made a 51 gain in their assets in the past two years billionaires are not the real victims tech companies have come to dominate us stock markets their slump dragging the broader market down and with them the pensions and savings of americans who are also struggling with high interest rates and high inflation in 40 years the bigger question is how long will this fall last and who will be hurt the most they are not likely to be aristocrats in the big tech companies if wealth is going to disappear from the economy that is the best place to disappear from collins says it may slow down the stinging philanthropy but the truth is that most billionaires donate to their own foundations and to the money that donors advise but it could mean less dynasty wealth which i ultimately think is a good thing
the good times might soon be over for california s government the nation s most populous state has had so much cash lately that lawmakers have spent freely handing out free health care to low income immigrants paying for every 4 year old to attend kindergarten and sending more than 21 billion in stimulus checks to taxpayers over the past two years that seemingly endless flow of money has started to dry up as state tax collections have fallen below expectations for four months in a row there s now an 80 chance california will be about 8 billion short when its fiscal year ends next summer

in this article we will be taking a look at the 10 largest gas station chains in the us to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 largest gas station chains in the us gas stations in the united states are a major industry in and of themselves and integral to the revenue and profits of the major oil and gas companies running them according to ibis world the united states gas station industry is worth more than 138 billion providing employment to hundreds of thousands of people across the country the lonely gas station in an otherwise abandoned area has provided the backdrop to many movies and is an iconic image in and of itself unlike most european countries the united states is absolutely huge many states alone are bigger than some european countries which is why while public transport is a very efficient means of travel in the european regions it is not as easily implementable in the united states further while european cities are often built and amended to facilitate its citizens and allow for better public transport cycling routes and pedestrian areas u s cities thanks to lobbying by major automakers in the country are built to accommodate roads and cars which is why cars are in huge demand in the country additionally while most european governments are emphasizing on using alternative fuel to power automobiles in addition to reducing the number of cars diesel is still king in the united states and while alternative fuels are being implemented the pace is slow and not making a significant impact in the near future all of this shows why gas stations are so integral to the united states and why they are an entire industry in fact such is the importance of gas prices in the country that the outlook of americans on their country rises and fall in accordance with the rise and fall in gas prices if gas prices go up there is greater fear that the country is on an uncertain path with vice versa holding true too 2022 has been an uncertain year for the biggest superpower in the world and economic uncertainty has increased with inflation rising to near record levels and the threat of a recession looming over every decision the country makes gas prices have been notoriously high as well with one of the main reasons being the russian invasion of ukraine which has led to sanctions against one of the world s biggest oil and gas producer leading to gas prices rising across the world the united states was no exception with the national average price of gas in the country crossing 5 per gallon in june before decreasing in subsequent months and leveling off since most people do not have an alternative to cars because of scant public transport they have no choice but to allow gas prices to take up a bigger chunk of their total savings while in the case of other products having their prices increased people can opt for cheaper substitutes or just reduce their spending on that specific product this is not true for gas as there aren t really any alternatives to driving the psychological impacts of gas prices increasing are numerous as well an economist with the philadelphia fed learned that people who were teenagers during the gas price shocks in the 1970s drove less even 20 years later as this is the first major product spend for most teenagers and if the cost is significantly high they may be more averse to spending on it even if their level of disposable income increases there is another reason to be wary of gas prices in the future opec recently announced that they re going to be decreasing output by 2 million barrels a day this was despite talks between saudi arabia and the united states continuing to ensure that oil supply was adequate so as to not increase price and despite the latter being hopeful of an increase in output opec contravened the wishes of the united states and decreased output which can have additional ramifications as the united states considers sanctions against saudia arabia according to the u s energy information administration there is a potential of disruptions in the petroleum supply chain and the slower than expected oil production growth could lead to increasing oil prices in winter when demand is higher however a slower than expected economic growth rate could lead to a decrease in oil prices u s production meanwhile is expected to be around 11 7 million barrels per day and 12 4 million barrels per day in 2023 which will easily beat the record highs set in 2019 before the pandemic wreaked havoc globally further the expected gas price in the u s is 3 8 per gallon in q4 of 2022 and 3 57 in 2023 well below the frightening high of over 5 per gallon in june 2022 despite the dependence on gas the expected gasoline consumption in the united states is expected to decline in 2022 as compared to 2021 with consumption being 8 8 million barrels per day 40 000 barrels per day less than as compared to 2021 and expected to remain at similar levels throughout 2023 the main reason behind declining consumption is increasing fuel efficiency which has more than offset the increase in prices and rising demand the biggest gas station chains in

in this article we will be taking a look at the 10 largest gas station chains in the us to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 largest gas station chains in the us gas stations in the united states are a major industry in and of themselves and integral to the revenue and profits of the major oil and gas companies running them according to ibis world the united states gas station industry is worth more than 138 billion providing employment to hundreds of thousands of people across the country the lonely gas station in an otherwise abandoned area has provided the backdrop to many movies and is an iconic image in and of itself unlike most european countries the united states is absolutely huge many states alone are bigger than some european countries which is why while public transport is a very efficient means of travel in the european regions it is not as easily implementable in the united states further while european cities are often built and amended to facilitate its citizens and allow for better public transport cycling routes and pedestrian areas u s cities thanks to lobbying by major automakers in the country are built to accommodate roads and cars which is why cars are in huge demand in the country additionally while most european governments are emphasizing on using alternative fuel to power automobiles in addition to reducing the number of cars diesel is still king in the united states and while alternative fuels are being implemented the pace is slow and not making a significant impact in the near future all of this shows why gas stations are so integral to the united states and why they are an entire industry in fact such is the importance of gas prices in the country that the outlook of americans on their country rises and fall in accordance with the rise and fall in gas prices if gas prices go up there is greater fear that the country is on an uncertain path with vice versa holding true too 2022 has been an uncertain year for the biggest superpower in the world and economic uncertainty has increased with inflation rising to near record levels and the threat of a recession looming over every decision the country makes gas prices have been notoriously high as well with one of the main reasons being the russian invasion of ukraine which has led to sanctions against one of the world s biggest oil and gas producer leading to gas prices rising across the world the united states was no exception with the national average price of gas in the country crossing 5 per gallon in june before decreasing in subsequent months and leveling off since most people do not have an alternative to cars because of scant public transport they have no choice but to allow gas prices to take up a bigger chunk of their total savings while in the case of other products having their prices increased people can opt for cheaper substitutes or just reduce their spending on that specific product this is not true for gas as there aren t really any alternatives to driving advertisement advertisement the psychological impacts of gas prices increasing are numerous as well an economist with the philadelphia fed learned that people who were teenagers during the gas price shocks in the 1970s drove less even 20 years later as this is the first major product spend for most teenagers and if the cost is significantly high they may be more averse to spending on it even if their level of disposable income increases there is another reason to be wary of gas prices in the future opec recently announced that they re going to be decreasing output by 2 million barrels a day this was despite talks between saudi arabia and the united states continuing to ensure that oil supply was adequate so as to not increase price and despite the latter being hopeful of an increase in output opec contravened the wishes of the united states and decreased output which can have additional ramifications as the united states considers sanctions against saudia arabia according to the u s energy information administration there is a potential of disruptions in the petroleum supply chain and the slower than expected oil production growth could lead to increasing oil prices in winter when demand is higher however a slower than expected economic growth rate could lead to a decrease in oil prices u s production meanwhile is expected to be around 11 7 million barrels per day and 12 4 million barrels per day in 2023 which will easily beat the record highs set in 2019 before the pandemic wreaked havoc globally further the expected gas price in the u s is 3 8 per gallon in q4 of 2022 and 3 57 in 2023 well below the frightening high of over 5 per gallon in june 2022 despite the dependence on gas the expected gasoline consumption in the united states is expected to decline in 2022 as compared to 2021 with consumption being 8 8 million barrels per day 40 000 barrels per day less than as compared to 2021 and expected to remain at similar levels throughout 2023 the main reason behind declining consumption is increasing fuel efficiency which has more than offset the increase in prices and rising demand the biggest

photo pixabay as the cost of living rises and world economies head for a 2023 slowdown flinders university researchers are forecasting ongoing effects of the russian ukraine conflict on key barometers notably in the energy sector and global stock markets while the conflict has hit much of western europe now struggling with the negative effects of gas supply cuts higher power price and uncertainty on their stock markets investors are focusing on renewable energy stocks and global energy firms with footholds in north america and elsewhere renewable energy stocks have performed very well as sanctions by the west with world leading energy exporter russia followed its invasion of ukraine says flinders university lecturer in finance dr jak kakhkharov from the college of business government and law as the war drags on we could see even more focus on the speed and amounts of funds devoted to a transition to a green economy unfortunately it appears that the conflict will continue for a long time and it is going to have long lasting disparate impact on different sectors the analysis of stock markets of different countries at the start of the military campaign shows a significant and negative impact of the war on the stock markets of hungary russia poland and slovakia even before the invasion stock markets in some other countries located remotely to the conflict zone including australia india japan south africa and spain followed in the post invasion days this effect demonstrates that in a globalised world none of the countries is secured against conflict fallout it appears that globalised economies turned out to be more vulnerable to this conflict whereas markets of some nato countries exhibited higher returns possibly due to expectations of higher military expenditures the study so far shows that energy firms competing with russian energy companies performed better than other energy firms and while the sanctions have serious implications for fossil fuel stocks and international energy security it has led russia to divert energy exports to india and china the exporters in these countries are paying lower prices for energy imports from russia which may eventually strengthen their competitive position vis a vis the western alliance that adopted the sanctions another interesting phenomenon to observe is the differential effect of the war on various economies with most existing research focused mainly on the economic fallout of the second world war eight rounds of eu sanctions russian demands of payments for gas in roubles restrictions on using russian tankers partial military mobilisation in russia a price cap on maritime transport to third countries of russian crude oil and many others have created external shocks which are worth studying to forecast how different sectors react dr jakhkharov says the international energy agency iea this week confirmed forecasts that russia s invasion of ukraine is likely to accelerate the world s transition to greener energy from fossil fuels

if republican bob stefanowski had answered a forthright yes when asked if he would denounce the anti democracy stance of his national party and former president trump especially in connection with the jan 6 assault on the capitol the day would have been free to give serious consideration to endorsing his candidacy for governor of connecticut no issue not inflation not police accountability not the supreme court s nullifying of roe v wade not gun safety supersedes the peril of the united states of america losing the soul of its democracy make no mistake elections have consequences and the one on nov 8 2022 will have greater consequences than any so far in american history it will ultimately affect every other issue and every american yes the governor is a state official not a member of congress and yes it is true as both stefanowski and incumbent governor ned lamont told the day editorial board that the office of governor of connecticut is less encumbered with dysfunctional partisanship than a u s senate seat but no one elected this fall will be able to look away from the urgency of addressing our divisiveness at every level when the microphones went off at the end of stefanowski s meeting with the editorial board he said he was just asking for a chance asked earlier about his political role models he cited ronald reagan and massachusetts governor charlie baker bob stefanowski could have campaigned as a traditional moderate connecticut republican who would have no truck with the election denying right wing he chose not to he has been right on some important issues he is spot on in attacking the corruption and waves of cost increases under the connecticut port authority as have the day and columnist david collins he is right that the deal with eversource and orsted the wind power developers should have been reopened he is an enthusiastic fan of new london and sees the potential for this port city in the four years since he first ran stefanowski has given up on ending the state income tax and instead has plans for a 2 billion tax relief plan that would partially tap the state s surplus that would be welcome during an inflationary time but bipartisan passed volatility and spending caps direct a percentage of the gains toward paying down the state s burdensome pension debt there is no comparison to the hundreds of millions of dollars that payment will save for current taxpayers and their descendants in recent weeks stefanowski has gotten behind policies that make it unlikely in the end that he would have gotten the day s endorsement revising essentially weakening the affordable housing statute promoting the scariest interpretation of post pandemic crime increases and warning that police aren t chasing suspects because they fear the qualified immunity provision of the police reform law ned lamont has shown both strong leadership and serious flaws in his first term but with a reorientation from private sector businessman to the state s highest public official he should be able to give connecticut a better four years the day s most persistent criticism of lamont has been his failures of transparency repeatedly treating state governance as if it were a proprietary matter rather than the people s business you don t have to take our word for it his generally competent administration somehow could not muster the capacity to comply with the connecticut freedom of information act that will change at last because the foi commission has slapped the governor s staff with mandatory training on the open records law by his own lights lamont thinks of himself as transparent it is true that his daily press briefings during the covid pandemic kept the public connected to daily developments but that should be just a start it took him a while but the governor has been good for new london and for the largest single potential growth area in the state s job market the hiring of thousands of new workers at electric boat helped by federal funds and stock market returns he has made a healthy dent in the pension debt started programs to cope with children s and adults mental health crises overseen gun control measures and implemented child tax credits he has been an education governor when one was sorely needed should he win re election as polling suggests he will lamont needs to continue to focus on job training for manufacturing and recruitment of nurses teachers and police officers he can expect to be dealing with inflation and a likely recession in this term he should lead the way in reducing opioid and fentanyl overdose deaths through methods that have proven to work he should continue to advocate for greater access to voting crucially he must renew and carry out the state s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and preparing for climate change that is already underway it is the day s responsibility first last and always to advocate for democracy all those critically important endeavors must happen within the framework of democracy or they may never happen at all ned lamont has his shortcomings like any governor any human in our judgment however he is the most likely candidate to affirm connecticut s commitment to justice and opportunity for all

engagements by chidi amuta this piece was earlier published in the immediate aftermath of the july kuje prison break in abuja by iswap operatives and subsequent sporadic terrorist attacks in and around the federal capital this week s coordinated terror alerts by embassies of different western countries in abuja compel a re run of the piece on the matter of ensuring national security by all means necessary i accept being called a hawk but on the concomitant cautious fear that bad things could happen to the nation if our defenses are lax i will accept the title of coward in short a nation is entitled to deploy maximum force to ensure its continued sovereignty while constantly looking out to protect its citizens from those forces that do not wish both government and people well taken together this is the contradiction that now defines our security imperative nothing better gives our situation more urgency than the clear consistent threat on the security of abuja life limbs and the very state are now at risk as the national capital is daily assaulted by an undisguised enemy force and yet the embarrassing laxity of our defense and security forces in response to this existential threat dictates that we prepare for the worst and hope for the best in the last couple of weeks an enemy we are used to casually dismissing as a bunch of bandits has consistently targeted abuja without fear of any contradiction the forces of insecurity have coalesced into an enemy with a concerted strategic focus the target of this adversary is clearly and unambiguously the sovereign heart of the nigerian state i am convinced that some evil force is out to hoist its nasty flag and shout a familiar bad slogan somewhere in the heart of abuja only in the last fortnight iswap terrorists have stormed and breached the kuje medium security prison and freed an indeterminate number of inmates these include over 60 dangerous boko haram combatants an operation that reportedly involved over 200 iswap operatives on motorbikes and which lasted a few hours has merely been explained away by an untidy exchange of blames and excuses by those paid to secure that facility an embarrassed president buhari visited the broken prison and demanded a report on why our intelligence set up woefully failed to prevent the attack soon afterwards alarms by some institutions in abuja about imminent terrorist attacks have produced evidence that the enemy we fear to name is very much at the door an elite brigade of guards patrol in the reported area of the abuja law school yielded a bloody ambush that has claimed the lives of a number of soldiers of the presidential guards unit if the well trained and armed guards of the president cannot survive an attack by the enemy force what chance is there for the ordinary abuja resident meanwhile a reported siege of a federal government high school in a neighborhood of abuja has alarmed school authorities into asking parents to evacuate their children from the school in a reflex over reaction authorities of the federal capital authority have ordered a shut down of any number of private and public schools in and around abuja as a preventive measure there is no word as to for how long these unforeseen closures will last i share a level of intelligence available to the officials ordering these closured that is not available to either commonsense or the public as if that was not enough only last thursday evening a roving unit of terrorists attacked an army checkpoint around zuma rock on the busy abuja kaduna highway casualty figures remain hazy and conflicting predictably these sporadic attacks in and around abuja have created an understandable atmosphere of fear among the populace understandably the president has taken some feeble action he has met with his security council the national security adviser has briefed a frightened and unsettled nation about steps being taken to tame terrorists and in particular defend abuja in an unusually candid admission the nsa admitted that nigerians have become weary of the security situation and the numerous official reassurances by his admission the public has incrementally lost confidence in the ability of the state to protect and defend the citizenry thereby making self help and personal protection an increasingly attractive option mr monguno revealed that defense and security authorities are working on a new set of strategies to contain and combat the insecurity in the nation after seven years of buhari s anti corruption and maximum security administration the army has quickly reshuffled its commanders as if the mere moving of personnel and military furniture will translate into a fundamental strategic refocusing or tactical review of the old methods that have woefully failed us in the last seven years under a president with a military background clearly the political leadership of the nation has been vastly deficient mr buhari has serially fallen short in the enormous powers which the nigerian constitution give him as commander in chief moreso for a president who was elected partly because he has a military background that was hoped would equip him to deal with the insecurity that preceded his ascendancy however given the present critical stage of the threat to national security it would be a disservice to the nation for politicians to aggravate what is already and incendiary moment therefore the six week ultimatum given the president to fix the insecurity or face impeachment is an irresponsible political gambit it is at best a cheap political blackmail with an intent to frighten an insecure president with a history of epic incompetence at worst the threat by senators of the opposition pdp has an inbuilt extortionist undertone that is familiar in nigeria s murky political culture of corruption and unbridled mercantilism it is bad business to try and extort money out of a desperate national security emergency call my alert on the threat to abuja baseless scare mongering if you like but i see a clear strategic purpose in the pattern of recent attacks on facilities in and around abuja it ought to interest a perceptive public however that the government has never given the adversary a name it is in fact the terrorists themselves who strike installations like the kuje prison and reveal unapologetically through vivid videos that they are iswap the government has been reluctant to admit either boko haram or iswap as the enemy against which they are fighting the government just tags the attacks the handiwork of terrorists and moves on the progressive advance of the enemy forces is by no means haphazard or just opportunistic what we are witnessing is a clear purposive and directed movement of hostile actions even in an asymmetrical fashion which is typical of jihadist guerilla tactics but the direction is obvious it is governed by the territorial ambition of a movement intent on controlling a strategic swathe of territory from the sahel to the larger west african gulf of guinea oceanfront nigeria is central to that calculation on account of its population and resource base it has also become more attractive in recent times on account of the proven serial failures of the institutions of state and the weakness of national defence and security to stoutly defend the nation s sovereignty some analysts have pointed at signs of collusion between elements in nigeria s security forces and the enabling financiers of boko haram and iswap some have seen signs of infiltration of intelligence sources and outright complicity between guardians of state security and defence and the enemy forces leading to ease of some of the operations no one is certain that these suspicions are either true or totally false what we can see is a clear purposive enlargement of the theatre of these attacks in the direction of abuja as the centre of power in nigeria what started out in borno state has spread throughout the entire north east it has strayed into the north west and descended on the north central zone in the north west zone it has targeted kaduna as the military industrial nerve centre of the nation and the last line of defense for abuja it has successfully tested the nerves of the nigerian defence academy by killing and abducting some of its officers right on the campus the enemy briefly knocked out the kaduna airport by invading its perimeters and abducting some airport workers thereby briefly closing the airport to many commercial airlines it has made the abuja kaduna highway untenable as a route for normal civil traffic the enemy has severally attacked the rail link between abuja and kaduna and has knocked it out of the national civil transportation grid it has taken out the rail link on the abuja kaduna corridor while its rolling stock is marooned meanwhile the chinese loan that funded the rail line is gathering interest and charges while the project is returning zero revenue government has remained silent on when the rail link will reopen and yet we remain silent on the identity and purpose of this enemy the iswap boko haram coalition forces have similarly zeroed in on states adjoining abuja in niger state for instance the terrorists have taken over whole local governments and are exacting tributes rents and levies from local populations it attacked a miners in shiroro and killed over 30 soldiers and policemen that dared to challenge their abduction of chinese miners in the same week an advance contingent of presidential staff on their way to president buhari s home town of daura were attacked and a couple of them injured a deliberate targeting of the president as the ultimate symbol of our national sovereignty can only mean one thing an arrow in the heart of the nigerian nation those intent on diminishing the urgency and import of the obvious threat to abuja and nigeria s sovereignty need to learn from recent jihadist takeovers and disruptions of nations in recent times the dramatic fall of kabul to the forces of the taliban proceeded in similar fashion at first the taliban forces were concentrated far in the provinces far away from the capital through a series of lightning raids and coordinated but sporadic attacks on major strategic routes to kabul they stunned both the government in kabul as well as its supporting us military backers all that american training air power hardware logistics and communications backing were neutralized overnight taliban operatives who had effectively infiltrated the intelligence and defense architecture of the state merely streamed into an already softened and besieged kabul america retreated in stampede almost like in saigon on april 30 1975 all that sophisticated arsenal was reduced to a huge scrap yard of useless military technology that no one could use all the generals with their fancy titles epaulets and shiny medals were reduced to a horde of scampering cowards on the run many of them had long been in the payroll of both the americans and the taliban simultaneously that lesson ought to be instructive to those paid to guard the secrets of nigeria s security and defence in today s unfolding engagement there may still be some residual professional muscle left in our military to confront our security nightmare but the political interpretation of the crisis has bred a doctrinal anarchy and confusion of terminologies which is not helping those whose business it is to worry about nigeria s insecurity the political leadership has finally agreed that the power base of the state is confronted by a terrorist onslaught it took a while to officially pronounce the iswap boko haram coalition a terrorist undertaking but even that is hardly the whole truth by the strict characterization of terrorism we are not dealing with mere sporadic terrorists terrorists strike at the soft underbelly of society s complacent zones to disturb the peace violently distort the norm and frighten the innocent terrorists storm train stations airports convert air planes into kamikaze missiles blow up restaurants mosques churches night clubs and other places where society takes normalcy and tranquility for granted these are the favorite targets of determined terrorists as a rule terrorists do not take territory or seek sovereignty over any place peoples or things they bomb shoot or stab and instill horror through sudden violent acts thereafter they move on hoping not to be caught but leaving an unmistakable message through blood and tears their aim is to shock us all into an awareness of a cause or a cultural injury the aim of terrorists is always to provoke the question why the hope is that the quest for answers will lead to some justice or atonement of an original injustice that has been etched into the mind of terrorist foot soldiers terrorists carry no maps or compasses to do so would make their operations predictable and their trail obvious all terrorists are unhinged agents of the devil satan s foot soldiers with neither direction nor compass in some cases they decorate their violence with a sectarian creed in order to keep their followership and attract new devotees sectarian terrorism is best rooted out by political means from its creedal source not massaged by silly palliatives and symbolic amnesties let us make no mistake about it in nigeria we are not confronted by transactional bandits merely out to collect loose cash to assuage their socio economic deprivation and flee the trade after making enough money of course there are criminal bandit elements in our mix of sundry trouble makers but those ones merely frighten innocent people take hostages rape women demand ransom and sometimes storm schools transit buses trains and isolated motorists banditry is bad violent entrepreneurship gone out of control but the majority of those we call bandits are recruits of the iswap boko haram enterprise the ransoms collected by bandits go to swell the war chest of the larger jihadist enterprise criminal banditry is easy to root out take out the gangster chieftains and you are likely to exterminate the ring but systemic jihadist banditry has an almost limitless pool of recruits and is therefore self renewing nigeria s more strategic insecurity is therefore a local off shoot and subset of the larger isis global jihadist terrorist network in its sahelian iteration isis has metamorphosed into iswap boko haram which has swallowed up boko haram and other isolated local chapters that is why it became necessary and urgent for iswap to exterminate abubakar shekau and the leadership of boko haram it has territorial ambition it has political and strategic purpose it has a sectarian dressing to appeal to innocent hearts and minds it has a geo strategic design its operations have a strategic compass and political map what is unfolding in nigeria especially the virtual siege on abuja are the manifestations of these more concerted purposes and larger designs hence the concerted international concern we need to key into the international onslaught to save our nation instead of this laughable grand standing by marionette minions of state power
in 2016 dunbarton tobacco trust released its second line of cigars and perhaps most notably the company s first line to incorporate a connecticut broadleaf wrapper named mi querida which translates to my mistress from spanish the cigar is made at nicaragua american cigars s a nacsa the estelí based factory with ties to the oliva tobacco co which is widely regarded as being one of the better tobacco companies when it comes to working with that specific tobacco while that original mi querida has grown to encompass more than 12 different vitolas since it debuted dunbarton also released as second brand in 2019 named mi querida triqui traca that slightly stronger blend gets its name from a nicaraguan term for firecrackers that are tied together and is differentiated by its red and gold band compared to the original mi querida s navy blue and gold band earlier this year dunbarton announced it would be releasing a third line extension named mi querida black made up of a connecticut broadleaf wrapper covering a mexican san andrés negro binder as well as filler tobaccos grown in the dominican republic honduras and nicaragua according to saka the mi querida black blend is expected to be offered in multiple sizes next year but the first cigar in the line was shown off during the 2022 pca convention trade show a 7 1 4 x 54 double corona named sakakhan if you are wondering about the name sakakhan saka detailed the origin of the moniker in a facebook post it was the 80 s when chaka khan became known as an artist and i was getting certified to con n as a jood underway on my ship the enlisted guys who worked the bridge started calling me this kinda funny as my middle name temujin is also the birth name of ghengis khan so this is double dip when it comes to why this nickname stuck my dad obviously had some pretty lofty expectations as is the case with both the regular mi querida and the triqui traca lines the mi querida black sakakhan is made at nicaragua american cigars s a in estelí nicaragua the msrp for the mi querida black sakakhan is set at 15 95 per cigar and the release is limited to 3 500 boxes of 10 cigars that began arriving at retailers early last month while the sakakhan is new for 2022 the cigar is not this exact same blend and vitola was actually sold last november as an exclusive for jr cigar and the retailer s 50th anniversary the cigars are the same outside of the packaging and the price the sakakhan is 1 per cigar more expensive than the jr release cigar reviewed mi querida black sakakhan mi querida black sakakhan country

of cigars smoked for review 3 this does not include the aforementioned 2021 release at jr cigar visually the mi querida sakakhan is a sight to behold highlighted by a dark espresso brown wrapper that despite the copious amount of oil that is present is parchment rough to the touch there are plenty of veins running up and down all three cigars but none of those veins are overly distracting and the small pigtail coiled on top of each cap is a nice touch after physical inspections i find a soft spot close to the foot on the right side of the main band on my first cigar but the other two have no such issues aromas from the wrapper include strong sweet wood earth leather barnyard black pepper and fairly generic sweetness the foot s aroma features notes of dry oak baker s spices dark chocolate espresso beans raisin sweetness and a touch of citrus finally after a straight cut the cold draw brings flavors of strong almonds leather cocoa nibs cinnamon gritty earth and milk chocolate sweetness starting out the first thing i notice is some obvious mineral saltiness on my lips along with distinct oak and black pepper flavors as the burn progresses the oak remains one of the top flavors in the profile it is joined by a strong and rich roasted espresso bean flavor after about eight puffs followed by dry straw gritty earth leather plain popcorn pencil lead and light cinnamon in addition there is a small amount of black pepper on the retrohale which also features a stronger fruity sweetness that reminds me of pomegranate at times both the flavor and the body have no problem reaching a point just under medium by the end of the first third while the strength is lagging just a bit behind them so far construction wise the draw is excellent after a straight cut the burn line on all three cigars is a bit wavy but non problematic and there is no lack of thick gray smoke a dry tea leaf note takes over the main flavor in the profile during the second third of the cigar followed by secondary notes of creamy oak dank earth roasted coffee beans toasted bread cinnamon and creamy hay there is a bit more pomegranate sweetness on the retrohale and a bit less black pepper while the mineral saltiness on my lips has also decreased slightly in addition one cigar features a very light floral note on the finish but it is gone almost before i can place it flavor bumps up to medium full and is still rising the body is just a bit over medium and the strength is also at a solid medium but the latter seems content to stay put for the moment the burn on the problematic cigar from the first third has evened up nicely the other two cigars are great in that regard while both the smoke production and draws continue along their excellent paths the main flavors in the profile of the sakakhan change again during the final third this time to a combination of rich cocoa nibs and gritty earth that continue until the end of the cigar additional notes of dark chocolate dried tea leaves creamy oak espresso beans sourdough bread and very light citrus peel flit in and out at various points while the retrohale has barely changed compared to the second third meaning there is a small amount of black pepper combined with slightly more pomegranate sweetness the mineral saltiness that has been noticeable on my lips for the first two thirds has completely dissipated flavor ends the cigar firmly in the full range while the strength reaches medium plus and the body lands halfway between medium and full finally although the smoke production remains copious and the draws continue to be excellent on all three cigars one cigar has enough burn issues that i am forced to touch it up twice in quick succession final notes the smoke emanating from this cigar smells distinctly like graham crackers to me when i first saw it i absolutely loved the simplicity of the band the silver pops out from the black background as well as the darkness of the wrapper it is wrapped around however when i looked at them closer up and in person i realized that the design that is used on the boxes is also embossed into the background of each band a very nice touch for those who notice it during my interview with saka at the 2022 pca convention he told me that dunbarton will most likely produce a total of 1 8 million cigars this year which is an increase of more than 400 000 cigars compared to 2021 saka also estimated that number will increase to around 2 5 million total cigars by the end of next year dunbarton tobacco trust advertises on halfwheel the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time averaged two hours and 7 minutes for all three cigars although my first cigar smoked noticeably faster than the other two for some reason if you would like to purchase any of the mi querida sakakhan cigars site sponsors cigar hustler corona cigar co and famous smoke shop all have them in stock 91 overall score a flavor bomb from the first puff to the last the mi querida sakakhan is highlighted by main notes that include cocoa nibs earth oak espresso beans and dried tea leaves along with a constant pomegranate sweetness on the retrohale however the black pepper i was expecting has been toned down quite a bit especially in the final two thirds of the cigar replaced by an overall creaminess that really helps to balance out the earthiness that is present in the end the mi querida black sakakhan is a bold and superbly balanced addition to the mi querida family and a cigar that is well worth taking the time and effort to track down

soft finance with ayo arowolo shortly after i had scanned the concept soft finance to the designer working with me to come up with design options he sent back a whatsapp note to me asking me to explain what i meant by soft finance he needed this to come up with a fitting design i tried some explanations which appeared to be okay with him then three days after he forwarded to me the three options he had generated and promptly i shared the designs with six persons who i felt could assist in working with me to arrive at the best option surprisingly one of the reviewers a lady also sent a whatsapp message to me asking the same question what is soft finance why soft finance as i was preparing to offer what i considered the best explanations to her it just occurred to me that she might not be the only person interested in knowing what soft finance is i had to think deeply and ask myself the question how did i even come about soft finance it is not my coinage by the way it has been in use for years and then i remembered that everything flew from my experience when i had just been hired as a reporter by african concord magazine edited then by our very own mr bayo onanuga currently the director of the media campaign team of asiwaju bola ahmed tinubu it was a very interesting experience i cannot forget in a hurry i had studied political science at the university of ife now oau and i had gotten so involved in social activism that i saw myself becoming either an activist or a lecturer i had got fascinated with the great books we were exposed to like how europe underdeveloped africa the all the marxist books adeyinka olumide fusika now senior advocate of nigeria san was my roommate and he had succeeded in luring me to what was called alps then an association of students who believed in the marxist theory of socialism we were always meeting in the night arguing about socialism and other marxist stuff kehinde bamigbetan and seye kehinde were also comrades so i saw myself becoming an activist but a few dramatic things happened in my final year at the university that altered the direction of my academics and career to cut the story short i found myself in the journalism and starting in the proofreading department of concord newspaper the media house owned by the late flamboyant billionaire mko abiola i quickly adjusted my dream to a career in journalism a year after graduating from the nigerian institute of journalism ogba where i got the director s prize for the overall best student i was recruited by mr onanuga into the african concord then the next question was which desk i would fit into i had mentally picked the politics desk naturally but mr onanuga instead instructed that i should resume on the business desk as the correspondent there was on leave i was confused i hated anything numbers or statistics with passion right from secondary school in fact i was always at loggerheads with our mathematics teacher then one guy called sylvedra a srilankan and at the university one lecturer dr kale feyisetan that was taking a course called mathematics for social science students was everybody s enemy we hated his course compounded even by his style of teaching many were casualties of his course on a yearly basis anyway i passed it sha but here i am confronted with another ordeal i protested suggesting he should post me to their political desk he made me understand that the only place he could place me was the business desk especially since the guy covering the business desk was on leave i had to accept his offer but with a lot of trepidation i was truly scared to compound the matter the first assignment he gave me was to cover the stock market at the nigerian stock exchange when i got to the floor of the exchange the following day i was completely lost as the stockbrokers were shouting at the top of their voices offering and bidding it was one of the features of the regime they normally referred as the call over session a language that was completely strange to me it was a monday and i needed to file my report on wednesday i figured a disaster was lurking since i did not understand what took place on the exchange talkless of filling a story eventually i devised an agenda i walked up to a stockbroker by the name of dele lateef he was working with marriot securities owned by senator dele bajomo at that time i explained my dilemma to him and good enough he responded positively and he asked me to follow him to his office where he explained everything in the daily official list to me we became friends and i became a regular visitor to his office eventually i filled a story even though it was not used my editor saw potential in me and asked me to repeat my visits to the exchange he did more than that he handed me over to a guy called tunde olugboji the magazine s copy editor a dammed good guy when it comes to cleaning up copies we became friends with the encouragement i received from the editor and friendliness of the copy editor i decided to give it all it would take my first story was eventually published after about four months of amateur reporting eventually i also got another person ariyo olusekun an investment banker with the defunct center point merchant bank who actually suggested i visit his house on weekends for explanations then there was this senior colleague of mine ayo aluko olokun whose style of explaining financial terms creatively caught my attention at that point there was no going back i started to buy and read financial newspapers i also subscribed to a journal called arbitrage stock guide published by dr olasenni akintola bello a former commissioner for finance in ogun state introduced to me by his brother mr tunji bello lagos state commissioner for environment who was a great political journalist at the concord then i put everything into learning about financial terms and numbers which later won me a sponsored programme to the united states of america by the us government three years later i also won a reuters award which took me to their office in london where we were exposed to deep training for three weeks on how to simplify financial reporting shortly after i returned from the trip i joined financial standard as the founding ceo where one of the things that distinguished us was simplifying financial information and numbers joseph ode an economist was the editor and simon kolawole the publisher of the cable who was a graduate of mass communication was his deputy we worked together to ensure a culture of always asking questions that was ingrained in every reporter we recruited so that was how i came about the habit of always looking for the soft side of the hard financial stuff i was being asked to report i always asked my self how can i soften this stuff so that ordinary folks like me can understand it it became an obsession to look for the soft side of every financial information i came across back to the original question so what is soft finance i have always hated anything hard about finance we were taught in the reuters office in london always to ask questions that matter on any financial information when you ask such questions you will find answers that lurk underneath the surface for instance most times government officials push out impressive numbers to show us how they have performed you hear something like gdp grew by 10 per cent inflation moved by 10 percentage points and forex reserves increased to a certain amount what do these numbers and terms mean late akintunde asalu former president of the nigerian shareholders association was one of my great sources when it came to reporting the stock market i was always at his james robertson street in surulere lagos or his house in bolade oshodi he shared with me an interesting method for analysing companies he called it soft screening he taught me not to look much at the annual report of a company if i truly wanted to know their performance he asked me to look for soft indicators like going to the reception of the company to listen to what the staff and visitors are saying and what they write in their in house newsletters there was a time a popular ceo of a manufacturing company started to appear in major newspapers granting interviews asalu asked me to spend some days at the reception of the company and listen to what the staff were saying i got tonnes of useful information about the company which i weaved into my story ignoring the glowing report dished out by the managing director the company folded up eventually and has remained closed another md called a press conference at sheraton hotel and mesmerised reporters with great numbers a week before the event i had gone in search of my own soft indicators after all the questions had been asked and answered i raised my hands and asked to be given permission to ask a set of questions the whole hall was quiet the company had given the impression that the profit jumped by so much within a year i had read the notes to the account and sat down with asalu who gave me a hint that what made the profit jump was that the company leased part of its building to a bank that fetched handsome cash but it was not made from their normal operations by the time we did another ratio analysis we had discovered the company was indeed in deep trouble the annual general meeting agm was almost disrupted so what is soft finance literally it means we shall be softening financial information when the government rolls out budget figures we will not be moved we shall ask the question so what how does it affect my family the chop money i give to my wife monthly will it increase how will it affect my children s school fees the other time a colleague at thisday olusegun adeniyi a great columnist wrote a powerful article pointing out the red flags in the 2023 budget i made a short reply to his article and it explains the kind of things we shall be looking at regularly in this column i reproduce an abridged and updated version below first you assumed in your analysis that we have been operating budgets in nigeria a budget is meant to be an instrument of control not one single year has nigeria s budgetary system fulfilled that role it is shameful that the national assembly the executive and the budget office have continued to amuse everyone that they have been running budgets nothing of such has ever happened for the past several years if you reduce your analysis to a personal finance process at home when you budget you are simply telling yourself a few things a these are the things i want to make happen within this period of time b this is the estimated cost of making those things happen c these are the sources of income for financing such expenses and if you have financial intelligence you will also include these d of my total expenditure so much is allocated to expenditure that will bring more income into my wallet as time goes on these are other expenses that if properly executed may not necessarily generate cash but they will provide the enabling environment for making the above happen f you will also state that i have put in place a tracking system that will enable me to monitor if i am following what i have planned and if there are deviations these are the monthly and quarterly measures i will take to put me back on track g finally at the end of the year i will do a variance analysis to see how far i deviated from all the targets set in the budget and the reasons these observations will enable me to correct myself in the next budgeting exercise in all honesty can we say that our budgets for the past several years have resembled these far from this it is a tragedy that these governments have taken every single one of us on circus shows since pretending to be leading us to a definite predetermined end more fundamental is the fact that those who were supposed to provide necessary checks and intelligent reviews of the exercise have no idea of what that means so when they invite heads of parastatals to come and defend their proposal those who are intelligent among them hardly honour such invitations because they know they are mostly avenues to lubricate the wallets of those inviting them worse those in charge at the helm have muddled up the well tested strategies for controlling the levers of the economy all over the world the central bank authorities usually decide on which instrument they would use to regulate the economy interest rates or inflation rates in nigeria we have muddled up everything we are using the two together and some other very strange instruments what is the business of cbn disbursing money directly to farmers something that should be left to development banks and this politicians have also taken over the business of commercial banks by giving out loans tradermoni do they know what it takes to give out loans and what it takes to track if the granted loans are used for the purpose for which they were granted most of the money given out is gone forever my daughter s school teacher who collected one such freebie gladly announced to my wife and i sir the government has given us another money for christmas chicken and rice he was given n250k as the first tranche of the agric loan money the government official never visited his farm the guy has chopped the money that is how we have been wasting money since sometimes the cbn gives crazy and ridiculous instructions to commercial banks like asking them to give entrepreneurs low interest bearing loans as if the cbn would subsidise the cost of mobilising the funds remember peoples banks such schemes never work and this one is a very scary one we are busy focusing on the supposed loans accumulated by the federal government nobody is focusing on what is happening at the state level when you look at the exposures by the states you will weep for the country we are in deep trouble but because we only focus on the surface we have no idea of the collective damages the disasters the states and the fg are accumulating for generations of unborn nigerians i knew we were in trouble when the cbn governor came out publicly to accuse aboki fx of being responsible for the woes of the naira it is a simple arithmetic we are not producing much that would generate forex oga sege alluded as much to this in the composition of our tax system many people don t know that the external reserves figures we have been parading are gross not net when we adjust for due obligations what is left cannot finance up to three months of imports the usual globally recommended but no one is tracking that it is obvious that those who are running around campaigning to take over the reign of government have no idea of what is on the ground my assumption is that none is coming to fix anything none has the capacity to do that until something deeper happens to nigeria s current architecture the former minister of transport collected a chinese loan to start rail projects but he has left no one is asking him to account for the status of the projects which in the first place were not designed to be profitably run and given the available facts that when you compare them with similar projects by the same chinese financiers in a few other african countries there are obvious questions marks so we shall be looking at the meaning behind the numbers in this column life is tough already finance should be easy so what is soft finance soft finance can be used interchangeably with personal finance and has been defined by a finance magazine as the management of individual or family financial resources to create enough wealth to achieve the basic needs chosen lifestyle and aspirations of that individual or family this definition picked from a book does it for me breaking the term down into its components personal and financial clarifies its meaning a little more personal means that it s about you and your family it is not about the business and its revenue costs and profits it is about what comes into your household what goes out of your household what stays in your household and what is saved the goals are personal as are the means and tools to achieve them true you may watch your investments from your desk and your health insurance may actually come as a business health plan but these factors influence your personal well being not your business so get ready and let us do it together we shall be working with our team at the thisday economic and intelligence unit which is also working with a network of researchers can t wait to catch up with you next week quote and this one is a very scary one we are busy focusing on the supposed loans accumulated by the fg nobody is focusing on what is happening at the state level when you look at the exposures by the states you will weep for the country me and my money yemisi shyllon don t use all your hands to eat i have always lived by the principle don t use all your hands to eat and it has always saved me from financial stress many people make this mistake when they get a raise in the office they immediately adjust their tastes you see a worker staying in a one room apartment suddenly decides it is time to move to a highbrow area that is a display of financial foolishness remember there will be times when what you have may not be available again and you will have to rely on what you have put together when i was working i had a policy that 10 per cent of my money every month must go into investment i am talking about liquid investment and another 10 per cent would go into non liquid investment the remaining 80 per cent we used to take care of myself and my family when you spend all the money you get you have eaten both the seed and the harvest you have sown a seed of disaster into your future binocular is governor ben ayade in the wrong career if you asked for my opinion i would like to suggest that the executive governor of cross river state is probably in the wrong career i am persuaded that if he had sought appropriate guidance and counselling he might have been advised to pick a career in the drama area or better still set up a shop as a comedian he would have probably made a good outing working with ay or even joined forces with our able senator deno melaye to be producing comedy skits take a look at the nomenclature of his annual budget which someone rightly observed has been reduced to an annual comic spectacle just take a look 2016 budget of deep vision 2017 budget of infinite transposition 2018 budget of kinetic crystallization 2019 budget of qabalistic densification 2020 budget of olympotic meristematic 2021 budget of blush and blish 2022 budget of quantum infinitum i beg what questions do the state assembly people ask him during his comic budget presentation tragedy comedy

gdp final sales to private domestic purchasers refinitiv capital economics the only saving grace of the gdp report was its headline 2 6 as it turns out net exports added 2 8 percentage points and for the wrong reasons excluding net exports the domestic economy s gdp growth was 0 2 the recession continues while the country still has a large negative balance of trade it is the change that plays into the growth of gdp because of the dollar s strength the dollar value of exports rose yet despite that strong buying power imports fell lower imports tells us something about the u s consumer final sales to private domestic purchasers were flat less than 0 1 at an annual rate compared to 0 5 in q2 2 1 in q1 and 2 6 in q4 21 the chart at the top tells the real story about a weakening u s consumer the black bars note the lack of such on the right hand side services held up the best with vacations rising 6 3 appears to be due to pent up demand after two summers of covid related issues on the other hand the purchase of goods were weak with durable goods falling at a 0 8 annual rate 2 8 ar ar in q2 and non durables down 1 4 ar down three quarters in a row lest you succumb to the narrative that the positive gdp print means a recession has been avoided you should know that it isn t uncommon to have a positive real gdp quarter within a recession in 2008 s great recession the following was the sequence of the quarterly gdp prints q1 08 1 6 q2 08 2 3 q3 08 2 1 q4 08 8 7 in the dot com bubble bust q1 01 1 3 q2 01 2 5 q3 01 1 6 we find a similar pattern in the recessions of the 70s and 80s given the rest of the incoming data see below it is quite clear to us that this recession is continuing equity market index disparity on top of the news leaked by the fed on friday october 21st that they were thinking about stepping down rate hikes when the commerce department reported that q3 gdp grew at a 2 6 annual rate thursday october 27th the immediate reaction of the sell side commentators was that a recession has been avoided or there will be a soft landing the dow jones djia which had risen 750 points the day of the fed leak and continued its rise on monday 417 and tuesday 337 went on a rampage again on thursday 194 and friday 829 total points added since the last down day thursday october 20th were 2 529 an 8 3 up move in just six trading days while the russell 2000 index was up a similar 8 4 over that time span the s p 500 6 4 and nasdaq 4 6 indexes weren t as robust it is apparent from the table right hand column that the djia and russell significantly outperformed the nasdaq and s p 500 since hitting their cycle lows the reason is the weight of technology stocks the djia has a technology weight of less than 20 in contrast the nasdaq is much more technology oriented 49 the s p 500 s tech weight is 27 last week despite the general market rally several of nasdaq s and s p 500 s highly weighted tech holdings disappointed including alphabet meta and microsoft msft amazon amzn another highly weighted nasdaq stock also disappointed one must wonder how bright the immediate future can look when the country s major growth sector isn t growing the media generally reports the market results using the djia but the vast majority of investor portfolios hold a significant portion of tech stocks as a result the djia s recent performance isn t typical for investor portfolios equities peak universal value advisors housing mortgage purchase applications continue to plumet down 2 3 the week of october 21st and down 42 y y this isn t a wonder as 30 year fixed mortgage rates 7

in the u s be far behind the case shiller home price index fell 1 3 m m in august latest data on top of july s 0 7 august was the steepest one month decline since march 09 remember that housing market the federal housing finance agency s fhfa home price index fell 0 7 in august also the latest data and its three month annual rate of change is 4 8 october is at an end surely these price trends have accelerated since housing is the most interest sensitive sector we can expect similar reactions in other major sectors as the impact of rising interest rates takes its toll other data the ny fed s

new york the rapacious rise of the dollar is set to wipe more than 10bn from us corporate earnings in the third quarter analysts estimate piling pressure on companies that are already grappling with high prices and a gloomy domestic outlook the dollar s strength has been eating into us earnings all year taking its toll on makers of everything from children s toys to cigarettes the trend is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to ignore as concerns grow about its knock on impact on demand as an investor you re trying to get clarity is what i m looking at a translation problem or a demand problem said jack caffrey a portfolio manager at jpmorgan asset management the translation problem refers to the way a stronger dollar reduces the relative value of sales made in foreign currencies when they are converted back into dollars for quarterly financial reports measured against a group of other developed market currencies the dollar rose 17 per cent in the first three quarters reaching its strongest level in more than 20 years jonathan golub head of us equity strategy at credit suisse estimates that for each 8 to 10 percentage point rise in the dollar index these translation effects knock 1 percentage point from earnings per share across the s p 500 with estimated earnings of 480bn before earnings season kicked off this year s move would cut third quarter profits by around 10bn some investors estimate the translation effects could be even higher michael walker portfolio manager at alliancebernstein suggested this year s move could wipe around 3 per cent from profits across the index for the year many investors are willing to look through such effects if they are confident in the underlying strength of a business when microsoft slashed its revenue forecasts by around 500mn earlier this year for example its stock recovered from a brief blip to close the day in positive territory more concerning however is the potential for demand to fall as rivals that produce and sell in weaker currencies now look cheaper it s not something people have talked about enough over the last several years so there may be an unfortunate period of time where have to recalibrate what information comes through added caffrey alliancebernstein s walker contrasted microsoft with its megacap rival amazon although both are based in california microsoft sets prices for its azure cloud service in local currencies while rival amazon web services prices in dollars with currencies deviating this much it would seem to me a big competitive advantage for microsoft which is taking a big translational hit but is choosing not to raise their prices whereas amazon is effectively raising prices for their customers moreover one key reason for the dollar s recent strength is the brighter economic outlook in the us compared with many other countries meaning demand may fall even without additional competition when levi strauss reported second quarter earnings in june the company took a translational hit from the strong dollar but stressed that it still had strong momentum in europe by the time it reported third quarter results and another foreign exchange hit earlier this month however chief executive charles bergh said its european wholesale customers were being cautious and predicted further weakness as the winter begins to hit goldman sachs index of companies that generate the majority of their revenues in the us fell by 15 per cent in the first three quarters compared with a 30 5 per cent decline in its index of companies with a large international presence over the same period besides a slightly less bleak economic outlook in the us the dollar s strength has been encouraged by rapidly rising us interest rates while the dollar has fallen from its highs in late september as investors have bet on a slowdown in the fed s interest rate increases a meaningful weakening of the dollar is unlikely until the fed actually begins cutting rates the central bank has signalled it is not prepared to do so until inflation reaches its 2 per cent target

aolescent and young adult medicine at mgh dr hadland thanks so much for being here thank you for having me we know that massachusetts general was seeing up to cases 80 of rsv a day this past weekend how are things right now were very busy it s not just our emergency clinics it s our icus and outpatient clinics as well we are here to help everybody erika we ve all seen how quickly viruses can spread in school and daycare settings how should parents be approaching this what should they be watching for a lot of the tools we know that work right now we know them from a couple of years of living with covid when kids are sick we want to keep them home so that they don t do school and spread germs it s also important to continue testing for covid and communicating with schools and daycare s and let them know if your child is sick in terms of rsv specifically most kids will just have common cold sometimes runny nose some cough the younger kids children under two are at particular risk for the infection to get into their lower airways and cause more specific problems ben this is a big weekend for kids a lot of anticipation for trick or treating how do you keep kids happy and full of trick or treat candy i would never stand in the way of kids enjoying halloween i will be taking my two kids out with my husband and doing treating ourselves something that i do with my family and recommend other viewers do as well it s going to be a nice night does it look like it s going to rain it looks like the temperature will be relatively warm it s a good time to be outdoors reduce the time you are spending indoors when we know that spreading germs is higher inside maybe number limit the number of families and kids we get together with sticking to close folks and being safe as we do it advertisement some forms of popular antibiotic amoxicillin in short supply likely due to increased demand share copy link copy amoxicillin a common antibiotic used to treat a broad range of conditions is in short supply according to the u s food and drug administration the agency lists amoxicillin oral solution in its drug shortage database which relies on reports from manufacturers the oral solution is an anti infective used with pediatric patients the fda told cnn on friday that it was aware of some intermittent supply interruptions in the u s and is working with manufacturers to evaluate the supply chain to help prevent or reduce the effects of drug shortages the american society of health system pharmacists which gets reports about drug shortages from health care practitioners patients and caregivers said friday that it started hearing about a shortage of amoxicillin tablets and oral solution in some areas about three weeks ago erin fox whose team creates the content for the group s drug shortage website said it is getting reports that the antibiotic may be available in some areas but not in some of the more commonly prescribed strengths i think it s going to be challenging for doctors and prescribers to give their patients a prescription that they ll then be able to get filled because pharmacies are going to have a variety of different strengths in stock and you hate to have that delay of the back and forth especially for an antibiotic they usually want to get started pretty quick so i think it s going to be a frustrating shortage said fox a senior pharmacy director at university of utah health government databases in ireland australia malaysia and romania also reported a lack of availability of the drug due to some manufacturing issues and unexpected demand drugmakers aurobindo rising sandoz teva and u s antibiotics did not respond to requests for comment some companies say there has been little demand for the drug during the pandemic when covid 19 mitigation measures also lowered rates of other infections companies make the antibiotic when there is a demand for it but they need time to catch up when demand increases a spokesperson for hikma said that the company is delivering to its customers in full and has adequate supplies to meet its commitments our number one priority is to honor the commitments we have to our current customers and allocation allows us to achieve this said steve weiss hikma s head of communications and corporate affairs we understand the importance of this medication and are looking at ways to increase production in the u s the amoxicillin shortage does not seem to follow the usual pattern according to michael ganio the american society of health system pharmacists senior director for pharmacy practice and quality generally what we see in the drug shortages is on the production side in this case we don t have any indication from the manufacturers that they re having any sort of difficulty with production he said this one seems to be driven by demand which is a little unusual we see increased demand as a cause of a shortage fairly infrequently the u s is struggling with an early surge in rsv cases and although doctors would not use amoxicillin to treat the viral infection some children can develop secondary bacterial infections that may require antibiotics it s also possible that if a doctor can t narrow down the cause of an infection they may opt to prescribe an antibiotic it seems like that may be what s happening right now ganio said with a shortage driven by demand it is possible that one pharmacy will have the drug in stock while others won t walgreens told cnn it was not experiencing any shortages cvs and walmart did not respond to requests for comment fox suggests that someone who gets a prescription for amoxicillin check with the pharmacy first to see if they have the drug in stock at the strength that was prescribed the health care provider could also write a prescription for a couple of options amoxicillin clavulante and cefuroxime are also suitable alternatives particularly for pediatric bacterial infections my first advice would be don t panic fox said there is still some amoxicillin it just might need a quick change of prescription
first published at spectre on october 5 as catastrophic floods in pakistan and drought in europe and china highlight the ecological crisis of fossil capital a debate between matt huber and kai heron in new left review s sidecar raises important issues for anyone concerned with understanding and responding politically to our times this exchange draws attention to questions on which there are significant disagreements between what one could call the ecomodernist and less satisfactorily third worldist degrowth or degrowth adjacent strands of ecological marxism although these two perspectives are the most prominent in recent english language discussions their limitations call for the further development of a different approach the issues at stake are not relevant only to intellectuals with a particular interest in ecological questions everyone concerned with human well being must recognize that the late holocene conditions of relative ecological stability within which the capitalist mode of production emerged and spread no longer exist the worsening ecological crisis of our current historical period within the anthropocene will make growing nonlinear ecological instability an increasingly important aspect of the totality of the interlocking matrix of social relations there has been a permanent foundational shift in how human society and economy can operate in the future with wide ranging effects on capital accumulation politics and other aspects of society what then are the issues raised by the huber heron exchange and why do they matter capitalism s productive forces huber clearly argues against anti capitalist degrowth ideas that we do need to develop the productive forces but ecologically a socialist eco modernism should make the transformation of production and the productive forces the fulcrum of any new relation to the planet because capitalism fetters the technological pathways to halting environmental breakdown solving climate change requires new social relations of production that would develop the productive forces toward clean production heron rightly responds that technologies do not exist outside of the social relations within which they are developed and that instead of seeing capital s abolition as the unfettering of productive forces it is better to view it as freeing the world s producers to choose from a richer and more diverse array of technologies and socio ecological relations than capitalist industrialization can offer it is about adopting appropriate technologies and collectively managing energy and food systems at relevant scales ecomodernist socialism perpetuates a longstanding idea within the marxist tradition that the productive forces themselves are neutral the problem is the social relations that hinder their deployment for progressive ends this also tends to involve a narrow conception of what productive forces are as just technology and not also forms of social cooperation and to see them as wholly distinct from the relations of production however if we follow marx in understanding the productive forces as the productive powers of human labour then when thinking about these as they exist today we must recognize them as the productive powers of alienated human labour as developed by capital this is not just a matter of the purposes to which they are put but also about which technologies and forms of cooperation are developed and in what ways for example precision agriculture a new paradigm of capital intensive industrial agriculture that integrates digital technologies to improve crop yields and manage populations and the mass manufacture of digital devices that are difficult or impossible to repair both reflect specifically capitalist imperatives in this way ecomodernist socialism brings to mind raya dunayevskaya s observation about the marxism of second international figures like kautsky and hilferding there is no longer any sense of breaking the chains of the ubiquitous capitalist machine nor of the total reorganization of the relations of men at the point of production by the men themselves any hint of the critique of technology fetishism also found within the marxist tradition is altogether absent the very embrace of the ecomodernist label by a marxist is itself remarkable given that ecomodernism is so clearly a case of bourgeois ideology how we think about forces of production matters today and will become even more important as ruling class responses to climate change come to rely on technological fixes including ones like solar radiation management and nuclear fusion that exist barely or not at all the approach taken by heron is considerably more fruitful for addressing the many questions related to the ecological crisis that involve capitalism s productive forces imperialism in climate change as class war huber frames the climate justice struggle as a global class struggle between capital and an international working class and not a struggle between global north and global south heron contends that this approach posits a false choice between anti imperialist and class struggle politics more broadly heron charges ecomodernist marxism with inattention to imperialism including its ecological dimensions for example huber ignores the question of ecologically unequal exchange which andreas malm defines as transactions that might seem fair on the monetary surface but allow rich countries to absorb biophysical resources from the poor and drain their natural endowments as in how the american appetite for hamburger is satisfied from pastures carved out of the amazon this charge is generally persuasive both at the analytical and political levels unfortunately there are also serious problems in heron s anti imperialism as in those of the third worldist strand of ecological marxism more broadly while rejecting the idea that the working class in imperialist countries is not exploited heron endorses theories of imperialism whose handling of unequal exchange and super exploitation is vulnerable to critique heron s contention that workers in the core benefit from a capitalist system that pits them against their peripheral counterparts is partially true but inadequate access to imported beef coffee and other products of ecologically unequal exchange is a reality but higher profits derived from the operations of imperialism or anything else never automatically trickle down into higher wages the balance of class power is crucial in determining wage levels for decades this balance has been tilting further away from labour on a global scale as capitalist competition in a world economy organized in part by imperialist relations has intensified the dispossession of more peasants and other independent producers the elimination of many relatively better jobs in both the private and public sectors and the weakening of welfare state programs as military spending grows have all increased competition among people seeking work for wages war oppression and ecological crisis all of which are fuelled by imperialism have also swelled the ranks of people desperate for paid work whether in the south or through migration in the north at the same time policy changes and technological development have also reduced barriers to capitalists moving the production of many goods and some services from imperialist to imperialized countries people in imperialist states are encouraged to identify with their imperialism binding workers to their rulers and exploiters thus in various ways the working class in imperialist countries loses more than it benefits from imperialism how ecosocialists understand imperialism has clear political consequences for how they approach movement organizing their stance to states in the imperialist chain that descends from the us to the uk germany france and china to lesser imperialist powers including canada and russia and their orientation to imperialized states heron is right to call for a politics that can do the difficult work of developing strategies of struggle and ecological transition that meet the needs of the exploited and oppressed in the global north in ways that are compatible with demands for colonial reparations technology transfers food sovereignty land back the lifting of sanctions the end of occupations and the atmospheric space to develop freely and independently yet ecological marxism must also avoid the pitfalls of the enemy of my enemy is my friend politics to which third worldism often succumbs ecological limits huber s critique of utopianism in today s anti capitalist ecological thought is important but entirely fails to reckon with a scientific truth that heron puts plainly the global north s energy and resource use cannot be extended to the rest of the world without exceeding the planet s biophysical limits climate change as class war generally ignores the question of how a just and rapid global transition from fossil fuels and other sources of greenhouse gas emissions could be carried out this would have to entail imperialized countries using more energy to meet people s needs as they simultaneously decarbonized and consequently a reduction in energy demand within advanced capitalist countries for marxists to take ecology as seriously as the crisis demands we must grapple with the findings of earth system science and think through the implications for immediate climate justice demands and for our global vision of ecosocialism materialists ought not to ignore the biophysical limits often theorized as planetary boundaries which as ian angus helpfully puts it can be compared to guard rails on mountain roads which are positioned to prevent drivers from reaching the edge not on the edge itself at stake here is nothing less than how well marxist analyses of ecological crisis and political responses to it measure up to scientific knowledge of that crisis no matter how unsettling some of its implications may be for some people in the advanced capitalist countries strategy ecological marxism cannot stop at analyzing the unfolding catastrophe it must also guide efforts to work towards a transition to ecosocialism as i hinted above a great strength of huber s approach is its argument for a class struggle strategy for ecosocialism based on analysis of the concrete class relationships that both inhibit transformations or might bring them about as an alternative to utopian leaps into abstraction when it comes to how transformation could be achieved his insistence that we need a climate politics that aims outward beyond the already converted towards the exploited and atomized working class is vitally important although heron agrees in general while criticizing huber s false choice between working class politics and anti imperialism the third worldist strand of ecological marxism has yet to produce a grounded political strategy like the one that huber proposes for people in the us in climate change as class war in that book huber argues for working class struggle for a green new deal gnd a politics of more that explains how much we have to gain from a climate program he sees this in terms of a mass working class electoral coalition to win state power backed up by the disruptive power of strike action he then makes a case for a much narrower strategy rank and file workplace organizing among electrical power workers in order to fight for public ownership of the sector class struggle for a gnd is at a general level a compelling orientation the content of such a package is important to specify though a radical gnd in a country like the us needs to include along with the usual gnd reforms measures to assist imperialized countries with their own just transitions and to cut domestic energy demand reforms that reflect a decommodifying internationalist climate justice politics of better rather than more of public luxury and private sufficiency the strategy of electing a socialist government within the existing state that with the backing of workers direct action will implement radical reforms as a road to socialism is unrealistic we should know by now that capitalist state power cannot be so easily taken over and wielded against capitalism and that the working class cannot rule through its alienated bureaucratic institutions further in response to huber s case for focussing organizing efforts in the electrical power sector jonathan rosenblum rightly argues a working class based climate movement doesn t have the luxury of time to focus in just one place one important theoretical task is analyzing the global working class in relation to global capital as heron recognizes the class really is deeply divided and hierarchically stratified as a consequence of capitalist development and various forms of oppression yet the working class also has common interests that are contrary to heron an objective reality because of how people are located within capitalist social relations these provide a material basis for the convergence of struggles and the forging of solidarity between people whose conditions are in some ways quite different so oriented ecological marxist theory can guide the practice of mass movement climate justice politics in both paid workplace and community organizing in addition to digging in where people work and live its supporters need to be ready to intervene constructively in unexpected upsurges of protest and resistance like the yellow vests movement in france in 2018 19 and the uprising against racism in the us in 2020 even if ecological concerns are not what is putting people into motion ecological marxists risk irrelevance if they cannot respond to and become part of social eruptions in ways that allow them to build political relationships and help people to make connections and bring out the ecological dimensions of struggles against injustice what would ecosocialism be although it does not surface directly in the heron huber exchange the character of the society that ought to replace capitalism is also a central question for ecological marxism today here ecomodernists and third worldists have more in common than they may realize huber sees china today as not fully capitalist because of its state owned enterprises and heron seems to think that at least under mao china was socialist the common ground between marxists in the traditions of karl kautsky and mao zedong is the belief that state ownership of the means of production makes a society non capitalist even when the state is not made up of new radically democratic institutions of self government through which the working class runs society the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor hailed by marx in the paris commune and dubbed a semi state by lenin in state and revolution breaking with capitalism and beginning a transition to ecosocialism is not a short term prospect anywhere in the world today but this does not mean that the character of ecosocialism or what would be required to begin to reconstruct society in its direction are irrelevant matters they shape what we can call following daniel bensaid a regulatory horizon that through many mediations ought to inform theory and action today ecological marxists in the tradition of rosa luxemburg and william morris insist that the prerequisite for initiating this revolutionary transition would be a self emancipatory rupture that establishes the democratic rule of the direct producers themselves not the taking of state power by a party acting on their behalf of course the dire state of the world ought to encourage collaboration among adherents of all strands of ecological marxism wherever possible areas of agreement deserve to be recognized and disagreements kept in proportion yet we cannot afford to ignore what can be learned from the historical experiences of social democracy and stalinism in the twentieth century especially as we confront the horrors of the twenty first david camfield

menafn afp first elon musk revolutionized the automobile industry then he tackled space travel by taking control of twitter the eccentric billionaire now wields a nearly untold level of influence in using his fortune to grab hold of such an important platform experts say he has even inserted himself squarely in today s global political conversation he is not just expressing views on an instrument of communication he now owns it and sets the policy of how that instrument will be used jeffrey winters a specialist in elites and oligarchs at northwestern university told afp the question now is what he will do with that power starting with the topic on everyone s mind whether or not musk will allow former us president donald trump to return to the site without anyone to answer to musk is going to change the constellation of political voices that are going to be expressed through twitter winters said according to the professor musk represents a typical oligarch a person whose fortune lends them social and political power not available to an average citizen though musk does not have any governments or militaries under his control oracle in the business world musk s bona fides as an innovator are well established he goes into directions that people just never go in and he creates brand new products that proved to be highly effective and successful said nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research musk did not invent the electric car but with tesla he showed it was possible in a big scalable way colas explained with spacex musk introduced internet satellites and reusable rockets technologies that were something that s been promised but never really delivered until he came along colas added for colas musk can in some ways be compared with inventors as prolific as thomas edison or iconic apple founder steve jobs he has proven at least that he knows how to make money tesla is by far the highest valued car company on the stock market and spacex is worth more than 125 billion so when the richest man in the world gives his two cents on a business matter such as his opinion on a company or on cryptocurrency like an oracle his fans listen he can shake up the markets with just a few words in 2021 when musk edited his twitter bio to simply say bitcoin the price of the virtual currency temporarily soared 20 percent he could have stuck to his role as a businessman and adopted a low profile according to winters that s what most rich people do fearing hostile reactions to their wealth they employ lawyers and lobbyists to discreetly protect their interests sometimes financing political campaigns but elon musk is unafraid to be very rich and very visible winters said red line the creation of tesla as an iconic brand brought him to people s attention and great wealth said arizona state university communication and marketing specialist mark hass then he just was willing to put himself out there continually on social media on issues that other ceos would never publicly engage with the way he did he added he s not afraid to say what is on his mind regardless of who he insults regardless of which regulator he angers said hass when musk took to twitter to propose a peace deal between kyiv and moscow he probably viewed himself as just giving his opinion like anyone else winters said when you control the satellites that are important for ukrainians ability to communicate your opinion has massive ripple effects he explained but in washington musk still has less influence than other financial heavy hitters such as jp morgan s jamie dimon or goldman sachs david solomon who control the banking system colas said in buying twitter largely with his own money but also with significant backing from investors who expect a return on their own risk musk has taken on a huge potential liability he can t just flip a switch and make an anarchy there at twitter because every big advertiser will back away colas cautioned he likes to push things to the edge hass said and so far he s never self destructed but in controlling twitter musk has a more direct line to the public than ever before and i don t know where his red line is hass added

spread in school and daycare settings how should parents be approaching this what should they be watching for a lot of the tools we know that work right now we know them from a couple of years of living with covid when kids are sick we want to keep them home so that they don t do school and spread germs it s also important to continue testing for covid and communicating with schools and daycare s and let them know if your child is sick in terms of rsv specifically most kids will just have common cold sometimes runny nose some cough the younger kids children under two are at particular risk for the infection to get into their lower airways and cause more specific problems ben this is a big weekend for kids a lot of anticipation for trick or treating how do you keep kids happy and full of trick or treat candy i would never stand in the way of kids enjoying halloween i will be taking my two kids out with my husband and doing treating ourselves something that i do with my family and recommend other viewers do as well it s going to be a nice night does it look like it s going to rain it looks like the temperature will be relatively warm it s a good time to be

being safe as we do it advertisement some forms of popular antibiotic amoxicillin in short supply likely due to increased demand share copy link copy amoxicillin a common antibiotic used to treat a broad range of conditions is in short supply according to the u s food and drug administration the agency lists amoxicillin oral solution in its drug shortage database which relies on reports from manufacturers the oral solution is an anti infective used with pediatric patients the fda told cnn on friday that it was aware of some intermittent supply interruptions in the u s and is working with manufacturers to evaluate the supply chain to help prevent or reduce the effects of drug shortages the american society of health system pharmacists which gets reports about drug shortages from health care practitioners patients and caregivers said friday that it started hearing about a shortage of amoxicillin tablets and oral solution in some areas about three weeks ago erin fox whose team creates the content for the group s drug shortage website said it is getting reports that the antibiotic may be available in some areas but not in some of the more commonly prescribed strengths i think it s going to be challenging for doctors and prescribers to give their patients a prescription that they ll then be able to get filled because pharmacies are going to have a variety of different strengths in stock and you hate to have that delay of the back and forth especially for an antibiotic they usually want to get started pretty quick so i think it s going to be a frustrating shortage said fox a senior pharmacy director at university of utah health government databases in ireland australia malaysia and romania also reported a lack of availability of the drug due to some manufacturing issues and unexpected demand drugmakers aurobindo rising sandoz teva and u s antibiotics did not respond to requests for comment some companies say there has been little demand for the drug during the pandemic when covid 19 mitigation measures also lowered rates of other infections companies make the antibiotic when there is a demand for it but they need time to catch up when demand increases a spokesperson for hikma said that the company is delivering to its customers in full and has adequate supplies to meet its commitments our number one priority is to honor the commitments we have to our current customers and allocation allows us to achieve this said steve weiss hikma s head of communications and corporate affairs we understand the importance of this medication and are looking at ways to increase production in the u s the amoxicillin shortage does not seem to follow the usual pattern according to michael ganio the american society of health system pharmacists senior director for pharmacy practice and quality generally what we see in the drug shortages is on the production side in this case we don t have any indication from the manufacturers that they re having any sort of difficulty with production he said this one seems to be driven by demand which is a little unusual we see increased demand as a cause of a shortage fairly infrequently the u s is struggling with an early surge in rsv cases and although doctors would not use amoxicillin to treat the viral infection some children can develop secondary bacterial infections that may require antibiotics it s also possible that if a doctor can t narrow down the cause of an infection they may opt to prescribe an antibiotic it seems like that may be what s happening right now ganio said with a shortage driven by demand it is possible that one pharmacy will have the drug in stock while others won t walgreens told cnn it was not experiencing any shortages cvs and walmart did not respond to requests for comment fox suggests that someone who gets a prescription for amoxicillin check with the pharmacy first to see if they have the drug in stock at the strength that was prescribed the health care provider could also write a prescription for a couple of options amoxicillin clavulante and cefuroxime are also suitable alternatives particularly for pediatric bacterial infections my first advice would be don t panic fox said there is still some amoxicillin it just might need a quick change of prescription
britain s politico economic fiasco of the past six weeks culminated in a tragicomic anticlimax the 45 day prime minister liz truss resigned as many had predicted before she even took high office last month rishi sunak the incumbent prime minister britain s third in two months had vociferously criticized truss flamboyant yet idiotic fiscal plan during the summer run up campaign to replace boris johnson in hindsight while she successfully managed to woo the ultra right tories with her anti immigrant and pro brexit rhetoric her inane economic policies failed to enchant the financial markets and in mere weeks as great britain nudged normalcy after grieving its longest reigning monarch truss ill timed tax cuts and brazen borrowing plans wreaked havoc the british pound tanked to record low mortgage rates shot to stratospheric levels forcing the bank of england boe to intercede to soothe the markets and safeguard the vulnerable pension funds from collapse admittedly the united states is witnessing relative political stability at least compared to the trump tenure the american economy is heading toward a recession piecemeal however the federal reserve shows no sign of panic or loss of control and the investors are patently not losing confidence in the us government unlike the jitters on display across the atlantic nonetheless there are a few concerning parallels between the western duo to recap and analyze in depth we should first ask ourselves why did the british economic plan backfire it is a well known fact that britain is one of the most pivotal western industrialized economies 6th largest in the world yet an inflationary mini budget still earned it a rare public rebuke from the international monetary fund imf over fiscal imprudence such remarks are usually reserved for emerging economies with a notoriety for fiscal irresponsibility it was not because of the 45 billion in unfunded tax cuts britain s biggest tax package in over five decades but it was a reaction to the contradiction sketched by the truss regime between britain s conservative monetary policy and quasi liberal fiscal strategies the imf unerringly realized that this tussle would only exacerbate the economic uncertainty already looming in the aftermath of the russian invasion of ukraine in a period when the western world alongside the bank of england boe tightened policy to wrestle with energy fueled inflation the british government tabled a plan sans any independent assessment of potential fiscal impact to borrow funds to finance utopian tax cuts and eliminate limits on bankers bonuses in a span when the working class witnessed ballooning energy bills the truss government planned to kickstart economic growth via primitive trickle down economics without any substantive agenda to invite foreign investments naturally the financial markets revolted by dumping uk debt causing interest rates to spiral mortgages to skyrocket pound to drop to almost parity with the us dollar the new chancellor of the exchequer immediately reversed most of her policies before she even egressed the office while forewarning of painful spending cuts to come still the markets shadowed the announcement of the uk s next prime minister with an ambiguous reaction as sterling slipped 0 17 against the greenback erasing the earlier gains while bonds rallied to pre budget levels thankfully the united states is not even remotely in the same shoes but political uncertainty is brewing in the us congress as well the biden administration has somewhat restored the lost stability totemic to the american political scene the make america great again maga tendencies have receded if not completely effaced and the united states is seemingly back to its classical balance of diplomacy and deterrence that was noticeably missing since 2017 yet not all is sunshine in the domestic and international dynamics the democrats welcomed this year with a thin majority in both houses their mid term election prospects gradually improved with collective success in europe against russia the republican blunders like the reversal of roe v wade further favored biden s case however the short sightedness of the group of seven s g7 ambitious price cap on russian energy supplies and china s force posturing in the indo pacific region disillusioned the american patriots iran s bold collusion with russia by allegedly supplying military drones in ukraine has further weakened the american illusion of power the recent slap in the face has been the saudi betrayal leading opec to cut global oil supply by 2 million barrels day even after biden bumped fists with crown prince mohammad bin salman mbs during his domestically criticized visit to saudi arabia in july as the gasoline prices have picked up in the last few weeks and inflation is increasingly proving obdurate the democrats could lose both houses or at least the senate which could plausibly trigger a britain like bedlam the trigger point is somewhat apparent the contentious us debt ceiling according to the imf estimates the us and the uk are two of the most highly industrialized economies running huge deficits in both their budgets and current accounts according to data from the imf s world economic outlook weo database britain s current account deficit this year would be about 4 8 of its gross domestic product gdp 3 9 for the united states both nations have borrowed over 4 of their respective gdps to fund these gaps such huge deficits imply a continual need for capital inflow now i admit that advanced economies like japan and france also run huge government deficits but no member of the g7 has a deficit on their current account quite like that of britain and the us register and while i unequivocally agree that the us treasuries are currently running in the opposite trajectory of uk gilts a crisis could ensnare the american economy if the republicans gain control of either of the houses of congress and enforces a debt limit on government borrowing while theoretically it could push the us government to default on its debt and plunge the global economy into chaos the more likely outcome is a compromise in the form of spending cuts a repeat of obama s begrudging submission to republican pressure in 2013 in hopes of a long term deficit reduction deal nonetheless this impending political browbeating could spook the already febrile bond markets courtesy of the aggressive tightening schedule of the federal reserve remember investors doubt in the british government s fiscal plan caused the current market meltdown not any actual sign of imminent default it illustrates that in the sensitive market environment today all it takes is market skepticism that gradually snowballs into a formidable economic nightmare even for an advanced economy another risk is the bustling value of the us dollar this year alone the greenback has gained more than 18 against a basket of key currencies according to the benchmark ice u s dollar index the fed s accelerating rate hikes have pushed the dollar to a multi decade high even against the currencies of its major trading partners consequently american exports have turned expensive imports have turned cheaper thus us exports are in line to fall while imports gain further widening the current account deficit i fear that a sell off in the us treasury market could invoke a financial crisis dwarfing the great recession of 2008 fortunately us securities are a staple for risk averse investors seeking an economic haven and virtually every major global transaction from the oil market to commodities is settled in the us dollar thus i reckon that the us markets are far more stable than their british counterparts ultimately the ubiquity of the us economic presence does pose some challenges the economic pain exported globally by the united states due to a straightening dollar could lead to financial turmoil in one of its major trading partners japan is a perfect example the rate hikes by the federal reserve have plummeted the japanese yen to a 32 year low against the us dollar yet the bank of japan boj is persistent in keeping interest rates low to allow its historically moribund inflation to liven up my apprehension however lies in the perception of inflation japan s inflation of 3 is not demand driven but imported from abroad on the back of inflated fuel and food prices recent history suggests that japan would not resort to rate hikes which would pinch local businesses and dent public sentiment without actually lowering inflation however japan could stop buying or even partly liquidate its immense holdings of us treasury securities totaling about 1 23 trillion to service its staggering debt circa 260 of its gdp without cutting public spending this scenario is just one example of many that could spark a crisis the frightening reality is that unlike the contained financial debacle of britain a panic run in the us capital markets would devastate the global economy and hence britain s fiscal blunder should be an omen to the us policymakers to address its chronic budget and current account deficits and mitigate its prohibitive borrowing sprees before it is too late to redress

in this article we will be taking a look at the 10 largest gas station chains in the us to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 largest gas station chains in the us gas stations in the united states are a major industry in and of themselves and integral to the revenue and profits of the major oil and gas companies running them according to ibis world the united states gas station industry is worth more than 138 billion providing employment to hundreds of thousands of people across the country the lonely gas station in an otherwise abandoned area has provided the backdrop to many movies and is an iconic image in and of itself unlike most european countries the united states is absolutely huge many states alone are bigger than some european countries which is why while public transport is a very efficient means of travel in the european regions it is not as easily implementable in the united states further while european cities are often built and amended to facilitate its citizens and allow for better public transport cycling routes and pedestrian areas u s cities thanks to lobbying by major automakers in the country are built to accommodate roads and cars which is why cars are in huge demand in the country additionally while most european governments are emphasizing on using alternative fuel to power automobiles in addition to reducing the number of cars diesel is still king in the united states and while alternative fuels are being implemented the pace is slow and not making a significant impact in the near future all of this shows why gas stations are so integral to the united states and why they are an entire industry in fact such is the importance of gas prices in the country that the outlook of americans on their country rises and fall in accordance with the rise and fall in gas prices if gas prices go up there is greater fear that the country is on an uncertain path with vice versa holding true too 2022 has been an uncertain year for the biggest superpower in the world and economic uncertainty has increased with inflation rising to near record levels and the threat of a recession looming over every decision the country makes gas prices have been notoriously high as well with one of the main reasons being the russian invasion of ukraine which has led to sanctions against one of the world s biggest oil and gas producer leading to gas prices rising across the world the united states was no exception with the national average price of gas in the country crossing 5 per gallon in june before decreasing in subsequent months and leveling off since most people do not have an alternative to cars because of scant public transport they have no choice but to allow gas prices to take up a bigger chunk of their total savings while in the case of other products having their prices increased people can opt for cheaper substitutes or just reduce their spending on that specific product this is not true for gas as there aren t really any alternatives to driving the psychological impacts of gas prices increasing are numerous as well an economist with the philadelphia fed learned that people who were teenagers during the gas price shocks in the 1970s drove less even 20 years later as this is the first major product spend for most teenagers and if the cost is significantly high they may be more averse to spending on it even if their level of disposable income increases there is another reason to be wary of gas prices in the future opec recently announced that they re going to be decreasing output by 2 million barrels a day this was despite talks between saudi arabia and the united states continuing to ensure that oil supply was adequate so as to not increase price and despite the latter being hopeful of an increase in output opec contravened the wishes of the united states and decreased output which can have additional ramifications as the united states considers sanctions against saudia arabia according to the u s energy information administration there is a potential of disruptions in the petroleum supply chain and the slower than expected oil production growth could lead to increasing oil prices in winter when demand is higher however a slower than expected economic growth rate could lead to a decrease in oil prices u s production meanwhile is expected to be around 11 7 million barrels per day and 12 4 million barrels per day in 2023 which will easily beat the record highs set in 2019 before the pandemic wreaked havoc globally further the expected gas price in the u s is 3 8 per gallon in q4 of 2022 and 3 57 in 2023 well below the frightening high of over 5 per gallon in june 2022 despite the dependence on gas the expected gasoline consumption in the united states is expected to decline in 2022 as compared to 2021 with consumption being 8 8 million barrels per day 40 000 barrels per day less than as compared to 2021 and expected to remain at similar levels throughout 2023 the main reason behind declining consumption is increasing fuel efficiency which has more than offset the increase in prices and rising demand the biggest gas station chains in the u s are operated by some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world each maintaining thousands of locations across the country together the 10 biggest gas stations in the country operate more than 50 000 gas stations with a presence in most states and thousands of cities most of these gas stations will be familiar to you and odds are you ve likely used one or more of these gas stations in your travels our rankings are based on both the number of gas stations each company operates along with the number of cities it operates in with 70 weightage being assigned to the former

over the past few years i have lost count as to how many republicans conservatives independents and libertarians have told me that they have learned the art of self censorship when it comes to discussing or even hinting at their political or faith based views they went into self censorship mode as a self preservation response to the woke cancel culture vigilantism many believe has swept into the corners of academia corporate america and the mainstream media as many now believe that identity politics and the search for any micro aggression or misappropriation rule the day in these powerful left leaning institutions they have decided that discretion

shuttle service she had a good credit rating and enough cash for a down payment yet dealerships in the detroit area didn t have any suitable vehicles or they d demand she pay 3 000 to 6 000 above the sticker price months of frustration left her despondent i was depressed hudson said i was angry too a breakthrough arrived in late september when a dealer called about a 2022 chrysler pacifica at 41 000 it was hardly a bargain and it wasn t quite what hudson wanted yet the dealer was asking only slightly above sticker price and hudson felt in no position to walk away she s back in business with her own van it could have been worse hudson made her purchase just as the prices of both new and used vehicles have been inching down from their eye watering record highs and more vehicles are gradually becoming available at dealerships hudson s van likely would have cost even more a few months ago not that anyone should expect prices to fall anywhere near where they were before the pandemic recession struck in early 2020 the swift recovery from the recession left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand price skyrocketed and they ve scarcely budged since prices on new and used vehicles remain 30 to 50 above where they were when the pandemic erupted the average used auto cost nearly 31 000 last month the average new 47 000 with higher prices and loan rates combining to push average monthly payments on a new vehicle above 700 millions of buyers have been priced out of the new vehicle market and are now confined to used vehicles the high prices are yielding substantial profits for most automakers despite sluggish sales on tuesday for example general motors reported that its third quarter net profit jumped more than 36 thanks in part to sales of pricey pickup trucks and large suvs still as hudson discovered many vehicles are becoming slightly more affordable signs first emerged weeks ago in the 40 million sales a year used market as demand waned and inventories rose prices eased from their springtime heights carmax said it sold nearly 15 000 fewer vehicles last quarter than it had a year earlier the ceo of the used vehicle company based in richmond virginia pointed to inflation higher borrowing rates and diminished consumer confidence new cars are delivered to a dealer in pittsburgh on sept 29 the prices of new and used vehicles in the united states have begun inching down from their eye watering record highs as more vehicles have become gradually available at dealerships photo gene j puskar associated press a buyer s strike is how adam jonas an auto analyst at morgan stanley characterized the sales drops a dynamic that typically foretells lower prices and indeed the average used vehicle price in september was down 1 from its may peak according to edmunds com at autonation the nation s largest dealership chain sales of used vehicles and profit per vehicle both dropped last quarter ceo mike manley noted that while the supply of vehicles remains low used auto prices are declining our analysis shows that we are coming off the high values that we saw before manley told analysts thursday ivan drury director of insights at edmunds cautioned that it will take years for used prices to fall close to their pre pandemic levels since 2020 automakers haven t been leasing as many cars thereby choking off one key source of late model used vehicles similarly rental companies haven t been able to buy many new vehicles so eventually they are selling fewer autos into the used market that s crimped another source of vehicles and because used cars aren t sitting long on dealer lots demand remains strong enough to prop up prices when auto prices first soared two years ago lower income buyers were elbowed out of the new vehicle market eventually many of them couldn t afford even used autos people with subprime credit scores 620 or below bought only 5 of new vehicles last month down from nearly 9 before the pandemic that indicated that many lower income households could no longer afford vehicles said j d power vice president tyson jominy higher borrowing rates have compounded the problem in january 2020 shortly before the pandemic hit used vehicle buyers paid an average of 8 4 annual interest according to edmunds monthly payments averaged 412 by last month the average rate had reached 9 2 and because prices had risen for over two years the average payment had jumped to 567 the 1 average drop in used prices will help financially secure buyers with solid credit scores who can qualify for lower loan rates but for those with poor credit and lower incomes any price drop will be wiped out by higher borrowing costs the new vehicle market by contrast has become an option mainly for affluent buyers automakers are increasingly deploying scarce computer chips to make costly loaded out versions of pickups suvs and other outsize vehicles typically with relatively low gas mileage last month the average price of a new vehicle was down slightly from august but remained more than 11 000 above its level in january 2020 glenn mears who runs five dealerships south of canton ohio says the federal reserve s interest rate hikes by contributing to pricier auto loans are slowing his showroom traffic we can feel some pullback he said analysts generally say that with shortages of computer chips and other parts still hobbling factories new vehicle prices won t likely fall substantially but further modest price drops may be likely the availability of vehicles on u s dealer lots improved to nearly 1 4 million vehicles last month up from 1 million for most of the year cox automotive reported before the pandemic normal supply was far higher around 4 million so historically speaking inventory remains tight and demand still high like hudson many buyers are still stuck paying sticker price or above it s extraordinarily expensive these days said jominy who estimates that there are still 5 million u s customers waiting to buy new vehicles despite recent stock market declines many such buyers have built up wealth especially in their homes and are rewarding themselves with high end autos in the san francisco bay area for example notes inder dosanjh who runs a 20 dealership group that includes general motors ford acura volkswagen and stellantis brands many people have received substantial pay raises there s just a lot of money out there he said in its earnings report tuesday gm noted that its customer demand is holding up though gm and other automakers would like to produce more vehicles at the moment they are benefiting from slower production which typically means higher prices and profits john lawler ford s chief financial officer noted wednesday that near record new vehicle prices were starting to decline and consumer appetites are starting to change demand for midrange vehicles he said has begun to outpace more profitable autos loaded with options next year could be a turning point suggested jeff windau an analyst at edward jones with the economy likely to weaken and possibly enter a recession prices could fall as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they re willing to bite off from a payment perspective
elon musk has taken over as the new owner of twitter dismissing top employees he had accused of deceiving him and offering little explanation of how he will carry out the ambitious plans he has made for the significant social media company his initial response was a tweet the bird is free he said after sealing the deal the bird is freed elon musk elonmusk october 28 2022 according to a new york times report that cited sources with knowledge of the situation musk has decided to clean house at twitter with the firings of at least four top executives former ceo parag agrawal is among the twitter executives that were fired following the resignation of twitter co founder jack dorsey in november parag agrawal was appointed ceo of the company agrawal has been employed by twitter for about ten years and held the position of the chief technical officer before becoming ceo elon musk vs parag agrawal the world s richest man elon musk has acquired control of the social networking platform after a protracted legal battle and months of enmity between musk and twitter leadership there was a lot of animosity between elon musk and parag agrawal and little of it was kept from the public eye as the litigation made their scathing messaging exchanges public in an early filing regarding the deal musk stated i don t have confidence in management you are free to tweet is twitter dying or anything else related to twitter noted musk but it s my obligation to let you know that it s not assisting me in improving twitter in the current context file image what did you accomplish this week elon musk publicly attacked parag and expressed ambivalence about the agreement by writing i m not joining the board this is a waste of time elon s story of the twitter takeover a remarkable saga with many twists and turns that raised questions about musk s ability to execute the deal culminated in the 44 billion dollar acquisition it all started on april 4 when musk revealed that he was the san francisco company s top stakeholder with a 9 2 stake the richest man in the world then agreed to join twitter s board but changed his mind at the last minute and proposed to buy the firm instead for 54 20 dollars per share twitter wasn t sure whether to take this as another of musk s references to marijuana or not musk s offer was genuine and the two parties eventually came to an agreement on his estimated amount over the course of just one weekend later in april this occurred without musk performing any due diligence on the company s proprietary information as is normal in an acquisition web screen grab following those weeks musk had second thoughts he expressed public displeasure about twitter s estimate of less than 5 of its monetizable daily active users saying he thought the number of spam accounts was substantially higher then according to his attorneys twitter ignored his demands for information on the matter due to the growing tension musk informed twitter on july 8 that he was ending their business relationship and that twitter had misled him over the bots and had not cooperated with him twitter filed a lawsuit against musk in delaware where the business is incorporated four days later to compel him to finalize the transaction making of the chief twit shares of social media businesses and the overall stock market had already fallen at that point due to concerns that the federal reserve s attempts to combat inflation by raising interest rates may cause the u s economy to enter a recession twitter said that musk was suffering from buyer s remorse and wanted to back out of the agreement because he believed he overpaid according to reports the majority of legal experts felt that twitter had the best arguments and would probably win the case even after twitter s former security chief peiter zatko came forth as a whistleblower in august and said that the firm failed to disclose flaws in its security and data privacy their opinion did not change musk made another u turn on october 4 and offered to complete the agreement as promised just before he was scheduled to be questioned by twitter s attorneys prior to the start of their trial later that same month he was given until october 28 by the delaware judge to complete the deal and avert the trial twitter elon musk visited the twitter offices the day before the deal closed and modified his bio to read chief twit then he said in a letter to twitter advertisers that he had bought twitter because society s future required a shared digital town square there is currently a significant risk that far right and far left echo chambers on social media will spread more hate and split our society because it would be simple i chose not to do it i didn t do it to increase my earnings i did it in an effort to support humanity whom i adore musk wrote parag s deal there won t be any empty bags for parag agrawal according to a filing the ceo will fully vest all of his unvested equity awards as part of the agreement according to research firm equilar s estimate he will earn almost 42 million reuters reported for more on news and current affairs from around the world please visit indiatimes news

dr lee duffield lays bare seven critical leaders in the second part of his analysis of radical right wing movements and governments worldwide each such right wing party seems to need a prominent leader whether a dominant figure or a clown classed here as demagogues from a standard dictionary meaning these have been playing on what the united nations now calls a colossal global dysfunction where climate change and disease combine with forced migration to create conflict and fear the extremist parties work against asylum seekers play racial politics disrupt institutions of society like education courts or free elections and generate mayhem where they can for example by deregulating guns and as a trademark in political debates trade in lies as said in part 1 of this series the parties have shown no skill or interest in governing even when elected preferring to run campaigns not a government and so they have not this time gone to the full extreme of linking up with the despotic regimes russia china and their collaborators democracy in danger the rise of right wing demagogues recent european elections which went towards extremist parties campaigning against immigrants are a warning for democracy jair bolsonaro brazil jair bolsonaro governed ham fistedly for four years in brazil after the election in 2018 dividing the country over such projects as opening the amazon region to open slather forest clearing disastrous handling of the covid crisis saw some of the worst outcomes with more than 680 000 deaths allies of the president contrived to get opposition leader luiz inacio lula da silva imprisoned on corruption charges taking him over 18 months to get it overturned through appeals to higher courts while bolsonaro has taken a heavy drop in voter support like many of his movement counterparts he has a resistant core of supporters including many devotees of new christian churches a follower of donald trump bolsonaro took the same position on his bid for re election if it went against him it had to be rigged in a first round of voting for the presidency 2 october this year he actually did better than polls had forecast raising different suspicions about rigging on the lines that it might take one to know one a decisive second round of voting against lula was due on 30 october boris johnson england boris johnson was pushed out of the prime ministership by his own party for lying about misconduct in office amongst several misdeeds running drinks parties in his offices during covid lockdowns his signature achievement brexit secession from the european union broke up his party and government and wounded the country ideologues in the ranks seized on the break with european standards of strong governance to go for broke on wild capitalism led by liz truss s lunge to pile on fresh unfunded tax cuts after her fall johnson was himself seen manoeuvring for a possible shock come back in the end deferred a reminder that despite everything he can count on many votes from the conservative faithful the dedicated core marine le pen france marine le pen is a long term presence on the french political scene mobilising support against immigration and voicing objections to islam within the country s large ethnic communities she brings together the elements of charismatic leadership playing on racial tensions and drawing votes away from moderate parties her party national rally rn is one of a set of such movements across europe called populist because of offering straight talking remedies she was placed second in presidential elections this year underscoring the decline of the traditional centre right republicans and centre left socialist parties both fumbling to cope with structural changes in the economy both also deserving public censure over official corruption when in office like the british conservatives the le pen party is hostile to the rules based practices of the european union but prevaricates about going against firm public opinion in support of continuing membership giorgia meloni italy giorgia meloni became prime minister of italy on 13 october this year after her party brothers of italy became the largest in parliament the party was the outgrowth of nearly 30 years of movement politics in the ultra nationalist or populist category its election breakthrough came in a climate of crisis northern italy heavily exposed to china through the rag trade connection became one of the worst hit areas under covid then already in financial straits the country suffered amongst the hardest from the invasion of ukraine inflation and impacts on energy costs crisis had actually been longer term with a vacuum that followed the collapse of the two adversaries of 40 years the christian democrats and communists don camillo versus mayor peppone in the 1990s and later break up of the socialist party as in france betrayed by corrupt leadership the poll came on when the nightclub party m5s five star movement a nine year old movement that mixes policies across the spectrum brought on a no confidence vote then lost more than half its parliamentary representation in this year s elections meloni has a coalition with extreme right parties led by silvio berlusconi the geriatric bunga bunga man former playboy prime minister very close to vladimir putin and matteo salvini the militant opponent of immigration the arithmetic posits that much of her support would come from the old christian democrat centre so policies have had to edge away from fascism towards more centrist ideas like staying in the european union will this prime minister be able to govern effectively with the militant gentlemen on her right or will the new movement start to blow over like five star or become a makeover of mussolini scotty from marketing what a way to run a country word is prime minister scott morrison intensely dislikes the moniker scotty from marketing bestowed upon him last year by the betoota advocate scott morrison australia scott morrison may have set out to check the most boxes for a demagogue politician during his three years as australian prime minister until last may intimately identified with donald trump morrison in office likewise ran an ongoing media campaign appearing constantly in different work clothes on job sites getting called scotty from marketing he ran a government that failed to get programs working to follow up big announcements it stumbled on covid missing key calls such as timely delivery of test kits an attempt by morrison to take centre stage as national leader a kindly duce by chairing a national cabinet that included state premiers ended when the premiers refused to play instead using their own powers to take on the pandemic as pm and a former state political director of the liberal party he persisted in spending time on internal factional manoeuvres a mystery to most voters but activity that did nothing to stop encroachment on power by the ideological right wing on personal political style he fell out demonstrably with women voters on the empathy variable and was universally called out for impulsive lying as a fundamentalist christian morrison enjoyed a lot of barracking support during visits to certain churches though always ready to edge away if religious friends ran into scandal or embarrassment viktor orban hungary viktor orban in 2022 has been backing up his friendship with vladimir putin for example blocking the transit of allied shipments to ukraine across his territory not joining in sanctions against russia or criticising those sanctions and still buying in energy stocks from russia this has further eroded relations within the western military alliance and with the european union which has levied economic sanctions against hungary for breaking its protocols on the justice system fair elections and human rights he had refused to take any share of refugees during the 2015 immigration crisis in europe the man asserts he has been following a program of illiberal democracy objecting to the electoral systems of the west and proclaiming that he finds models in china russia india singapore or turkey starting off in 1989 as a proponent of neoliberalism orban has become identified with the nationalist populist or nativist movements drawing support from rural areas he routinely insults elites living in the cities donald trump usa donald trump united states president from 2017 21 might have written this article to outline what he finds good and exciting in the political world trump is at war with conventions of human behaviour especially day by day civility truthfulness and doing your job responsibly he represents the neoliberal phenomenon of billionaires striving to dominate public life with resources to defy the law if it should impede his ambitions or seek to call him to account he has a demagogic interest in propounding his messages constantly in campaign mode while unsuccessful in government in that his diplomatic initiatives like the handshake meetings with kim jong un of north korea failed and his negligent response to the pandemic produced dire consequences for the public trump is facing subpoenas and possible charges for various failings in office not least those connected with the attack on congress by trump supporters on 6 january 2021 trump impeachment he s so bad they did it twice the destruction of democracy in the capitol on january 6 live streamed by proud perpetrators was a gross violation commanded by the u s s terrorist in chief donald trump together with the systematic placement by his administration of judges with right wing partisan records his efforts to influence the counting of votes is being seen as undemocratic a dangerous bid to paralyse or control the institutions of society he continues to command a strong following responding especially to his efforts to choke off migration his alliance with the gun lobby and for the more well healed his hand out of billions of dollars in the 2018 tax cuts as trump said summary crisis enveloping the world has thrown up a crop of political adventurers taking advantage of distress and panic among people worldwide it has echoes of the crises of the first world war and its aftermath of economic collapse in the 1920s and 1930s which produced fascist dictatorships especially nazi germany and italy under mussolini enamoured of charismatic orators at their head exploiting emerging mass media systems these parties were positioned on the right wing where they favoured and depended on major business corporations suppressed workers movements as a prelude to general abrogation of citizens rights and mobilised the persecution of minorities they have parallels in the axis of autocratic governments in 2022 with china and russia at the centre the demagogic leaders identified here including several in liberal democracies have been some time coming through the late margaret thatcher john howard in australia and george w bush in the 1980s and 1990s can be seen as transitional moving away from cautious and conservative government towards radical extremes the demagogues have stopped short of affiliating with the axis to this time but where they move further in that direction such as moving to conquer more centrist parties or conquer institutions of society like education or the courts or if they corrupt electoral systems the question has to be asked whether they are in transition to a dark future this article is part 2 of a

canadian pot producer canopy growth corp isn t waiting any longer to pull the trigger on acquiring three companies it had planned to buy only when marijuana became federally legal in the u s chief executive officer david klein said in an interview before an announcement that canopy will create a new entity canopy usa llc to purchase the companies acreage holdings inc jetty extracts and wana brands in which it has options to take control in the event of u s legalization the deal which is subject to a shareholder vote will make canopy profitable and allow it to create a u s house of brands that can move into new states and use each company s intellectual property even without the federal legal change that the deals were contingent on he said by triggering the total ownership of acreage and bringing jetty wana and acreage under one umbrella we get to more aggressively take control of our destiny in the u s and get these businesses performing better than they are today klein said the latest deal is notable because it offers canopy a u s toehold in a business that remains federally illegal constellation s involvement is also noteworthy because larger consumer products companies have mostly kept their distance from marijuana companies based in the u s the use of medical marijuana was legalized in arkansas in 2016 and a ballot initiative to legalize its use for adults goes before the voters on nov 8 the deal has special provisions that canopy says will let it avoid running afoul of the federal prohibition of cannabis in the u s for starters canopy usa will have its own management and the exchangeable shares create a protective layer between u s operations and canopy s core canadian business canopy usa will have its own board of managers and canopy won t have voting rights according to klein canopy has had conversations with both tsx and nasdaq and is working with the exchanges to ensure continued compliance with listing rules and regulations additionally corona and modelo beermaker constellation brands inc canopy s largest stakeholder and financial backer can change its common stock investment to exchangeable shares that would keep its 35 7 ownership stake unchanged while shielding constellation from more direct involvement with the still federally prohibited substance klein said klein added that moving constellation s stake to exchangeable shares will make the company more comfortable and allow them to participate in the upside from what canopy is doing the deal is structured to allow constellation to convert its stake in canopy growth back to class a common stock at any time klein said a spokesman for constellation said the conversion of constellation s common stock to exchangeable shares will allow it to realize the potential upside of our investment in canopy the company s strategic shift comes as canadian pot stocks are suffering and canopy is no exception constellation announced in its most recent quarterly report that it was taking a 1 1 billion charge due to its canopy stake marijuana stocks have experienced an industrywide decline due to the perception that legalization is taking too long even u s president joe biden s announcement this month that a federal evaluation of the drug is underway has failed to reverse stock market losses the deal also gives constellation a way out of the impact of falling stock values on its own earnings a constellation spokesperson said that by giving up its warrants it eliminates the impact to its earnings and will further reinforce our intent to not deploy additional investment in canopy canopy s initial deal for acreage in 2019 gave it an innovative call option on u s legalization which has has since been imitated by other companies and by canopy itself a year ago canopy paid almost 300 million in cash for the option to acquire wana brands upon legalization this year it paid 69 million for a similar option to buy jetty extracts the deal doesn t include another u s company that canopy has a stake in terrascend corp shareholders and analysts have questioned whether canopy might enter the u s market on a federal legal shift that s slightly less than full legalization of the drug such as a rescheduling or the passing of so called safe banking law that would give u s marijuana companies more leeway to work with banks canopy usa will be governed by a four person board acreage jetty and wana will continue to be led by their existing management teams klein said canopy is considering the creation of a class of exchangeable shares available to all investors not just constellation it would allow those concerned about regulatory ramifications to participate in the space in an attempt to encourage more ownership by institutional investors cassels brock blackwell paul hastings and dentons were legal advisers on the deal information for this article was contributed by john magsam of the arkansas democrat gazette
tgs asa otcpk tgsnf q3 2022 earnings conference call october 27 2022 3 00 am et company participants kristian johansen chief executive officer sven bã rre larsen chief financial officer conference call participants john olaisen abg sundal collier holding jã rgen andreas lande danske bank kristian johansen good morning everyone and welcome to tgs q3 2022 financial presentation my name is kristian johansen i m the ceo of tgs and with me today we have our cfo sven bã rre larsen as well i want to start by drawing your attention to the forward looking statements and i ll encourage you to read through that when the presentation is over and then i hit the highlights of q3 right away so we had late sales of 65 million in q3 and that compares to about 31 million in q3 of 2021 so we more than doubled our late sales in the quarter and obviously we reported this figures at the sixth day of the quarter and you ll also notice that we had 135 million of total revenues and that compares to 200 million in q3 last year but keep in mind last year we had an extraordinary high portion of projects being completed during the quarter and the way we recognized that obviously with ifrs had a very positive impact to q3 of last year but some of you are probably more familiar to the poc revenues and the poc revenues this quarter came in at 119 million and that compares to 61 million in q3 of last year so again pretty much a doubling of our poc revenues which just reflects a very strong market and a significant improvement from a pretty low base from 2021 though also happy to announce that we had a robust order inflow we had 140 million of new projects signed in in 2000 or in q3 of 2022 and that compares to only 30 million in the same quarter of last year so a significant improvement both in terms of late sales in terms of poc revenues and order inflow which i will come back to that means that our backlog stands at about 225 million at the end of q3 and as you all know we have also made the acquisition of more than 76 of the shares in magseis and if you add magseis strong backlog to this number it s obviously going to be by far the strongest backlog that you ve ever seen from tgs so we re in a really good position entering into 2023 we see a continued improvement to the market and it makes us really optimistic about the future for this company we combined that with a solid financial position we have net cash of 192 million and keep in mind that we spent quite a lot of cash on 2 acquisitions during the quarter we bought the company prediktor in q3 and paid for that with cash in q3 and we also acquired the seismic business of ion geophysical that used to be a public company in the u s that was also paid by cash during q3 but despite those acquisitions we actually ended up with a cash balance of 192 million which is well within the comfort zone of where we want to be in terms of financial strength and liquidity that also means that we re in a position to continue to pay dividend of usd 0 14 per share which corresponds to about 16 million and i can clearly conclude that we re delivering on our strategy it s supported by 3 m a transactions that all were closed or 2 of them were closed in q2 and the last one is going to be closed in q4 sorry q3 and q4 and last but not least we see a continued recovery in the market which is obviously when you look at the numbers and compare it to last year you ll see a tremendous increase in the activity level and we think that trend is going to continue into q4 and into 2023 i ll touch on our strategy as i said we are executing on our strategy and our goal of being a leading energy data company and energy data means more than oil and gas data it also means data for wind and solar and geothermal and deep sea minerals and even carbon capture and storage there are great opportunities for us in the energy space going forward the strategy basically has 3 important pillars one starts with maximizing shareholder returns we will never sacrifice on that goal we continue to have a relentless focus on cost we combine that with a low financial gearing which again counters a high operational gearing in our business and we think we found a business model and also a financial and capital structure model that is quite unique in this industry and that means that we can continue to target the industry leading returns and that s the returns you will see from a combination of dividend and share buybacks and i think the illustration there is really good in terms of comparing tgs to the philadelphia index where you ll see tgs has a cash conversion rate so you know how much of your revenues do you actually turn into free cash it s 30 for tgs and it s 3 for the philadelphia index in average so it s clearly a unique business model a unique capital structure and a unique performance through the cycle that allows us to continue to deliver very strong returns we combine that with improving or an ambition to improve and expand the seismic offering so you ll see we made 3 acquisitions within the seismic space over the past few years it started with spectrum followed up with ion and then the last one is magseis fairfield the first 2 acquisitions both the spectrum and ion really puts us in a great position in terms of high growth areas so take the southern atlantic as an example that s where you see a lot of the growth at current you see brazil activities really picking up and the combination of tgs library but also the spectrum library and the ion library makes us a truly unique provider of seismic in this area in addition to that we also see that the multi client market may be too small for us so that frontier multi client may be too small so we see a lot of opportunities outside that as well we want to gain access to the what we call non frontier activities and what we mean by non frontier activities would be for the production seismic and converted contracts and we think the acquisition of magseis fairfield puts us in a really unique position in order to target those areas as well and really use our strength our financial strength and our commercial strength and our business model to gain a bigger part of that market as well we continue to consolidate and we do that to gain economies of scale and provide our clients with a reduced unit cost in the future so i think this is a great story in terms of how we ve changed with the markets the market is very different today compared to what it was 5 10 and 20 years ago and we change with the market we see a higher activity level around proprietary and converted contracts and with the acquisition of magseis we re going to put ourself in a really unique position in terms of targeting that market as well and then last but not least we want to be positioned for what we call the energy evolution so we want to utilize our core competencies to build an offering across the energy value chain so not only oil and gas so despite the fact that we think that oil and gas will be critical for many many years and decades to come we see significant growth opportunities in the renewable space and we think by applying the same business model as we have done now for 40 years in oil and gas we can become really successful in terms of reflecting the overall energy mix and provide data across the value chain these products and services are going to be subscription based so this is data on insight that is supposed to be subscription based it s going to be non cyclical and it s going to provide a new revenue stream for tgs in the future that adds on top of the revenue stream that we have in seismic so again we re extremely proud of what we have carried out this summer we think it really puts tgs on the map in a very different way it provides new opportunities for us it provides more growth opportunities and we have a more diversified and solid company and last but not least we combine that with continuing to have a very strong balance sheet with about 200 million of cash even after 2 of these 3 acquisitions so i ll talk a little bit about the recent highlights and i think the first one that is important to mention is that u s has finally set a date for the march lease sale in the gulf of mexico and this is very positive news of course for the entire seismic industry but particularly for tgs it s got a very strong and dominating position in the u s economy so boem announced next steps for the oil and gas leasing on the gom outer continental shelf and this is to comply with the provisions in the ira or the inflation reduction act that was released by biden quite recently basically what it says of the inflation reduction act is that it requires boem to number one accept the highest valid bids from lease sale 257 so that has already been carried out so anyone who bid and won a lease in the lease sale last fall they ve now have been awarded these leases finally they re also obliged to hold their lease sale 258 which is in the cook inlet basin in alaska by the end of 2022 so that s going to happen before christmas it doesn t really have a lot of impact for tgs because we don t have any â or we don t have much seismic area or seismic data in the area but more importantly they re also required to hold lease sale 259 which is the gulf of mexico lease sale and the deadline for that is march 31st of 2023 and not only that but they ve also committed to lease sale 261 which is also in the gulf of mexico and that will be held by september 30th 2023 so there will be 2 lease sales these lease sales will cover the entire gulf of mexico and obviously that s great news in terms of our planning for both new projects but also our late sales budget for 2023 there is going to be some royalty rates related to the ira and one is that they will increase the minimum royalty rate from 12 5 to 16 7 and this is for our future ocs oil and gas leases but there is a positive to that too it means that they also establish a maximum rate of 18 75 for future leases and that lasts for 10 years so there is not going to be any negative surprises in terms of new taxes being added as you ve seen in a few other countries quite recently then they have made a commitment to not make any changes to the royalty rates for existing leases which also means that there are no surprises related to existing leases which obviously our clients looked very positively at and there s also a connection to offshore wind and we see that as very positive because what it says is that they may not issue a lease for offshore wind development unless in the year preceding that sale boem has held at least 1 oil and gas lease sale so any new lease sale for offshore wind and we know that there s going to be a lot of lease sales for offshore wind so any lease sale for offshore wind will have to be followed or there will have to be an oil and gas lease sale before that so that s also very positive and a good driver for the industry so i think a lot of people kind of underestimate the impact this is going to have for seismic going forward it really means that gulf of mexico is back in terms of seismic activity the good thing is that the u s gulf of mexico already has a lot of seismic it already has a lot of 2d and 3d seismic and the next generation of seismic in the u s gom will be ocean bottom nodes and with the acquisition of magseis fairfield tgs is in a very unique position in terms of grabbing these opportunities for the future so we look at this as very favorably and it just adds to all the pros that we see by the acquisition of magseis and how that s strategically important for tgs in the future and how that s going to strengthen our position in one of our core markets going forward so i talked about the order inflow that is record high at 140 million in the quarter i m just going to go through some of the projects that are behind that order inflows so i ll start with the capreolus phase 2 in australia you ll see it from the map that this is an area where tgs has quite a lot of data and that s actually been 2 quite recent discoveries one very recent discovery here and it s also been a discovery a couple of years back the dorado discovery in by santos back in 3 or 4 years ago so this is in one of the hottest areas in asia pacific right now and i m extremely proud that tgs got the permit and also got the opportunity to acquire more data in australia this is a basin where we ve done really well financially over time and we re going to continue to do that so the data acquisition of this service starts in early 2023 and we re using the pxgeo vessel for that job then we have the amendment 2 in the gulf of mexico i know a lot of you have been waiting for that survey to finally come up you know we ve been waiting for permits for quite some time and there s been kind of a standstill in the u s gom for quite some time but we ve been quite optimistic in terms of the future and we know there s a lot of pressure on politicians to open up the gom again and that s why we believe the inflation reduction act is very positive for oil and gas in general it s positive for all for the entire energy mix but obviously it helps a lot in terms of getting permits to acquire more data in the future and as i said a lot of this is going to be obn data so the long offset obn data in the u s if you look at the volumes right now we re going to have more than 13 000 square kilometers after we re done with this survey in total we have about 222 000 square kilometers of 3d data so if you subtract 13 000 from 220 000 you ll see that there s a lot of opportunities going forward where there s going to be many many years of obn activity in the u s gulf of mexico which again is very positive for our growth going forward we also finally announced a new onshore project it s called swanson 3d it s canada onshore this is a project that is relatively small it adds about 100 square kilometers of high quality seismic data and it s in the montney basin in canada and as you see it from the map we already have a lot of data there and again it s always important when we start new surveys we always have to look back on the financial success or lack of success of previous surveys and this is another area where we call it a sweet spot in terms of financial returns we ve always done well on the surveys that we re doing in this area and that gives us high confidence in terms of providing good returns also in the future in the montney basin in canada this acquisition will actually commence in q4 this year and then we re going to have data delivered sometime in may 2023 talk a little bit about the magseis acquisition as well we ve obviously had a couple of sessions where we have talked about this already but the status right now is that we have about 75 4 of the outstanding shares of magseis we got that through the voluntary offer that expired on 28th of september 2022 then the next step is to provide the remaining shareholders with a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares that s going to be announced shortly it s probably going to start sometime in early november and then it s going to be open for about 6 weeks and then the shareholders can decide whether they want to take the mandatory offer and if they don t want the mandatory offer we will our intention is to propose the statutory merger if the voluntary offer fails and then bring the holding to more than 90 so no matter how we get there we re going to get to a full control of the company it s going to be fully consolidated we ve already started the integration process of a data analysis of the integration process and then obviously we re going to kick off the full integration whenever we have more than 90 of the shares which is going to happen over the next couple of months i can also remind you about the strategic rationale but i think it comes across pretty clear through the throughout the presentation but number one it really strengthens our multi client business towards ilx and converted contracts and that s where we see kind of a shift in the market we think it will shift back eventually but it s a clear shift from frontier seismic to ilx we ve seen that over the past 3 to 5 years and we gradually we see a number of our servers have shifted from being frontier to more ilx work but this is really going to give us a great continuation of that strategy and we by controlling the a significant part of the obn market we put ourselves in a really good position in that regard we re also positioned for production seismic in 4d obviously we re going to continue to do that magseis is not going to be a multi client company magseis is going to continue to be a divisional tgs where they continue to do what they do today but the beauty of having tgs as the owner is that we can fill the gaps we can optimize the backlog at any point of time and we can hopefully improve the returns quite significantly over the next couple of years it s going to enhance our position in obn processing we have some very successful processing projects in the u s gulf of mexico we really want to build on that we really want to make sure that for obn processing tgs is going to be a tier 1 company and that is going to improve our exposure towards energy transition related industries if you look at offshore wind if you look at ccs and deep sea minerals magseis has the tools to do it they have the toolkits to carry out some of these surveys and we re going to see significant growth in that going forward but again the market for oil and gas is so good right now so magseis is pretty much sold out now for the next 12 to 18 months so it s a good problem to have but of course we also want to target areas where you see higher growth in the future so in that regard it also strengthens our new energy solutions strategy and it s interesting if you look at the upper picture in the on the right side of the slide you see all the opportunities that you have not only in multi client as you see in the on the left side but you see traditional data acquisition that is being carried out proprietary we re going to continue to do that you see renewables you see technology lease and sale which magseis has been quite successful with in the past and then obviously reservoir monitoring so it provides a significant diversification of our business going forward and it doesn t impact our returns in multi client to probably going to be even higher in the future because we get a higher proportion of ilx work as well so i think this is something we are obviously extremely excited about and we re also very excited about the 2 other acquisitions that we made and closed in q3 one is the ion geophysical i honestly have to say i think ion geophysical is going to go into the history books of being the best acquisition we ve ever made and i can t provide details or further details about that but i think we ve never seen an acquisition with such a fast payback time and we re just very very fortunate to be in a financial position where we can take the opportunity when the opportunity is there so when the door is open we can get in there we can do a deal that no one else is able to act that quickly because of our strong balance sheets the transaction closed in late august 2022 we ve already added 60 employees that has moved to tgs as part of the transaction and the integration into tgs which is mainly on the processing side is about to be completed so we re extremely happy to have lots of talent coming in from ion that used to be one of the really strong processing companies back in the days and then they kind of underinvested in their technology over the past few years but we think we can really bring this back and really make sure that the sum of tgs and ion in processing will be a tier 1 company prediktor we ve talked about prediktor before but it s a leading provider of asset management and real time data management solutions and this goes to both renewable and energy asset owners we are particularly focused on the solar market this is probably the fastest growing market in the energy transition related industry so we re very excited about adding prediktor to the mix it makes up an important part of our offering in our new energy solutions and we re adding about 40 employees to tgs they ve already been integrated and transaction closed in early july and this is being integrated and aligned with our overall digital energy solutions business so again a very very interesting add on to our business for the future so with that i m going to hand it over to sven bã rre he s going to go through the financials and then after that i will come back and talk a little bit about how we see the market and how we see the outlook going forward thank you very much sven bã rre larsen thank you for that kristian and good morning to you all so i will go through the financials and as always i will start with going through the revenues in more detail in starting with the early sales in the upper left hand corner of this slide as you can see we had 55 million of early sales recognized in q3 2022 this is significantly lower obviously than the 164 million we had in the same quarter of last year when we completed some big projects in brazil the largest contributors to the early sales in this quarter are the projects the largest projects that were completed during this quarter were the noaka obn survey in norway espirito santo 3d in brazil and cambriol 3d in canada and then we had a number of smaller surveys and reprocessing projects that were also completed and contributed in the quarter then focusing on sorry focusing on the late sales on the top right hand corner we had 65 million of late sales in this quarter compared to 31 million in the same quarter of last year and this is actually an increase of 108 year over year as you can see it s a little bit down sequentially and that has to do with the significant amount of transfer fees that we booked in q2 but and i call it underlying basis excluding transfer fees we are more or less at level with where we have been in the past few quarters in q3 we experienced particularly strong sales in africa and latin america and also in gulf of mexico then focusing on proprietary sales on the bottom left hand corner we had high proprietary sales in the quarter 16 million and that has to do with the noaka survey that we continued to do during this summer in the north sea so the noaka survey is kind of a hybrid survey which has from an accounting viewpoint has a proprietary portion and a multi client portion so we recognized a large part of the proprietary portion during q3 but we also saw higher activity in terms of proprietary processing in the quarter which also contributed to this increase that we see in the quarter so this meant that we had 135 million of total ifrs revenues in the quarter which compares to 200 million in the same quarter of last year then going into more into detail on the operating results and the cash flow on operating expenses we had total operating expenses of 27 million in this quarter note that this excludes a 3 2 million charge related to m a costs that was booked in q3 so it s costs or an accruals related to the 3 transactions that kristian already talked about so this has been excluded from the 27 million number that you see in this chart so as you can see we re a little bit up compared to the same quarter of last year when we had 24 million of operating expenses and that has to do with mainly with 2 things first of all we included ion staff from the closing date of 1st of september so the month of september also included some staff from ion which obviously increases the personnel cost in the quarter and secondly as i already said we had a bit higher activity on proprietary imaging in the quarter which means that we did a little bit less proprietary multi client or imaging multi client work which means that we capitalize less and we expense more of that personnel cost so all in all we are very happy with the underlying development in operating expenses and we continue to show very strong cost discipline then focusing on amortization and impairments on the top right hand corner there you see that we had 90 million of amortization or total amortization in the quarter which compares to 144 million in the same quarter of last year of the 90 million straight line amortization accounted for 39 million so that s a little bit down compared to the previous quarter but this obviously don t move very much from quarter to quarter so you should expect it to be reasonably stable going forward then accelerated amortization amounted to 42 million that may be a little bit higher than what you normally would think the accelerated amortization related to early sales was in the range of 25 million to 30 million so it accounted for roughly say roughly 50 of early sales which is probably where we should be on a normalized basis although this will jump a little bit around from quarter to quarter depending on which projects that are being completed the reason why accelerated amortization in total is higher than that number is partially related to the fact that we had some accelerated amortization related to late sales in this quarter we don t have that in every quarter but in this quarter we had so sometimes when we do larger sales of individual surveys we that have little headroom left in there call it impairment test we will have to also book an amortization in association with late sales on top of the accelerate on top of the straight line amortization so we have a little bit of that in the quarter and also there are some technicalities related to the ion transaction that impacts accelerated amortization so obviously when we take the ion surveys into our library as of 1st of september we do that at a level which means that net book value equals fair value or value in use and when we then have sales continuing on those surveys in september we have to book an accelerated amortization on those surveys so it s a bit of a technicality so this meant that the operating profit was 4 million in the quarter again this is adjusted for the 3 2 million of m a related expenses then free cash flow was 10 million in the quarter which is not very impressive but if you look at the last 12 months or the last 4 quarters we actually have had 155 million of free cash flow and as you know free cash flow will jump a little bit around from quarter to quarter due to changes in working capital and other elements but if you look at this in a slightly longer term you will see that we continue to produce very strong free cash flow then going into more detail on our multi client library you see here that we had multi client investments of 79 million so quite high multi client investments in the quarter and that compares to 56 million in the same quarter of last year the high investments is obviously mainly due to a higher activity level in terms of data acquisition activities but it s also a call it technical element related to a change in accounting practice so in the past as you may know when we have had this risk share contracts where a vendor has taken risk on sales we have booked the investment when the sale has happened so if that sale has happened say 3 years after the survey was completed we have booked the associated investment at that point in time so at the same time as we have booked the sales now we will have to make an estimate of future risk share sales and book the investment as we do the survey so therefore we have implemented that change now in q3 and it s also a little bit of catch up from earlier this year so that has caused investments to be a bit higher than it otherwise would have been looking at the net book value of the multi client library it stood at 576 million at the end of the quarter so it s slightly up compared to q2 partially obviously due to the ion acquisition and partially due to the investments the high investments that we just went through going forward and looking into 2023 and what our kind of preliminary plans show us we are quite optimistic that this trend without shrinking multi client library will turn around and that we will start to see an increasing trend from next year then looking at the chart on the bottom left hand corner you see our multi or our investments by vintage and also where the net book value of those vintages sit currently obviously in the ifrs reporting we do very little amortization on our work in progress balance most of that happens when we recognize the revenues at completion and therefore of course the net book value is pretty close to historical investments for our wip balance looking at the revenues by year of completion on the bottom right hand chart you see that we continue to show very strong revenues from older vintages in this quarter 23 of our revenues came from surveys that were completed prior to 2018 which we like very much because those sales normally have a very high margin also what s encouraging to see is that our 22 vintage is selling really well which also bodes well for future returns then the income statement so with the early sales late sales and proprietary sales as i went through earlier total revenues were 135 million in the quarter we had high cost of goods sold in the quarter and that is related to the proprietary revenues that we recognized in connection with the noaka survey that i talked about earlier so the cost of goods sold the increase in cost of goods sold is associated with the increase in proprietary sales personnel cost of 17 9 million and other operational costs of 12 7 million this again included 3 2 million of m a related went off expenses this gave us an ebitda of 97 million in the quarter and then subtracting amortization and some smaller impairments and depreciation it meant that we had an operating result of 1 1 million you see there on the table that we had exchange losses of 3 3 million in the quarter and that s related to some non usd assets that we hold that obviously have depreciated in value as a result of the appreciation of the dollar versus most other currencies lately this gave us a result before taxes negative of 2 3 million which meant that we had a positive cash cost that gave us a net income of a negative net income of 1 7 million in the quarter looking at the balance sheet it obviously continues to be strong with a strong net cash position of 192 million and as you know on top of that we have an undrawn rcf of 100 million that we can utilize we are now in a prolonged discussion with or in detailed discussion with banks about refinancing this facility and also include the 45 million facility that magseis has so you will probably see more news on this before we report the q4 numbers in early february then to the cash flow statement not much to note here you ll see the investments the m a related investments of 41 million that were charged in the quarter that was related to ion and prediktor so we had no investments related to magseis in this quarter and then we obviously continue to pay dividends and we also bought back shares worth 4 5 million in the quarter so this meant that we had a negative net cash flow of 59 million in the quarter which brought our cash balance down to 192 million then dividends so once again the board has resolved to maintain the dividend at 0 14 per share in this quarter with the strengthening of the dollar versus the norwegian krona it means that the norwegian kroner denominated dividend is now up to nok 1 48 million in this quarter the ex date will be 1 week from now on 3rd of november and the payment date will be 3 weeks from now on the 17th of november and as i noted already we bought back shares worth 4 5 million during the quarter with that i will hand back to kristian that will cover the market outlook thank you kristian johansen thank you very much sven so in terms of the market outlook and how we see the hopefully the next quarter but obviously in the next few years so i ll start with a slide that most of you are quite familiar to and it talks about the trilemma between sustainability affordability and availability and i think this is really core to what we see in the energy markets today we see an imbalance in the trilemma between the 3 we see a world that has moved too fast in the direction of sustainability on behalf of availability and affordability if you go back 5 or 10 years it was probably the other way around we were too focused on availability and we forgot about the sustainability but the key challenge now is how can you find the right balance between the 3 such that we can provide affordable energy we can have available energy and we can do that in the most sustainable way and i think it s important to say that the final goal here is not to get rid of oil and gas the final goal should obviously be to reduce emissions and reducing the emissions in the most successful and quickest way would be to obviously replace coal with natural gas and it would also be investing heavily in carbon capture and storage such that you can continue to provide oil but in a much cleaner and more sustainable way that s really the recipe for how we have to move forward on this and finally it seems like the world starts to realize that and unfortunately there is a war that kind of reminds us about how important energy security is that we ve clearly learned a lesson during the past 6 or 8 months and that s really going to impact the markets going forward there s no question about that so energy security requires higher exploration activity there is no question about that and if you look at the graph on the or the bar chart on the right hand side and you look at where we are today even with a slight increase in 2022 you see we re at the level that is somewhere around 1 3 of what it used to be and then you can argue that the baseline was too high if you compare it to 2014 but the fact now is that we are running out of oil and gas we already see the results of that with the energy crisis in europe and there is a strong push now to make sure that we can produce more such that we can get over these kind of obstacles that we re faced with today and that means that we ve had 8 years of under investments and after 8 years of under investments you will see an increase and there could be a quite sharp increase in exploration investments and higher energy security concerns and we re not talking about temporary concerns we re talking about permanent concerns it s going to be here for a very long period of time we see improved success rate with success you re probably likely to take more risk in the future as well which is good so 2022 has actually been one of the best years for exploration success in many many years so we re glad to see all the discoveries that have been made but it s it doesn t really fill up the gap between supply and demand that is just growing bigger and bigger almost every day frontier is recovering we see that and i will come back to that when we talk about future licensing rounds but frontier is definitely back on the agenda it s taken longer than most people would expect i think most iocs are definitely getting more focused on certain basins than they used to but to replace some of the ioc activity you see nocs seeking international markets and you obviously see start ups and the smaller companies taking advantage of the strategies of the iocs and then last but not least gas is becoming more attractive so you see it pretty much all over the world now it used to be the way that you were always drilling for oil and if you were unlucky you would find gas now they re actually drilling actively for gas because that s really the core to replace some of the shortage that we have in the world today and also the very important mechanism to get rid of coal in the future the oil market is remaining tight i mean the oil price as you see on the left hand side has been quite volatile recently but it s still at a very very high level if someone told us 3 or 4 years ago that the oil price would be 95 then we would be slightly disappointed about that nobody would believe it but if you look on the right side now and you look at what eia expects in terms of stock build and draw for 2023 you see that they actually expect a net draw on reserves in 2023 which means that there is a very very strong backing now to keep the oil price high we ve seen how opec react we ve seen how shell reacts in the u s there s hardly any production growth or definitely a lower growth than most people would expect so we re quite confident that the oil market is going to remain tight and obviously that s a good foundation for our success and for future investments in seismic we talked a little bit about licensing round activity this is probably the busiest slide we ve shown since 2018 in terms of the number of licensing rounds coming up i ll touch on a few of them gulf of mexico i ve already talked about it s great news of course for a company like tgs we see the brazil permanent offer round that is opened in q4 we see round in suriname where we are or have been active in 2022 uruguay where tgs has a lot of data from the acquisition of spectrum we see europe of course with the apa round that had a surprising high number of companies participating we see africa which i m not going to touch more on i m just going to look at the list and say that the list is definitely longer than i ve seen in many many years which again means that africa has probably been the region where we see the highest year on year growth in terms of activity we think that s going to be the case for 2023 as well so when we get the budgets or the bottom up budgets over the next couple of weeks i would be surprised if i don t see a growth in africa that is probably more than 100 in terms of activity level we see a growing demand for obn data this is a fantastic slide i think we got it from magseis but it shows the activity level in 2020 so it s a total market revenue for obn globally in 2020 that s the one to the left and then you see 2021 where you see quite significant growth in the market to a level of 635 million and a sharp growth in 2022 obviously coming out of covid and more activity and more basins opening up and we see a sharp growth to the market size of about 800 million in 2022 the important thing here is that one or the column number 4 the bar number 4 where you see that about the same as the total revenue for the industry in 2022 has already been booked for or secured for 2023 so we re already at the level of 2022 even if we don t sign up any new obn contracts for 23 but the last bar is showing that that s a pipeline of unsecured opportunities that comes on top if we had capacity as an industry to take on that then you would see a solid portion of that build on top of the second bar from the right and you see now how tight that market is and how fast it s growing so this is a market that i know all of you have followed for quite some time and nobody has really been very profitable in this market but of course with the tightness that you see in the market now you can probably assume that rates will go up and you will see that companies really start to make money so we think that the timing of our entry into this market is really good and then on top of that we will have cost synergies we will have revenue synergies in terms of improving the utilization so we think this is an extremely exciting picture for tgs going forward so i promised to touch on the contract backlog and inflows so the backlog stands at about 225 million as we enter into 2024 you see or entering into q4 as you see from the pie chart you see that 20 of that is going to be booked in q4 and 45 is going to be booked in the first half of 2023 and another 35 is going to be booked in the second half of 2023 more importantly the contract inflow and you ve seen we ve taken a significant step up in terms of the order inflow this year compared to last year and we think that s going to continue also into 2023 so it looks really promising in terms of the activity level and i think when you add magseis on top of this we can be very optimistic entering into 2023 and 2024 so with that i m just going to touch on the highlights we re pleased about our results our late sales is about double of last year we see our total revenues and particularly the poc revenues are also about 100 up compared to last year we had a strong order inflow 140 million that s about 4 5x the amount that we had in q3 of last year we re pleased about the backlog and the backlog is more than double with the addition of magseis of course solid financial position we re extremely proud of the fact that we made 2 acquisitions with payment in cash and we still stay pretty close to 200 million at the end of the quarter quarterly dividend we continue to pay that we re delivering on our strategy pleased about the m as that we ve made we think the timing is good we think the strategy behind it is excellent and we see a market that continues to recover so with that i want to say thank you very much for your attention for all the people in the room but also people who follow us on webcast so with that i will have sven bã rre come and help me read the questions and help me answer some of them thank you very much question and answer session a kristian johansen john oliasen you have the first question please john olaisen a question on looking into 2023 over the last 10 years multi client investments have gone down roughly 70 in dollar terms and multi client investments is a in dollar terms is a good proxy for volume as well and if you look at late sales in 2022 for the industry as a whole it seems like well we still have q4 left of course but it looks like late sales is going to be up 100 or more for the year it s a big jump but my question now is for 2023 do you think the industry has enough multi client data to continue to see strong later growth into 2023 or does the industry need to do more multi client investments first because it s an interesting of course you could argue there s been some special fx in 2022 post covid some transfer fees etcetera and in fact consensus is expecting lower multi client late sales for the industry if you look at consensus for cgg pgs yourself for next year late sales are expected to come down so is consensus into something here is it because of investments have been too low and there s been too many special fx for the industry as a whole in 2022 or do you think there s room to grow late sales for the industry in 23 kristian johansen i would be extremely surprised and very disappointed if we see a lack of growth in 2023 we re obviously in the early days of setting our budgets for next year but as i said africa is looking significantly better brazil has not been particularly good this year we think we re going to see a rebound next year we re back to licensing rounds in the u s gulf of mexico in 2023 and i just feel very confident that we re going to see growth in late sales i can t talk on behalf of the entire industry but i think we have a library and the accounting value of the library doesn t really make sense in terms of we amortize it so heavily right now but we have so much data and you see pretty much anywhere where there is new activity or there is a discovery namibia is one example suriname is another example you re going to see that happening in 2023 as well and then guess what tgs will have data in that place anyway we have such a big database now with the spectrum and the ion and obviously the vintage database of tgs this quarter we had about 25 of our sales coming from fully written off data the ion data library which has i don t know the book value of the data library of ion but it s just a few tenants right i mean that library is in volume size it s about 1 4 of tgs so i mean there are so many opportunities and i think we have a tendency to underestimate the speed of the up cycle and we have the tendency to underestimate the speed of the down cycle as well when i look back at not only our estimates but pretty much all the estimates from back a year ago what we were expecting for 2022 i mean no one was saying that yes late sales is going to grow by 100 and if i said that at the presentation in q3 last year people would think i m stupid right or crazy and i m not going to say that we re going to grow another 100 but you always get surprised in this business when you have an up cycle it usually goes higher and steeper than most people expect john olaisen that s the history so it s a bit strange to see consensus estimates were down late sales down for the industry but on q4 of course the gulf of mexico is going to be potentially a big trigger for you say late sales in q4 how do the oil companies react so far is there any uncertainty about the march round are they holding back because they want to like to be more certain that it s actually coming or do you do the oil companies just have they started buying data already ahead of the march round kristian johansen yes i don t think i want to be specific on the latter part of the question but what i can say is that i don t none of the oil companies that i speak to personally have any doubt that it s going to be a lease sale and the data has been set and there is not much of an uncertainty around that side i don t think anyone is holding back because of that i think if people are holding back it s either because they have the data from before or that they have a tight budget but we don t think that s the case i mean if you look at what the budget is for an oil company for 2022 i mean they obviously underestimated their cash flow and they have more cash than they ve ever had and if we have the right data at the right place and now we have a trigger as well i m fairly optimistic about that john olaisen optimistic about kristian johansen about q4 and the gulf of mexico and activity around that not only tgs data but in general the activity level in front of the or ahead of the licensing round we think that s going to be pretty good john olaisen so is it right to assume that gulf of mexico is going to be the big swing factor for q4 or are there any other regions in general that could be a big swing factor positive or negative for you guys kristian johansen no i think we are hopeful that the gom is going to be a swing factor we think that when we saw the news although we expected some kind of news around it and we expected that there was going to be a round sometime in 2023 and i think we ve discussed that before i ve been fairly confident about that they re obviously getting that confirmation makes us more optimistic of course so yes i think gom is definitely going to be a driver i really hope that brazil is going to be a driver as well we re looking at a lot of new opportunities in brazil which not necessarily is going to move the needle for late sales in q4 but we see brazil definitely picking up as well and we have such a big database there that s going to be positive too so i think in general we were quite hopeful that we ve beaten last year by about 100 every quarter if you adjust for the transfer fee that we had in q2 so obviously q2 was better than 100 over but i don t see why we shouldn t be able to target there for q4 as well john olaisen there s more questions but i guess i could take them at the end if there s more time kristian johansen jorgen jã rgen andreas lande so just on your question in terms of the reversing the declining trend on the multi client book value for 2023 and onwards in just in terms of investments i guess it s fair to assume higher investments for next year but i think you also alluded to that magseis is kind of fully booked for 2023 so does that mean that your 2023 investment estimate will be no obn investments particularly strong growth in those investments for next year kristian johansen no you can probably assume that some of that booking that is behind magseis backlog is provided by tgs i guess so no i donâ t think thatâ s going to be a significant bottleneck for â 23 for us i think we have the capacity we need and weâ re obviously discussing that pretty much daily with magseis and obviously 3d providers as well and trying to secure capacity for 2023 and iâ m not afraid of seeing kind of an impact â negative impact on our investment level i donâ t think weâ re there at this point i think we have the capacity we need sven bã rre larsen we have already announced the amendment 2 obviously obn in gulf of mexico where we are using magseis which will be mostly executed in 2023 jã rgen andreas lande so is it too early to kind of give a rough split on obn versus traditional 3d in terms of investments for 2023 at this point kristian johansen yes it s probably too early to be specific on that but i think as sven bã rre has said i mean we ve already secured a magseis crew for the gom survey we hope that we can do another gom survey during the course of 23 probably like to be active in the north sea as well or norway u k so that s probably it in terms of multi client activity and then i mean there are partnership opportunities of course on top of that so i don t think capacity is going to be an issue in terms of meeting our own investment ambitions for next year but i don t want to reveal those ambitions yet jã rgen andreas lande just lastly here on pre funding pgs was out yesterday saying that 2022 has seen a positive shift towards multi client and they re expecting higher and quite high and strong prefunding for 2023 what s your view on that kristian johansen yes i mean first of all we see a shift from where most of our business used to be very frontier with very low funding and high risk and we see a shift a gradual shift back to when we ve seen that over the past few years where you have more converted contracts and obviously that requires higher pre funding because the overall sales multiple is lower and we target the same irr pretty much so i think in that regard yes we expect strong pre funding in 2023 we re probably and some of the discussions we have with our board right now is that given our outlook of the market and how we see things going forward we got to make sure that we take some risk too and we have the balance sheet to do that so we get pretty much a go ahead from the board to take those opportunities and in areas where you have proven success over time and you see that you have an underlying database that is promising then don t be afraid of taking some risk and take on some lower prefunded projects so i think we can see good mix in 2023 probably a bigger mix or a wider range that you saw in 21 and 22 where there was a majority of ilx projects in general funding is going to be at a very high level for sure sven bã rre larsen we have a few questions from online from christopher mollerlokken first he asks could you remind us how you define contract inflow yes it s simply all the dollar value of the aggregate dollar value of the contracts that we sign in a given period then he asks with q3 mc investments being a bit on the high side due to technicalities what would be a fair estimate for organic mc investments in q4 2022 of course there is still a bit of uncertainty not so much in terms of what projects we are going to work on in q4 but when the start up point and all of that will be whether it slips or whether we can push something forward and so on so there s still a bit of uncertainty but we re currently looking at close to or around 40 million for q4 investments and then we ll have to come back to that obviously in early february and then he asks how will you account for magseis in q4 so we will consolidate it 100 and then adjust the parts that for the parts that we do not own in as a minority interest and the way we re thinking now we will also consolidate it fully in the entire quarter yes there was a similar question from mike pickup in barclays about magseis consolidation so i guess that has been answered and that is it on the web any more questions from the room john john olaisen your backlog for multi client investments next year is 165 million is that correct 225x 65 if i get it correctly sven bã rre larsen yes john olaisen i just wonder the amendment 2 is that included 100 so i guess schlumberger still has the option to buy into that is â or am i wrong sven bã rre larsen yes so amendment 2 is at this stage a 100 tgs project yes john olaisen would tgs â sorry schlumberger has the option to buy into that kristian johansen they do but the way it works is that if they do and then we may be likely to buy and to trade into one of their service and overall i think our ambition is that we re going to be 50 50 partners overall so i think for the year i don t think that matters a lot john olaisen then on the high amortization i just wonder do you get a tax shield for all the amortization regardless of the definition of amortization sven bã rre larsen yes we should yes john olaisen so the p l amortization depreciation isâ sven bã rre larsen yes john olaisen also the tax depreciation and amortization sven bã rre larsen yes kristian johansen all right with that i want to say thank you very much to everyone who followed the q3 presentation and wish you come back and i hope to see you again in early 2022 when we have our q4 presentation at our capital markets day so thank you very much
