death a day later the nation s security would be breached and there would be a new threat that truly was a matter of life and death on that day two decades ago sen joseph r biden jr of delaware delivered a speech warning that america s role in the world was in danger of being undermined by washington s willingness to go it alone and its readiness to make unilateral decisions in what we perceive to be our own self interest a day later events would be set in motion in which the country was willing largely to go it alone and make unilateral military decisions on that day american warplanes attacked farms sheltering three surface to air missile sites 100 miles southeast of baghdad a day later those sites and other military installations throughout the country would be in fresh danger from a newly mobilized american military related 20 years since 9 11 museum launches fund so next generation never forgets related 20 years later will biden reveal saudi terror complicity to 9 11 families like mine on that day the leader of the last remaining opposition to the taliban ahmed shah massoud was killed in a suicide bombing an event that received only glancing attention though the penultimate paragraph of the new york times account warned that the likelihood the assassins were arabs gave credibility to who contend that foreigners including osama bin laden are playing an ever bigger decision making role among the taliban a day later bin laden would be a household name and the fate of the taliban would become an american obsession that would extend to this day on that day donald j trump sat with sarah jessica parker and monica lewinsky in the front row of a marc jacobs fashion show on manhattan s far west side the next day he would do a live telephone interview on a new york television show and say of his 71 story building at 44 wall street not far from the collapsed twin towers now it s the tallest on that day americans were preoccupied with the bare female shoulders and backs in fashion styles inspired by britney spears even as macy s was selling sweater coats for 34 99 for the fall season a day later americans would be fearful of going shopping and the

it s 3 a m and after five days plying through the high seas the ocean warrior is surrounded by an atoll of blazing lights that overtakes the nighttime sky welcome to the party said third officer filippo marini as the spectacle floods the ship s bridge and interrupts his overnight watch it s the conservationists first glimpse of the world s largest fishing fleet an armada of nearly 300 chinese vessels that have sailed halfway across the globe to lure the elusive humboldt squid from the pacific ocean s inky depths as italian hip hop blares across the bridge marini furiously scribbles the electronic ids of 37 fishing vessels that pop up as green triangles on the ocean warrior s radar onto a sheet of paper before they disappear immediately he detects a number of red flags two of the boats have gone dark their mandatory tracking device that gives a ship s position switched off still others are broadcasting two different radio numbers a sign of possible tampering the associated press with spanish language broadcaster univision accompanied the ocean warrior this summer on an 18 day voyage to observe up close for the first time the chinese distant water fishing fleet on the high seas off south america the vigilante patrol was prompted by an international outcry last summer when hundreds of chinese vessels were discovered fishing for squid near the long isolated galapagos islands a unesco world heritage site that inspired 19th century naturalist charles darwin and is home to some of the world s most endangered species from giant tortoises to hammerhead sharks china s deployment to this remote expanse is no accident decades of overfishing have pushed its overseas fleet the world s largest ever farther from home officially capped at 3 000 vessels the fleet might actually consist of thousands more keeping such a sizable flotilla at sea sometimes for years at a time is at once a technical feat made possible through billions in state subsidies and a source of national pride akin to what the u s space program was for generations of americans beijing says it has zero tolerance for illegal fishing and points to recent actions such as a temporary moratorium on high seas squid fishing as evidence of its environmental stewardship those now criticizing china including the u s and europe for decades raided the oceans themselves but the sheer size of the chinese fleet and its recent arrival to the americas has stirred fears that it could exhaust marine stocks there s also concern that in the absence of effective controls illegal fishing will soar the u s coast guard recently declared that illegal fishing had replaced piracy as its top maritime security threat meanwhile activists are seeking restrictions on fishing as part of negotiations underway on a first ever high seas treaty which could dramatically boost international cooperation on the traditionally lawless waters that comprise nearly half of the planet of the 30 vessels the ap observed up close 24 had a history of labor abuse accusations past convictions for illegal fishing or showed signs of possibly violating maritime law collectively these issues underscore how the open ocean around the americas where the u s has long dominated and china is jockeying for influence have become a magnet for the seafood industry s worst offenders specifically 16 ships either sailed with their mandatory safety transponders turned off broadcast multiple electronic ids or transmitted information that didn t match its listed name or location discrepancies that are often associated with illegal fishing although the ap saw no evidence that they were engaged in illicit activity six ships were owned by companies accused of forced labor including one vessel the chang tai 802 whose indonesian crew said they had been stuck at sea for years another nine ships face accusations of illegal fishing elsewhere in the world while one giant fuel tanker servicing the fleet the ocean ruby is operated by the affiliate of a company suspected of selling fuel to north korea in violation of united nations sanctions yet another the fu yuan yu 7880 is operated by an affiliate of a nasdaq traded company pingtan marine enterprise whose chinese executives had their u s visas cancelled for alleged links to human trafficking beijing is exporting its overfishing problem to south america said captain peter hammarstedt director of campaigns for sea shepherd a netherlands based ocean conservation group that operates nine well equipped vessels including the ocean warrior china is chiefly responsible for the plunder of shark and tuna in asia says hammarstedt who organized the high seas campaign called operation distant water after watching how illegal chinese vessels ravaged poor fishing villages in west africa with that track record are we really supposed to believe they will manage this new fishery responsibly wild west the roar of the mechanical jiggers pulling the catch from the ocean s depths can be heard hundreds of feet away before you come upon the floating slaughterhouse the stench too as the highly aggressive squid blow their ink sacs in one final futile effort to avoid their inexorable fate by all accounts the humboldt squid named for the nutrient rich current found off the southwest coast of south america is one of the most abundant marine species some scientists believe their numbers may even be thriving as the oceans warm and their natural predators sharks and tuna are fished out of existence but biologists say they ve never faced a threat like the explosion of industrial chinese fishing off south america the number of chinese flagged vessels in the south pacific has surged 10 fold from 54 active vessels in 2009 to 557 in 2020 according to the south pacific regional fisheries management organization or sprfmo an inter governmental group of 15 members charged with ensuring the conservation and sustainable fishing of the species meanwhile the size of its catch has grown from 70 000 tons in 2009 to 358 000 fishing takes place almost exclusively at night when each ship turns on hundreds of lights as powerful as anything at a stadium to attract swarms of the fast flying squid the concentration of lights is so intense it can be seen from space on satellite images that show the massive fleet shining as brightly as major cities hundreds of miles away on land it really is like the wild west said hammarstedt nobody is responsible for enforcement out there experts warn that even a naturally bountiful species like squid is vulnerable to overfishing although it s unknown how many humboldt squid remain they point to past disappearance of squid stocks in argentina mexico and japan as cause for concern if you have a vast resource and it s easy to take then it s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that this is limitless that it s just stars in the sky said william gilly a stanford university marine biologist if humanity puts its mind to it there s no limit to the damage we can do gilly said squid are also a key barometer of marine environments a biological conveyor belt transporting energy from tiny carbon absorbing plankton to longer living predators like sharks and tuna and ultimately human beings the people who fish squid are happy said daniel pauly a prominent marine biologist who in the 1990s coined the phrase fishing down the food web to describe how previously spurned chum were replacing bigger fish on dinner plates but this is part of the gradual degradation of the ocean dark fleet for dozens of chinese ships the journey to the warm equatorial waters near the galapagos began months earlier on the opposite side of south america where every austral summer between november and march hundreds of foreign flagged jiggers scoop up untold amounts of shortfin squid in one of the world s largest unregulated fishing grounds the plunderer s paradise lies between argentina s maritime border and the british held falkland islands in a jamaica sized no man s land where fishing licenses catch limits and oversight are non existent between november 2020 and may 2021 a total of 523 mostly chinese fishing vessels 35 more than the previous season were detected just beyond the boundary of argentina s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone according to satellite data analyzed by windward a maritime intelligence firm of that amount 42 had turned off at least once their safety transponders meanwhile 188 of those same vessels showed up near the galapagos including 14 chinese vessels that went offline in both oceans for an average 34 hours each time it s impossible to know what the ships did while they were dark however sometimes ships turn off their tracking systems to avoid detection while carrying out illicit activities argentine authorities over the years have spotted numerous chinese vessels off the grid fishing illegally in its waters once even firing shots into and sinking a trawler that tried to ram its pursuer near a whale breeding ground under a united nations maritime treaty to which china is a signatory large ships are required to continuously use what s known as an automated identification system or ais to avoid collisions switching it off except in cases of an imminent threat for example hiding from pirates is a major breach that should lead to sanctions for a vessel and its owner under the law of the nation to which it is flagged but china until now appears to have done little to reign in its distant water fleet the chinese fleet is able to fish for sometimes years at a time because they can offload their catch at sea into a network of giant refrigerated vessels or reefers capable of hauling more than 15 000 cubic meters of fish enough to fill six olympic sized pools to port giant tankers provide cheap fuel heavily subsidized by the chinese government adding to the environmental burden the 12 reefers active in the pacific this past july as the ocean warrior was patrolling nearby had at least 196 encounters with fishing vessels during that period according to satellite data analyzed by global fishing watch a group that supports sustainable fishing nearly 11 of total u s seafood imports in 2019 worth 2 4 billion came from illegal unreported and unregulated fishing according to the u s international trade commission a federal agency outside the u s the problem is believed to be even worse we don t know if things are getting better or worse said boris worm a marine biologist at dalhousie university in halifax canada it basically comes down to who you believe fishy business in the seascape of the world s oceans pingtan marine and its affiliates have left in their wake accusations of illegal fishing by authorities in places as diverse as south africa timor leste ecuador and indonesia but the company is not some rogue outfit it boasts china s second largest overseas fleet trades shares on the u s nasdaq and in its home port of fuzhou across from taiwan is helping build one of the world s largest fish factories the company s chairman and ceo zhou xinrong appears to have built the fishing empire through massive state loans generous subsidies and communist party connections it s not just a fishing company it s practically a chinese government asset said susi pudjiastuti who as indonesia s former fishing minister between 2014 and 2019 was lionized by conservationists for destroying hundreds of illegal foreign fishing vessels fifty seven of pingtan s ships including three refrigerated carrier vessels all of them owned directly or through an affiliate were registered by china in the past few years to fish in the south pacific according to c4ads a washington based think tank that last year authored a report on illegal fishing pingtan in its last earnings report almost a year ago said that it had 280 million in outstanding loans from the china development bank and other state lenders one of the country s biggest state investment funds owns an 8 stake in one of its subsidiaries meanwhile chinese state subsidies to pingtan for the building of vessels totaled 29 million in the first nine months of last year about a third of all its purchases of property and equipment as part of pudjiastuti s crackdown vessels operated by two pingtan affiliates in indonesia had their licenses revoked for a slew of alleged offenses ranging from falsifying catch reports illegal transshipments and the smuggling of endangered species those affiliates pt avona mina lestari and pt dwikarya reksa abad are managed or partly owned by members of zhou s immediate family pingtan disclosed in filings with the u s securities and exchange commission crew members of one vessel told authorities they had been gang beaten hit on their heads with a piece of steel and subjected to torture by their chinese supervisors according to an indonesian court ruling upholding the ban on the pingtan affiliate a panama flagged carrier vessel the hai fa whose listed owner is a different pingtan affiliate based in hong kong was seized in 2014 with 900 tons of illegally caught fish including endangered shark species a lenient court later released the vessel from custody after it paid a 15 000 fine an entity majority owned by zhou s wife also operates the fu yuan yu leng 999 which was caught in 2017 transiting through the galapagos marine reserve with more than 6 000 dead sharks on board another pingtan affiliated vessel spotted by ap the fu yuan yu 7880 was arrested by south africa in 2016 after it tried to flee a naval patrol that suspected it of illegal squid fishing the ship s officers were found guilty of possessing illegal gear and disobeying a maritime authority but were released after paying a fine the more you learn about these vessels and equipment the harder it is to sleep at night said pudjiastuti these south americans should wake up as early as possible pingtan didn t answer a detailed list of questions pingtan doesn t answer questions raised by the media the company said in an e mail as scandal has followed pingtan and its affiliates around the world investors have dumped the company s stock in june nasdaq sent notice that it would delist the company unless its share price which has tumbled nearly 80 the last two years crawls back above a minimum 1 threshold soon the threat of delisting followed the abrupt resignation of the company s independent auditor which warned about pingtan s ability to continue doing business pingtan told the sec that its failure to file any quarterly reports for nearly a year was due to a material weakness in its ability to conform with u s accounting practices one decision that pingtan has also not commented on is the surprise u s sanction of its top executives two u s officials said that ceo zhou xinrong and his wife were among the 15 individuals who had their visas cancelled last year for being complicit in illegal fishing and human trafficking the decision taken in the waning days of the trump administration was the first of its kind specifically targeting abuse in the fishing industry the two officials said on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations bullying china criticism of china s distant water fishing fleet has spurred some reform last year china imposed stricter penalties on companies caught breaking the rules including manipulating their transceivers they ve also boosted reporting requirements for transshipments on the high seas banned blacklisted vessels from entering chinese ports and ordered off season moratoriums on squid fishing in the high seas near argentina and ecuador the measures while far from a panacea nonetheless mark a giant leap for the world s largest consumer and producer of fish products i used to go to conference and officials would be in just complete denial said tabitha mallory a china scholar at the university of washington who specializes in the country s fishing policies at least now they re acknowledging that their fishing is unsustainable even if it s just to counter all the negative pushback they re getting around the world china s foreign ministry the bureau of fisheries and the china overseas fisheries association an industry group didn t respond to multiple requests for an interview nor a detailed list of questions china s distant water fishing fleet launched in the 1980s as a response to depleting fish stocks at home and the need to feed its fast growing population but it s evolved into a thriving industry and an important part of china s geopolitical push to secure access to the world s dwindling natural resources says mallory in the eastern city of zhoushan home to china s largest distant water fleet an ultramodern squid museum opened this year that allows visitors to follow the squid on a sanitized adventure filled 3d journey from the ocean depths to the giant jiggers and their eventual processing back at home into squid rings researcher pauly believes that much of the criticism of the chinese fleet s fishing around the galapagos is attributed to growing anti china sentiment in the u s and sensitivities about beijing s growing presence in what has traditionally been considered washington s backyard he said imposing restrictions on high seas fishing something that could be discussed as part of the negotiations over a high seas treaty would be a more effective way to curtail china s activities than bullying china doesn t do anything that europe has not done exactly the same way said pauly the difference is that everything china does is big so you see it china s stonewalling seafood companies in the u s have started to take note of the risks posed by china s expansion and are seeking to leverage their market power to bring more transparency to the sourcing of squid this year a group of 16 importers and producers banded together to devise a common strategy to root out abuse much of their focus is on china which is responsible for around half of the 314 million in squid that the u s imported in 2019 the bulk served up as fried calamari in restaurants the initiative is opening something of a pandora s box for an industry that until now has thrived in the shadows without a lot of attention focused on its supply chains the bulk of china s squid harvest comes from the high seas where there s little in the way of controls like there is in many coastal waters right now it s the perfect situation for would be violators said alfonso miranda executive director of calamasur a group made up of squid industry representatives from mexico chile peru and ecuador you can do whatever you want even forced labor nobody says anything and you still have a market for your product one alternative is to deploy technology like publicly available ais tracking data to allow consumers to eventually identify the very vessel its owner fishing history and precise location that caught the fish in that way the seafood industry can catch up with other manufacturers from meat producers to the garment trade where such practices are more common the keyword is traceability said ambassador jean manes the top civilian at u s southern command in miami when consumers insist on traceability the market responds however boosting transparency is a challenge the industry has grappled with for decades nobody knows for sure how much china is fishing on the high seas meanwhile critics say regional fishing management organizations that operate on the basis of consensus are powerless to block china from registering vessels with links to illegal fishing and abuse case and point the hua li 8 which was greenlighted by china to fish in the south pacific in 2018 two years after it was the target of an international manhunt when it fled warning shots fired by an argentine naval vessel that had caught it fishing illegally four of the hua li 8 s crew members were treated like slaves indonesian officials said at the time of the ship s arrest pursuant to an interpol purple notice the ship again was involved in suspicious fishing activity in 2019 this time in the western hemisphere when it went dark for 80 hours as it was fishing along the edge of peru s exclusive economic zone at the same time as the ship was offline vessel movements were detected inside peru s waters nighttime satellite data analyzed by global fishing watch shows craig loveridge executive secretary of the sprfmo declined requests for interviews but in an e mail he pointed out that it s up to each member to take into account the history of fishing operators when deciding whether or not to authorize a vessel to fly its flag to address concerns several south american governments proposed at this year s sprfmo meeting a number of conservation measures already in place elsewhere ideas included banning transshipments at sea allowing countries to board other member states vessels on the high seas and creating a buffer zone so coastal states are automatically alerted whenever a foreign vessel comes within 12 nautical miles of its territorial waters but each proposal was shot down by china miranda said china doesn t really seem interested in expanding protection said mallory they follow the letter of the law but not the spirit moreover once the catch is landed in china or a warehouse anywhere it s impossible to discern between legal and illegally caught fish this is the black hole and having clarity there is really complex said miranda there are many things that can be done but you need to rely on credible data which right now is lacking alone at sea in the absence of more robust monitoring the ocean warrior is something of a high seas sheriff holding bad actors responsible but it s surrounded by dozens of chinese vessels accustomed to operating with little fear of reprisal as the sun prepares to set and the chinese squid fleet awakens in time for another night of fishing the ocean warrior s crew sets out on a dinghy to inspect up close the chang tai 802 the ship is one of 39 vessels suspected of forced labor in a may 2021 report by greenpeace based on complaints by workers to indonesian authorities six shirtless men all of them indonesian gather on the chang tai s stern gesturing friendlily and looking comforted to see another human being so far from land but the mood quickly turns when one man who the ap isn t identifying by name out of concern for his safety shouts above the engine that his boss is not nice and asks with only the foggiest of comprehension whether the coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged the world has arrived in the u s i m stuck here he says with a sullen look before a visibly irritated chinese supervisor appears and orders the men back to work i want to go home a day later when the ocean warrior returns with a megaphone to facilitate the open water exchange the chinese supervisor moves quickly to block any talk with the english speaking strangers but as the chang tai pulls away the man throws overboard a plastic bottle stuffed with his brother s phone number scribbled on a piece of paper reached back home in indonesia the relative confesses to knowing precious little about how his brother was recruited or the conditions of his employment since leaving home three years ago after graduating from a vocational school with few other job prospects he s communicated with his family only sporadically he nonetheless worries for his brother s wellbeing to the point that he recently pressed the agency that hired him to bring him back the greenpeace report cites a complaint by another anonymous indonesian sailor on the same ship who while ill with kidney pain due to drinking poorly treated seawater was forced to sign a document or risk being marooned in peru with no travel documents i hope he can come back soon says the man s brother hesitant to reveal too much out of fear it could compromise someone s safety and i hope he s always healthy

dear earthtalk can the american lobster fishermen survive new restrictions on their activities thanks to the endangered species listing of the atlantic right whale a n smith bourne ma for centuries north atlantic right whales were aggressively hunted for their meat and their oil which was used to keep lamps lit and to make soap these iconic 50 foot long dark blue and white whales were even named the right whale to hunt as they were often found near the shore can only swim slowly six miles per hour and float when killed but by the early 1900s they had become a rare sight and in 1935 the league of nations a precursor to the united nations banned hunting them but the population failed to rebound and in 1970 the u s added the northern right whale to its new endangered species list despite these protections only 400 remain and human interactions still present the greatest threat with entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes the leading causes of mortality since 2017 the national oceanic and atmospheric association noaa has documented 34 dead whales 21 in canada 13 in the u s and 16 whales with serious injuries from entanglements or vessel strikes in an attempt to conserve and rebuild the population noaa announced new regulations in august 2021 on the maine lobster and jonah crab industries including the closure of large parts of the gulf of maine to lobstering between october and january and requiring more traps per trawl to reduce the overall number of lines in the water not surprisingly the fishing industry isn t happy this is incredulous says crystal canney executive director of protect maine s fishing heritage foundation pmfhf the whale deaths are not in maine at the hands of maine lobstermen instead of saving right whales what this decision has done is endanger not only the livelihoods of many of our lobstermen and women but also their lives she adds the maine lobstermen s association mla is also apprehensive about the new regulations in a statement the group maintains that a historic number of right whales have died in canadian waters over the past five years and yet canada has not implemented protections comparable to the u s furthermore the latest scientific evidence points to a change in right whale migration patterns away from maine waters and into canada and other areas according to noaa fisheries the maine lobster industry has not had a documented entanglement with a north atlantic right whale in over 17 years and has never been known to kill or seriously injure a right whale notes the mla s patrice mccarron she adds that noaa s new regulations are just the first round of economic impacts and that future restrictions will likely destroy maine s iconic lobster fishery meanwhile environmental advocacy group oceana says the new rules don t go far enough stressing that potentially fatal entanglements are still likely particularly for juveniles the fastest growing segment of the right whale population contacts noaa fisheries announces new lobster and jonah crab fisheries regulations to help save endangered north atlantic right whales fisheries noaa gov media release noaa fisheries announces new lobster and jonah crab fisheries regulations help save feds release final regulations that fail to protect north atlantic right whales from deadly fishing gear entanglements usa oceana org press releases feds release final regulations fail protect north atlantic right whales deadly pmfhf statement on the noaa decision protectmaine com pmfhf news pmfhf statement on the noaa decision earthtalk is produced by roddy scheer doug moss for the 501 c 3 nonprofit earthtalk see more at emagazine com to donate visit earthtalk org send questions to

argentines take to the polls on september 12 in a paso primary vote that will measure the political strength of the federal peronist government and the opposition ahead of midterm elections on november 14 this guide will help you navigate what to watch closely on sunday 1 what s at stake in the election on the november ballot half of the seats in the lower house chamber of deputies and a third of the senate are up for grabs in a broader sense sunday s primary vote serves as an informal referendum for president alberto fernández and his left wing coalition s first two years in office it could also provide some early signals into the 2023 presidential race buenos aires city mayor horacio rodríguez larreta a key figure in the opposition is seen as a likely presidential candidate in two years and his top deputy diego santilli is on the ballot in buenos aires province since voting in the primary is mandatory it acts as a big opinion poll ahead of the final midterm vote 2 what are the main differences between the two main coalitions despite an array of parties running in the primaries argentines are largely split between fernández s populist coalition frente de todos and the more investor friendly opposition juntos por el cambio fernández s government never gained credibility in the eyes of foreign investors after a series of anti business decisions including defaulting on its dollar debt and tightening capital controls the opposition led by protégés of former president mauricio macri aims to open up the country to foreign investment and trade though macri failed to manage the economy well during his time in office 3 why are there so few public polls ahead of the vote pollsters are shying away from publicly predicting voters intentions after a nightmarish experience during the last primary vote in august 2019 ahead of presidential elections back then many pollsters suggested macri would lose the primary to fernández by no more than five percentage points a gap he could conceivably recover in the final vote but instead he lost by 16 points triggering a mass selloff of argentine assets the peso lost 18 percent of its value just in the week after that primary macri blamed the pollsters for getting it wrong equities seem to be pricing a technical tie in buenos aires province how likely is that that s the average of all polls roughly how reliable are them not much as pollsters must contend with sanitary restrictions in their already challenging job said pablo waldman head of strategy at stonex argentina 4 what are the key races to watch the two key races are in buenos aires city and buenos aires province home to almost 40 percent of the population in the province fernández s ally victoria tolosa paz leads the government s candidates for the lower house chamber of deputies the main opposition coalition has two candidates in that primary santilli and facundo manes who are both promising to support the other after sunday s vote in the capital opposition leader maría eugenia vidal is competing against an array of candidates including libertarian economist javier milei whose bombastic style has won over some voters 5 how will the midterms impact argentina s negotiations with the imf argentina owes the international monetary fund us 45 billion stemming from an agreement granted to macri s government in 2018 that failed to stabilise the economy negotiations to restructure the deal have not made concrete progress since fernández took office with a disastrous history between the imf and argentina the midterms have become a political hurdle for the president before he can consider a new agreement with the washington organisation analysts also note that if the ruling coalition doesn t perform well it could jeopardise the job security of economy minister martín guzmán who is leading talks 6 how will covid 19 affect the vote more than 17 500 voting centres will open nationwide at 8am local time but first results aren t expected until 11pm as special measures related to covid 19 could delay vote counting participation levels are historically lower in primaries compared to general elections as some voters skip the task despite being mandatory we expect a lower participation rate in this primary because some people might choose not to go to voting centers due to covid said jimena blanco director of latin america research at consulting firm verisk maplecroft federal judges have also ruled that people with covid 19 symptoms or close contacts to positive cases can t go to the voting centres 7 how are markets expected to react the s p merval argentina s stock index has extended gains this month amid growing signs that fernández s frente de todos coalition is losing ground investors would cheer if the ruling coalition looses or shows a poor performance especially in buenos aires province but in the short term an open question remains whether an election loss would force the peronist leader to be more pragmatic or instead double down on unorthodox measures to rile up his base we are skewed to believe the latter is to dominate if so we would entertain more of a rocky negotiation with the imf says diego pereira latin america economist at jp morgan chase and co by jorgelina do rosario patrick gillespie bloomberg

fed exec brings national view adam jones says perhaps his career in economics was preordained my parents think i was born to be an economist because i ve been doing marginal benefit marginal cost analyses forever he said with a laugh when i was a kid we d all be standing around in the kitchen and i would be thinking if i make this smart comment about my dad i m going to get smacked is it worth it yep smack worth it jones chair of the department of economics finance at the university of north carolina wilmington also serves as the university s regional economist he will present his analysis of the area s economy during the economic outlook a time for agility talk at the oct 7 wilmingtonbiz conference expo where he will look at economic prospects partly through a cost benefit lens take the pandemic s effect on the economy for example the way i m thinking about the current situation is that it s like taking a drug if you re ill he said there s the benefit in that it treats your symptoms but there are side effects costs we as a country took the drug we injected a lot of stimulus into the economy we dropped interest rates as low as we can get them we increased unemployment benefits there s still a lot of pain from that but also side effects and we re seeing that in the labor shortage there s still a lot of fear of the virus as of early august 2 5 million people were not working because of that fear and that has popped up a little bit because of the delta variant there is the runup in the stock market which has given mental security and perhaps the option of retirement making major changes in life such as retiring or changing careers are not free jones continued but increases in the value of assets such as real property and investment portfolios created an opportunity to cover those costs additionally unemployment stimulus checks provided more opportunities for the people who received them enough assistance has been given that hopefully lets them think about options they may re enter the workforce at different places especially those who were in the leisure and hospitality industries i think that will be in the long run the silver lining of this jones said jones enjoys reflecting on big picture and small picture economic questions in college he shed a potential major in math when he was faced with a course on imaginary numbers whose title he couldn t even fathom he dropped the idea of a physics major when he had to spend a sunny afternoon in the lab processing an experiment whose outcome he already knew that left me with economics the value of that was i could study for it while i was out riding my bicycle he said i would bounce around in my brain until the aha moment arrived it s no wonder that jones liked a field of study that he could ponder while cycling there s a long bicycle path winding its way through jones formative years and his career participating in bike rallies as a youth provided a way to see parts of the country far from his home in houston when he joined the cycling club in his college town of sherman texas he met the city s economic development director a fellow cyclist he offered me an internship working two hours a day one hour of which would be going to lunch with jones said i ended up doing a lot more work that work gave jones experience and led to his first job out of college as

views on development policies and opportunities after the chamber s attempt to establish a community college in the county for which they had the funds and land was vetoed by the county commissioners

series of bicycle races he recalled we were driving all over the state on weekends and we were on the north side of atlanta one weekend my wife was talking with a man at the race telling him my plans and he told her i should apply to the university of georgia that he controlled the largest ph d scholarship fund in the economics department he figured that as a bike race organizer i could finish a

fed exec brings national view adam jones says perhaps his career in economics was preordained my parents think i was born to be an economist because i ve been doing marginal benefit marginal cost analyses forever he said with a laugh when i was a kid we d all be standing around in the kitchen and i would be thinking if i make this smart comment about my dad i m going to get smacked is it worth it yep smack worth it jones chair of the department of economics finance at the university of north carolina wilmington also serves as the university s regional economist he will present his analysis of the area s economy during the economic outlook a time for agility talk at the oct 7 wilmingtonbiz conference expo where he will look at economic prospects partly through a cost benefit lens take the pandemic s effect on the economy for example the way i m thinking about the current situation is that it s like taking a drug if you re ill he said there s the benefit in that it treats your symptoms but there are side effects costs we as a country took the drug we injected a lot of stimulus into the economy we dropped interest rates as low as we can get them we increased unemployment benefits there s still a lot of pain from that but also side effects and we re seeing that in the labor shortage there s still a lot of fear of the virus as of early august 2 5 million people were not working because of that fear and that has popped up a little bit because of the delta variant there is the runup in the stock market which has given mental security and perhaps the option of retirement making major changes in life such as retiring or changing careers are not free jones continued but increases in the value of assets such as real property and investment portfolios created an opportunity to cover those costs additionally unemployment stimulus checks provided more opportunities for the people who received them enough assistance has been given that hopefully lets them think about options they may re enter the workforce at different places especially those who were in the leisure and hospitality industries i think that will be in the long run the silver lining of this jones said jones enjoys reflecting on big picture and small picture economic questions in college he shed a potential major in math when he was faced with a course on imaginary numbers whose

one recent thursday ciara brown a junior at fox tech high school in san antonio stepped up to a small white table pulled down her face mask and took a test that is still far from standard in u s schools a cotton swab up the nose testing is supereasy she said it s not as scary as i thought it would be it s not a huge thing going up in your brain the united states has struggled with covid testing since the earliest days of the pandemic now nearly two years in and weeks into another covid disrupted school year school systems across the nation are struggling with the role of testing in keeping children safe and in class some like brown s in texas have gone all in others offer no covid testing at all and still others say they want to do more testing but lack the resources or have been tripped up by obstacles and delays the numerous school districts in the san antonio area reflect the nation s political rifts some districts have adopted multiple precautions including testing to shield themselves from the virus some have few defenses even as the worst of the early testing supply shortages have eased and states have received federal money including 10 billion from the american rescue plan to implement school based covid testing programs many school districts are still foundering there is just a lot more to testing than just swabbing a nose or spitting in a test tube said dr laura faherty a pediatrician and researcher at the rand corp who has studied school based covid testing a range of tests in texas ciara brown a junior at fox tech high school has two immunocompromised family members i wouldn t be able to live with myself knowing that if they got covid it was because of me she said school systems like brown s that have managed to establish large scale testing programs are a case study in how much effort is involved san antonio independent school district offers weekly testing to every student and staff member a commitment that requires proctors to collect nasal swabs on area campuses three days a week a single collection event can take hours but the program a partnership with the nonprofit community labs is largely voluntary and despite the district s efforts many families have not enrolled about 30 of students are participating brown who has two immunocompromised family members was eager to sign up i wouldn t be able to live with myself knowing that if they got covid it was because of me she said knowing that i can keep them safe myself safe friends even strangers safe is all that i really care about but in the boerne independent school district where masks are optional testing is also optional and only available in the campus clinic by appointment while the district says that anyone who is sick should not come to school symptomatic people will not be referred for testing or even sent home unless they are unable to participate in instruction dr heather riebel a pediatric cardiologist who has treated covid patients said she has been so careful not to bring the virus home now she worries her children may be more likely to contract it at school students from the advanced learning academy and fox tech high school waited to take covid tests provided by community labs a non profit that has partnered with the san antonio independent school district she has already pulled her fifth grader out of school once this fall after he was exposed five times in one week to students infected with the virus it s extremely disheartening riebel said district officials did not respond to numerous interview requests elsewhere in san antonio the northside independent school district has taken a middle ground rapid testing students and staff members who are symptomatic although students can only be tested if parents consent superintendent brian woods has not ruled out the possibility of larger scale screening if cases spike but the district faces severe staffing shortages making it difficult to scale up testing right now we re not at that point yet he said the district is doing contact tracing but the rollout has been bumpy one elementary school can consult cafeteria cameras to help identify students close contacts but they were not working on the day that andrea ochoa s 10 year old daughter ate lunch with a student who later tested positive ochoa who has autoimmune issues only found out about the exposure the following week from her daughter i m not upset that a child got sick ochoa said but i don t want gossip between little kids to be the way us parents figure out how to advocate for our children policy patchwork san antonio is a microcosm of the patchwork of programs at schools across the country even as the federal government invests more resources in testing while some of the logistics are getting easier there s a pretty fragmented approach from school district to school district as to whether and how testing is being used faherty said in illinois all public schools outside chicago are eligible for free shield testing weekly saliva tests developed by the university of illinois at urbana champaign but neighboring iowa turned down the 95 million it was allocated for testing under the american rescue plan the state s department of education says other resources are available for schools some districts are distributing take home test kits which are available at no cost from the state laboratory even in states with coordinated programs participation can be spotty as of sept 21 just 24 of virginia s public school divisions had signed up for its federally funded testing program which provides regular pooled pcr testing and access to at home test kits elsewhere the late summer spike of cases has left schools scrambling it s a matter of playing catch up said dr richard besser president of the robert wood johnson foundation and the former acting director of the centers for disease control and prevention you can t ask schools to implement broad based testing protocols once the school year has already started when there aren t the supplies and the personnel and the logistics in place illinois shield program was bombarded by last minute sign ups as of sept 21 43 of participating public schools opted in after aug 23 a shield representative said the program takes three to six weeks to launch several weeks into the school year most participating schools have not yet started testing chicago public schools has its own repeatedly delayed program the district initially said weekly screening would be available to every student when schools opened aug 30 the district now says the program will be fully operational by the end of september attributing the delay to the need to conduct background checks on the testing company s employees local parents have expressed frustration about shifting timelines and slow updates there is no clear line of communication said debora land who has a high school sophomore in the district and is a parent representative on her local school council parents have been asking what s your plan what s your plan what s your plan as of sept 17 just 3 of students had enrolled in the testing program the district said in new orleans the district has actively encouraged families to enroll in its weekly pcr testing program offering multilingual online sign ups and enrolling in a state run program that pays students to get covid tests said district spokesperson richard rainey but local schools have had to weather both delta and ida a category 4 hurricane that knocked out the city s power temporarily closed public schools and suspended testing we pivoted quickly after the storm passed to restart the regimen within a week rainey said it takes a village students and faculty waited for testing at brandeis elementary school in louisville ky last month the rising demand for testing has also strained supplies in fresno california the school district has been unable to replenish its stock of rapid antigen tests and has had to cut back on its testing of student athletes as a result but the biggest challenge many schools face is staffing berkeley unified school district used state money to hire seven people to staff its covid testing team and then dipped into its own coffers to hire 14 more for many districts in lower income communities that kind of financial outlay may be impossible we need to make sure the resources are there in particular in the communities that have been hit the hardest besser said protocols that work when transmission rates are low can become unsustainable when rates rise alachua county florida allows quarantined students to return to school early if they test negative for the virus on the fifth day of their quarantine during the worst of the august surge nurses at some schools were testing as many as 40 50 quarantined students every morning schools had to hope that no one needed medical attention during the hour or two it could take to test all those students said superintendent carlee simon like a kid doesn t have an asthma attack or you know anybody needs an epipen she added our nurses had a full time job before covid now covid is a job the workload has eased but in the first month of school 15 nurses quit in grapevine texas the school district s testing center saw so much demand in early september that appointments were booked up days in advance amy taldo who runs the site said she lacked the staff to expand i need an army she said finding a way forward sebastian sanchez a student at advanced learning academy in san antonio returned his test to a community labs staff member and testing is only the first step in san antonio independent when students or employees test positive a brigade of nurses conducts a laborious contact tracing protocol to identify the close contacts of a single high school student lynn carpenter a district nurse asks all their teachers for detailed seating charts i ve got to know are they at desks are they at tables how far apart are the tables she said if the student is an athlete coaches get calls too with questions about practices and games it just kind of mushrooms out she said carpenter who works from a windowless bare walled office sometimes needs several days to complete a single case she has had calls with seriously ill staff members some of whom broke down in tears it s a heart wrenching job she said a vaccine for children ages 5 11 could be authorized as soon as next month further protecting elementary schools but even then it could be months until most young children are vaccinated and many may never get the shots besser said so schools are forging ahead with what they have limited staffing and limited time i think it s a very worthwhile thing that we re doing carpenter said i m just looking forward to that day when this is behind us and i can go home this article originally appeared in the new york times c 2021 the new york times company

conditions report southeast colorado arkansas river leadville to buena vista as of 9 22 2021 braden baker with ark anglers writes the upper arkansas is in great shape and with a much cooler forecast in the next couple of weeks our northern fish will have a very comfortable environment as we head into the fall hayden meadows is still the most wadeable section of the arkansas though now that the voluntary flow management program has ended more of the river below the lake creek confluence will offer easier wading access the low clear flows in hayden meadows can make for more technical fishing and spookier fish so be very thoughtful in your approach nighttime cold may make for slow mornings near leadville but mid day and afternoon is still fishing well this far north this area is seeing a fair amount of pressure so be very courteous to fellow anglers and try to give your neighbors plenty of their own room to fish we are seeing blue winged olives and pseudocloeons above bv so be prepared with small baetis nymphs emergers and dries in 20 on average sometimes smaller for larger food be prepared with caddis grasshoppers and golden stoneflies above buena vista guides and diy anglers are reporting very good dry and dry dropper fishing this week but nymphing through the deeper pools and pockets will also be effective streamers can also be a great way to probe some of the deeper pockets north of buena vista flows 65 cfs at hayden meadows 109 cfs at granite 9 22 2021 arkansas river leadville to buena vista lake trinidad as of 9 24 2021 park staff reports the lake is at

doughballs and nightcrawlers boat inspection hours are 7 a m to 7 p m call the park for the most up to date conditions at 719 846 6951 lake trinidad arkansas river buena vista to salida as of 9 22 2021 braden baker with ark anglers writes the voluntary flow management program has ended and the river has dropped back down to native flows this adjustment has brought the river back into the ideal flow range for our local trout 240 400 cfs at the wellsville gauge and they will be able to maximize their use of the river to their benefit we will still have just enough water to float fish the arkansas near and below salida but this adjustment is definitely welcome news to wade anglers who will have more flexibility on wadeable water the rest of the summer the weather is slowly cooling down with lows in the 30s and 40s and highs in the 70s in the middle basin this week these air temperatures are helping moderate water temperatures and are giving us good conditions throughout the day to fish at current water levels be prepared for spookier fish a quiet thoughtful approach will pay big dividends with the lower water clarity is excellent in the middle basin and flows have receded now that we are back to sunny dry weather with flows dropping to native levels expect fish to be able to occupy more of the river rather than just the edges like they do during high summer flows fresh golden stonefly shucks are on the rocks above the water most mornings and the presence of these insects alongside grasshoppers has given us some fun action on larger attractor dry flies blue winged olives and pseudocloeons are hatching in the middle basin so small baetis nymphs emergers and dry flies should be in your arsenal 20 on average caddis and red quills make up medium sized food items with sporadic midge and trico hatches taking the microscopic award dry dropper and shallow nymphing tactics are generally the most productive but streamer fishing has been very effective lately as well at times fish are incredibly surface oriented yielding windows of great dry and double dry fly fishing the next few weeks should provide some excellent early fall opportunities on the warmest days fish will be looking for oxygen so if you can find aerated water you ll find trout following a low water spring and an underwhelming runoff fish are healthy and have fared well through the high water of summer flows 227 cfs at hecla junction 9 22 2021 arkansas river buena vista to salida john martin reservoir as of 9 24 2021 west boat ramp is closed due to low water levels east boat ramp

via international man international man almost every government and country in the world is going in the wrong direction from a personal freedom standpoint and if the last two years have been an indication the situation could get much worse before it gets better how can individuals limit the impact of government overreach in their day to day lives doug casey the first thing is to become self employed you don t want a job where you re dependent on somebody else or worse some organization the bigger the organization the less relative importance you have and the more danger you re in assess your resources and abilities and try to become an entrepreneur the world has an unlimited desire for goods and services an entrepreneur figures out how to satisfy them it takes thought knowledge and hard work but there s unlimited upside an employee by contrast just does what he s told for a wage most are easily replaceable cubicle dwellers these days being an employee is both high risk and low reward the second thing you can do is to not support the state in any way the state is not your friend it s your enemy it takes a fat slice of your earnings and in return tells you what you can and can t do find ways to reduce your contact with it and deny it both resources and approval minimize the taxes you pay so that you don t feed the beast that includes participating in its elections your choice is almost always just the lesser of two evils anyway remember that people who want to be in office are desirous of controlling other people voters are dupes at best voting for tweedledee or tweedledum while endorsing the corrupt system itself it s questionable whether your vote ever does any good or even counts ultimately the best solution is the one that ayn rand outlined in her novel atlas shrugged which is to put yourself in a position where you can just check out of the system and live in a parallel economy because the old one is going down anyway surround yourself with sound like minded people to the greatest degree possible international man vaccine mandates are threatening millions of people s livelihoods politicians and companies are threatening people telling them that either they get the jab or lose their jobs what can the average person do to avoid being coerced by such threats doug casey you re right that s another reason you don t want to be reliant on an employer and why you want to be an entrepreneur other than that you should take opportunities to speak out because most people lack courage and keep their thoughts to themselves that s a big mistake don t roll over just because it s convenient if you act like a docile sheep or scared rabbit you ll get what you deserve in the short run there are ways to avoid the vaccine for instance the cities are full of bums on the streets if you can find somebody who looks like you lend him your id shepherd him to a walgreens and have him take the vaccination in your stead to get the paper although i m sure that s only a temporary palliative because it would appear they re going to require people to take booster shots every six months as the virus mutates and they ll probably require some type of bio identification or the implantation of a chip to ensure that you don t find some way to get around this in addition to imposing nasty penalties some people have thought about radical counters to the threats of government and big corporations for instance if airlines require that you become vaccinated in order to fly some who are well organized might get a hundred friends together to book a flight and show up without vaccine cards solutions like that however are inconvenient and costly not just for the airlines it s a real problem since we re moving into a genuine police state there will likely be draconian penalties imposed on the 20 of the country that thinks for itself on the other hand if there are enough adverse reactions to the vaccine the hysteria might blow over in six months i plan on waiting at least another year or two before considering it i don t like playing the role of guinea pig certainly not unnecessarily international man as the original international man you ve literally written the book on how to protect yourself from your government by diversifying various parts of your life geographically and politically we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us how has the current global situation changed your perspective doug casey it s a totally different world now than it was when i wrote the international man book that was over forty years ago in those days it was possible to travel on a world service authority passport for instance today that s completely out of the question in any event with international flights down 85 and many countries totally cut off it s a totally different world in lots of ways although the days of cheap carefree travel are over it s more important than ever to not be beholden to just one government you have to get options even if you can t get a second citizenship and a second or third passport don t act like a deer in the headlights it s important and doable to get official permanent residency in a number of other countries so you have an escape hatch assuming they allow you to leave international man canada new zealand australia and other counties in the so called free world have turned into explicit totalitarian police states what can the unfortunate people who live behind this new iron curtain do to protect themselves doug casey as the inmates of the soviet union nazi germany mao s china pol pot s cambodia and many other places have found there s not much you can do once a place becomes a serious police state it s dangerous to do anything at this stage i think non cooperation is still the best approach don t be complacent and make supplicating motions to the apparatchiks of the state when they require you to do things don t cooperate to the greatest degree possible of course it s easy for me to say this as an academic matter but it s going to become increasingly dangerous because the society is full of rats that want to turn you in as a potential enemy of the state or a potential terrorist in this light you might want to watch the series the man in the high castle which gives an alternate history of the us if it had lost wwii it has lots of interesting discussions and observations about how easily the average american would roll over and cooperate with whoever gives him orders i also recommend that everybody rewatch v for vendetta it pretty much mimics at least up to its spectacular climax what s going on today right down to the virus international man what are some things that people of modest financial means can do now to protect themselves in case the situation persists or worsens doug casey in the years to come a lot of people will find that they have much more modest financial means than they imagined at some point the stock market bond market and probably the real estate market will crash in real terms i don t know what it s going to be in dollar terms it s going to be a leveling event not just despite but because of the foolish efforts of central banks around the world to prop things up it s quite possible that the unwinding has already started with evergrande in china everything else is made in china why not the greater depression as well but apart from staying clear of conventional markets just try to produce more than you can consume and save the difference i suggest saving the difference in small gold and silver coins that keeps it simple in addition speculate on things that are low risk and high potential also don t have a high correlation with conventional investments for instance one of my favorite classes of securities uranium stocks has gone up about four to one in the last few months uranium stocks are no longer at the absolute bottom but are going higher i m also quite involved in carbon sequestration stocks despite the fact that i think the carbon concept ranges from hype to scam the area will likely get very hot as a consequence of so called esg investing i also own a lot of oil and coal stocks which the market hates ironically they ll go up at least as much as carbon plays but next on the runway will be gold and silver stocks they ll not only have their cyclical day in the sun but will also be super hot editor s note the months and years ahead will be politically economically and socially volatile what you do to prepare could mean the difference between suffering crippling losses and coming out ahead that s precisely why legendary investor and ny times best selling author doug casey just released this urgent report on how to survive and thrive click here to download the pdf now

in america around 17 million children are battling hunger an entrepreneur has teamed with rap star gunna to open a free grocery store inside his old middle school in georgia to try to begin to change that social entrepreneur jasmine crowe knows a thing or two about getting creative in the pursuit of giving back as ceo of goodr a startup dedicated to eliminating food waste her bread and butter has been helping those who need it most it has always been a dream of hers to open brick and mortar locations to do just that crowe said in an interview with npr partnering with gunna whom she and her company have worked with for years on charitable efforts helped turned that dream into a reality for the students and families at ronald mcnair middle school in atlanta the store called gunna s drip closet and goodr grocery store has an array of foods household items toiletries and even clothes and shoes for students and their families the principal describes it as like a mini walmart crowe said the biggest difference of course is that everything is absolutely free stock is replenished weekly and there are vegan options as well as fresh produce also present are plenty of easy and quick options which were chosen for a very specific reason we were really conscious of making sure that we were providing items that the kids could make themselves because the principal let us know that a lot of these kids when they leave school they are essentially adults that are making the meals crowe explained they re doing everything for their household parents can come shop after dropping off their children for school and they even have the option of using an app created exclusively for the school to reserve a shopping time slot or request items goodr also gifted every student a reusable shopping bag not just to avoid waste but also to provide students with the option to shop anonymously since every student has a bag to use for anything at any time there s no real way to know if a student has gone shopping at the goodr store crowe explained on twitter for some parents whose children now have the option of bringing home dinner for the entire family it s been a dream come true crowe told npr i know we ve received tons of messages from parents that are just saying you know what you don t know how much you just saved my life because now these kids can literally say mom i ll bring dinner home sometimes they re working two and three jobs and there are little kids at the house she said so it is really good to be able to have that there this store is only the beginning when gunna approached goodr about ways to help out his community during the back to school season crowe saw an opportunity to give back in a way that would have a more lasting effect than handing out school supplies she said i just wanted us to do something that would last and just be more sustainable and that we can continue to build upon she said that s when gunna and crowe teamed up to help ronald mcnair middle where gunna born sergio kitchens was once a student himself the store which had its grand opening last week will remain open during the school year it s maintained by store managers whose pay is also covered by gunna s sponsorship the store will close in the summer when the students are gone but all the food items will be sent home to families before then to reduce waste they don t have to worry about keeping the store alive either according to crowe gunna who took to instagram this week to share photos and videos of the store s opening day has committed to funding the store for as long as he is alive as for crowe she s been in the business of helping others for nearly a decade now she began feeding those in need out of the kitchen of her small atlanta apartment in 2013 buying all of the food and preparing it on her own every weekend for more than three years crowe s company goodr launched in 2017 describes itself as a surplus food recovery service it helps connect businesses that have excess food items with nonprofit organizations that could use those items operating in pursuit of the mission to feed more waste less goodr has also been hosting pop up free grocery stores across the country and organizing free grocery deliveries for senior citizens still crowe said there s always room to do more we have a lot of work that we do around children and seniors and i just thought it would be so great if we had a real location that provided that direct access for kids she said i just felt like there s a need so many kids don t know where their next meal is coming from and here was an opportunity to bring the food directly to them crowe hopes to partner with more celebrities and brands who can act as sponsors and open more goodr stores in the future feeding more people for free in the meantime there are also plans to expand the offerings at gunna s goodr store by offering resources like recipe cards and instructional cooking videos those who want to be involved can contribute food donations to the school s front office or even have items delivered via amazon fresh crowe also has a children s book releasing next month called everybody eats with proceeds going toward programs to feed children to see the impact that it s really made on these families and just to hear those things it s just been amazing crowe said this is just the beginning it s only going to get better copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

nine months ago my partners and i began hearing of ominous warnings from management insiders many of whom were forecasting a 2020 recession it was not that startling to us given that we had written about the factors that could produce a downturn in various blog posts however those collective observations were running counter to the news of the day the country was doing great experiencing full employment confident consumers a robust housing market and low interest rates to be fair there were signs of headwinds as well such as the government s obsession with imposing tariffs on our trading partners an upcoming presidential election and considerable uncertainty in the stock market the issue at the time was if and or when companies started to cut back on spending and reducing inventory levels those emerging challenges would serve as the forewarning of economic problems to come other troubling signs started to surface in late 2019 a fortune survey monkey surveyed senior managers at companies ranging from fortune 500 concerns to small businesses in diverse industries one of the key findings was that two out of three executives believed a recession was likely within the next 12 months while there were several bright spots in the economy then the consensus was that the good times would not last forever coincidentally it was december 2019 when the first covid 19 case was reported in china and by the end of january 2020 the world health organization declared the highly transmissible virus a global health emergency the first case in the usa was reported in january as well the covid cliff as it turns out the concern that managers had in late 2019 would translate into a major transformation and upheaval of business much sooner than even they had predicted a number of key economic indicators essentially crashed in a remarkably short period of time the dow jones industrial average dropped 38 percent in 40 days unemployment soared from 3 5 percent in february to 14 7 percent in april and consumer confidence plummeted 29 percent from february to april most businesses were unprepared to deal with the economic free fall in fact small to middle market companies experienced the most significant declines and were generally ill equipped to deal with them in retrospect one might ask what could these businesses have done to prepare for such a drastic downturn given the dramatic rate of change some might question what if anything they could have done to mitigate the financial impact our response to that rhetorical question has never wavered always have a plan b even in good times the power of planning preparation in the world of business where both startup and established companies deal with daily struggles and sometimes risk everything to succeed having a plan b may be considered a weakness or seen as a lack of commitment to the current plan having a contingency plan is nothing new however especially to those organizations and individuals willing to take great risks for a chance at even greater gains dating back to the civil war the art of contingency planning took on supreme importance in case the optimal plan of attack did not work out even though you hope that you will never have to resort to your back up plan this does not change its importance since you might have to rely on it in the future the process itself will often cause you to rethink your primary plan and be in a position to improve it intentionality is what makes any contingency plan effective executives who are often risking it all to survive in the business world regardless of sector or industry should view their back up plan as a strategy not an afterthought it requires you to take a personal inventory of what is important to you and finding ways other than plan a to help achieve your goals the last point is particularly important as developing a plan b forces management to assess their business critically as part of this process they must understand where they have vulnerabilities this might include assessing the risk of high customer concentration weakness in their supply chain determining the risk of losing key management members the lack of online ordering and delivery systems as well as weakness in their information technology systems by identifying these vulnerabilities management in fact may decide they must act sooner rather than later to make important changes in advance of the next business decline take it from a former ceo that has helped numerous companies deal with the consequences of poor planning you don t want to be the person in the board or management meeting that says we should have listened and been prepared

we have to create a more robust economy in the past few days we have had more small energy companies go bust a huge surge in gas prices warnings of a rise in food prices at christmas from tesco bp petrol stations running out of fuel and warnings of food shortages we have also had fears there won t be enough fireworks for bonfire night or enough christmas trees and to cap it all two crumpet factories having to shut down because of the shortage of co2 this is ridiculous it is all very well to talk of our electricity industry being hit by several problems at the same time the rise in global gas prices a fire that has put one of the connecting cables with france out of action too little wind nuclear plants undergoing maintenance and so on rethink if the shelves really are empty over christmas government will get the blame however that begs a string of questions such as why have we not built more gas storage is it really a good idea to import so much power from france why are delivery drivers not paid more and so on besides we all know that the wind sometimes does not blow it was all very well to try to introduce more competition into the gas and electricity industries but the way it has been done is to allow lots of tiny enterprises often with inadequate financial backing to offer cut price deals to gullible customers only to go under when things turn tough and it is all very well to blame the shortage of hgv drivers on supply problems but this is a longstanding problem as not enough young people have been taking up licences maybe they should be paid more this is not just a matter for britain all around the world there are supply chain issues german car plants have had to cut production because of shortages of computer chips bank of america has just warned about the problems in the us saying that christmas for retail will very much be about empty shelves one of the reasons why russia is restricting its gas exports to europe is that it has to rebuild domestic stocks first as they have been run right down so what s to be done companies all over the world have spent 30 years and more focusing on squeezing down costs rather than building security of supply so small local plants have been shut in favour of some giant factory on the far side of the world warehouses have switched to just in time operations and stocks have been minimised the uk has been particularly hard hit with the relentless rundown of manufacturing for a generation but we did not realise how fragile things were until the pandemic struck now the mood has changed there are three main ways in which companies are trying to reorganise themselves one is to buy locally of course there are some products we will always have to import you can grow pineapples in a heated greenhouse in uk but it makes more sense to import them from somewhere warmer but there are lots of products that are made here and one of the side effects of brexit disruption has been to encourage local suppliers a second way of tackling one aspect of the problem labour shortages is to invest in more automation something made easier by 5g telecom networks a third is for companies with any spare logistical capacity to sell that to other enterprises making the whole distribution system more efficient all this will take time and cost money greening the economy is admirable but that takes time and costs money too a whole generation of managers who have spent their careers trying to screw down costs have to learn the new trick of creating a more robust and more local network of suppliers there will be winners including firms that manage their logistics skilfully and specialist suppliers of top end products and there will be losers companies that can t cope it won t just be the third rate energy companies that go under the really big message here for businesses is that globalisation the dominant force driving the world economy is changing direction things had started to go more local before the pandemic struck but now the shift has massively speeded up the big message for governments is that they need to think about the consequences of every bit of legislation they bring in does this make our economy more robust or less so if the shelves really are empty over christmas they will get the blame too
two solar component specialists and one renewable energy utility look well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in renewables there is much enthusiasm surrounding renewable energy stocks in recent years though the ishares global clean energy etf is down roughly 18 in this year it still crushed the broader market over a three year timeframe in three years the etf is up 163 significantly outperforming the s p 500 index s 55 rise investors euphoria around renewable energy isn t unfounded by 2050 the share of renewable sources in the u s power generation sector is projected to double from 21 to 42 that should give renewable energy companies significant growth opportunities here are three promising stocks to consider buying right now to benefit from expected renewables growth array technologies array technologies arry 0 70 provides solar trackers which move solar panels throughout the day based on the movement of the sun the trackers help increase the reliability and uptime of the system as well as boost energy production array technologies stock fell steeply in may after the company reported lower margins for the first quarter due to higher steel and freight costs it also expressed uncertainty over meeting its guidance for 2021 in the last few months the company focused on reducing its exposure to the prices of input commodities notably steel array has now entered into supply agreements that fix around 85 of its input costs for the rest of 2021 this gave it the confidence to reinstate its earlier guidance for 2021 array increased its revenue by 76 in q2 though margins dipped due to higher costs moreover its order book increased by 45 over the year ago quarter indicating continued strong demand array now freezes costs with suppliers as soon as it receives a project from a customer it used to wait until the customer signed the final contract exposing it to price increases during this gap with the new process array expects continued margin improvement in 2022 in august array secured an investment of 350 million from blackstone by selling perpetual preferred stock it also has the option to withdraw an additional amount of up to 150 million through june 2023 the company used these funds to repay its outstanding debt and improve its liquidity position though the preferred stock s yield is higher than the interest rate array was paying on its loans the investment helps improve its debt ratings moreover blackstone s decision to invest in array while also appointing one of its member on the company s board suggests that the group believes in array s growth strategy and potential so while common investors don t generally like preferred stock issuance in array s case it looks like a better option than dealing with the high debt levels array technologies is trying to get a better handle on its costs at the same time the company s revenue growth and order backlog look strong with improved liquidity strong demand and favorable contract structures array technologies looks well placed to grow in its niche shoals technologies group shoals technologies group shls 4 25 provides electrical balance of system or ebos solutions for solar projects ebos includes all the basic components such as cable assemblies and fuses needed to transfer the electric current produced by solar panels to the power grid the company often customizes these systems integrating design and engineering support and installations for customers specific projects shoals which completed its initial public offering in january reported 38 year over year growth in its second quarter revenue at the same time the company s gross margin increased from 38 8 in the year ago quarter to 43 8 in the latest quarter the company s bottom line is in the green and it is generating positive cash from operations albeit a small amount for the full year 2021 shoals expects revenue in the range of 230 million to 240 million that range implies 31 to 37 year over year growth in revenue shoals competes with companies such as solarbos bentek solar and connectpv but it is bigger than these competitors in the ebos market segment investors might want to consider adding this components specialist to their portfolioa because of its impressive revenue and gross margin growth nextera energy partners formed in 2014 by utility nextera energy nextera energy partners nep 1

getty images the incoming biden administration has clearly stated that they want to position the u s as the world s clean energy leader the president elect has an ambitious plan the highlights of which include a goal of economy wide net zero emissions by 2050 an investment of 400b over 10 years in clean energy and innovation and the creation of a new research agency focused on climate technology in addition the biden administration seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of u s building stock by 50 and a carbon pollution free power sector both by 2035 they hope this will create an estimated 10m jobs when combined with their ambitious infrastructure plan similarly the european commission outlined a plan in december 2019 to become the first climate neutral continent by 2050 the plan seeks to reduce greenhouse gas impacts by 50 55 by 2030 for the 28 member states and to be 100 carbon neutral by 2050 funded by a proposed 1t over ten years the plan s broader goals include accelerating wind and solar capacity shifting fossil fuel dependent regions toward renewables and combating job losses in legacy energy industries it s clear that alternative clean energy will be a major investment theme over the next several decades the international renewable energy agency released a report earlier this year that argues for a 70 reduction in the world s energy related co2 by 2050 with 90 of those reductions from renewables and energy efficient measures irena investors have already woken up to the shift in the global landscape away from fossil fuel dominant investments two major alternative clean energy etfs qcln first trust nasdaq clean edge energy index fund and pzd invesco cleantech etf are at all time highs having risen substantially from march lows others like tan invesco solar etf fan first trust global wind energy fund and icln ishares global clean energy etf are at decade highs while each will likely pause after becoming very extended in the short term i d look for opportunities to buy should they consolidate some william o neil co one of the major drivers of this performance is the fact that in a number of areas alternative energy has become economically viable as costs continue to fall many completed clean energy projects have generated high margins and steady cash which should enable a continued stream of capital in this landscape i favor companies that are expanding wind solar and electric battery storage capacity either organically or through acquisitions especially in areas with government policies promoting renewable energy emerging negative emissions technology next generation building materials and renewable hydrogen energy technologies are also attractive areas of investment in the new energy space the following names have both leading fundamental and technical characteristics from an o neil perspective tesla tsla tsla 560b market cap is the world s largest electric vehicle ev manufacturer 87 of sales and provides energy storage products for residential and commercial customers it has a 16 share of the ev market which represents just 4 of the total auto market but will continue to grow faster especially given increasing government support in markets like europe and china the energy storage market is also a huge opportunity longer term where q3 revenues rose 44 y y but still make up just 7 of total revenues william o neil co enphase energy enph enph 17b market cap provides microinverter systems for solar modules which are key in converting dc electricity harnessed from the sun into ac electricity used to

keep pushing all the way to 6 200mw by 2025 as new project costs are expected to keep falling if it can reach its 2025 target and maintain a very high 75 80 ebitda margin it could grow ebitda by 10x

insurance market df many producers know the business market in general but they don t develop specific knowledge of the various types of businesses for the business owners their businesses are almost like a member of the family like a child they ve raised they want to feel that their producers understand the unique nature of their business are highly experienced and have a high level of understanding about the challenges and issues they face this will open conversations and create opportunities inn what exactly is allianz offering to help producers df we can help in many ways for instance we compile semiannual reports on industry specific trends legislation changing tax laws and anything else that s impacting the sector these reports help producers not only stay informed but also be better prepared for meetings and better equipped to build valuable relationships that are productive and efficient they give producers a leg up on the competition and maximize their opportunities inn are there specific concepts or issues producers should be familiar with df their clients will need to work with qualified tax and legal advisors when considering various planning strategies but producers certainly need to be familiar with the basics such as the core estate planning strategies key employee compensation plans and business succession strategies but they also need to understand what keeps these business owners up at night for instance if they re working with manufacturing companies they should be aware that these businesses are being hit hard by skilled labor shortages and recent supply chain interruptions these businesses may be looking to recruit key employees with experience in navigating supply chains and they may be looking for human resources talent to help them address labor shortages understanding the current trends can help producers bring the best sales strategies to the table and generate opportunities inn what are some other issues and solutions in other industries df a good example is agriculture where succession planning is key a lot of farms have remained in the same family for generations the owners have a strong emotional attachment to their land they also want to treat all of their children equally and some in the next generation may have little interest in continuing the tradition so a well constructed succession plan for an agricultural business owner might pass the farming assets to those children who want to engage in farming and simultaneously purchase life insurance for financial protection the death benefit is generally income tax free to the clients beneficiaries another big issue for agricultural business owners is conservation easements by donating certain property rights to a charitable land trust or government agency the landowner can realize a considerable income tax deduction this might be an appropriate strategy if the client is anticipating a sizable income tax event but it also lowers the value of the land so producers might recommend life insurance to help replace that lost value for the client s beneficiaries inn interesting what about issues facing the construction industry df the construction industry should benefit from increased government infrastructure spending if and when the government passes an infrastructure spending bill but in these businesses surety bonds are essential business owners can t do their job without them their contracts require them surety bonds help provide assurances that construction projects will be completed in order to obtain surety bonds the business needs to be evaluated by the bond company s underwriters producers can help business owners pass muster with the surety bond underwriters by reviewing the business s succession plans and buy sell agreements perhaps recommending life insurance for key employees life insurance can also improve debt to asset ratios since the cash surrender values may count as working capital interestingly construction companies are having difficulties finding skilled labor at the moment as well so they re also going to need to hire human resources professionals to recruit and train more skilled labor this in turn creates an opportunity to offer key employee compensation plans such as nonqualified deferred compensation plans bonus plans split dollar plans phantom stock plans and others specifically targeted to the hr talent they ll be bringing on inn i see you mentioned the manufacturing industry what else about manufacturing businesses should producers be aware of df a prevalent trend in manufacturing is the internet of things which refers to linking together technologies to generate data that improves operational efficiency companies need to adapt to that they need to develop tech related skills and bring on executives who can manage tech teams consequently they too are going to need key employee compensation plans what s more business owners should consider the additional cash flow needs the next generation will have in order to keep up with ongoing technological advances one potential solution is to create a trust that s funded with life insurance upon the death of the owner the trust receives the death benefit and the trustee may make distributions or low interest loans to the business for keeping up with technology inn are there unique issues in the professional services space df it s a diverse field made up of health care providers attorneys engineers accountants etc many of them are concerned about creditor protection generally speaking they practice in areas that attract litigation also most serve their clients personally without using employees or subcontractors which increases the potential for legal claims against them so assets that have creditor protection such as life insurance in many states may be appealing in addition these firms are often top heavy the owners earn much more than the staff this makes it difficult to contribute to qualified retirement plans for higher paid employees including the owner cash value life insurance may be the answer it allows for tax favorable withdrawals and loans from the available cash value1 as well as a generally income tax free death benefit inn lastly what do professionals need to know about commercial real estate df commercial real estate businesses regularly buy and sell property as a result capital gains taxes are a big concern producers should be familiar with capital gains tax deferment strategies such as 1031 exchanges which allow you to defer capital gains taxes when you sell an investment property and reinvest the proceeds in a similarly valued asset within a certain time period other options include delaware statutory trusts or real estate investment trusts reits which may appeal to clients who want to remain invested in the real estate market but don t want to actively manage the properties anymore more aggressive strategies such as deferred sales trusts are often marketed as tax deferment strategies allowing property owners to sell assets to a third party trust in exchange for a promissory note producers should proceed with caution have the client work closely with their tax and legal professionals and understand the irs may challenge these arrangements they also are not approved as a recommended strategy by allianz inn thanks dave for these fascinating and worthwhile insights it s clear that getting to know each client s specific business and market segment is vitally important for providing better service generating ideas and maximizing opportunities producers need to know not just the financial products available but the best applications of them by understanding clients businesses from

the problem with terrorist groups is that they are firmly believe that the gun is the only way to resolve any issue and this makes them imperious and obdurate in their dealings so it s not at all surprising that even though it seized power by brute force and not through consensus taliban spokesperson suhail shaheen has the gall to demand that the world should recognise taliban to respect the will of the afghan people infact by saying that afghanistan will have an islamic government based on sharia laws there would be no democratic system at all because it doesn t have any base in our country senor taliban member waheedullah hashimihas made it clear that taliban has without even asking the people concluded that that afghans don t have any appetite for democracy on tuesday taliban deputy information minister and former spokesperson zabihullah mujahid went a step further by saying it is the responsibility of the united nations torecognise our government for other countries including european asian and islamic countries to have diplomatic relations with us this statement in noteworthy as it reveals two things one that taliban has no intention of following international laws and conventions and two it considers international recognition as a matter of right readers would recall that soon after his arrival in kabul for talks on government formation taliban s main architect of the doha agreement mullah abdul ghani baradar announcedthat we re working to establish an inclusive government that represents all the people of afghanistan however within a month while baradar seems to have faded into oblivion and with mujahid now making it clear that pakistan or any other country has no right to ask the islamic emirate to establish an inclusive government in afghanistan so has the promise of an inclusive government so when taliban can so shamelessly turn back on its own promise of forming an inclusive government how can one believe mujahid s non committal comment that women might be inducted in the government subsequently or that the decision to allow girls to attend school will be announced soon with government coffers empty and no sustainable sources of funds to run the country taliban has no other option but to rely on foreign aid that s why its bellicosityraises a question why is a near bankrupt taliban still exhibiting such a non cooperative attitude the answer isn t very difficult to find as history is replete with examples of how repressive regimes ostracised by the international community were bailed out by countries that placed their vested interests above ethics and global amity in the case of taliban china and pakistan are two such countries that have openly come out in its support and it s just a matter of time when others too would join in and taliban knows that even before anyone realises it ll be business as usual beijing s motivation to woo taliban stems from the scope of exploiting afghanistan s vast natural resources as well asgaining land route access into central asia pakistan is standing by taliban for three reasons one being china s client state it has no other option and two with pakistan army s spy agency inter services intelligence having painstakingly handpicked a pliable taliban government the resultant haqqani led dispensation in kabul suits islamabad s interests lastly pakistan is probably betting on becoming the taliban s confidante and its interphase with the outside world so it can divert aid for its own use just like gen zia ul haqdid with cia funds meant for mujahideens fighting the soviets in afghanistan with china and pakistan on its side taliban knows that it can still manage the show despite antagonising the world by flatly refusing to respect enduring international laws and conventions on governance and human rights while china would provide it funds a cash strapped pakistan seems to have assumed the role of taliban s public relation agency why else would pakistan prime minister imran khan describethe barbaric taliban fighters as normal civilians why did he take so much pains to explain the genealogy of haqqanis of them being pashtuns of afghan stock born in a pakistan refugee camp and educated in a pakistani madrassa lastly why else would khan hail taliban s bloody takeover of kabul as a defining moment for afghanistan by saying that with this afghans had broken the shackles of slavery by saying that if they can sort of now work towards an inclusive government get all the factions together afghanistan could have peace after 40 years khan may have shared the international community s concerns on this issue however by adding that the world should give them time it s clear that he s not as serious as he pretends to be because achieving inclusiveness isn t a time consuming exercise that he is merely paying lip service is all the more evident from the fact that instead of offering positive suggestions to make taliban form an inclusive government khan has instead gone off on a tangent by saying that rather than sitting here and thinking that we can control them we should incentivise them that a prime minister could insult international consensus regarding an inclusive government in afghanistan by perceiving it as an attempt to control taliban is unfortunate however khan s suggestion that the international community should incentivise taliban for this purpose is not only downrightly demeaning but will also encourage taliban to hold the international community hostage to its perverse whims and fancies besides highlighting the genuine issue of burgeoning humanitarian crisis in afghanistan khan has tried to make thecase for immediate engagement with taliban stronger by reminding the world that an unstable afghanistan could heighten the possibility of terrorism from afghanistan s soil while his concerns deserve appreciation but then khan s proclivity for presenting a dooms day scenario to buttress his claims is well known remember how he used the unga podium to very confidently prognose a bloodbath in kashmir once precautionary restrictions invoked after article 370 abrogation were lifted recall how he kept warning the world about an imminent indian false flag operation against pakistan that would culminate in a nuclear exchange so one isn t very sure whether the international community will takehim seriously this time it seems khan is attempting to peddle the hypothesis the only way for the world to immunise itself from terrorism is to incentivise taliban however one can t blame khan for this absurdsuggestion since pakistan itself has been a beneficiary of such an arrangement remember former us president donald trump s 2018 tweet the united states has foolishly given pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies deceit thinking of our leaders as fools they give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in afghanistan some may argue that a weak taliban government would only embolden other terrorist groups like the al qaida and islamic state of iraq and levant khorasan they may alsocite the kabul airport suicide bomb attack that killed 13 us soldiers and atleast 169 afghan men women and children as well as the recent spate of three isil k bomb attacks targeting taliban in jalalabad while threat from isil k and al qaida cannot be disregarded or downplayed but given taliban s dubious track record and manipulative skills there s a need to take its claims with a rather generous pinch of salt on august 29 when us declared that it had droned a suicide bomber driving an explosive laden car france 24 reported that a taliban spokesman confirmed the incident saying a car bomb destined for the airport had been destroyed taliban coming out so promptly to second afalse claim made by its arch enemy should have raised red flags but unfortunately it didn t but why did taliban concur with the false us claim of an abortive isil k car bomb attack the most likely reason is that doing so would help taliban in building up the narrative of a heightened isil k threat in afghanistan and thereby prepare ground for it to seek international aid for quelling al qaida and isil k so there are bright chances that in the days to come we could well see a replay 2002 albeit with some minor changes in which an incentivised taliban will replace pakistan army as the good guys and fight the global war on terror just like pakistan army did for the last two decades looks like the days ahead will indeed be extremely interesting

vice president when his family blew up into full conflict after his 104 year old great grandmother died but by then he d married a woman whose family s radically transparent approach to finances showed how he could grow his money while sorting out the mess left by generations of secrecy see also thrifty rich locals the best money advice for each decade of your life our adoptive parents did not want us to be orphaned again by their death they made sure we were exposed to all walks of life that we were well traveled and we would learn to manage money jacque vaughn as a child born in war torn vietnam jacque vaughn has gone from orphanage to poster child for success american style she s worked hard for it but also inherited a scrimp and save mentality she says from the white u s military couple who adopted her they lived frugally when we went out to eat like at a mcdonald s we weren t allowed a beverage we didn t have designer anything but her parents did design their lives coming from small towns jacque says they entered the military life and that opened their eyes they gave jacque and her brother an adoptee from germany education and experiences instead of things and from an early age required them to give back in the form of service jacquelyn and stephen smith also opened the family books to them when they were small we call it the full monty approach jacque says early on they talked about what would happen when they died our adoptive parents did not want us to be orphaned again by their death from jacque s adoption on the smiths had to fight to receive a presidential authorization to take her from vietnam they set an example when they first adopted me my parents planned to live in virginia near family she says but they decided not to because being transracial would be a handicap for me they moved to hawai i in 1975 but that raised a new concern one the cost of living and two what the future would bring so they made sure we were exposed to all walks of life that we were well traveled and we would learn to manage money a navy commander her father walked her through her first salary negotiation for a post college job in public relations we sat down i said there s no way i can make a living in this field at this salary so we crunched the numbers what i needed to pay the rent to pay car insurance and the only way to break even and maybe go out to a movie he said was you gross 24 000 a year now he added jacque was to take in her calculations and show it to her interviewers he said to ask them to come as close as they could she laughs you have to be very respectful and polite when you re laying that on the table she got the job at the number she wanted when others at her level were making 18 000 to 20 000 a year her father then marched her into a bank to set up an ira he said i want you to put a percentage of your income away and when you get a raise put more away maybe 5 percent she followed through and yet in her 20s she went through a rebellious phase you look at other kids wearing all the clothes you wanted you re in that shallow and sensitive stage she recalls i ran up credit card debt bounced checks as many do in that time period so many of my peers got caught upholding the mythology of how it should be the designer bags the designer clothes the expensive cars which tend to depreciate so much it was a real struggle in new york i stayed with friends who all had broadway backgrounds but they all had regular jobs i said guys don t you want to go audition but they d given up their dreams cyndi mayo dream vs reality socking away micro percentages keeping to a spreadsheet budget frankly it all can sound rather joyless and yet you can have your dreams and your savings and growth strategy too when cyndi mayo was born in oakland california her parents were living with relatives and trying to decide if they could afford to move back to hawai i dad is hawaiian caucasian mom s filipino spanish chinese says mayo whose hyphens include singer dancer actress and investor all told 11 ethnicities she grew up on o ahu and then maui when her father who had a car detailing business decided to get away from traffic there the family formed a band since i was 10 we ve had a group called family ties we all took hula tahitian dance i sang pretty much in hawaiian often work brought the family band to waikīkī since i was a young age i ve been in shows she says to tide them over the lulls her father had a side business he d have vending machines so we d go around town filling them his industriousness rubbed off as mayo hit adulthood i just decided to go to college get a business degree and put the entertainment thing on the side at the university of hawai i at mānoa she earned a degree in travel industry management her course seemed set but college had whetted not dampened her passion for dance i was in a group maile aloha singers that took us around the world a visit home after graduation led to a job at a show as a singer dancer on maui allowing her to pursue her art while keeping other revenue streams flowing she s traveled the world and risen to new challenges i was a magician s assistant once because it paid more i didn t get sawn in half she was hired by legends in concert to play janet jackson in waikīkī there s been acting commercials movies a long gig with the ulalena show on maui paid her 50 000 a year much of which she banked by staying with friends she knew just what to do with the money because i came from pretty humble beginnings over time i saved a friend helped me open a 401 k in my early 20s from just talking to people i got into investing seeing what i could do when she saw a professional opportunity she invested in that too by flying to auditions in las vegas and new york city the payoff from sticking to her passion came when she was called to new york in the 1990s to audition for her dream job dreamgirls i stayed with friends who all had broadway backgrounds but they all had regular jobs i said guys don t you want to go audition but they d given up their dreams mayo was hired to tour and then the original dream girl jennifer holliday decided to join them performing in front of tens of thousands of people she played nearly every role even that of a blonde with a top hat and cane i lived with another cast member and saved enough money to buy a one bedroom condo in hawai i and was able to sell that in two years and use the profit for my next townhouse which was a three bedroom two and a half bath now i m renting again but i want to own again never forgetting her father s example for the past seven years mayo has also balanced her creative schedule with a real job as a flight attendant for hawaiian airlines i could ve gone into management somewhere but flying is more fun more flexible and she can keep dancing and singing so yes you can still keep your dreams doing multimedia was my dream job even though people said you ll never make anything but there are people out there who will help people become homeowners ellen studies show that wages grow fastest in your first 10 years of work however not everyone gets the memo about growing an asset base for many in their 30s one day they look around and realize life is a race and they ve missed the starting gun for others it s a job with a low salary limit that puts a crimp on any hopes of surviving in hawai i let alone buying a home finance was discussed growing up says ellen who asked that her last name not be used but she chose to be a multimedia specialist anyway no 28 on usa today s list of lowest paying professions after a few years working her way up from entry level positions in a small metro area on the mainland she was making 29 000 a year then her company was sold and she decided to move to hawai i to join her grandparents and parents it was only a couple of years after the 2009 crash my timing was terrible she says i was so stupid plus instead of staying with her grandparents i paid rent after seven months her savings almost out she finally found a job after a few years of living with four roommates and paying 730 a month in rent ellen decided to buy her own place but to obtain even a 250 000 mortgage in a state where the average condo costs 410 000 she calculated it would take at least 10 years of saving and by then the price could be 30 percent higher or even more ellen met with a real estate agent who specializes in putting people into their first home she got me to the hawai i homeownership center a nonprofit that helps local lower income working people to become homeowners they educate you on the homebuying process ellen says they have classes one on one counseling with hhoc s help she created a monthly budget and stuck to it as her savings grew she enrolled in the nonprofit s down payment assistance program if you live in the state of hawai i are buying for the first time and your income is within a certain range you can get up to 40 000 to use toward a down payment with zero interest she adds she smiles i was so surprised by this i emailed everybody her income fit into the range it can t be too high or too low and she set about gathering documents including credit reports w2s and tax returns for the past three years pay stubs checking and bank statements but since she only qualified for the lowest priced unit in a still unbuilt affordable housing development the competition was stiff she didn t get a place but she didn t touch her savings either after an initial deposit a second was due after 30 days but before that happened she got a phone call somebody had dropped out of a condo deal she had 24 hours to accept commit and make her down payment on a place that wouldn t be finished for another three years and that she wouldn t be able to sell or rent or move from for five more years i said yes it s now almost three years later and ellen has just gotten word that the deal has closed and the condo is hers during those three years she says some of my friends have had to leave hawai i a couple of them made double of what i did so i d just say to you wait you don t have to go live in florida there s so much you can t control you can t control if you get a raise or if you can find a better job to acquire real estate and know it s going to appreciate is exciting jacque vaughn growing an a set and revenue base at 29 jacque vaughn had tamed her spending and her debt i didn t run it up so much that i couldn t get out from under it and although it may have seemed as if the lessons learned from her parents hadn t sunk in she was ready for a change a special incentive took the form of what she calls a mean spirited kick in the skirt when she moved on from her first job her boss her third in two years said you ll never do better than you did here financially at the time she was making 34 000 a year and i remember thinking to myself of course i can meanwhile jacque s parents had some advice you re giving all your money to the landlord they said buy an apartment you don t have to love it working with a budget of 125 000 in 2000 she found an 800 square foot condo at crosspointe by aloha stadium it was leasehold with 20 more years to run meaning she could end up with nothing for her investment any less time on the lease and banks wouldn t finance it she recalls her realtor thought she might be offered a deal on the lease down the line however i gambled on it she says thinking it would be the same as paying rent in the end the landowner offered her the chance to buy after five years for an additional 46 000 the day i bought it was really exciting and liberating i was owning my life she also owned an investment property that is now worth 400 000 when she met a man and started a serious relationship she says i said this is the way to go this is how it can be done in hawai i if we can buy property and rent them for close to the mortgage and stay budget neutral we should do it by the time they were married six years later they each had two properties hers at crosspointe and his in mililani then her husband took an overseas posting in sicily we got all our moving expenses paid for by the government we could rent out our place let it appreciate and let someone else pay the mortgage while an immediate financial boon the four year sojourn would end however in divorce you work so hard to learn your lessons and do well and then you get married and divorced and it can be disastrous jacque vaughn ri ing above disaster stuff happens things fall apart disaster strikes even the best prepped after separating from her husband jacque vaughn moved back to hawai i in 2009 and into her original crosspointe condo i remember being shocked there was nobody at the mall nobody at restaurants for rent signs everywhere with the divorce she says there was a financial reckoning but she was able to find her footing you need to have a hard times strategy she says i think you should always put yourself in a position where you re prepared for the worst if you have strategies in your life that are solid and good you re going to weather the storm whether recession losing your job or divorce of particular importance was keeping a level head in dealing with the end of her marriage fortunately there was enough respect in the relationship that i could say hey you came in with two properties i came in with two properties let s walk out of the marriage with what we came in i don t think we even used a lawyer we used a paralegal by working the problem not the grievances jacque avoided the divorce penalty that many women pay they typically lose 20 percent of their income in the aftermath of a divorce she also never lost touch with her career while overseas among the companies vaughn did long distance consulting for was a former employer the hawaiian humane society upon her return she says they welcomed me back with open arms and it was here that she met her future husband keoni when disaster strikes she sums up the only thing i can recommend is make a thoughtful decision not an emotional one pa sing it on good planning and financial transparency have a cumulative effect in the typical family s life cycle learning to talk dispassionately about finances with members of the younger and older generations reduces friction and misunderstandings keeping everything under wraps however virtually guarantees a struggle even a fight that can inflict ruinous costs and permanent emotional damage for keoni vaughn s family everything fell apart when his 104 year old part hawaiian great grandmother died her trust went into effect and it was a total nightmare my grandmother came to me for help so in my 40s this is the first time my family has ever talked about money before when i asked it was none of your business pal as often happens in large complicated multigenerational families various members had cut different kinds of backstage deals with each other and the great grandparents there were trusts within trusts with cloudy wording different properties were involved the main trust had been written long before but both the great grandfather and one of two brothers had died members on the mainland were out of touch but at least keoni had a different way of looking at money watching and dealing with jacque s family had been a revelation they treat me like their son he says of the smiths there s no holding back they talked to me about stocks and bonds they started me thinking about property and real estate within his own family on the other hand things escalated to the point of one of the surviving brothers threatening to sue even if the costs would sink the estate and force the sale of properties at auction keoni brokered a deal that diminished his own grandfather s inheritance but allowed a clean break the malcontented octogenarian moved into a family property and a month later passed away now keoni vaughn says i m breaking the mold when it comes to my family i lived a life of secrets to me that s just so detrimental to those left behind almost four years ago jacque and keoni adopted a son hunter this year my husband and i undertook the emotional process of setting up our own trust says jacque and it was a life changing experience to come face to face with our own mortality and scenarios that can empower or cripple your heirs inheritance can rob heirs of ambition and of truly claiming their own life and we are mindful of that and have seen it happen adds keoni if we die i don t want our son to have access to the trust until he s 30 and then only for education and medical purposes he s required to go to school to access any of this money today keoni is the executive director of the lāna i cat sanctuary which is also a tourist attraction enjoying national attention including a recent cnn profile he commutes from o ahu and is proud he just got 100 percent of his employees to sign up for the 403 b the nonprofit s 401 k i felt so passionate about getting them started in the right place he says the people who are open do better the open people learn from each other it s the only way to get there keoni vaughn a few years ago jacque vaughn took a deep breath and started her own business transcendence pacific llc a community engagement consulting company my parents grew up much less affluent than our upbringing she says they received nothing from their parents upon their death except for memories and mementos and yet they have created a wonderful lifestyle and comfortable retirement they set themselves up to ensure they will never have to depend upon their children for anything and they did it in hawai i and they expect us to do the same by their example

as major corporations look to buy carbon credits to offset emissions critics are questioning the value of legacy credits from green projects that are a decade or more old what s needed experts say is to reform the credit system so it delivers actual carbon reductions on october 20 last year french oil giant total docked a tanker loaded with australian liquefied natural gas at the port of dapeng in southern china the company boasted that the lng was carbon neutral because the emissions from burning it had been neutralized by carbon credits purchased from a 10 year old wind farm in northern china environmentalists cried foul handing out money to a decade old project that will run anyway does nothing to neutralize pollution from continued use of fossil fuels tweeted sam van den plas policy director of carbon market watch a brussels based nonprofit four weeks later another european oil major royal dutch shell delivered another tanker load of lng to a port in taiwan it too was labeled carbon neutral thanks to the company s investment in forest projects in ghana indonesia and peru that date back more than a decade raising further questions about the environmental value of purchasing such legacy carbon credits the practice of dirty industries offsetting their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits has long been disparaged by some environmentalists as a fig leaf to cover business as usual that rarely delivers real gains for the atmosphere yet these credits are suddenly back in vogue as u s and global corporations respond to new climate policies from the biden administration and mounting calls for corporate action to slow global warming this month the wall street journal reported that the american petroleum institute will endorse carbon pricing which will likely lead to giants such as exxonmobil buying carbon credits in the future meanwhile the world s airlines have agreed that beginning this year they will cover any further increases in their emissions with carbon offsets these developments come as the gap between the pr surrounding some carbon credits and reality has widened critics warn of a growing market in outdated credits that offer no carbon benefit for the planet since the carbon saving projects they were once intended to fund have long been in operation without the benefit of sales of credits the market contains hundreds of millions of tons of poor quality credits says mark maslin of university college london co author of a new analysis written with trove research a u k based carbon market analyst there are increasing calls from industry and the finance sector to reform markets in carbon credits to improve their performance in delivering actual carbon reductions banks are questioning whether they could be putting up money for credits that are of dubious climate benefit carbon credits are provided for activities that claim to benefit the climate either by removing co2 from the air or preventing it being emitted in the first place such projects might include low carbon energy generation or planting or conserving trees often called nature based solutions intermediaries act as verifiers and brokers selling the credits to companies that wish to offset their emissions in theory the sales fund the project which would not otherwise have happened the danger is that some of these projects would have happened regardless because they perform other valuable services and did not require the extra funding in which case the offsets can be an illusion and the only effect is to allow the polluter to carry on emitting co2 the concern is greatest for credits generated by early wind farms and other sources of renewable energy some of them projects that are 10 or more years old the cost of producing renewable energy has crashed in the past decade and they generally no longer need subsidizing with carbon credits in their early days did not always deliver their hoped for climate impacts bruno vander velde of conservation international who has promoted nature based carbon credits wrote in a recent blog post major advances have been made in the past decade in ensuring their effectiveness however he noted that nature based offsets represent one of the only immediate and effective ways for some high emitting industries to abate hard to cut emissions but reform he wrote is needed to raise standards many financiers appear to agree with a resurgence of interest in buying carbon credits banks are increasingly questioning whether they could be putting up money for credits of dubious climate benefit in january a taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets headed by mark carney a former bank of england governor who is now un special envoy on climate finance announced plans to launch a cleaned up and more credible carbon market in london that might soon trade 100 million a year in credits the basis for the environmental benefit of selling carbon credits is that they offer additionality either by removing carbon from the atmosphere such as by planting trees or by preventing emissions from other sources for instance by replacing coal burning with wind turbines or protecting forests from deforestation but trove ceo guy turner contends that more than 60 percent of credits on the market are from projects that have questionable additionality claims including old renewable energy projects a tanker carrying liquefied natural gas that oil giant total calls carbon neutral because of credits purchased from a 10 year old wind farm credit total calculating this additionality is usually hard it depends on a counterfactual what would have happened without the project would the coal fired power station have been built would the forest being conserved have been destroyed how long will the planted trees survive was the finance from selling the credits the critical factor in whether the carbon reduction project went ahead the answers are often unknowable to outsiders as the authors of a carbon offset guide published in 2019 by the stockholm environment institute and ghg management institute put it only a project developer can say whether the prospect of selling carbon offset credits was truly decisive but regardless of the truth every project developer has an incentive to argue that it was nobody doubts that conservation and renewable energy projects can and often do keep carbon out of the air and some projects genuinely do need the cash from selling credits to get them off the ground some large environment groups including the nature conservancy are supportive of carbon credits as a means of generating money for nature based solutions to climate change tnc sells credits connected with arranging environmental easements to prevent future damage to protected areas but the risk of wishful thinking or even fraud exists critics such as turner contend a majority of carbon credits generated by such projects may fall into that category the good carbon saving schemes risk being lost in an avalanche of dodgy credits over the last two decades a sizable industry has grown up around certifying and marketing these carbon credits the credits that total purchased to offset its lng shipment represent the emissions saved when huadian power international corporation built the 100 megawatt wind farm rather than a coal fired power station project documents in 2011 claimed that without the project electricity on the north china power grid would continue to come mainly from burning fossil fuels on that basis huadian claimed credits of 225 000 tons of co2 per year some of which total later bought but china s energy system did not evolve as forecast in the past decade the country has been building hundreds of wind farms often without recourse to carbon credits it currently has 280 gigawatts of wind capacity yet the credits from the early wind farms continue to be sold as if nothing had changed where critics ask is the additionality total did not respond to a request to answer that question similar questions persist around the three forest projects that shell says offset its recent lng shipments one of them is from a 370 000 acre project to protect swamp forests at katingan in indonesian borneo the project began in 2007 and issued credits on the basis that the forest would otherwise be cut down for industrial acacia plantations that eventuality was the baseline from which carbon benefits were calculated the project website carries a live update of co2 it says the project has kept out of the air by preventing this deforestation the claimed offset increases by a ton every five seconds and at the time of writing was more than 39 6 million tons shell and volkswagen have each bought credits with their cash helping to fund the projects but whether their purchases made any difference on the ground say critics is far from clear in a statement shell said it only trades credits that have been assessed by independent third party processes greenpeace claims the credits are illusory because the plantation plan was conjecture and the forest has been covered since 2011 by a national moratorium on new forest concessions permian global the company that organized the credit sales provided evidence that a plantation company had applied to take over a third of the project area in 2008 and was only thwarted by the prior establishment of the project but the belief that the remaining two thirds would ultimately have gone the same way assumes that any projected applicants would have found ways to get around the moratorium trade in carbon credits began as part of the 1997 un kyoto protocol the first international agreement to cut co2 emissions its clean development mechanism cdm allowed industrialized countries to reduce emissions abroad where that might be cheaper than at home such as by planting trees in the tropics but in practice most trading has been in voluntary markets in which companies buy credits some originating under the cdm a sizable industry has grown up around certifying and marketing these credits the katingan project from which shell has purchased carbon credits began in 2007 and has helped protect swamp forests in indonesian borneo credit katingan project to date credits for about a billion tons of co2 have been put up for sale to would be carbon offsetters on the voluntary market but there have been more sellers than buyers the surplus is getting bigger every year says maslin at the moment 600 700 million tons of old carbon credits could be claimed which is seven to eight times the current annual demand turner says that although in principle historic credits may have some legitimacy in practice they risk swamping the market with little or no additionality and so little or no climate benefit others agree a 2016 report for the european union by martin cames of the oko institut in freiburg germany concluded that only 2 percent of past cdm projects have a high likelihood of delivering the promised benefits to the atmosphere the cdm is a zombie market it has not helped to reduce emissions says gilles dufrasne policy officer at carbon market watch the cdm was due to shut down last year as the kyoto protocol is replaced by the paris accord but the required meetings were never held because of the pandemic and it lives on dufrasne says credits from some cdm projects have been allowed for trading under a new international aviation carbon trading scheme that starts this year some tech companies have already taken the lead in the recent upsurge of purchases of carbon credits microsoft has purchased 1 3 million tons worth from 26 projects many of these credits are new in january micosoft bought newly created credits from an australian cattle ranch wilmot cattle which says that in three years its careful grazing systems have added 40 000 tons of carbon to its soils while many tech companies say they see purchasing carbon credits as an interim solution as they work to eliminate their emissions entirely other corporations plan on continued growth in credit purchases italian oil major eni said in november that it was aiming to increase its carbon credit portfolio to 10 million tons of co2 per annum by 2025 and 30 million annually by 2050 delivering an 80 percent reduction in net emissions if companies want to stop contributing to climate change a recent report noted they should first reduce their own emissions turner of trove research predicts that corporate spending on credits will rise 20 fold in the next decade to more than 10 billion he fears much of that demand could be met from the surplus stocks of dubious old credits so what should be done some want to reform the existing carbon credit markets to weed out the junk new rules are needed to exclude older credits from the market says university college london s maslin turner hopes carney s proposed new bigger voluntary market can clean up the business but dufrasne of carbon market watch calls the new initiative so far mostly a pr stunt for the financial sector to legitimize their new found enthusiasm for carbon markets last september a group of academics at oxford university came up with a set of principles for net zero aligned carbon offsetting they said that if companies want to end their contribution to climate change they should first reduce their own emissions then if they need offsets they should shift from projects that avoid emissions to projects that deliver direct carbon removal and they should concentrate on schemes that deliver the longest lasting co2 removal that means chemically capturing carbon from the air or stack emissions and burying it underground it would effectively exclude offsets that use trees and soils to suck up carbon because of what oxford ecologist and co author yadvinder malhi calls the risk of reversal if ecosystems are degraded another group of around 50 academics and activists who wrote to carney in december took a similar line

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news what does the average person from a western country really know about nio what does an american or european who holds nio stock actually know about the company that is what i have been asking myself ever since i tried the european version of the nio es8 and met the nio norway team i returned to the netherlands and have not stopped learning since after some background about things most readers might already know about nio and our experience with the team in norway i will get to what was discussed during our interview with the general manager of nio norway feel free to see our video of the interview and see for yourself his big smile and enthusiasm for the work nio is doing the third part of the article will go over some really wild and unique benefits nio customers in china can use their nio points for nio refresher course when it comes to nio what would people consider to be common knowledge some might remember their troubled balance sheet in the early years that they have since resolved some might remember that they have the chinese state s seal of approval and are thus unlikely to fail because of it they might know that nio does not have its own factory yet that it partnered with intel mobileye for autonomy and that it successfully introduced battery swapping in china but all in all that barely scratches the surface of an inherently chinese success story that has not yet been translated into english by the media in my previous article and video about the nio es8 i explained that i discovered that the company s products are shockingly good so good that they will give tesla a run for its money and make the tesla community envious at times also as elon has implied on twitter chinese evs are going to become tesla s biggest competitors and the extent of that has not yet become apparent however there is a human centric story about the customer experience behind all of this incredible technology and it s a bigger part of nio than you know nio norway our experience later in this article we will give some really cool examples about nio in china but first let s start with what we were able to observe in person when we were in norway to get to the site where nio was showing off the es8 there was an hour long bus ride most of the journalists that day were norwegian and they chose to go there using their own cars so the electric bus was fairly empty the first thing i found interesting was that the nio representative who was chosen to greet journalists and potential clients was not from the pr department he was instead an employee from the service division and on the way there we got to talk at length he in fact used to work for tesla according to him working for nio was a lot more pleasant and more fun it seemed like this employee and everyone else on the nio team who i talked to felt free to give their honest opinions and were incredibly friendly casual and genuinely excited in their conversations with all the journalists and potential customers at the event in my line of work i feel like i had never been treated better by a company than i was by nio even though it was not part of nio s half day program we were allowed to stay longer and properly document the car as can be seen in the review article and review video nio answered all of our technical questions and even shared some information they made us pinky swear not to share prematurely slight exaggeration there nio s actions enabled us to give you a better more correct assessment of the vehicle and its capabilities even if some details remain under wraps i truly applaud nio for the way it handled this as you will find out in the coming years the customer service experience is extremely important to nio and i would be surprised if a few years from now nio s community didn t rival that of the various tesla owners clubs especially considering how nio is actively fueling this in china more about that after the interview the interview here is the most important information that we learned from our interview with marius hayler the general manager of nio could you maybe talk about the nio house design we are currently sitting in nio house is something new in the automotive industry at least for europe in china the whole market already has the nio house and we are going to open it in oslo on september 30th here we are currently in a temporary experience center so this is just a touch feel preview of how it s going to look like it is so refreshing how open and friendly you are to both the journalists and potential clients you have invited something that was once the case with tesla many years ago but is a charm they have since lost could you tell us about this thank you for appreciating that we try to share as much as possible who we are i think it is very important for journalists and especially the users so that they get to know us the people around the brand and also the brand itself we have to open up to show what kind of service quality we would like to offer could you also mention how this ties into your autonomy within nio that you mentioned previously nio norway was established in march this year so we are a pretty young company then as for our autonomy we and our european team have some autonomy from our friends and colleagues in china we already have the best practices from china which we are trying to adapt as much as possible into the norwegian market so to answer your question our autonomy within the company is what will let us make nio a perfect fit for our users so i am asking this assuming that other european countries will also get a chance to do this a part of your autonomy from nio is also allowing you to create the software and features that will make nio fit well within norway like i don t know using local weather apps program road particularities voice assistant functions can you tell us what you nio norway are doing to make the car ready for the norwegian consumer for the product itself we have been doing a pretty good job to make it in a way that will fit 100 for the norwegian users why well for example nomi you could say that she is undergoing a language course right now so when we launch the car it is going to be fluent in norwegian or for example as you also mentioned the traffic signs it is very important that the car recognizes norwegian traffic signs so everything there is taken care of as well and do you think that this strategy will let nio expand into europe faster than your other non european competitors that are trying to enter the market this of course we will see but i think with the quality job that the team is doing and the lessons learned also from launching a new brand in norway will help our colleagues in the rest of europe later on so you already have a partnership with tidal i assume you guys are also working on spotify and youtube music what i was wondering is will you also have something like youtube netflix a web browser an app store we will as you said already have a pretty nice lineup with apps when we launch and this is just a start we will see what will come in the future but we will not stop here we will continue developing and new software will become available as over the air updates so during your presentation a journalist asked whether nio would be willing to share its battery swapping technology with other automakers could you repeat your answer for us that was a good question and the answer is yes nio is very open to sharing this fantastic battery swapping and battery swapping station technology with other carmakers i think it s smart because it could create a standard for the automotive industry which is again good for the users you know when i heard that i had to think back to a tesla investor call some years ago where elon musk made a very similar offer to share the supercharger network so long as other automakers agreed to pay their fair share for the electricity and expansion of the network since then none have taken him up on his offer and i always thought why it s such a great offer however now in comparison they really should not have accepted that offer they should accept nio s offer because with battery swapping they could get so far ahead haha yes you re right but on a different topic do you think that nio will build a factory somewhere in europe for the european consumers i don t have the answer to that but it might happen because we want to grow the miracle of nio in china so how did nio build a community within china and how much of it will come to norway and the rest of europe thanks to our recent nio coverage some of our readers and viewers in china have come forth with some very interesting experiences they had with nio in china and have claimed that the service is just as excellent as the product first and foremost the nio app the main screen isn t even the car controls instead the first thing you see is a pretty advanced social network of all the nio users discussing the brand their car giving tips and tricks in addition to giving a like if you found something useful you can even give them a tip that gives the person nio points which we will get to in a minute by pretty advanced social network we mean that users can leave comments add each other as friends chat create groups of people and even create their own events under a different tab the company also shares news with its users then under the next tab you basically get a nio guide for all things nio that you can find or do in the current city you are in from swapping stations visiting nio houses and their latest new beverages all the way to events nio is hosting or sponsoring that you as part of the nio community can attend then nio also has all kinds of promotions whether its a discount on charging at a select location or maybe a discount on some sort of specific product you could order through nio or even the hundreds of accessories you can buy for the car from all weather matts to a cute little winter hat or sombrero for the cute little nomi assistant on the car s dashboard that doesn t even touch the whole range of merchandise the company offers from t shirts to suitcases then we get to the dozen services that nio provides to people in china the most obvious is the instant customer service in the form of an instant messaging chat where you can drop a message and get a response from nio though i think my favorite example is the designated driver service where if your visit to the bar with friends resulted in more than the only one beer you said you would have you can use your nio points to have a person come to you and drive you home in your own car if nio is going to offer this kind of service outside china i am certain it would be an enormous hit in many countries in europe and especially in the us where public transportation is underdeveloped tesla s legal hands off self driving functionality is still a few years off yet nio has found a very creative human centric solution to part of this problem then some of you might have already heard of nio power a service where an electric van will come to you to charge your car wherever you are like for example if you are stuck at work all day with a nearly depleted battery right before you go on a long trip however it now turns out that nio has more services like this from getting the car washed while you are away to having the car picked up and a scratch on the door repainted in the service center before the car is returned to you all in a day s work when the car would have been sitting idle there is even a service where you can easily park in an easy to access parking spot at the airport and have nio repark your car in the more secure and cheaper long term parking then whereas tesla s most reliable feedback system is elon musk occasionally responding to tweets he comes across nio has a feature for that in the app because nio is very feedback oriented something we have already witnessed in norway in person though this all does bring up an important question how many of these services are actually viable outside of china where the minimum wage is significantly higher hopefully we will find out more on october 1st when nio launches the car and the nio house have a tip

bundled against mongolia s frigid late november air thousands clamored to see and hear the dalai lama four years ago their boots crunching against a dusting of snow at the gandantegchinlen monastery in ulaanbaatar mongolia s officials insisted then in 2016 that the visit was strictly religious and had nothing to do with politics the country has connections to tibetan buddhism that reach back hundreds of years the title dalai lama is actually of mongolian origin of course that mattered little to china which views the octogenarian spiritual leader as a separatist beijing promptly canceled meetings with its mongolian counterparts and slapped fees on commodity imports from mongolia which was already suffering from an economic downturn a month later the mongolian government said the dalai lama was no longer welcome he has not returned since tsakhia elbegdorj mongolia s president at the time told me recently that the decision was as was widely assumed due to pressure from the south a reference to china with which mongolia shares a border elbegdorj has an outsize role in modern mongolian politics he served two terms as the country s president from 2009 to 2017 and prior to that two terms as prime minister he was one of the leaders of the 1990 democratic revolution that peacefully ended seven decades of mongolia s serving as a soviet satellite state given his country s location hemmed in by russia and china two countries that really don t like our way of life as elbegdorj put it and its economic dependence on beijing he has spent much of his political life interacting with the highest levels of the chinese government by his count he has met chinese president xi jinping some 30 times in 2015 xi hailed china mongolia relations as the best ever now a harsh and high profile critic of beijing s recent efforts to stamp out the mongolian language and its distinctive vertical script in inner mongolia an ostensibly autonomous region within china that is distinct from mongolia elbegdorj and his country offer an extreme example of the difficulties facing nations that are heavily reliant on beijing those challenges are amplified for places such as mongolia democracies that profess even limited support for human rights china s economic and military power allow it to demand uncomfortable concessions and as the country becomes more and more antagonistic its less powerful neighbors are left with little room for maneuver how then does a smaller nation choose between its values and its interests of course when you are in office you have certain responsibilities elbegdorj told me in one of two recent interviews struggling at times to square his current vocal denunciations of chinese policies with his more muted tone when he occupied the highest echelons of government but when you are out of office you also have more freedom to express your ideas when i asked him whether he still believed as his foreign minister said four years ago that the dalai lama should be barred from visiting he was briefly evasive before relenting i ll say it publicly now we are always happy to see his holiness in mongolia when elbegdorj a journalist turned democracy advocate became president in 2009 the country was becoming one of superlatives it was briefly the world s fastest growing economy powered largely by mineral wealth housing the world s best performing stock exchange located in what is often referred to as the coldest capital city in the world prospectors geologists heavy equipment operators and a stream of carpetbaggers of all varieties arrived from australia the u s and europe the boom brought flashes of wealth to soviet influenced ulaanbaatar ostentatiously kitted out hummers idled in traffic inching past the softly lit glass front of a louis vuitton store the city s last statue of vladimir lenin came down in 2012 the boom would prove short lived by 2017 the country needed a bailout from the international monetary fund while he upgraded relations with china elbegdorj also worked to bring mongolia to a more prominent position on the international stage involving it more heavily in the united nations and other multinational groups he had a moment of viral stardom when former president barack obama inadvertently obscured his face during a 2011 photo op he pushed for the abolition of the death penalty which when it occurred in 2015 brought praise from human rights groups president elect joe biden in 2011 hailed mongolia under elbegdorj as an emerging leader in the worldwide democratic movement the enthusiasm was tempered a year later though when elbegdorj faced u s and un criticism for the jailing of a former president but praise from the west for democratic progress cannot make up for uncomfortable geography mongolia s strong economic dependence on china is worrisome oyunsuren damdinsuren a senior lecturer at the national university of mongolia s school of international relations and public administration told me if china decides not to buy mongolian products our economy will be paralyzed this power imbalance has helped fuel broad anti chinese sentiment among mongolia s population aided by a history of 200 years of manchu rule 70 years of anti china communist propaganda and 30 years of china bashing electoral campaigns damdinsuren said read what happens when china leads the world the dalai lama s visit was not elbegdorj s first or only china related controversy two years earlier in 2014 his country s officials stopped two mongol rights advocates from inner mongolia who had made their way across the border and were reportedly seeking exile the pair were sent back to china and what has happened to them since is unclear elbegdorj took both domestic and foreign criticism for the move at the time and indeed still does he now calls the incident an unfortunate mistake but claims that the decision was made without his input he added that mongolia s current government led by a populist political rival should take a stronger stand and allow inner mongolians to seek refuge i m openly saying to our government don t give those people back to china he told me they should be granted refugee status unbounded by elected office in recent months elbegdorj has emerged as one of the most consistent and highest profile critics of beijing s attempts to curb mongolian language and culture both within its own borders and internationally during our conversations he repeatedly said that his outspokenness was not caused by a sudden shift in his thinking though he acknowledged that there is a distinct challenge in the diplomatic balancing act required to run a country so dependent on china i didn t change he said when pressed on these seeming contradictions my standing to keep and continue to protect mongolian identity language culture and script since i entered public life it remains the same rather he told me the chinese actually changed and he noted what he called a very aggressive assimilation policy being undertaken by the authorities in inner mongolia young women in mongolian ceremonial clothing watched over by chinese police at opening ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the inner mongolia autonomous region china james whitlow delano redux the full scope of these efforts came to light in september when china started transitioning students in inner mongolia to using state compiled textbooks and changing the language of lessons from mongolian to mandarin chinese the situation drew speculation that the mongols of inner mongolia would soon be treated like minorities in tibet and xinjiang two regions where china has gone to extraordinary lengths to assimilate ethnic tibetan and uighur populations with the national han chinese majority beijing has responded to criticism of its inner mongolia policy with predictable furor chinese officials have singled out elbegdorj deploying a familiar tactic of accusing him of meddling in its internal affairs he disagrees with the assessment this is not a foreign issue he told me it is an issue related with my language it is an issue related with my culture it is an issue related with my tradition mongolians who live in inner mongolia mongolians who live in mongolia they are the same people the same blood the same traditions the same history elbegdorj s activism has so far been confined to mongolia a decision over which he has little say he is facing a corruption probe and has been barred from leaving the country for the past few months he told me he denies the charges and said the investigation was politically motivated read the end of hong kong mongols make up about 17 percent of the population of inner mongolia the group has sometimes been described as a model minority within china though notable flare ups have occurred mongolian nationalists have not been as openly radical as uighurs and tibetans and beijing s repression there is not nearly as severe as in xinjiang or tibet according to christopher p atwood a professor of east asian languages and civilizations at the university of pennsylvania society and culture within inner mongolia remains legible to han chinese in a way that uyghur and tibetan society and culture seen through the lenses of islamophobia and secularist discourses about primitive superstition has not been atwood recently wrote beijing has also generally taken a soft approach to mongolia never muscling in for example on a major mining project julian dierkes an associate public policy professor at the university of british columbia who is an expert on mongolia has long argued that this dynamic is due in part to nervousness about china s sizable domestic mongolian community and the potential for ethnic conflict there has always been this implicit concern or threat around having a large minority population that actually has a country outside to which it refers unlike uighurs and unlike tibetans he told me elbegdorj similarly described the mongols of inner mongolia as a living wall protecting mongolia from china these factors made it more alarming when in july initial reports of the education reforms began to surface as the start of a new school year drew near petitions against the move circulated on chinese social media and a number of popular bands backed calls for the decision to be reversed students and their parents staged large protests china s response was swift according to human rights groups the authorities carried out numerous arrests harassed journalists censored social media and sacked academics who spoke out in a september letter delivered to the chinese embassy in ulaanbaatar and addressed to xi elbegdorj opened with a stinging line you perhaps have heard and are aware of the fundamental provision in the constitution of your country that states all nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages which is now being flagrantly infringed upon with respect to the mongolian children of inner mongolia the chinese ambassador was incensed dismissing elbegdorj s claims as baseless hype and the letter was promptly returned elbegdorj told me a few weeks before we spoke that his brother had received a menacing phone call warning him that elbegdorj should stop his advocacy and keep quiet the call he said came from a chinese phone number china has not confined its efforts to erase mongolian identity to its own borders château des ducs de bretagne a medieval castle in nantes france houses a natural history museum that was until recently preparing to host an exhibition on the 13th century mongol emperor genghis khan organized in collaboration with the inner mongolia museum in hohhot china as preparations progressed however chinese officials began asking that words such as empire mongol and even the name genghis khan be removed from the exhibit the museum director bertrand guillet wrote in a statement they then went further demanding that the exhibition synopsis be rewritten by beijing the text that emerged was aimed at making mongolian history and culture completely disappear for the benefit of a new national story according to guillet he finally postponed the exhibit in the name of the human scientific and ethical values defended by the institution it will open at a later date but with collections from europe and america rather than china mongolian politicians have been loath to speak out likely worried by beijing s reaction the power imbalance was again made clear when china s top diplomat foreign minister wang yi visited mongolia in september and was met by protesters angry over the actions in inner mongolia neither wang nor mongolia s current president made any public statement on the situation but the chinese ambassador in an interview with a local newspaper noted that china s demand for mongolia s biggest export earner coal was falling the implication was clear frankly he was reported as saying we are working in your interests
finance minister shaukat tarin is sanguine about pakistan s business economic and financial situation he is all praise for the pakistan single window psw for expected reduction in complications and costs of doing business in pakistan while such initiatives are likely to be good for pakistan s economy there are aspects of the current situation and their implications for common people that deserve attention the government has been talking about ease of doing business and enabling the country to unlock its potential in becoming a hub for regional as well as international trade and transit there are hurdles which have prevented pakistan from achieving these ideals arguably the most important impediment is the government s inability to eliminate hidden costs that not only the business and industrial community bears in pakistan but regular people also end up paying a huge price for them with inefficiencies in the governance of the economic and financial sectors there appears to be some disconnect among various ministries and departments that make vital decisions regarding the economy agriculture banking customs deficit management and depreciation of currency exports financial regulation goods manufacturing health of the economy inflation jurisdictions of fbr and nab and many other areas appear to be functioning in conflicting directions relevant departments do talk about process reengineering but it remains an elusive term pakistan s ports remain uncompetitive transaction costs remain high and value added services are reeling regulatory departments are working arbitrarily and cross broad trade with neighbouring countries remains negligible as our major trading benefactors remain the eu saudi arabia usa uae and uk many of whom we are not happy with regarding their stance on the afghan taliban though the paris club of creditor countries has given pakistan another extension to service its debt so that it can dedicate its resources to combating the covid 19 pandemic it is a temporary relief now pakistan has until december to make the payment the resources freed by this initiative will be handy in spending to mitigate the economic and health impact of the covid 19 crisis it needs some highlighting that the country s debt amounts to some 90 percent of its gdp and pakistan s debt service for the 2020 21 fiscal year totaled nearly 57 billion pakistan still owes 11 5 billion to the paris club with this background stocks in the country have been plunging regularly and knocked off 223 points on sept 24 from the kse 100 index this past week the losing spree continued wiping off over 1500 points from the index geopolitical tensions have a lot to do with this and the government must take cognizance of it while advocating the case for world recognition of the new taliban regime in afghanistan related to this is also the hike in sbp interest rates to 7 25 percent the widening current account deficit with an upward spiral in imports and major devaluation of the rupee are resulting in soaring inflation then we also have an upcoming meeting with the imf in october all this deserves a more circumspect approach by the government and its economic managers as the citizens of this country are concerned about what lies ahead for them by the end of this year

four space tourists safely ended their trailblazing trip to orbit saturday with a splashdown in the atlantic off the florida coast their spacex capsule parachuted into the ocean just before sunset not far from where their chartered flight began three days earlier the all amateur crew was the first to circle the world without a professional astronaut the billionaire who paid undisclosed millions for the trip and his three guests wanted to show that ordinary people could blast into orbit by themselves and spacex founder elon musk took them on as the company s first rocket riding tourists your mission has shown the world that space is for all of us spacex mission control radioed it was a heck of a ride for us just getting started replied trip sponsor jared isaacman referring to the growing number of private flights on the horizon spacex s fully automated dragon capsule reached an unusually high altitude of 363 miles 585 kilometers after wednesday night s liftoff surpassing the international space station by 100 miles 160 kilometers the passengers savored views of earth through a big bubble shaped window added to the top of the capsule the four streaked back through the atmosphere early saturday evening the first space travelers to end their flight in the atlantic since apollo 9 in 1969 spacex s two previous crew splashdowns carrying astronauts for nasa were in the gulf of mexico within a few minutes a pair of spacex boats pulled up alongside the bobbing capsule when the capsule s hatch was opened on the recovery ship health care worker hayley arceneaux was the first one out flashing a big smile and thumbs up all appeared well and happy their families were waiting near the scene of wednesday night s launch from nasa s kennedy space center this time nasa was little more than an encouraging bystander its only tie being the kennedy launch pad once used for the apollo moonshots and shuttle crews but now leased by spacex isaacman 38 an entrepreneur and accomplished pilot aimed to raise 200 million for st jude children s research hospital donating 100 million himself he held a lottery for one of the four seats late saturday musk tweeted he was donating 50 million putting them over the top for the last seat isaacman held a competition for clients of his allentown pennsylvania payment processing business shift4 payments joining him on the

had time to chat with st jude patients conduct medical tests on themselves ring the closing bell for the new york stock exchange and do some drawing and ukulele playing arceneaux the youngest american in space and the first with a prosthesis assured her patients i was a little girl going through cancer treatment just like a lot of you and if i can do this you can do this they also took calls from tom cruise interested in his own spacex flight to the space station for filming and the rock band u2 s bono even their space menu wasn t typical cold pizza and sandwiches but also pasta bolognese and mediterranean lamb before beginning descent sembroski was so calm that he was seen in the capsule watching the 1987 mel brooks film spaceballs on his tablet what an amazing adventure he tweeted later congratulations streamed in including from the association of space explorers to its four newest members aside from trouble with a toilet fan and a bad temperature sensor in an engine the flight went exceedingly well officials said some of the four passengers experienced motion sickness when they reached orbit just as some astronauts do it was a very clean mission from start to finish said benji reed a spacex senior director reed anticipates as many as six private flights a year for spacex sandwiched between astronaut launches for nasa four spacex flights are already booked to carry paying customers to the space station accompanied by former nasa astronauts the first is targeted for early next year with three businessmen paying 55 million apiece russia also plans to take up an actor and film director for filming next month and a japanese tycoon in december customers interested in quick space trips are turning to richard branson s virgin galactic and jeff bezos blue origin the two

olga r rodriguez associated press san francisco pacific gas electric was charged friday with involuntary manslaughter and other crimes after its equipment sparked a northern california wildfire that killed four people and destroyed hundreds of homes last year prosecutors said it is the latest legal action against the nation s largest utility which pleaded guilty last year to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in a 2018 blaze ignited by its long neglected electrical grid that nearly destroyed the town of paradise and became the deadliest u s wildfire in a century shasta county district attorney stephanie bridgett announced the 31 charges including 11 felonies against pg e saying it failed to perform its legal duties and that its failure was reckless and criminally negligent and it resulted in the death of four people if the utility is convicted of involuntary manslaughter the punishment would be a fine for each person killed in the zogg fire last year near the city of redding a corporation can t go to jail so we re talking fines fees the ability for the court to order remedial and corrective measures bridgett said one of our primary functions here is to hold them responsible and let the surviving families know that their loved one did not die in vain she added pg e ceo patti poppe said failing to prevent the fire was not a crime this was a tragedy four people died and my coworkers are working so hard to prevent fires and the catastrophic losses that come with them they have dedicated their careers to it criminalizing their judgment is not right poppe said in a statement in a filing with the securities and exchange commission the utility said it intends to vigorously defend itself against the charges we ve accepted cal fire s determination reached earlier this year that a tree contacted our electric line and started the zogg fire poppe said in the same statement released friday by pg e in the wake of bridgett s announcement of the charges we accept that conclusion but we did not commit a crime the wind whipped zogg fire began on sept 27 2020 and raged through rugged terrain and small communities west of redding killing four people burning about 200 homes and blackening about 87 square miles 225 square kilometers of land three of the victims died as they tried to outrun the blaze and were found inside or near their vehicles a fourth victim died at a hospital in march state fire investigators concluded that the blaze was sparked by a gray pine tree that fell onto a pg e distribution line shasta and tehama counties have sued the utility alleging negligence saying pg e had failed to remove the tree even though it had been marked for removal two years earlier the utility says the tree was subsequently cleared to stay the district attorney determined that the company was criminally liable for the fire the charges friday include enhancements for injury to a 29 year old firefighter who was hit by a falling tree that fractured his spine paralyzing him from the chest down they also include felony arson counts linked to several fires started by the utility s equipment in shasta county over the last year bridgett said pg e which has an estimated 16 million customers in central and northern california filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 after its aging equipment was blamed for a series of fires including the 2018 camp fire that killed 85 people and destroyed 10 000 homes in paradise and neighboring communities company officials have acknowledged that pg e hasn t lived up to expectations in the past but said changes in leadership and elsewhere ensure it s on the right track and will do better they have listed a wide range of improvements that include using more advanced technology to avoid setting wildfires and help detect them quicker pg e also remains on criminal probation for a 2010 pipeline explosion in the san francisco bay area city of san bruno that killed eight people giving a federal judge oversight of the company the judge and california power regulators have rebuked pg e for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the company has acknowledged that its equipment may have played a role in sparking this summer s dixie fire which has burned nearly 1 million acres and is now the second largest wildfire in state history pg e emerged from bankruptcy last summer and negotiated a 13 5 billion settlement with some wildfire victims but it still faces both civil and criminal actions including charges from the sonoma county district attorney s office over the 2019 kincade fire that forced nearly 200 000 people to evacuate in the meantime most of the roughly 70 000 victims who have filed claims for the devastation caused by pg e s past misdeeds still are awaiting payment from a trust created during the bankruptcy the trust which is run independently of pg e is facing a nearly 2 billion shortfall because half its funding came in company stock

bloomberg the easing of u s and u k travel restrictions is breathing new life into european airline stocks british airways owner iag sa has been the star of the show in the last two weeks soaring 21 after the white house said america would open up to vaccinated foreigners and the u k relaxed coronavirus testing requirements for fully jabbed arrivals air france klm and deutsche lufthansa ag have also rallied strongly as have budget carriers such as ryanair holdings plc but investors are divided on whether the gains can last and the industry has been a laggard for a long time european airlines remain about 25 below pre pandemic levels underperforming sectors like industrials and retail which are up as much as 30 from where they were back then the catalyst of air travel reopening could be just what they need for a more sustained revival though the possibility of fresh restrictions is a constant risk investors should look very seriously at so called reopening sectors like travel said alan custis head of u k equities at lazard asset management the opportunities now one would argue are much much better perversely than they would have been probably if the pandemic hadn t happened that s because excess capacity in aircraft hotel rooms and restaurants has been eliminated custis said in an interview there s been a sea change a similarly positive stance is held by mamta valechha an analyst at quilter cheviot which manages about 25 billion pounds 34 billion we do continue to see value in the travel sector particularly airlines which have been hit the hardest and are still way off their 2020 peaks valechha said positive news is starting to gather pace the relaxation of u s rules led to a surge in bookings from europe to the u s air france klm reported a spike in christmas bookings while lufthansa was upgraded at goldman sachs and while analysts have been slow to raise estimates for airlines consensus is on an upward slope data compiled by bloomberg suggests the sector could be profitable again within about a year other areas of the travel industry are also showing better signs tour operator tui ag added 10 in three days after britain said sept 17 that it would scale back testing requirements and simplify its country risk rankings booking software provider amadeus it group sa airport retailer wh smith plc and hotelier accor sa are among a raft of other stocks that have rebounded of late although all remain well below pre pandemic levels still investors may need to be patient travel stocks are a next year story said alasdair mckinnon lead manager of scottish investment trust plc this year has already gone from a leisure travel perspective as the main holiday season has passed he said the shift toward working from home meanwhile is still having a knock on effect for travel earnings according to quilter cheviot s valechha who estimates that corporate passengers make up 30 to 60 of airline revenue there remains much uncertainty when this will recover given the advancements in technology to do business remotely she said resurgence risk covid 19 s resurgence in key asian destinations also poses a risk for some firms such as london listed intercontinental hotels group plc according to hannah gooch peters an equity investment analyst at sanlam u k which manages about 4 9 billion pounds sanlam holds travel stocks like ihg but reduced its exposure in february the valuations of these companies are not looking that compelling gooch peters said in an interview what we need is a more synchronized recovery globally for these stocks to really see a big increase from here for gavin launder a fund manager at legal general investment management investors looking at airline stocks need to be able to trust that the next reopening wave won t be followed by another setback i think it s very clear that people want to travel launder said so that will be a good trade at some point but we need that confidence that it s going to be a bit more than a false start 2021 bloomberg l p
the fortress like building at 6885 elm street in mclean has no sign indicating it s the headquarters of a multinational corporation as you approach the building the only clue suggesting the presence of mars inc is the warning private property one of the best kept business secrets in washington is the presence of this family owned corporation in the virginia suburbs few washingtonians realize that the country s fifth largest private business is headquartered here the mars company and the family that owns the candy giant have turned secrecy into a way of life mars inc is the largest privately owned business in the washington area although only a few hundred of its employees work here it produces four of the country s top ten confections snickers number one m m s plain and peanut numbers three and four and milky way number seven the company also manufactures snack foods and ice cream novelties including dove bars leading subsidiaries of the mars company include uncle ben s maker of the country s most popular processed rice and kal kan foods a top pet food business worldwide the company owns 51 plants in 31 countries estimated revenues in 1994 11 billion mars inc is in its third generation of family leadership forrest mars jr 64 is chairman of the company ceo and co president with his brother john 60 their sister jacqueline mars vogel 56 works in the business and also sits on the board of the company which their 91 year old father forrest sr gave them in 1973 together they are trying to identify fourth generation family members who eventually may take the helm of mars inc the older members of the mars family seem uncomfortable with a place in the washington business world their family wealth is conservatively estimated at 14 billion but privacy is their religion they reject any leadership role that would thrust them into the spotlight in the late 1980s shortly after the mars family was added to the forbes list of america s 400 wealthiest individuals and families jacqueline known as jackie found herself seated at a dinner party near malcolm forbes the magazine s publisher incensed over what she perceived as the magazine s violation of her family s privacy she threatened to leave the party if the hostess did not switch her to another table the mars family did not inherit its love of anonymity from the company s founder frank mars who started the company in the early 1920s after failures in candy manufacturing and distribution relished his role as a business leader in 1923 the milky way bar became mars s brightest star by the early 30s frank had opened his oak park illinois plant to tours frank and his second wife ethel healy mars enjoyed their wealth and easily adapted to the role of social luminaries in the worst days of the depression frank and ethel enjoyed being chauffeured around chicago in a 20 000 deusenberg town car they purchased two getaway homes giving them names that left no ambiguity as to their owners identity one dubbed marlands was in wisconsin s lake region a few hours from mars headquarters then in chicago the other was a 2 700 acre tennessee showplace milky way farms racing stables the marses had more than 100 employees at milky way their tasks included hand raking fields where the registered hereford cattle grazed and polishing the stalls of polished oak that housed yearling thoroughbreds frank and ethel opened milky way to the public for fundraisers and public events ethel s station in mint julep society was assured when her horse gallahadion won the kentucky derby in 1940 as a young man frank s son forrest mars was quite unlike his father and stepmother when it came to living the good life while establishing a european division of the company in the 30s forrest was so parsimonious that his father in law sailed to england to insist that forrest s wife audrey meyer mars return to the united states with their young children public relations was not one of forrest s strengths during world war ii reader s digest published a story that praised converted rice and highlighted in particular forrest s uncle ben s brand as a result the us military approached forrest and asked him to share the uncle ben s patents with other rice manufacturers to maximize the amount of processed rice available to american troops forrest resisted the appeal and the war ended before he could be forced to share his secrets with competitors the lesson forrest sr took from this and taught his three children was that publicity even good publicity could have bad consequences forrest sr eventually loosened up and learned to enjoy his wealth in the late 40s he bought a 740 acre farm in the plains in virginia s hunt country and dubbed it marland in homage to his father s vacation home it was only an hour s drive from national airport giving forrest easy access to the new jersey m m plant subsequently he moved the company s headquarters from chicago to 15th street in downtown dc the farm was big as were the 300 steers and the hogs there that were fed the imperfect m m s that forrest had shipped from the new jersey plant nothing was wasted for forrest was still frugal he raised his three children forrest jr john and jackie to be the same way despite their attendance at such exclusive boarding schools as hotchkiss and miss hall s on weekends at home they worked at farm chores to earn spending money daughter jackie the youngest was never expected to work in the family business but her two brothers knew they would have to earn the respect of their father if they wanted to have any chance of succeeding him forrest sr acquiesced to an interview with candy industry confectioner s journal in 1966 after years of requests by the publication though favorable the profile enraged forrest who felt he had been misquoted and misunderstood in the nearly three decades since then he has kept his promise never to give another interview he avoids photographers too although he and audrey lived apart for much of their marriage while he was in the plains she kept a penthouse apartment at the watergate he would come to town at her request to escort her to the national symphony ball audrey would be dropped at the front of the building and enter the party alone forrest would enter through a side entrance to avoid photographers and slip into the ballroom through the kitchen one of the few pictures of forrest taken there shows him holding a napkin over his face in an attempt to avoid being caught by a flashbulb the transfer of power at mars from forrest sr to the next generation was not smooth the patriarch would not hesitate to ream out john and forrest jr sometimes calling them stupid in front of fellow executives there was the time forrest sr arrived at john s plant opening in the netherlands and seeing a fence he deemed unnecessary kicked it down while berating john in front of the assembled dignitaries the brothers still wince at the mention of their father s name and mars managers know better than to bring up the topic of forrest sr while with their father a few years ago john lost his temper and wheeled around to face the elderly man how long do i have to work for you dad shouted the son who was close to 60 years old the intergenerational tension has not kept john and forrest jr from emulating their father in one way publicity shyness neither will talk to the press or allow himself to be photographed for publication a few years ago forrest jr was spotted in national airport by a business acquaintance who called to gain his attention forrest forrest mars forrest strode over and rebuked the man don t ever call out my name in public even attorneys for the law firms here that represent the marses can be frustrated by their inability to get information from the company mars executives are taught that loose lips not only sink ships but produce pink slips travel plans are to be kept confidential if david badger mars manager in charge of sales in russia and eastern europe and the first husband of jackie mars vogel plans to fly to stupino russia where mars is building three plants to produce russian favorites snickers and mars bars as well as rice and pet food products he knows not to mention the trip to his colleagues the headquarters staff is aware that a casual question about an executive s travel location would be met with an admonition that people disappear for periods of time to unknown locations is only one of the reasons the mclean headquarters office is nicknamed the kremlin jackie mars vogel now in the process of divorcing second husband hank vogel is the only mars sibling whose lifestyle even comes close to reflecting her billionaire status she has put her estate in bedminster new jersey up for sale at 2 million and has bought a place in the plains called stonehall farm several miles from where she grew up at marland she also maintains her late mother s penthouse in the watergate where she is a next door neighbor of robert strauss the high profile lawyer and former ambassador to russia her father has sold marland and now lives in miami as philanthropists the marses set no records for generosity in 1993 when its revenues were estimated at 12 billion the company gave only 600 000 for distribution through the mars foundation checks from the foundation tend to be spread around and written for relatively small sums forrest jr and john are focused on business so mars charitable interests are usually administered by their wives or by jackie the national symphony orchestra has received larger donations from board member virginia mars since she divorced forrest jr in 1990 in the past virginia s gifts were constrained by her husband now that she has won 50 million as part of her divorce settlement she is free to donate to the symphony as she wishes one cause the family foundation supports is cancer research in september jackie chaired an american cancer society polo benefit in virginia it was held in memory of her mother audrey who had established cancer societies in asia australia and europe before the usa scotland polo match began jackie and virginia were conveyed around the field by a team of four cleveland bay hunters in a circa 1900 carriage while guests applauded mars answers allegations of cheapness by maintaining that it makes anonymous contributions that s a bit of a dodge says a local philanthropist the company doesn t encourage its executives to be active in community affairs and it s unlikely to hold any diversity training sessions an english executive reported that when forrest sr was scheduled to visit the plant in slough workers of color were asked to take the day off some mars employees have said that the atmosphere in the company s us offices makes african american employees uncomfortable last year a mars employee who was disabled by an accident in the mclean headquarters building and who now must rely on a cane for support was offended when john called her a cripple and referred to an employee with partial vision as a one eyed jack in front of mars associates several weeks later john approached the woman i guess i shouldn t have said what i did he said without further apology the contemporary marses rarely spend a lot of money on themselves forrest jr lives in rosslyn s weslie condominium where the price of a two bedroom apartment is about 500 000 he lives there alone he divorced virginia his wife of many years to marry deborah adair clarke with whom he became involved while she was working at mars headquarters deborah now lives in france and works for the mars company there john and wife adrienne recently put their five bedroom house in chain bridge forest on the market for 650 000 with their children grown the house is too large for them they re planning a move to smaller quarters in an area condominium the chain bridge house was offered by listing agent pat derwinski of weichert realtors who handles realty transactions for all area mars employees neither forrest s nor john s dwelling is the sort where you would expect a billionaire to live a recent tour of john s up for sale house which was comfortably but not extravagantly appointed required prospective buyers to make a quick two step around an awkwardly placed refrigerator before entering the tiny kitchen the mania for keeping a low profile sometimes has economic consequences for the family business since the 1980s the marses have been nervous about losing market share to hershey the decade began with a blunder when mars turned down the opportunity for an m m s product placement in steven spielberg s blockbuster movie e t although the company has loosened up since then it now promotes m m s through licensing of stuffed animals bed linens sold through sears and a children s picture book entitled the m m s brand counting book real damage was felt when spielberg substituted hershey s reese s pieces for m m s as the lovable extraterrestrial s favorite treat sales of reese s pieces jumped following the release of e t since that episode the company s market share has fallen mars candy is in second place in the us market with a market share of 23 2 percent compared with hershey s 26 6 percent according to food data base nestlé is a distant third at 10 percent worldwide however nestlé is king with revenues of 42 8 billion in 1994 as recently as 1979 mars enjoyed a full 14 percentage point lead over hershey that a relatively small company like hershey whose sales are virtually limited to north america and whose 1994 revenues were 3 6 billion compared with estimated revenues for mars of 11 billion could ascend over the larger mars company was a bitter morsel for mars to swallow mars is also losing customers in the dog eat dog pet food market of the mars subsidiaries only the uncle ben s brand is holding steady a measure of the mars company s own view of its financial condition is the increases over base salary it pays to employees historically when goals have been met mars workers and managers have earned as much as 16 percent over their base salary for the last several years sales based increases for managers have hovered at around 10 percent in fact washington business journal has estimated that mars revenues fell by 1 billion between 1993 and 1994 from 12 billion to 11 billion although the corporation shies away from public disclosure it does not hesitate to try to influence lawmakers mars is considered one of the most effective american companies at having its positions articulated on the hill this fall the florida sugar cane league was feeling bruised and battered from its battles with mars and others that were pushing the republican congress to permit the import of unlimited amounts of foreign sugar the next generation of family members may want to avoid controversies over sugar imports and other headaches associated with running a multinational company in a highly competitive food market especially given that all ten children of the fourth generation have trust funds seven of them forrest s four daughters and john s daughter and two sons have worked for mars jackie s three children have not shown any interest in the family business although the kind of criticism that the brothers took from their father has not been revisited upon their own children the competition between the two brothers which has caused fissures in the ranks over the years is also being played out in the following generation the marses seem certain to keep the company in family hands they would rather sell out to a larger company such as nestlé than consider taking the company public even if they could retain a share of the business public disclosure required of a company listed on any stock exchange would be torture for this family mars managers assume that john wants the company to stay in family hands so it can be passed on to sons frank who has worked at the company s ethel m plant in nevada and mike who is running a packaging company that sells styrofoam and other materials to the mars company john s only daughter linda who is reserved like her father is living in arizona and raising horses forrest s daughters victoria valeria pamela and marijke markie are considered more seasoned than their male cousins pamela is stationed in the mars office in australia that exports to asia forrest for his part would like to see the company end up being run by one or more of his daughters in terms of privacy the fourth generation of marses may not differ from their parents when a local photographer recently snapped four attractive young women standing together at a middleburg party he asked them their names we re the mars sisters replied forrest s daughters well what are your first names asked the photographer the young women became coy if you know that we re the mars sisters then you should know that we won t tell you our first names then they laughed and turning as one walked away jan pottker

aboard the ocean warrior in the eastern pacific ocean it s 3 a m and after five days plying through the high seas the ocean warrior is surrounded by an atoll of blazing lights that overtakes the nighttime sky welcome to the party says third officer filippo marini as the spectacle floods the ship s bridge and interrupts his overnight watch it s the conservationists first glimpse of the world s largest fishing fleet an armada of nearly 300 chinese vessels that have sailed halfway across the globe to lure the elusive humboldt squid from the pacific ocean s inky depths as italian hip hop blares across the bridge marini furiously scribbles the electronic ids of 37 fishing vessels that pop up as green triangles on the ocean warrior s radar onto a sheet of paper before they disappear immediately he detects a number of red flags two of the boats have gone dark their mandatory tracking device that gives a ship s position switched off still others are broadcasting two different radio numbers a sign of possible tampering the associated press with spanish language broadcaster univision accompanied the ocean warrior this summer on an 18 day voyage to observe up close for the first time the chinese distant water fishing fleet on the high seas off south america the vigilante patrol was prompted by an international outcry last summer when hundreds of chinese vessels were discovered fishing for squid near the long isolated galapagos islands a unesco world heritage site that inspired 19th century naturalist charles darwin and is home to some of the world s most endangered species from giant tortoises to hammerhead sharks china s deployment to this remote expanse is no accident decades of overfishing have pushed its overseas fleet the world s largest ever farther from home officially capped at 3 000 vessels the fleet might actually consist of thousands more keeping such a sizable flotilla at sea sometimes for years at a time is at once a technical feat made possible through billions in state subsidies and a source of national pride akin to what the u s space program was for generations of americans beijing says it has zero tolerance for illegal fishing and points to recent actions such as a temporary moratorium on high seas squid fishing as evidence of its environmental stewardship those now criticizing china including the u s and europe for decades raided the oceans themselves but the sheer size of the chinese fleet and its recent arrival to the americas has stirred fears that it could exhaust marine stocks there s also concern that in the absence of effective controls illegal fishing will soar the u s coast guard recently declared that illegal fishing had replaced piracy as its top maritime security threat meanwhile activists are seeking restrictions on fishing as part of negotiations underway on a first ever high seas treaty which could dramatically boost international cooperation on the traditionally lawless waters that comprise nearly half of the planet of the 30 vessels the ap observed up close 24 had a history of labor abuse accusations past convictions for illegal fishing or showed signs of possibly violating maritime law collectively these issues underscore how the open ocean around the americas where the u s has long dominated and china is jockeying for influence have become a magnet for the seafood industry s worst offenders specifically 16 ships either sailed with their mandatory safety transponders turned off broadcast multiple electronic ids or transmitted information that didn t match its listed name or location discrepancies that are often associated with illegal fishing although the ap saw no evidence that they were engaged in illicit activity six ships were owned by companies accused of forced labor including one vessel the chang tai 802 whose indonesian crew said they had been stuck at sea for years another nine ships face accusations of illegal fishing elsewhere in the world while one giant fuel tanker servicing the fleet the ocean ruby is operated by the affiliate of a company suspected of selling fuel to north korea in violation of united nations sanctions yet another the fu yuan yu 7880 is operated by an affiliate of a nasdaq traded company pingtan marine enterprise whose chinese executives had their u s visas cancelled for alleged links to human trafficking beijing is exporting its overfishing problem to south america said captain peter hammarstedt director of campaigns for sea shepherd a netherlands based ocean conservation group that operates nine well equipped vessels including the ocean warrior china is chiefly responsible for the plunder of shark and tuna in asia says hammarstedt who organized the high seas campaign called operation distant water after watching how illegal chinese vessels ravaged poor fishing villages in west africa with that track record are we really supposed to believe they will manage this new fishery responsibly wild west the roar of the mechanical jiggers pulling the catch from the ocean s depths can be heard hundreds of feet away before you come upon the floating slaughterhouse the stench too as the highly aggressive squid blow their ink sacs in one final futile effort to avoid their inexorable fate by all accounts the humboldt squid named for the nutrient rich current found off the southwest coast of south america is one of the most abundant marine species some scientists believe their numbers may even be thriving as the oceans warm and their natural predators sharks and tuna are fished out of existence but biologists say they ve never faced a threat like the explosion of industrial chinese fishing off south america the number of chinese flagged vessels in the south pacific has surged 10 fold from 54 active vessels in 2009 to 557 in 2020 according to the south pacific regional fisheries management organization or sprfmo an inter governmental group of 15 members charged with ensuring the conservation and sustainable fishing of the species meanwhile the size of its catch has grown from 70 000 tons in 2009 to 358 000 fishing takes place almost exclusively at night when each ship turns on hundreds of lights as powerful as anything at a stadium to attract swarms of the fast flying squid the concentration of lights is so intense it can be seen from space on satellite images that show the massive fleet shining as brightly as major cities hundreds of miles away on land it really is like the wild west said hammarstedt nobody is responsible for enforcement out there experts warn that even a naturally bountiful species like squid is vulnerable to overfishing although it s unknown how many humboldt squid remain they point to past disappearance of squid stocks in argentina mexico and japan as cause for concern if you have a vast resource and it s easy to take then it s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that this is limitless that it s just stars in the sky said william gilly a stanford university marine biologist if humanity puts its mind to it there s no limit to the damage we can do gilly said squid are also a key barometer of marine environments a biological conveyor belt transporting energy from tiny carbon absorbing plankton to longer living predators like sharks and tuna and ultimately human beings the people who fish squid are happy said daniel pauly a prominent marine biologist who in the 1990s coined the phrase fishing down the food web to describe how previously spurned chum were replacing bigger fish on dinner plates but this is part of the gradual degradation of the ocean dark fleet for dozens of chinese ships the journey to the warm equatorial waters near the galapagos began months earlier on the opposite side of south america where every austral summer between november and march hundreds of foreign flagged jiggers scoop up untold amounts of shortfin squid in one of the world s largest unregulated fishing grounds the plunderer s paradise lies between argentina s maritime border and the british held falkland islands in a jamaica sized no man s land where fishing licenses catch limits and oversight are non existent between november 2020 and may 2021 a total of 523 mostly chinese fishing vessels 35 more than the previous season were detected just beyond the boundary of argentina s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone according to satellite data analyzed by windward a maritime intelligence firm of that amount 42 had turned off at least once their safety transponders meanwhile 188 of those same vessels showed up near the galapagos including 14 chinese vessels that went offline in both oceans for an average 34 hours each time it s impossible to know what the ships did while they were dark however sometimes ships turn off their tracking systems to avoid detection while carrying out illicit activities argentine authorities over the years have spotted numerous chinese vessels off the grid fishing illegally in its waters once even firing shots into and sinking a trawler that tried to ram its pursuer near a whale breeding ground under a united nations maritime treaty to which china is a signatory large ships are required to continuously use what s known as an automated identification system or ais to avoid collisions switching it off except in cases of an imminent threat for example hiding from pirates is a major breach that should lead to sanctions for a vessel and its owner under the law of the nation to which it is flagged but china until now appears to have done little to rein in its distant water fleet the chinese fleet is able to fish for sometimes years at a time because they can offload their catch at sea into a network of giant refrigerated vessels or reefers capable of hauling more than 15 000 cubic meters of fish enough to fill six olympic sized pools to port giant tankers provide cheap fuel heavily subsidized by the chinese government adding to the environmental burden the 12 reefers active in the pacific this past july as the ocean warrior was patrolling nearby had at least 196 encounters with fishing vessels during that period according to satellite data analyzed by global fishing watch a group that supports sustainable fishing nearly 11 of total u s seafood imports in 2019 worth 2 4 billion came from illegal unreported and unregulated fishing according to the u s international trade commission a federal agency outside the u s the problem is believed to be even worse we don t know if things are getting better or worse said boris worm a marine biologist at dalhousie university in halifax canada it basically comes down to who you believe fishy business in the seascape of the world s oceans pingtan marine and its affiliates have left in their wake accusations of illegal fishing by authorities in places as diverse as south africa timor leste ecuador and indonesia but the company is not some rogue outfit it boasts china s second largest overseas fleet trades shares on the u s nasdaq and in its home port of fuzhou across from taiwan is helping build one of the world s largest fish factories the company s chairman and ceo zhou xinrong appears to have built the fishing empire through massive state loans generous subsidies and communist party connections it s not just a fishing company it s practically a chinese government asset said susi pudjiastuti who as indonesia s former fishing minister between 2014 and 2019 was lionized by conservationists for destroying hundreds of illegal foreign fishing vessels fifty seven of pingtan s ships including three refrigerated carrier vessels all of them owned directly or through an affiliate were registered by china in the past few years to fish in the south pacific according to c4ads a washington based think tank that last year authored a report on illegal fishing pingtan in its last earnings report almost a year ago said that it had 280 million in outstanding loans from the china development bank and other state lenders one of the country s biggest state investment funds owns an 8 stake in one of its subsidiaries meanwhile chinese state subsidies to pingtan for the building of vessels totaled 29 million in the first nine months of last year about a third of all its purchases of property and equipment as part of pudjiastuti s crackdown vessels operated by two pingtan affiliates in indonesia had their licenses revoked for a slew of alleged offenses ranging from falsifying catch reports illegal transshipments and the smuggling of endangered species those affiliates pt avona mina lestari and pt dwikarya reksa abad are managed or partly owned by members of zhou s immediate family pingtan disclosed in filings with the u s securities and exchange commission crew members of one vessel told authorities they had been gang beaten hit on their heads with a piece of steel and subjected to torture by their chinese supervisors according to an indonesian court ruling upholding the ban on the pingtan affiliate a panama flagged carrier vessel the hai fa whose listed owner is a different pingtan affiliate based in hong kong was seized in 2014 with 900 tons of illegally caught fish including endangered shark species a lenient court later released the vessel from custody after it paid a 15 000 fine an entity majority owned by zhou s wife also operates the fu yuan yu leng 999 which was caught in 2017 transiting through the galapagos marine reserve with more than 6 000 dead sharks on board another pingtan affiliated vessel spotted by ap the fu yuan yu 7880 was arrested by south africa in 2016 after it tried to flee a naval patrol that suspected it of illegal squid fishing the ship s officers were found guilty of possessing illegal gear and disobeying a maritime authority but were released after paying a fine the more you learn about these vessels and equipment the harder it is to sleep at night said pudjiastuti these south americans should wake up as early as possible pingtan didn t answer a detailed list of questions pingtan doesn t answer questions raised by the media the company said in an e mail as scandal has followed pingtan and its affiliates around the world investors have dumped the company s stock in june nasdaq sent notice that it would delist the company unless its share price which has tumbled nearly 80 the last two years crawls back above a minimum 1 threshold soon the threat of delisting followed the abrupt resignation of the company s independent auditor which warned about pingtan s ability to continue doing business pingtan told the sec that its failure to file any quarterly reports for nearly a year was due to a material weakness in its ability to conform with u s accounting practices one decision that pingtan has also not commented on is the surprise u s sanction of its top executives two u s officials said that ceo zhou xinrong and his wife were among the 15 individuals who had their visas cancelled last year for being complicit in illegal fishing and human trafficking the decision taken in the waning days of the trump administration was the first of its kind specifically targeting abuse in the fishing industry the two officials said on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations bullying china criticism of china s distant water fishing fleet has spurred some reform last year china imposed stricter penalties on companies caught breaking the rules including manipulating their transceivers they ve also boosted reporting requirements for transshipments on the high seas banned blacklisted vessels from entering chinese ports and ordered off season moratoriums on squid fishing in the high seas near argentina and ecuador the measures while far from a panacea nonetheless mark a giant leap for the world s largest consumer and producer of fish products i used to go to conference and officials would be in just complete denial said tabitha mallory a china scholar at the university of washington who specializes in the country s fishing policies at least now they re acknowledging that their fishing is unsustainable even if it s just to counter all the negative pushback they re getting around the world china s foreign ministry the bureau of fisheries and the china overseas fisheries association an industry group didn t respond to multiple requests for an interview nor a detailed list of questions china s distant water fishing fleet launched in the 1980s as a response to depleting fish stocks at home and the need to feed its fast growing population but it s evolved into a thriving industry and an important part of china s geopolitical push to secure access to the world s dwindling natural resources says mallory in the eastern city of zhoushan home to china s largest distant water fleet an ultramodern squid museum opened this year that allows visitors to follow the squid on a sanitized adventure filled 3d journey from the ocean depths to the giant jiggers and their eventual processing back at home into squid rings researcher pauly believes that much of the criticism of the chinese fleet s fishing around the galapagos is attributed to growing anti china sentiment in the u s and sensitivities about beijing s growing presence in what has traditionally been considered washington s backyard he said imposing restrictions on high seas fishing something that could be discussed as part of the negotiations over a high seas treaty would be a more effective way to curtail china s activities than bullying china doesn t do anything that europe has not done exactly the same way said pauly the difference is that everything china does is big so you see it china s stonewalling seafood companies in the u s have started to take note of the risks posed by china s expansion and are seeking to leverage their market power to bring more transparency to the sourcing of squid this year a group of 16 importers and producers banded together to devise a common strategy to root out abuse much of their focus is on china which is responsible for around half of the 314 million in squid that the u s imported in 2019 the bulk served up as fried calamari in restaurants the initiative is opening something of a pandora s box for an industry that until now has thrived in the shadows without a lot of attention focused on its supply chains the bulk of china s squid harvest comes from the high seas where there s little in the way of controls like there is in many coastal waters right now it s the perfect situation for would be violators said alfonso miranda executive director of calamasur a group made up of squid industry representatives from mexico chile peru and ecuador you can do whatever you want even forced labor nobody says anything and you still have a market for your product one alternative is to deploy technology like publicly available ais tracking data to allow consumers to eventually identify the very vessel its owner fishing history and precise location that caught the fish in that way the seafood industry can catch up with other manufacturers from meat producers to the garment trade where such practices are more common the keyword is traceability said ambassador jean manes the top civilian at u s southern command in miami when consumers insist on traceability the market responds however boosting transparency is a challenge the industry has grappled with for decades nobody knows for sure how much china is fishing on the high seas meanwhile critics say regional fishing management organizations that operate on the basis of consensus are powerless to block china from registering vessels with links to illegal fishing and abuse a case in point the hua li 8 which was greenlighted by china to fish in the south pacific in 2018 two years after it was the target of an international manhunt when it fled warning shots fired by an argentine naval vessel that had caught it fishing illegally four of the hua li 8 s crew members were treated like slaves indonesian officials said at the time of the ship s arrest pursuant to an interpol purple notice the ship again was involved in suspicious fishing activity in 2019 this time in the western hemisphere when it went dark for 80 hours as it was fishing along the edge of peru s exclusive economic zone at the same time as the ship was offline vessel movements were detected inside peru s waters nighttime satellite data analyzed by global fishing watch shows craig loveridge executive secretary of the sprfmo the inter governmental fishing group declined requests for interviews but in an e mail he pointed out that it s up to each member to take into account the history of fishing operators when deciding whether or not to authorize a vessel to fly its flag to address concerns several south american governments proposed at this year s sprfmo meeting a number of conservation measures already in place elsewhere ideas included banning transshipments at sea allowing countries to board other member states vessels on the high seas and creating a buffer zone so coastal states are automatically alerted whenever a foreign vessel comes within 12 nautical miles of its territorial waters but each proposal was shot down by china miranda said china doesn t really seem interested in expanding protection said mallory they follow the letter of the law but not the spirit moreover once the catch is landed in china or a warehouse anywhere it s impossible to discern between legal and illegally caught fish this is the black hole and having clarity there is really complex said miranda there are many things that can be done but you need to rely on credible data which right now is lacking alone at sea in the absence of more robust monitoring the ocean warrior is something of a high seas sheriff holding bad actors responsible but it s surrounded by dozens of chinese vessels accustomed to operating with little fear of reprisal as the sun prepares to set and the chinese squid fleet awakens in time for another night of fishing the ocean warrior s crew sets out on a dinghy to inspect up close the chang tai 802 the ship is one of 39 vessels suspected of forced labor in a may 2021 report by greenpeace based on complaints by workers to indonesian authorities six shirtless men all of them indonesian gather on the chang tai s stern gesturing friendlily and looking comforted to see another human being so far from land but the mood quickly turns when one man who the ap isn t identifying by name out of concern for his safety shouts above the engine that his boss is not nice and asks with only the foggiest of comprehension whether the coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged the world has arrived in the u s i m stuck here he says with a sullen look before a visibly irritated chinese supervisor appears and orders the men back to work i want to go home a day later when the ocean warrior returns with a megaphone to facilitate the open water exchange the chinese supervisor moves quickly to block any talk with the english speaking strangers but as the chang tai pulls away the man throws overboard a plastic bottle stuffed with his brother s phone number scribbled on a piece of paper reached back home in indonesia the relative confesses to knowing precious little about how his brother was recruited or the conditions of his employment since leaving home three years ago after graduating from a vocational school with few other job prospects he s communicated with his family only sporadically he nonetheless worries for his brother s wellbeing to the point that he recently pressed the agency that hired him to bring him back the greenpeace report cites a complaint by another anonymous indonesian sailor on the same ship who while ill with kidney pain due to drinking poorly treated seawater was forced to sign a document or risk being marooned in peru with no travel documents i hope he can come back soon says the man s brother hesitant to reveal too much out of fear it could compromise someone s safety and i hope he s always healthy ap writer joe mcdonald and ap

visit brean down for wonderful coastal walks and amazing views brean down is one of the landmarks of the somerset coastline jutting out into the bristol channel and providing a download setting between burnham on sea to the south and weston super mare to the north this rocky outcrop boasts a cafe near the beach plus a small visitor centre and a bird garden brean down is protected by the national trust and scheduled as a site of special scientific interest by the nature conservancy council for its exceptional natural history it is also classed as a scheduled ancient monument by the department of the environment for its archaeological remains explore brean down s amazing nature standing almost 100 metres 320ft above sea level on the summit of the western knoll the highest point on brean down and looking inland along the spine of the down it is easy to appreciate that brean down belongs to the great chain of mendip hills stretching away to the east beyond the river axe the slopes of bleadon hill and crook peak can be clearly seen nearby dropping down on their south sides to the somerset levels brent knoll rises out of the levels and can also be seen to the south just five miles away brean down is made up of carboniferous limestone one of the principal rocks of the mendips this rock was formed in a shallow sea about 300 million years ago from the remains of marine animals mainly shellfish and corals later in geological time perhaps about 230 million years ago these rocks were subjected to great movements of the earth s crust which folded them with crests and troughs in an east west direction this folding gave brean down the shape it has today bluebells and butterflies on brean down the vegetation of the steep rocky southern slopes and cliffs contrasts with the gentler slopes on the north side where the soil containing wind blown sand is deeper on the thin limestone the most noticeable plant flowering in early summer is the rare white rock rose it grows in abundance on brean down at its most northerly world limit and is only known to exist in two other places in britain other rare plants which grow on brean down include the inconspicuous dwarf sedge which flowers in early spring the late flowering goldilocks and the somerset hair grass known only in england in the mendips many well known plants include the grass sheep s fescue plus wild thyme wood sage salad burnet st john s wort field scabious bird s foot trefoil and the sping flowering cowslips shrubs are trees are few and far between because of the strong winds and salt spray but low growing privet hawthorn and elder trees can be seen on the south side butterflies and other insect life are rich on brean down butterflies regularly seen include the common blue pictured meadow brown and the marbled white while the chalkhill blue whose caterpillar feeds on horseshoe vetch is less common various species of grasshoppers can occasionally be seen and the bloody nosed beetle can also be spotted birds that are resident all year round include sky larks meadow pipits linnets great and blue tits and stonechats jackdaws crows and collared and stock doves nest on the cliffs as do kestrels which hover over the cliffs while searching for food look out for plenty of resident goats too the last peregrine falcons nested on the down in 1947 mammals on brean down include rabbits which are known to have lived there since the mid 1300s plus hedgehogs field mice voles and shrews these small animals provide much of the diet of foxes and wesels who often live in old rabbit burrows on the down brean down s incredible history life on brean down at the end of the last ice age was very different to that of today evidence of this comes in the sand cliff on the south side of the down near the beach where the layers of rock date back to between 14 000 and 10 000 bc and reveal fragments of reindeer giant deer arctic fox aurochs bison mammoth wolves and lemmings these are animals capable of living in the very cold climate not far away from the ice caps the first sign of human activity at brean is a worked giant deer antler dating to about 10 000 bc but it is likely that early hunters visited the down well before that as man was present in the mendips almost half a million years ago as the ice retreated the climate became warmer forests developed and the sea level rose it was not until 5 000 bc that the sea level reached its maximum height submerging the coastal plains and making brean down into a true island small farming communities sprung up in the area in 3 000 bc and there is evidence of stock grazing and land cultivation on the down by 2 000 bc when the defences of the hill fort were constructed about 300 bc iron had taken over from bronze as the main metal for tools these defences consisted of a ditch across the breadth of the down quarried from the limestone using picks shovels and wedges not dissimilar to today s tools the roman armies landed in britain in ad 43 and within a few years the armies organized the mendip lead mining industry a small port was set up at bleadon on the other side of the river axe from brean down to export some of the minerals and local framing produce life on the down remain unchanged until about ad 340 when a temple excavated in 1965 was built on top of the eastern knoll close to a burial mound of the bronze age folk rock from a quarry on the down provided some of the stone for the building the temple however fell into disuse within only 30 years around ad 370 to be replaced by a small building possibly a hermitage brean down harbour plans throughout the middle ages little changed on the down from the 1840s there had been talk of a harbour being built at brean to provide safe anchorage for mail ships and to act as a port for crossing the atlantic as it has a slight advantage in terms of miles over liverpool engineers prepared reports and drew up images of the scheme as shown here the proposed harbour with a breakwater at the west end of the down and docks at the east end was seen as giving access to even the largest vessels and steamers at all stages of the tide the brean down harbour company was formed in 1861 with a capital of 350 000 the bristol and exeter railway entered into an agreement to provide a link with the main railway network from a line extending the whole length of the down in 1864 the project began with a celebration of the laying of the foundation stone on guy fawkes day over 200 local dignatories company officials and the town band sailed from weston in the wye a paddle steamer to see lady eardley wilmot lower the foundation stone into place amid speeches champagne and celebration however the next morning the foundation stone had been washed away it was later found off steep holme and this seemed to be an omen while work began on the breakwater disagreements between personalities and the death of the main contractor led to the scheme being abondoned in 1868 heavy storms also destroyed much of the early construction another attempt to revive the scheme was seen in 1887 with full press coverage in american newspapers given to five days to sail to england although a deal to link up with the great western railway company at lympsham was agreed the whole scheme eventually failed again never to be restarted brean down fort as the naval military strength of france grew in the late 1850s under napoleon iii numerous forts around the south coast were built in addition to four in the bristol channel at brean down flat holm steep holm and lavernock point in wales four acres at the tip of brean down were requisitioned in 1862 for brean fort but building was not completed until 1870 due to disagreements between the contractor and government the seven 7 inch rifled muzzle loading cannons which were built at woolwich were mounted in 1877 and each weighed 7 tons and had a 30lb charge of gunpowder able to fire a 112lb palliser shot at 1 560 feet per second this could pierce 8 inches of armour at 1 000 yards brean down fort was approached over a dry moat on the landward side through iron gates the barrack quarters on the left as you approach the fort could hold 50 men while the officers quarters and admin offices were to the right there were three main gun positions 3 guns faced west 3 faced north west and one faced north no shots were ever fired in action but regular drill and gunnery practice was part of the regular routine the garrisons were part of the coast brigade royal artillery and could be enforced with volunteers forces from both sides of the bristol channel on the whole though life was very quiet at the fort at 5am on july 6 1900 the fort was rocked by a huge explosion causing the death of one soldier gunner haines who had fired his carbine down the shaft of a ventilator into no 3 magazine beneath the western gun positions huge damage was done with the wall separating the fort from the moat on the south west corner being demolished and wreckage thrown up to 200 yards no one knew why the gunner had blown up the fort but it was a fatal blow as it was quickly closed down and the cannons hauled away by traction engines between 1905 and 1939 the fort became a cafe but at the start of world war ii was re armed with two 6 inch naval guns from cardiff and two searchlight batteries brean down seemed an ideal testing site for secret weapons a rail track was built and the so called bomb was mounted on a six hundredweight trolley propelled at 200mph along a caterpillar track by 12 powerful rockets the aim was to propel the trolley at high speed into buffers the impact would fling the bomb far out to sea but the whole lot trolley buffers and all actually went flying off into the channel then did a sharp right and came back inland into a local farmer s chicken run in the 1980s and 1990s the victorian barracks were renovated and made safe to ensure that visitors can safely walk around the remains of the fort today see the national trust s page on brean down here
no one seems as defeated as the global warming deniers who dominated rightwing thinking a decade ago like late 18th century opponents of abolishing the slave trade lord lawson and the claque of conservative cranks who filled the comment pages of the tory press are remembered today as dangerous fools assuming they are remembered at all the billions of dollars spent by the fossil fuel industry on propaganda and its acceptance by know nothing elements on the right caused incalculable damage they might have followed margaret thatcher who warned in 1989 of c02 emissions leading to climate change more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known the desire of business to protect profits and the vanity of politicians and pundits who saw themselves as dissidents fighting the consensus rather than fanatics enabling destruction helped to waste two decades of valuable time every argument they advanced has been disproved as much by the experience of everyday life as science journalists are advised if someone says it is raining and another person says it s dry it s not your job to quote them both your job is to look out the window and find out which is true the world only had to look at the weather outside to know who was trying to fool it to pick from the dozens of examples in richard black s history of the conspiracy theory denied the rise and fall of climate contrarianism global warming is not a swindle as a channel 4 documentary informed its viewers in 2007 glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking and the seas are becoming more acidic if there was swindling it was at channel 4 as ofcom suggested when it found the station guilty of several breaches of the broadcasting rules it is not erroneous to assume that humanity is driving the climate catastrophe as the spectator assured its readers as late as 2017 the pace of man made climate change is faster than anything in the earth s history and all attempts to invent other explanations have failed viscount ridley who presided over the collapse of northern rock and now dismisses the collapse of the planet in the pages of the times said climate change was doing more good than harm we should adapt to a warmer earth and celebrate the reduction in deaths from the winter cold but the seas and icecaps cannot adapt nor can cities threatened with flooding and countries facing desertification the lights did not go out as we switched to renewable energy as so many pundits said they would and energy bills have fallen rather than risen despite the assertions of the noble lawson to the contrary rightwing denialism appears buried so deep in the dustbin of history it can never be recycled and yet there is nervousness among the impressively large number of conservative politicians who are serious about pushing for net zero they are pleading with their colleagues to understand the advantages to consumers and businesses that a determined remaking of the economy would bring the conservative environmental network is already in a fight with a small group of rightwing mps who claim the poorest will pay the highest price for net zero fantasies even though no measure is more likely to reduce fuel poverty than a government home insulation drive that battle will only intensify i put denier in quotes at the top of this piece because the enemies of science and of us all are endlessly malleable shapeshifters once they can no longer deny the existence of man made global warming they shift and keep on shifting so no one can ever pin them down in this they mirror the defenders of slavery 230 years ago who created the modern world s first corporate pr campaign and provided an example for all who have followed the comparison isn t harsh one day the attack on climate science will be seen as shocking as the defence of human bondage indeed that day should have long passed they are overwhelmingly old men or in the case of lawson a very old man they grew up in a 20th century where the carbon economy was natural the way the world was and would always be slavery was equally natural to the plantation owners and slave traders of georgian britain it had always existed everywhere on earth the 18th century had its viscount ridleys who opined that slavery did more good than harm in 1789 during the hearings for the first abolition bill in history one witness told parliament that africans wanted to be enslaved and nine out of 10 rejoice at falling into our hands the pro slavery lobby was as well funded as the fossil fuel lobby and as relentless the telegraph comment pages did not exist in 1789 so it commissioned the benevolent planters by one thomas bellamy to appear at the theatre royal in london s west end the play told the story of oran and selima lovers who are separated in africa their capture by slavers is a blessing far from being oppressors kind slave owners bring the couple together in the west indies and allow them to live productive lives together william wilberforce was assailed by claims that if britain abolished slavery our manufactures will droop in consequence our land tax will be raised our marine destroyed while france our natural enemy and rival will strengthen herself by our weakness today nick timothy the man who destroyed theresa may s premiership tells telegraph readers the british will be forced into penury by net zero zealots while other countries break their promises and profit from our naivety in the 18th and 21st centuries as soon as one fake position was exposed another took its place the arguments change the intent remains the same it remains an open question as to whether boris johnson secretly shares a denialist intent conservative environmentalists look on him with approval as he prepares to host the cop26 climate change conference in november he says all the right things but the investment and political will needed to electrify transport reduce meat eating and refit the housing stock are nowhere to be seen denialism is a shapeshifter its latest form may be a bombastic prime minister who promises the earth but does next to nothing to protect it

it s time to take vaccines to the masses says expert a lack of communication and transparency on the part of government over the importance of the covid vaccination and its safety allowed a small but vociferous group of anti vaxxers to seriously slow down the jabs roll out says an expert epidemiologist dr jo barnes said the first problem with vaccinations had occurred right at the beginning when the government was so slow in negotiating the purchase of vaccines when it became clear that they would have to acquire a large number of vaccines other countries had already secured stocks and south africa found itself at the back of the queue she said the next problem occurred when the astrazeneca vaccines that were put on hold while investigations were completed were disposed of instead of being used all this and other logistical issues meant that south africa had a very slow start to its vaccine roll out programme barnes said while the purchasing was in progress the information and education campaigns which should have kicked off in high gear from the start were very low key and contained almost no facts that could educate and convince the general public that gave the small but vociferous anti vaxx group the perfect opening to start taking over the communication gap they did that with frightening success she added the aids healthcare foundation ahf said south africa needed to improve its technology and logistics to recover and improve the speed of the vaccination roll out ahf s country programme manager dr nduduzo dube questioned whether sa s vaccine distribution was done effectively and said although more than 8 million of the 59 million people in sa had now been fully vaccinated the roll out remained slow for various reasons dube suggested the health department work closely with major employers such as retailers and manufacturers as well as with the labour department and the department of social development to use existing employee and beneficiary data to reach people for scheduled vaccinations this is especially important now that the country is targeting not only the vulnerable but also the wider population with the aim of vaccinating 67 of people to achieve herd or population immunity he said even with vaccines being available south africa has seen a lag in vaccination the impact of employees going to line up to get vaccinated impacts business productivity and may even be a deterrent but he noted granting employees a day off work to get vaccinated may cost employers a day of productivity but it would save a lot of days by preventing illness and infections barnes said south africa was now faced with high vaccine hesitancy a better but by no means good roll out programme and mistrust in the process by the general public this is a tall order to overcome in my opinion lessons from past mistakes will take us out of this crisis she said those lessons should include much better information openness on the part of all government structures explanations rather than orders and taking the vaccines to the people taking vaccines to the people had started and the successes were encouraging dube said much still needed to be done to achieve patient data digitisation so businesses and workers could plan together with the health department when and where to access the vaccine for a swifter distribution process he said this would also result in sufficient vaccines being made available when and where they were most needed and importantly limit wastage we believe a real solution lies in opening up lines of communication between the departments of labour health and businesses to streamline the digitisation of patient records dube said or at least for now of the working population and in due course for the almost 14 million people who are on social grants to improve citizens immediate access to the vaccine through some kind of loose appointment system at their closest inoculation centre churches are starting to help religion has been one of the barriers to mass vaccination against covid and a major reason behind vaccine hesitancy among believers the religious forum against covid 19 yesterday launched the vaxumzansi national campaign in phoenix kwazulu natal aimed at addressing vaccine hesitancy and building pillars of support for the vaccine in religious circles according to the south african council of churches the campaign was rooted in the premise of being a positive change agent with the goal to get at least 70 people in their congregations and communities vaccinated the council s bishop malusi mpumlwana said the forum against covid which was convened earlier this year continued in its advocacy work against the scourge mpumlwana said the campaign would allow the use of religious infrastructure as vaccination sites in partnership with the national department of health and other commercial partners already vaccine teams are working at places like the grace bible church in

each year nevada business magazine compiles data comparing nevada to other states and to u s averages a big part of these annual exercises is tracking how the state responds to the ups and downs of economic cycles however assessing the damage done by the economic fallout of the covid pandemic is rather like taking stock after a category 5 hurricane although the sun is finally peeking through the clouds the numbers show that it s not yet time for nevadans to put away their sandbags and umbrellas compared to other states nevada s economy took heavy damage over the past year because of its dependence on travel and tourism in addition it is still challenged with low rankings in education and healthcare along with a higher than average crime rate these long standing problems affect nevadans quality of life as well as impeding efforts to diversify the economy by attracting new businesses travel tourism one measure of the economic devastation caused by the pandemic is statewide visitor volume which declined more than 36 percent year over year hotel occupancy dropped 43 percent and convention attendance disappeared entirely from april through december 2020 nevada was not alone in suffering losses to a tourist economy with other major tourist states experiencing double digit losses the second half of the year is expected to be improved as long as the surge in covid cases is contained and numbers don t continue moving in the wrong direction lifestyle demographics show that life in the state s urban areas is not that different from life in the rest of the country nevadans may work in a world famous hotel or a 5 star restaurant but away from the glitter of the resorts they go shopping attend religious services and enjoy parks golf courses and cultural events considering the vast distances between urban areas the population density is much lower than in other states and rural nevadans enjoy a lifestyle all their own education nevada has been near the bottom in national education rankings for decades well before the magazine began tracking some progress has been made but moving from 50th place to 46th still earns the state a failing grade nevada students are less likely to be proficient in basic subjects like english and math and more likely to drop out of school however students in the silver state do have higher scores in sat testing and clear improvement has been made in many of these areas more is being done as stakeholders and business leaders get involved recognizing the importance education has to economic development tax burden nevada is in the middle of the pack when it comes to taxes for individuals ranking 29th but has no state income tax relying instead on sales taxes and other types of assessments it fares better in business taxes with an overall ranking of seventh many companies choose to come to nevada from higher tax states like california ranked 49th because it has no corporate income tax no inventory tax no franchise tax and no unitary tax cost of living housing and rental prices are significantly higher than the national average a statistic that isn t likely to improve any time soon given the current boom in housing prices other common household expenses are in line with national numbers it should be noted that gas prices since this report was pulled have significantly risen as of press time the average gas price in nevada was 4 06 for a gallon of regular unleaded gas but a dollar still goes further in nevada than the national average according to a study that includes the impact of state taxes cost of doing business compared to other locations it s generally less expensive to operate a mid to large sized business in nevada according to the boyd company which considers a wide range of factors including lease rates payroll costs business taxes and workers comp rates minden fernley and gardnerville offer convenient access to bay area markets without california s high costs in southern nevada mesquite and henderson compare favorably with other locations commercial real estate rates in the reno and las vegas metro areas are generally lower than in competitive markets healthcare the silver state s healthcare ranking has been an ongoing challenge especially concerning access to care nevada is in 45th place among the states for active physicians per 100 000 population the pandemic placed an additional burden on understaffed facilities making the shortage of healthcare professionals even more critical the lack of residency positions for recently graduated doctors means that many graduates must go out of state to complete their residencies and they often decide not to return local medical schools are rising to the challenge building more residencies whenever possible the kirk kerkorkian school of medicine at unlv s 150 million medical education building is also scheduled for completion next year coronavirus the recent surge in cases this summer chiefly due to the delta variant of covid has once again raised the number of hospitalizations and deaths attributed to the pandemic compared to the u s average nevada has had more cases and deaths and also has a higher rate of positive tests nevada has a lower percentage of vaccinated adults than the u s average with less than half of adults having completed the vaccination process crime rate ranking tenth in the nation for violent crimes may not seem like a good statistic but 2019 numbers the latest available from the fbi are actually much improved from previous years for example nevada was ranked third in 2014 for violent crimes and seventh for murders the crime rate is calculated per 100 000 population which skews nevada s numbers since millions of people visit the silver state each year increasing the number of people actually present at any one time housing nevada s real estate market famous for its boom and bust cycles has been red hot for some time now home values across the state have increased rapidly since last year reaching double digits in some locations a trend that is seen in other states as well new residential developments are sprouting up across nevada to keep up with demand driven partly by an influx of new residents from other states with increasing demand low mortgage interest rates and rising prices for building materials home price increases are not expected to stall anytime soon employment when covid restrictions closed resorts across the state thousands of nevadans were thrown out of work some for weeks or months and some permanently the unemployment rate soared from 3 6 percent in february 2020 to 28 7 percent in april 2020 a month that the national rate hit 14 7 percent now that most resorts and businesses have reopened the unemployment rate is under 8 percent the state regained 15 400 jobs in june 2021 chiefly in the leisure and hospitality sector which accounts for more than 20 percent of total employment in nevada the future of the job market in nevada depends on how the state s major industry is affected by the public health climate including any potential new waves of infection business rankings nevada ranks high in many national surveys because of its relatively business friendly environment moderate tax rates and low cost of doing business it s location near west coast markets without the high cost of west coast taxes and real estate makes it attractive to companies looking to expand or relocate economic development agencies are doing what they can to help diversify the state s economy but nevada s economic future depends on improving its ranking in education healthcare and crime as well as overcoming the fallout from ongoing covid issues

build back better is developmentspeak for a particular approach to disaster recovery the global facility for disaster reduction and recovery defines it as an approach to post disaster recovery that reduces vulnerability to future disasters and builds community resilience to address physical social environmental and economic vulnerabilities and shocks it looks forward to the post covid era and the potential to rebuild health education and other human development systems in a fairer greener and more robust way to minimise the likelihood and impact of future disasters the leaders of the usa and the uk use it frequently joe biden more often than boris johnson unicef which has mopped up africa s vaccine loans has also adopted the phrase and has used it to signal better vaccine supply systems in the future but bbb has been ridiculed in british social media and some americans are irked by biden s my build back better agenda refrain repeated with every new policy announcement african leaders have not yet adopted the mantra and there is hardly a trace of bbb on african social media at first it sounded like more of the revival of empire talk that accompanied the brexit saga a year into covid it is clear that what is being built back is the previous relationship between the developed world and developing countries before it was levelled out by the pandemic for a brief moment in history everyone was equally vulnerable that moment has passed as recovery in developed countries outpaces recovery in africa despite the far fewer deaths in africa the continent was more vulnerable to the economic shock caused by the pandemic recovery therefore requires more of that which was lacking in economic development prior to the onset of covid strong accountable governance able to make and implement hard decisions according to the recently deceased dr anthony mbonye uganda began to fail the governance test right at the beginning the national covid task force set up after the detection of patient 0 in march 2020 excluded eleven doctors with experience of managing ebola virus disease of which uganda has had five outbreaks yellow fever and cholera in favour of some chosen on grounds irrelevant to the problem this may explain why decision making came to be dominated by the local world health organisation representative where a ugandan may have understood the implications of contagion in uganda especially along truck routes through the poorest served regions the who representative was instrumental in lobbying to keep the borders open to truck drivers before their test results were known during his mission the representative was accompanied on media platforms by the permanent secretary in the ministry of health in his book dr mbonye singles out the permanent secretary as part of the problem plaguing uganda s health sector since then the rehabilitation of regional hospitals has failed to respond robustly to the second wave whatever the development goals recovery from the pandemic will require money which is in short supply with nearly all countries maxed out uganda s public debt increased from 32 per cent to 37 5 per cent of gdp an increase of ten percentage points since 2015 the current account deficit rose from us 1 999 million to us 3 205 million between 2018 and 2019 debt repayments increased by us 17 million in the same period the current account deficit that grew by us 740 million was plugged with funds from the world bank s uganda covid response and emergency preparedness project ucrepp and the us 300 million imf rapid credit facility in 2019 2020 in order to put together a covid response uganda and many other african countries resorted to massive borrowing through the pro forma emergency response rapid credit relief and economic recovery programmes designed by the world bank within weeks of patient 0 s detection the country was close to a billion dollars in covid debt bi lateral debt not included under ucrepp us 300 million was released by the world bank for among other things medical supplies tax relief for businesses in key economic sectors like tourism and industry and to provide relief for the vulnerable the imf formed a joint framework with the bank and added a credit facility of us 491 million the african development bank chipped in with us 31 million to support the medical response social protection and maintenance of macroeconomic stability and economic activity the following year the imf added another us 700 million while the world bank has continued to lend under existing programmes on the face of it there are elements of better development solutions within the covid response for example in order to bypass the global shortage of protective gear funds were made available to build local manufacturing capacity for face shields and masks the simplicity of it was astounding where these items have been imported since independence in 1962 a solution was found and implemented within weeks the main candidate for the build back better approach is the health sector prior to the emergency there were active health sector loans of a combined us 468 360 000 and a history of loan funded interventions dating back at least twenty years still the stock and quality of health infrastructure was in need of improvement human resources needed to be enhanced and service delivery to be made more efficient and effective every major disbursement related to the covid response has been accompanied by a public outcry about irregular procurement methods and the incompetence that led to icu beds remaining uninstalled for months after delivery the climax came when over 30 patients died in one day and it was discovered that the new oxygen plant acquired by the national referral hospital was not fit for purpose the seven ush7 billion us 1 883 587 contract had been handed over to the daughter in law of ruler yoweri museveni and her twin sister a newly elected member of parliament they are the daughters of disgraced former minister of foreign affairs sam kutesa a budget of ush32 billion us 8 996 240 to procure cloth masks from local manufacturers quickly ballooned to over ush70 billion awards of contract followed the usual pattern the government paid a price four times the production cost contracts were awarded to people within the president s office and to a firm in the entertainment industry and to other entities not connected to garment manufacturing to produce the masks would therefore entail sub contracting with the attendant price inflation whole districts did not receive any cloth masks every major disbursement related to the covid response has been accompanied by a public outcry about irregular procurement methods a challenge that has existed since 1995 when i first encountered it is the storage and distribution of essential drugs and medical supplies over the years massive amounts of expired drugs have either been destroyed or remain in stores at the same time stock outs of essential drugs are a widespread annual occurrence across health facilities symptoms have persisted throughout the pandemic some quarantine centres were shut down after being in existence for some time without the means to manage patients hospitals have lost patients for lack of oxygen health workers have been on strike over personal protective equipment ppe rivalling mulago hospital s oxygen debacle for incompetence the medical stores lost an entire donation of half a million face masks covid test kits and drugs were later discovered being off loaded from a truck onto private vehicles by a side road the imf is on track for bbb having reignited a lending relationship with uganda that has been dormant since 2006 the world bank has consolidated its dominance especially through its hands on enhanced implementation support mechanism or bank facilitated procurement through which it has supported the suppliers of its choice and captured the african pharmaceuticals market in this way any possibility of uganda cooperating with countries outside europe and north america on vaccine acquisition and technology transfer has been extinguished as a result european and north american vaccine supplying countries will also build back better financed by covid outflows from countries like uganda the easy borrowing under ucrepp was made possible by simply reopening or extending existing projects that were closed or closing in 2020 21 uganda health systems strengthening project east african public health laboratory networking project agriculture cluster development project ending in 2021 and the uganda multi sectoral food security nutrition project new loans unrelated to the pandemic were sought and granted roads and bridges in the refugee hosting districts koboko yumbe moyo road corridor project us 130m uganda intergovernmental fiscal transfers us 300 million additional financing securing uganda s natural resource base in protected areas project us 2 7 million and the uganda digital acceleration project govnet us 200 million the imf is on track for bbb having reignited a lending relationship with uganda that has been dormant since 2006 in the meantime repayments of multi lateral loans continue uninterrupted for example since the pandemic was detected in uganda in march 2020 an amount of us 8 222 820 93 has been repaid to the world bank on the 2006 transport sector development project and us 988 160 75 on the 2011 east african public health laboratory project appointed by the world bank s assisted procurement unicef has done better than uganda s entire covid task force and members of the cabinet it has carried out its biggest procurement assignment yet under the most stringent conditions individuals within unicef and who have added key contacts to their address books and pandemic management to their skillsets by surrendering their responsibility ugandan government representatives are now unable to say on any given platform what brand of vaccine would serve the country best or why and when it is arriving tragically while iran and vietnam have tested cuban vaccines and are building for future pandemics by reaching technology transfer agreements with cuba s finlay institute of public health to create domestic production capacity uganda has not taken delivery of a single paid for phial of vaccine all the doses received a year and four months since covid 19 made landfall have been donations
mike faretto owner of peavine construction in reno nev brought the machine to cashman s reno service shop and tasked the technicians with restoring the cat twenty two to its former glory the 1930s were not an easy time in the united states the stock market crash of 1929 left everyone reeling and in the great depression that followed 15 million people were unemployed president franklin d roosevelt was elected and began making all sorts of new deals to rebuild the economy many of which included building in general the economy and the people both needed strong equipment to support these initiatives and the newly formed caterpillar tractor company and the cashman equipment dealership answered that demand with built to last track type tractors cashman equipment turns 85 years old in august to celebrate cashman takes a look at both the past and the present with the rebuild of a cat model twenty two tractor in 1934 caterpillar debut a new track type tractor the cat model twenty two replacing the cat model twenty the twenty two s 1934 spec sheet indicated that the tractor had a 4 cylinder 4x5 in bore and stroke engine rated at 23 69 drawbar hp and 29 39 belt hp more than 15 000 of these 6 150 lb tractors were built from 1934 to 1939 one of those 15 000 tractors found its way to sierraville calif where cashman equipment customer mike faretto owner of peavine construction in reno nev purchased it from lloyd and joe parlanti in 2001 a long time collector of antique tractors faretto wanted to fix up the cat model twenty two so he could thrill his grandkids with a ride on an old cat tractor at his yerington nev farm faretto brought the machine to cashman s reno service shop and tasked the technicians with restoring the cat twenty two to its former glory experienced reno main shop lead technician frank williams took charge of the project although the 1936 cat twenty two track type tractor was in very good condition for its age it was still eight decades old williams began disassembling the machine and made some minor repairs many of the parts he needed were discontinued but a few were located through cashman s parts department gauges control handles gaskets etc a basic carburetor kit was also found online but williams had to have a brand new diaphragm made for the 80 year old fuel pump the next steps involved draining the engine oil removing the valve cover and washing the slightly rusty engine interior with solvent unfortunately at this point it was discovered that the bottom of the fuel tank had rusted away and had little hope of replacement at least not a cost effective one not daunted in the least however williams used the auxiliary fuel tank that was actually part of the original fuel tank as a fuel cell a few plumbing modifications with the assistance of cashman welder ken lee and williams was ready to test out the antique tractor hopeful williams and lee primed the fuel system and got ready to crank the engine over cat twenty two tractors didn t have a distributor but rather a magneto driven by the front gear train which created the spark of electricity to ignite the fuel in the cylinders via spark plugs as they began cranking it over williams and lee were thrilled to hear it fire right up williams and lee drove the 80 year old tractor around the yard a bit and then right over to the sandblasting booth with the first half of the customer s wish complete now it was time to make the tractor look as good as it sounded after sandblasting the undercarriage and some other take off parts the cat twenty two tractor was painted old cat highway yellow with contrasting black lettering for the hardnose with the machine looking as fine as it did 80 years ago cashman s product support manager lance pecetti sales manager mike brenner service manager andy butts and product support sales representative lyle kibbe welcomed faretto back to cashman for the machine presentation faretto and curtis newmeyer peavine construction equipment superintendent walked into the paint booth to examine the cat twenty two as soon as faretto saw it his face lit up and he said it looks brand new with that high compliment to williams s amazing rebuild pecetti and faretto began reminiscing about machines gone by and the good old days as they stood over a genuine piece of our industry s history cashman equipment could not have achieved 85 years of success without employees like williams and lee the company is grateful to them for restoring this piece of equipment cat model twenty two notes the twenty two was a versatile machine as it was paired with a wide variety of other equipment depending on the job at hand most notably the tractor was available as an orchard model with fenders mounted over the tracks to keep branches out of the tracks as the tractor moved through the orchards on a farm it would have been paired with a 12 to 15 ft 3 7 to 4 6 m engine driven combine three or four plow bottoms one 10 ft 3 m disc harrow a mower or 20 ft 6 m of grain drills in logging or industry applications it would have been able to handle small wagons sleighs logging winches or oilfield winches for construction and roadwork it would have been paired with the caterpillar no 22 blade grader no 22 terracer no 4 hi way patrol or no 1 terracer it also could have been paired with 5 yd 46 m rollover scrapers or small bulldozers built by other manufacturers for more information visit www cashmanequipment com today s top stories
as q3 winds down and q4 begins the broad investment climate is being shaped by the turning of the monetary cycle norway was the first and new zealand will be next it is not so much that these moves will force others to do the same instead the and the are simply ahead of the others although there is speculation that the bank of england can move before the end of the year it seems a stretch the market feels increasingly confident that the bank of canada will raise rates around the middle of 2022 by our calculations looking at the fed funds futures the market has priced in a hike for the september 2022 fomc meeting and has discounted a little more than a 25 chance of a second hike the offs may rise toward 50 before finding a new equilibrium the european central bank the bank of japan and the swiss national bank are notable laggards however the ecb s pandemic emergency purchase program will wind down and finish at the end of q1 22 it will however continue to buy bonds under the less flexible asset purchase program 20 bln euros a month the bank of japan has reduced its bond and stock buying with little fanfare and even less impact which reinforces our argument about the significance of the signaling channel in the efficacy of qe the evergrande hk problems which have been evolving for a few months at least play on anxiety about the debt problem in china which extends beyond property developers it may cast a shadow over the investment climate even though direct foreign exposure appears limited the chinese government moved to ensure that funds are used to construct what was promised and paid for rather than servicing creditors comparisons with lehman and the great financial crisis or even long term capital seem misplaced maybe a more apt comparison if one is needed may be the bankruptcy of gm and chrysler in 2009 with contained adverse impact the jump in energy prices is another dimension to the business and investment climate and the cost of carbon offsets have appreciated markedly began the year near 50 and has not traded below 70 this month and set new three year highs before the weekend around 78 25 the price of wti has doubled since the end of last october that oil prices doubled before the previous three business downturns in the us before the pandemic illustrates its power as a headwind even in a primarily service economy simply put oil demand has rebounded quicker than supply opec will gradually add 1 2 mln barrels a day in q4 though us shale is slower to recover and there was the loss of output and refining capacity due to storms recently it is slowly returning russia has reduced gas supplies to europe apparently to pressure the early start to the nord stream 2 pipeline while it is also rebuilding its inventories china reportedly is also revamping its stocks the weather volatility has seen droughts in some places reduce the supply of hydroelectricity while dampened winds for example in the uk experience a dramatic decline in this renewable output though this looks to change soon around half of a dozen small retail power providers in the uk have collapsed over the past six weeks or so impacting an estimated 1 5 million households the bottom line here is that rising energy prices ought to be considered a knock to growth rather than an inflationary threat and europe is particularly vulnerable several governments have responded with offsets for the higher household energy bills 30 40 political developments seemed to have little impact the process may be unbecoming but the pending us debt ceiling and spending authorization which now appear tied to biden s infrastructure initiative have not fazed investors at the recent auctions including the and year bonds indirect bidders often foreign central banks have been stronger participants in addition canada s liberals lost the popular vote but secured the most parliamentary seats for the second consecutive election the market looked through it in germany the spd is widely expected to lead the next coalition government merkel leaves a complex legacy and finance minister scholz represents much continuity including the ordo liberal disdain for the use of fiscal policy to manage aggregate demand in the typical business cycle of which this isn t instead the likely center left government favors measures that curb the most extreme forms of economic inequality germany s foreign policy may be more assertive as it helps navigate europe between russia china and america not putting them on the same level but suggesting a more independent europe france seemed to be re living the suez crisis which reinforces macron s gaullist leanings and gives le pen fresh fodder japan s ldp holds its leadership contest on september 29 the winner will become japan s next prime minister and face voters in a lower house election that has not been scheduled but will occur in the next couple of months however the market appears to be looking past it a large fiscal stimulus package is expected something of the magnitude of jpy30 trillion or 270 bln which seems to be part of the ldp tradition the next prime minister may help shape the package and priorities but there seems to be a consensus favoring it in addition to being the prime minister during the olympics suga has led the turn in foreign policy china s bullying and harassment in the region have provided a new framing for a more muscular military posture that significant parts of the ldp have long advocated japan offered unequivocal support for taiwan if it were attacked by china this is a step the us has not formally declared along with a stimulus package a more robust defense in the face of an upgraded chinese threat also appears to enjoy broad backing in the ldp the inaugural meeting of the us eu trade and technology council ttc on september 29 looked to be a victim of the french sub snub but it will be going forward what appears to be an apology from biden has begun the rapprochement process the french ambassador who was recalled will return to the us on the other hand uk prime minister johnson may have not gotten the be contrite memo and told france in french to get a grip and give him a break many observers who dismiss macron s pique may not appreciate the impact of the numerous slights on the relationship leaving aside the recognition of the possibility that the us is one election away from another rejection of multilateralism the list of offenses appears to be growing the eu travel ban the ban on exporting vaccines the withdrawal from afghanistan the continuation of the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the trump administration on national security grounds the treatment of personal data the unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear agreement with iran and threatening sanctions on those that violate the us sanctions on tehran the meaning of america is back remains elusive turning to the economic data one of the reasons high frequency reports are important for investors is the possible impact on policy yet next week s data are unlikely to move the major central banks needle this is not to say the information is unimportant instead the recovery from the pandemic is unprecedented and the trajectory of monetary policy is being shaped by medium term considerations for example the us reports august and data the fed has already acknowledged that the economy moderated in july and august and it still went ahead with its signal that it will begin tapering in q4 the august and data will help economists forecast q3 gdp already foretold a strong consumption report while may have moderated savings were likely drawn down to fund consumption the headline deflator which the fed targets may have stabilized the 0 3 rise of the median forecast in the bloomberg survey would replace a similar increase in august 2020 in the 12 month comparison that should keep the year over year rate steady at around 4 2 a 0 2 increase in the core rate is expected which could mean that the year over year slips to 3 5 from 3 6 we continue to see no signs that the fed prefers the measure when it announced the review of its policy and adopted an average rate target it seemed to underscore the importance that the headline measure is the best which it could have changed if it wanted the eurozone publishes its too but its estimate is for september prices pressures have not peaked and the ecb seems well aware of it in september the weakened and energy prices surged the base effect also warns of upside risks as last september s 0 1 increase drops out of the year over year measure and is bound to be replaced with something higher the year over year rate will move above 3 the measure is likely to have accelerated from august s 1 6 pace the prices of consumer goods including apparel and durable household goods like appliances and furniture have supply chain issues that drive up prices there was a mini drama recently about comments by a few board members questioning the accuracy of the staff s recently updated forecasts that saw inflation at 1 5 in 2023 there was also a dispute over what the ecb s chief economist told or did not tell a private group of german bankers broadly similar a few days earlier indeed given these unprecedented times we should discount long term forecasts take them with more than a pinch of salt as it were the forecast for this year is too low at 2 2 the cumulative monthly increases are already at 2 4 the coming adjustment higher will give the hawks the upper hand at a critical juncture in the evolution of monetary policy the pandemic emergency purchase program winds down in the first part of next year before ending as planned in march the fight is over the size and flexibility of the ongoing asset purchase program the september 2021 cpi estimate is unlikely to influence that debate the hawks may insist on ringfencing temporary in terms of time and or level before china goes off to celebrate the golden week the pmi will be reported here too the data will have limited impact on policy the composite of both the and the iteration fell below the 50 boom bust level in august the pmi will not change the perception that the economy has lost much forward momentum and that seems to be precisely when the over extended credit system is most vulnerable that said some early signs point to a stabilizing situation lastly to prepare for the upcoming holiday the pboc will be injecting liquidity into the banking system

metal vessel benin nigeria now in prussian cultural heritage foundation berlin germany 20 09 2021 listen as for the ownership status of the works who does not know that benin is the true owner despite the semantics and legalese by the international community we have had enough of these meetings which only end as academic exercise prince edun agharese akenzua enogie of obazuwa 1 we have recently been asked whether the famous benin bronzes belong to the nigerian federal government or the oba of benin our answer has always been unambiguous benin artefacts belong to the oba of benin who is the traditional king of the edo people also known as benin people my position has been reinforced by statements of leading scholars of benin art such as sylvester ogbechie benin kings imported large quantities of copper and bronze in various forms from europe that were then used by its court artists to create outstanding commemorative heads in making history african collections and the canon of african art 2 peju layiwola has in a recent powerful statement reminded us that benin art is court art can anyone with the knowledge of the colonial violence unleashed on benin its monarchy and its people with the attendant plundering of thousands of benin artefacts from the palace of the king contest ownership with his royal majesty the oba of benin is the custodian of benin art and these looted objects are clearly his heirloom the oba must therefore be a key figure in any discussions regarding the return of benin cultural treasures in addition the property rights of these objects must remain with him the oba had always held the objects in trust for his people he instituted and catered for the guilds that produced these treasures 3 it is surely no accident that the best exhibition of benin art curated by barbara plankensteiner was entitled benin kings and rituals court arts from nigeria this magnificent exhibition that started in vienna went to paris berlin and chicago exploring in detail the court art and the history of benin 4 those who plundered the benin treasures on the order of the british government in 1897 and their descendants would be the first to admit that the artefacts were stolen from the palace of oba ovonramwen in benin city until very recently then one would have considered the question of ownership as somewhat odd and absurd since nobody had any doubt that the famous treasures belonged to the oba of benin whose ancestors have since the 15th century owned the exquisite treasures that record and recount the history of the valiant benin people whose famous civilization was brutally and violently truncated by imperialist great britain in 1897 oba ovonramwen from whose palace the british soldiers stole these precious objects had been considered by the invading british as an impediment to british hegemonic objectives in west africa and therefore had to be eliminated just like king jaja of opobo and the asante kings the invasion of 1897 which had been planned long beforehand looted at least 3000 5000 artefacts the king was sent into exile in calabar where he died in 1914 other benin nobles were hanged after kangaroo trials houses and other properties were burnt innocent women children and men were callously killed by the british troops no compensation has so far been paid by the united kingdom for these wanton destructions and nobody seems to be concerned about this do black lives matter the people of benin have been asking for the restitution of their looted treasures for more than 120 years but to no avail the british who stole the precious benin bronzes kept a large number perhaps 1700 artefacts and sold the remaining to the germans dutch other europeans and americans the plunderers and their accomplices were declaring hundred years later inter alia that the artefacts belonged to them and were best kept in the universal museums of the western world all pleas from the africans fell on deaf ears until very recently in 2017 a young president in france emmanuel macron declared to the astonishment of all that it was unjustifiable to keep so many african artefacts mostly looted in western museums and institutions whilst africans had nothing to show of their glorious culture he added that conditions must be established infrance within the following five years for returning some of the artefacts as permanent or temporary restitution shaken to their bones by this audacious french president the germans tried to counter this earth shaking declaration with a publication leitfaden zum umgang mit sammlungsgut aus kolonialen kontexten guidelines for dealing with artefact acquired from colonial contexts which pretended to resolve the problem of restitution of looted african artefacts in german museums the leitfaden that were neither binding nor issued by a political authority solved nothing and were revised twice in rapid succession 5 in the meanwhile the report by felwine sarr and bénédicte savoy the restitution of african cultural heritage toward a new relational ethics commissioned by the french president recommended that looted african objects that had been taken without the consent of the african owners in the colonial period should be restituted this restitution report sent around the world of museums and galleries shock waves that are still felt in many western institutions 6 the struggle for the return of looted african artefacts crystallized in due course into a fight for the restitution of looted benin objects mainly because of the brutal way those artefacts were violently looted by the british army in 1897 in the meanwhile france decided to return 26 looted artefacts to the republic of benin the former french colony of dahomey not to be confused with the kingdom of benin now in nigeria from where the famous benin bronzes were stolen france decided also to return to senegal a sword and its sheath which had been taken from omar saidou tall a muslim leader and founder of the toucouleur empire an anti colonialist leader who resisted french hegemonic invasions the dutch responded to the french challenge with new rules that would facilitate restitution the belgians after some delay decided to restitute to the democratic republic of congo artefacts stolen during the colonial regime 7 the british who started the whole colonial robbery remain opposed to restitution of looted african artefacts new british guidelines on handling colonial objects commissioned by the arts council england ace in 2020 do not appear to be ready yet we can assume that any new british guidelines will not recommend restitution of looted african artefacts but endorse the idea of loans propagated by the benin dialogue group the present strategy as far as benin artefacts are concerned seems to be this encourage as many as possible british institutions with small numbers of benin artefacts to restitute them whilst institutions with large number of benin artefacts such as a pitt rivers and british museum spread the argument that the big institutions such as british museum and pitt rivers are prevented by law from returning any object by the british museum act 1963 this is of course not true we should look at section 5 of the act which states clearly that the british museum may remove objects from its collection under specific conditions the museum has substituted its negative policy for an interpretation of the law surprisingly many scholars including those ostensibly supporting restitution go about spreading this myth why do they not propose a modification of the law if this is an obstacle to the restitution that they so ardently seek after some hesitations and delaying tactics germany decided on 29th april 2021 to restitute the benin artefacts and in june 2021 finally announced it would restitute to the oba of benin and nigeria benin objects including those that were to go on display in the humboldt forum the new 800 m museum that finally opened on 20 july 2021 after various difficulties including the effects of the covid 19 pandemic 8 after the german decision to restitute 1131 looted benin artefacts to the oba and nigeria questions arose as to whether the restituted artefacts are owned by the oba in anticipation of the historic restitution of the benin bronzes it was announced that a new museum would be constructed in benin city designated edo museum of west african art edowaa designed by the famous ghanaian british architect david adjaye a trust fund legacy restoration trust was announced as having been entrusted with the function of managing the museum that will house the restituted benin artefacts we read the following statement from the british museum blog together with our partners the legacy restoration trust nigeria and adjaye associates we are excited to announce a major new archaeology project linked to the construction of the new edo museum for west african art emowaa in benin city nigeria this innovative project will investigate the archaeology of the kingdom of benin including excavating historical remains of the capital buried below the proposed site of a new museum this will be the most extensive archaeological excavation ever undertaken in benin city nigeria the project is developed with the approval of the benin royal court the edo state government and the nigerian national commission for museums and monuments the legacy restoration trust in partnership with the british museum has secured the equivalent of 3 million of funding to enable this archaeological project the new edo museum of west african art initiative led by the legacy restoration trust and being designed by the commissioned architects adjaye associates is focused on reuniting benin art works currently within international collections as well as investigating and presenting the wider histories that these represent the emowaa archaeology project is a fundamental element of the early phase work for the building of the new museum which will house the most comprehensive display in the world of benin bronzes alongside other collections 9 after the announcement of a trust to administer the new museum it became obvious that a major dispute was in the making before this statement most of us knew a new museum the royal museum was to be built within or close to the existing palace none of us was aware that another museum independent of the benin monarchy was in planning and would be run by a trust that did not depend on the oba the owner of the benin artefacts the governor of edo state in which benin city is located godwin obaseki issued several statements that amounted to a claim by the edo state to have an important role in the restitution of the looted artefacts and their future management many had not heard before of the legacy restoration trust a certain amount of confusion of roles seemed to be developing under these circumstances it was not surprising that the oba felt it necessary to clarify his stand on the restitution issues the oba issued a statement reasserting the centuries old ownership rights of the benin monarchy in the artefacts looted in 1897 the monarch denounced the legacy restoration trust as a private firm that does not represent the oba and the people of benin he reiterated the plans to build a new royal museum on grounds already allocated there is no alternative native authority and custodian of the cultural heritage of the benin kingdom outside the oba of benin as constituted by the royal palace i do not believe that the move by a privately registered company the legacy restoration trust ltd and the purported establishment of edo museum of west african arts emowaa are in consonance with the wishes of the people of benin kingdom it is pertinent to note that shortly after my ascension to the throne i had several discussions with the governor on the plan for the benin royal museum and he expressed his readiness to work with the palace to actualize this laudable wish of my father i made efforts and acquired additional plots of land from different families within the adesogbe area near the present day palace for this purpose i was however surprised to read from the governor s letter to the palace where reference was being made to the fact that a new museum to be known as emowaa is now being proposed which will be funded and executed through the vehicle of another body now referred to as legacy restoration trust when governor godwin obaseki informed me in his correspondence of another implementation framework using the so called legacy restoration trust and the edo museum of west africa arts emowaa my response was that the setting up of another organization or legal entity in whatever form or guise will not be necessary nor acceptable 10 the differences between oba ewuare ii and governor godwin obaseki regarding the control over the benin artefacts expected from germany developed into an open conflict played out openly in the nigerian media to the dismay of many friends of the benin monarchy and nigeria both in africa and outside the continent the oba requested the federal government to receive the restituted objects and keep them until the new royal palace to be built in benin city was ready he stated further that under no circumstance should the returned artefacts be handed over to the government of edo state various groups in benin have expressed their views on the positions of the oba and of the governor 11 however certain questions arising out of the dispute between the king and the governor need to be clarified was the oba not fully informed about the establishment of the legacy restoration trust was the composition of the members of the trust fund agreed upon by the oba and the governor with the british museum and the german government what were the roles of the british museum and the german government in the establishment of the lrt who decided that the administration of the emowaa housing the benin artefacts should be entrusted to the lrt did the germans or the british museum ever express any preference for the lrt over the benin oba for the management of the returned treasures can employees of the nigerian or german state serve on board of trustees of private ngo s what was the role of prince ezelekhae ewuare crown prince of benin and son of oba ewuare in all this governor obaseki s reaction to the hard hitting speech of the oba seemed at least on the surface aimed at avoiding further escalation of a dispute which will not further the interest of the edo state whose current governor he is in a press statement godwin obaseki referred to the statement of the oba that appears to have created the impression that there is a major conflict between the interest of the edsg edo state government and his royal majesty with regards to the laudable national milestone of having our highly valued artifacts returned to nigeria according to obaseki the government of the edo state and the governor have always acted transparently and in consonance with existing federal and state laws in all matters relating to the proposed return of the artefacts and the monuments the governor will continue to display immense respect for our traditional institutions and therefore will continue to make effort to secure a private audience with his royal majesty 12 whether these conciliatory words of governor obaseki will bring the governor and the oba away from a potentially dangerous confrontation remains to be seen one party or the other must give up his plans for a new museum in benin to house the returned benin artefacts it seems to us the governor must give up his plans for the edo museum of west african art emowaa and join forces with the oba to build a new royal museum in benin city as if the differences between the oba and the governor were not enough the nigerian minister of information and culture alhaji lai mohammed declared not only that the federal government was taking possession of the benin artefacts as the oba has requested but also seemed to be making claims on behalf of the federal government as regards the benin bronzes to be returned from germany the minister did not expressly claim ownership of the artefacts on behalf of the federal government but his statement that the government was taking possession of the artefacts may have led many to believe he was claiming ownership rights for the government let me state clearly here that in line with international best practice and the operative conventions and laws the return of the artefacts is being negotiated bilaterally between the national governments of nigeria and germany nigeria is the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from nigeria the relevant international conventions treat heritage properties as properties belonging to the nation and not to individuals or subnational groups for example the 1970 unesco convention in its article 1 defines cultural property as property specifically designated by that nation this allows individual nations to determine what it regards as its cultural property nevertheless the nigerian state through the federal ministry of information and culture and the national commission for museums and monuments has in working assiduously over the past years to repatriate our looted artefacts carried along our important traditional institutions and state governments what i am saying in essence is that the federal government will take possession of these antiquities because it is its duty to do so in line with the extant laws but we have always exercised this right in cognizance of that culture that produced the art works that is why the ministry of information and culture and the national commission for museums and monuments have always involved both the edo state government and the royal benin palace in discussions and negotiations that have now resulted in the impending return of these antiquities please note that we are not just involved in the repatriation of benin artefacts we are also working on repatriating ife bronzes and terracotta nok terracotta owo terracotta the arts of the benue river valley the igbo ukwu the arts of bida the arts of igala jukun etc recall gentlemen our efforts over the igbo statues that were auctioned at christie s in year 2020 and the fact that we took the british and belgian authorities to icprcp in 2019 over an ife object 13 the minister is right insofar as concerns the federal government s taking custody of the returned benin objects however the remarks that the nigerian federal government is recognized as the authority in control of artefacts originating in nigeria and that heritage conventions treat heritage property as belonging to nigeria and not individuals or subnational groups and the reference to the 1970 unesco convention may have created the misleading impression that international law makes the nigerian federal government owner of all heritage in nigeria first most of us know that the 1970 unesco convention is not retroactive and therefore not applicable to objects stolen in 1897 one cannot therefore use the provisions of that convention and apply them to the benin treasures stolen in1897 14 moreover the article of the convention cited does not deal with questions of ownership at all but with the definition of what the national state may designate as part of its national cultural heritage in case of dispute with other states as to possible retroactive application of the convention to historical events the leading commentary on the convention states as follows the fear is misplaced as the paragraph above shows cultural property displaced during historic times no matter what the circumstances is not the subject of the 1970 convention 15 article 1 of the 1970 unesco convention like the whole convention is only applicable to disputes with other states and not to disputes between the state and other entities within the country here the internal law of the state would be exclusively applicable one cannot resort to the unesco 1970 convention to settle proprietary disputes between nigerian contestants can anyone imagine an international convention that makes states owners of all cultural objects within the territory of the state more serious than the application of a non applicable international convention is the effect of such an application on the continent if this extension of the authority of the state to cultural objects were to be accepted attempts by modern african states to high jack the looted african treasures now in western museums and are likely to be returned soon would set the continent on fire the very notion of the state taking over treasures of traditional rulers reveals lack of consideration of the history of the relations between traditional rulers and modern african rulers just before and after independence serious conflicts between the modern elite and traditional rulers would ensue moreover such attempts may be in some cases unconstitutional and may upset compromises that had been reached before the gaining of independence suggestions that restituted looted treasures be handed over to the ownership of the central government would display a complete disregard of the sources of the strength and dynamism of african culture we know that much of the power of african art derives from the traditional rulers and their courts who live with and develop our cultures they really care for the artefacts resistance to european aggression was always organized around traditional rulers such as ovonramven whose troops resisted imperialist invaders much of our cultural festivals which are not there for entertainment or tourism but serve to spread and reinforce knowledge of our culture and history center around traditional rulers the renaissance and renovation of african culture that some expect from the restitution of looted treasures from western institutions can only take place when the looted treasures are returned to those places and institutions that created and cared for them before europeans came and stole them placing most of the restituted cultural objects under the control of central national institutions would most likely result in superficial tourist attractions in areas frequented by western tourists but not to rebirth or strengthening of our cultures many of those elites in control of our central institutions have their eyes and minds turned to new york and london they never think of kumasi or ife the continuation of colonialist objectives involving the destruction and replacement of african culture is in the sure control of many an elite we should also remember that attempts by the modern state to hijack looted cultural objects returning home run the risk of putting into question the legitimacy and authority of the modern state most traditional authorities have a longer legitimacy going back centuries before colonization whereas our modern states hardly existed before independence and cannot boast of a legitimacy and authority older than 60 years their creation would not have the ideological and religious aura of traditional authorities many of whom have centuries of religious underpinnings a state already showing signs of secessionist and other divisive tendencies may well be advised not to raise any unnecessary competition with traditional authorities a probable and likely effect of the dispute between the oba of benin and the governor of edo state or federal government would be to delay restitution those who were never keen on the restitution of looted african treasures may now think they have a legitimate ground for delay or postponement of restitution they are surely mistaken they should realize that they are not responsible for the future of the looted african objects that are to return to africa for example the germans who have been negotiating with the nigerian government which usually sends a delegation that includes representatives of the oba have no excuse for not following the agreed programme of completing the restitution that begins and finishes in 2022 the assumption has always been that the restituted treasures would be returned to benin city where they were looted by the notorious british punitive expedition where individual objects are finally placed is not the business of the german government this is up to the nigerians to decide we should remember that in the last decades whenever a benin treasure was returned to nigeria it was returned directly to the oba of benin in benin city who can forget the joy and enthusiasm with which dr mark walker a british doctor was greeted in benin city in 2014 when he returned two benin artefacts to the oba of benin oba erediauwa before an assembly of hundreds of excited and enthusiastic edo who were witnessing a historic event of great dimensions the speeches and music on that day embraced the unique nature of the historic event dr walker brought two looted objects he inherited from his great grandfather who was a member of the notorious punitive expedition of 1897 16 in 1938 when britain returned pieces of oba ovonramven s coral regalia to benin it was sent directly to oba akenzua ii who sang and danced with joy at this gesture from the british whenever the british museum with its usual concern for nigerian culture sold benin artefacts to the nigerian government they were sent to the central government then in lagos 17 there should be no misunderstanding as regards the current situation of looted african artefacts in the western world germany should no doubt be congratulated for having finally taken the decision to restitute looted benin artefacts in 2022 this is a great achievement considering the more than 124 years delay in which spurious and baseless arguments were presented to avoid restitution but what about the remaining benin treasures in the german institutions that are not part of the benin dialogue group and whose benin objects are not listed on the official german site supposing those museums and institutions refuse to restitute their benin artefacts what will happen can the federal german government put pressure on them to hand over the objects to benin 18 we will also have to ensure that the lists are complete and account for losses damages and sales or exchanges with other institutions in or outside germany germany has not yet agreed to return the other looted nigerian and african artefacts in german institutions these also must be returned to their original owners other european states such as the netherlands and belgium have announced plans which if implemented will result in restitution but no concrete restitution has taken place yet museums in the united states have not declared their intention to restitute the thousands of looted african artefacts they are detaining in their hall and depots but those institutions are beginning to examine their stock of looted african artefacts the state that is principally responsible for much of the looting of african artefacts in ethiopia in ghana in benin and elsewhere has so far rejected restitution at most the united kingdom has generously offered to loan to nigerians some of the benin treasures the mighty empire stole in 1897 we do know whether this offer of loans includes the ivory hip mask of queen mother idia which the british refused to loan to nigeria for the purpose of festac 77 the great pan african cultural festival in1977 the british secretary of state for culture has advised british museums and other cultural institutions not to remove statues or return artefacts they must retain and explain them as part of the glorious colonial history the minister has threatened to withdraw funds from institutions that do not follow the government s policy new staff must sign a written document accepting the government s policy before they are offered a contract 19 obas akenzua esigie ewuakpe ewuare ovonramwen and others may have thought they were recording benin history and customs when they commissioned bronze casters to record the history and customs of their people we now know for sure that what they were really recording was to become part of the history of the british empire and of the british isles the british secretary for culture and a number of historians on the isles seem to support this view moreover a recent poll by yougov indicates that a third of the british population shares the view that the benin artefacts are part of british history 20 after all it was the british who looted the benin treasures in 1897 and made them thereby famous this is part of their history in the face of such theories and arguments most people are easily discouraged readers may forgive me for not offering vigorous ripostes to such arguments the sheer audacity of the argument is enough to disarm seasoned polemicists from offering counterarguments for fear of descending to a level of argumentation hitherto unknown even in restitution debates based on the new thinking coming from the british isles we may allow bank robbers to keep the millions they have stolen from the bank because the stolen objects become part of their histories as for the deprived owners tough luck we cannot undo history morality has also been jettisoned into the sea colonialist and racist ideologies have not disappeared entirely from europe despite recent progress due largely to the impact of the black lives matter movement that has shaken not only slavery and colonialist statues but also many museums and cultural institutions but the old problems survive and europeans are not yet ready to apologize for their past crimes and amend their arrogant and unlawful methods some british intellectuals have suggested that the british museum should keep the benin artefacts because the resources benin used in purchasing metal from europe derived from slave trade it makes you wonder how widespread knowledge about slavery is in the united kingdom even among intellectuals supposing we suggested that all objects in the united kingdom which somehow involved slavery finance were free to be taken would the british museum liverpool museum and oxford university survive the consequential assaults the right wing of course believes that britain freed all of us from slavery britain cannot go on forever against the direction of history belgium france germany netherlands and other states have understood and recognized the movement of history and its direction for freedom and the ever growing demands for justice including reparation for colonial injustice and restitution of looted artefacts will britain the home of magna carta and the mother of all parliaments be the last to recognize this and the growing demands for self determination 21 no matter what the inhabitants of the british isles may think about the ownership of the looted benin artefacts the majority of the citizens of mainland europe seems to have accepted that the looted african artefacts should be returned to their owners in africa and their governments are organizing themselves to do what should have been done hundred years ago restitute the objects to the owners the british are now having problems on restitution of the benin bronzes they should be reminded that we are still waiting for the restitution of asante gold ethiopian crosses manuscripts and crosses as well as many other looted artefacts that were illegally taken during the colonial period the great ekpo eyo has underlined the importance of benin art to the contemporary court of the oba of benin the many artforms created over centuries by the carvers and metal workers for the royal court of the benin kingdom still resonate in benin city many of the rituals forms of regalia and commemorative ancestral practices continue to function today in much the same way as in the illustrious times of benin s powerful predecessors 22 the benin artefacts will be returned to the oba of benin in benin city nigeria kwame opoku notes 1 on the so so called benin plan of action see kwame opoku benin plan of action 2 will this miserable project be the last word on the looted benin artefacts one can sympathize with the frustration of prince edun akenzua brother of the late oba erediauwa wh om he represented at various meetings on the benin artefacts that did not seem to be going anywhere close to the issue of restitution of benin artefacts his disappointment was specifically caused by the meeting of the so called benin dialogue group in 2013 in benin city which issued the the benin plan of action for restitution this document did not constitute a plan nor was it about restitution that the benin dialogue group was not interested in restitution was made much clearer when that group in later years issued a statement that itg was removing the item restitution from its agenda when we reported on this the late prof folarin our predecessor in the area of restitution attacked us for reporting this benin dialogue group removes restitution of benin artefacts from its agenda members of the group were at most willing to consider loans of the looted benin artefacts to nigeria later as pressure was brought on germany to agree to restitutions to the nigerians the group appeared to pretend it had worked all the time towards restitution historians

competent authorities in the eu are committed to provide guidance for research organisations on how to strengthen internal compliance measures while it is recognised that it takes time for research organisations to set up and maintain such measures a systematic and proportionate approach to internal compliance measures for dual use export controls is vital to comply with the applicable eu dual use regulation and national complementary measures it is up to each research organisation to determine how internal compliance measures are best implemented and what internal operational procedures for individual researchers are to be followed this could be accomplished by building new export control structures or incorporating these measures in existing structures such as advisory bodies an internal compliance programme icp for dual use export controls is often only one part of the research organisationâ s overall compliance system many research activities performed by research organisations are not subject to dual use export control scrutiny firstly because such research does not relate to any of the items on the eu dual use list secondly because the research does not specifically deal with technology for the development production or use that is responsible for achieving or extending the controlled performance levels or functions in the eu dual use list lastly because it can be labelled as â basic scientific researchâ or â in the public domainâ as defined in the eu dual use regulation or it represents the minimum necessary information for patent applications however no reputable research organisation wishes to be involved in the misuse of proliferation relevant research output this is not just a matter of being obliged to comply with export controls but also in its own self interest hence it is important that research organisations take proportionate and effective internal measures to minimise the risk of non compliance the absence of such measures may lead to legal liability being attached to the institution should non compliance be detected top level management commitment is needed to emphasise the importance and value placed on effective compliance and to provide adequate resources to ensure the compliance commitments section 2 awareness for researchers 2 1â â â introduction eu dual use export controls exist to prevent the undesired accumulation of conventional military items and the proliferation of nuclear radiological chemical and biological weapons also known as weapons of mass destruction wmd and their delivery systems such as missiles and drones in addition these controls may be complemented with national measures for dual use items that are not listed in annex i of the eu dual use regulation because of public security or human rights concerns since dual use items are predominantly used for civilian purposes their potential for abuse is often not apparent at first glance in the wrong hands however they pose a threat to international peace and the security interests of the european union and its member states research organisations are often concerned about the public perception of research with military potential â dual useâ in the context of research is often considered in a broad sense what are the un desired civil and military applications of research or what is potential misuse of research for unethical purposes with regards to the eu dual use export control system however â dual useâ is to be understood in a restricted meaning it refers to items including software and technology which can be used for both civil and military purposes for more information on the scope of listed and non listed dual use items see subsection 2 3 2 and appendix 1 everyone natural or legal person has the legal obligation when dealing with dual use items to comply with the relevant laws and regulations these legal obligations are not identical to but may overlap with ethical motivations or self restriction that exist to prevent or mitigate the risks and potential damage which may be caused by malicious use of research involving dual use items this guidance speaks of â research involving dual use itemsâ dual use items that are used during research or research that results in research output in any possible formâ 7 meeting the technical specification of a dual use item in the eu dual use control list or in a complementary national dual use list if any in a limited number of cases it includes situations with military or wmd end use r concerns for non listed dual use items it is important to note that not every research activity involving dual use items will require an authorisation subsection 2 3 6 details in what cases an authorisation is needed 2 2â â â research areas and scenarios that could trigger dual use export controls the aim of export controls is not to censor scientific research output but to prevent security related abuse when sensitive goods or knowledge are transferred abroad scientists and research institutions are bound by the same laws as manufacturing industry and everyone else before goods are exported or information is transferred exporters and information brokers have a duty to check whether their actions require prior regulatory approval it is recognised that in the research context this requires balancing the concerns of inter national security and academic freedom but also the push for open access related to research output and data â academic freedom is a fundamental right guaranteed by the charter of fundamental rights of the european unionâ 8 however that does not exempt the researchers and research organisations from complying with regulations that are established to safeguard the security interests of the eu and of its member statesâ 9 â the push for open access as required by some funding programs aims to improve the access to and re use of research output and data however these open access objectives also do not exempt the researchers and research organization from screening proposed publications and data sets first under the technology control provisions of the eu dual use regulation and act accordingly research disciplines within science technology and engineering are more likely to be subject to dual use export controls than academic activities in humanities social sciences and economics the following topics are examples of research that could trigger dual use export controls â changing the host spectrum of lumpy skin disease virus to include human reservoirs â multispectral imaging camera sensors for data collection of crops â laser based next generation uranium enrichment technology as a potential alternative for the industrial enrichment that involves gaseous uranium in centrifuges â 3d printing of energetic materials â prototype drone with spraying system for combatting eastern equine encephalitis virus and â autonomous scientific underwater vessel that collects data automatically in deep sea regions appendix 1 illustrates research areas that among others may be subject to dual use export controls as the eu dual use control list contains items in these technology domains for instance research related to nuclear physics and engineering may deal with nuclear reactors specially designed or prepared equipment and components of nuclear reactors or to nuclear material that is on annex i to the eu dual use regulation this does not mean that all related research is by default research involving listed dual use itemsâ 10 nor that the research activity requires an authorisation appendix 2 highlights some recurring research scenarios that may trigger export controls â teachingâ 11 consulting collaborating or working on research involving dual use items with visiting foreign researchers inside the customs territory of the unionâ 12 â teaching consulting collaborating or working on research involving dual use items outside customs territory of the union â organising a virtual conference meeting seminar or presenting at a virtual conference meeting seminar inside or outside the customs territory of the union about research involving dual use items â publishing about listed dual use technology â submitting information for patent application and patented information and â exporting tangible dual use items goods including prototype design and second hand lab equipment in each of these scenarios it is also important to determine if any eu or national restrictive measures or sanctions apply for the items the type of activity the end use or the entities and countries involved in these scenarios personal motivation the source of research funding the nature of research partners and the purpose of research are irrelevant for determining whether the research involving dual use items meets the technical control thresholds dual use export controls may arise at different levels during the research life cycle at the stage of research funding project application contract development disseminating research output etcetera section 3 provides more information on how to set up a systematic export screening procedure at the different levels during the research life cycle 2 3â â â basics of the eu dual use export control system 2 3 1â â â the eu dual use regulation the eu dual use export control system is governed by the eu dual use regulation annex i to the eu dual use regulation contains the eu list of dual use items all items in annex i to the eu dual use regulation require a licence for exporting outside customs territory of the union annex iv to the eu dual use regulation is a small subset of annex i and contains more sensitive items that require a licence also for intra eu transfers annex i and thus also annex iv is dynamic to account for technological advances over time and the eu export controls reflect commitments agreed upon in export control regimes therefore the list is updated every year it is important to always consult the latest version of annex i to the eu dual use regulationâ 13 every dual use item has a classification number this is a combination of numbers and a letter comprising the category the subcategory and the individual control entry and is crucial for the item classification and authorisation documents the classification number is not random it refers to the nature of the item and the origin of control by the corresponding export control regime see figure 1 figure 1 illustrates the meaning of the dual use classification number the dual use classification number 9a012 a refers to controlled unmanned aerial vehicles or drones with technical specifications and certain related equipment and components â â 9â means that the item is listed in category 9 aerospace and propulsion â â aâ means that the item is listed in subcategory a systems equipment and components hence a complete drone meeting the technical specifications under 9a012 will be listed under a â â 012â means that the item originates from the control list of the wassenaar arrangement â â a â is the individual sub control entry for complete drones the classification of dual use items is based on objective technical criteria and the end use and end user do not play a role in the technical classification accordingly it is irrelevant for the classification and for the existence of the licensing requirement whether the item is to be used exclusively for civilian purposes or whether a military use is intended however the end use and involved parties play an essential role in the question of eligibility for licence approval consult subsection 2 3 9 and appendix 3 for more support on end use and end user checks dual use items are generally distinct from military items military items are commodities such as systems equipment components materials software or technology that are in most parts specially designed or modified for military use military items are listed in the common military list of the european union or in national lists in eu member states â 14 unlike the common eu dual use export control system the control system for military items is governed by each eu member state the stated military end use of research output or activity does not automatically render this item specially designed or modified for military use however it may be an indicator and obviously is useful information in the classification of military items and licence application assessment concerning the list of dual use items in annex i to the eu dual use regulation it is important to keep the following in mind â the ten categories are a consolidation of the control lists by four export control regimes nuclear suppliers group missile technology control regime australia group and wassenaar arrangement and by the chemical weapons convention each category is further divided into subcategories and into dedicated control entries in general items listed in subcategories b c d and e relate to listed items under subcategory a in a few cases there are dedicated stand alone controls under these subcategories the ten categories and five subcategories are a first breakdown of the list and may facilitate browsing through the relevant control entries â dual use items are generally distinct from military items military items are commodities such as systems equipment components materials software or technology that are specially designed or modified for military use the technical specifications for dual use items are often more detailed than the ones for military items the meaning of â specially designed for military useâ or â modified for military useâ is largely determined by the competent authority which is not necessarily the same as the competent authority for dual use export controls â the items specified in annex i to the eu dual use regulation include both new and used second hand items â the dual use classification list number is not the same as the customs commodity code harmonised system or combined nomenclature â 15 this is particularly relevant for the classification of tangible items including equipment materials and components â the eu dual use list contains tangible items including equipment materials and components but also intangible items such as software or technology in the form of technical data or technical assistance intangible items can be transferred in tangible format e g hard copy slides or physical data storage device or transferred electronically visually or orally also known as intangible format â 16 â controls on technology are of the utmost importance if proliferators are able to obtain a tangible dual use item they may be able to copy parts of it but they would not necessarily be able to produce additional items however if they acquire the technology to develop or produce the item they can manufacture as many as they want additionally while tangible items may be exported temporarily the export of technology is almost impossible to recover and is to be considered as definitive â an authorisation issued for an item also covers the minimum technology necessary for the installation operation maintenance and repair of that item 2 3 2â â â how to read the text of the dual use codes annex i to the eu dual use regulation is long and there is no single best way to quickly find each and every listed dual use item during a novel classification exercise in order to classify in the right way our dual use goods or our dual use technology it is important to go through the latest version of annex i thoroughly to find the most relevant and thus most specific control entry for the item at hand in case of doubt or in case of multiple possible classification numbers consult the compliance officer at your research organisation or where appropriate the competent authority in your member state in many control entries there are several notes note technical note or nota bene to assist in the exact item classification these notes further clarify the control scope including illustrations or de control or make a cross reference to other parts of annex i or the eu common military listâ 17 these notes are integral part of the item classification and thus should not be considered as illustrative the list has a set of global definitionsâ 18 indicated with â â double quotation marks and local definitions indicated with â â single quotation marks these definitions may differ from commercial or scientific jargon example 1 1c351 a 57 1c351 human and animal pathogens and â toxinsâ as follows a viruses whether natural enhanced or modified either in the form of â isolated live culturesâ or as material including living material which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures as follows â 57 severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus sars related coronavirus â 19 â note 1c351 does not control â vaccinesâ or â immunotoxinsâ example 2 1a004 d 1a004 protective and detection equipment and components not specially designed for military use as follows d electronic equipment designed for automatically detecting or identifying the presence of â explosivesâ residues and utilising â trace detectionâ techniques e g surface acoustic wave ion mobility spectrometry differential mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry technical note â trace detectionâ is defined as the capability to detect less than 1 ppm vapour or 1 mg solid or liquid note 1 1a004 d does not control equipment specially designed for laboratory use note 2 1a004 d does not control non contact walk through security portals â 2 3 3â â â software controls subcategory d software in the context of the eu dual use regulation is defined as a collection of one or more â programsâ â 20 or â microprogramsâ â 21 fixed in any tangible medium of expression in many instances the software controls relate to software designed or modified for the development production or use of listed items elsewhere in the eu dual use list but there are also dedicated stand alone software controls example 6d001 includes the control of â softwareâ specially designed for the â developmentâ or â productionâ of equipment amongst others specified inâ 6a008 specific radar systems equipment assemblies and specially designed components 7d005 refers to â softwareâ specially designed to decrypt satellite navigation system ranging code designed for government use key take aways for the definition of software the definition of software indicates that in order to be listed the software must exist at some point in a tangible medium or expression the software itself may be transferred by both tangible and intangible means the definition of software needs to be read in conjunction with the nuclear software note for category 0 and the general software note for category 1 to 9 in relation to information security software specified in category 5 part 2 it is important to note that the nuclear software note in its entirety and the general software note partially does not apply and thus cannot be used for releasing from control 2 3 4â â â technology controls subcategory e technology controls exist to ensure that knowledge know how and expertise related to sensitive items are not inadvertently supplied for use in programmes with military wmd public security or human rights concerns determining whether research involves dual use items can be very challenging innovative research does not easily allow itself to be labelled according to the existing control entries a good understanding of the definition of â technologyâ the technology notes and the de control notes â basic scientific researchâ and â in the public domainâ are essential to navigate through the technology controls â technologyâ in the context of the eu dual use regulation means specific information necessary for the â developmentâ â productionâ or â useâ of goods this information takes the form of â technical dataâ or â technical assistanceâ the reference to â specific information necessaryâ is intended to focus the technology control on that part of technology that makes an item to meet or exceed the listed performance thresholds for category 1 to 9 only this specific information is to be considered as listed dual use technology the aim of the definition of â requiredâ is to focus the technology controls on the specific technology that makes an item subject to license importantly listed dual use technology remains under control even when applicable to any uncontrolled item what is covered by â specific information necessaryâ is not defined generally the following information is not considered to be specific enough to be falling under the technology definition â safety data sheet sds material safety data sheet msds or product safety data sheet psds â brochures catalogues and excerpts thereof which in their respective form are intended or may be intended for an indefinite number of interested parties and which are made available to them without individual changes to the contents â schematic diagrams block diagrams process diagrams without detailed data â technical performance data key performance indicators â electrical and mechanical connection and consumption data â parts lists if no reference can be made to drawings â norms and standards that are generally available and not specific to a company product â articles from trade journals and comparable publications â general process and procedure descriptions in the case of production plants â delivery specifications e g for chemicals and other auxiliary materials â photos without detailed information on geometric sizes materials used and electrical electronic components â exploded drawings elevations without detailed dimensions â sectional views schematic and without material and detailed data illustration of the â requiredâ threshold 3e001 refers to the controlled technology for the â developmentâ or â productionâ of listed integrated circuits specified in amongst others 3a001 a 3a001 a 5 a 5 refers to analogue to digital converter integrated circuits with a resolution of 16 bit or more with a sample rate greater than 65 mega samples per second a documentâ 22 detailing the design parameters or the design steps necessary to achieve or exceed the 65 mega samples per second threshold alone does not contain the technology that is peculiarly responsible for developing the controlled 3a001 a 5 a 5 item and thus it does not contain the â requiredâ technology under the general technology note the reason is that the document does not detail how to achieve or exceed the â resolution of 16 bitâ parameter a manual describing the production technique to produce analogue to digital converter integrated circuits with a resolution of 16 bit or more but with a sample rate below 65 mega samples per second does not contain the â requiredâ technology to produce the controlled item in the two above situation the document and manual are not considered containing the controlled technology required for the development or production of listed 3a001 a 5 a 5 items as it does not contain the specific information related to the two technical parameters described inâ 3a001 a 5 a 5 example 1e001 controls â technologyâ according to the general technology note for the â developmentâ or â productionâ of equipment or materials specified inâ 1a002 to 1a005 1a006 b 1a007 1b or 1c letâ s apply this to 1c216 1c216 specifies the controls for maraging steel this item is controlled in category 1 therefore the general technology note is applicable hence the controlled dual use technology under 1e001 is the one that is â requiredâ for the â developmentâ or â productionâ of maraging steel with the specifications of 1c216 what is not controlled under 1e001 research output detailing â this type of maraging steel without providing detailed information on how to develop or produce this type of maraging steel â an historic overview of existing production methods in the public domain of this type of maraging steel â an innovative production process of maraging steel that does not meet the required thresholds inâ 1c216 and 1c116 what is controlled under 1e001 research output detailing â existing development or production processes that are not yet in the public domain and are not basic scientific research â an innovative not yet in the public domain development or production process of maraging steel that does meet the required thresholds inâ 1c216 and that is not basic scientific research key take aways for the definition of technology â technology is defined as the specific information necessary for the â developmentâ â productionâ or â useâ of listed dual use items this means that in order to be classified as listed dual use technology the technical data or technical assistance must contain specific information necessary for the development production or use of the goods specified in categories 0 through 9 the meaning of specific information is not defined in the eu dual use regulation the meaning of development production and use is defined â the definition of technology needs to be read in conjunction with the nuclear technology note for category 0 and the general technology note for categories 1 to 9 â for category 0 nuclear items listed dual use technology is the specific information that is â directly associated with any goods controlled in category 0â this is a broad description hence the range of controlled nuclear technology is larger compared to the controlled technology in category 1 to 9 â for category 1 to 9 only that part of â technologyâ that is â requiredâ for the â developmentâ â productionâ or â useâ of goods controlled in categories 1 to 9 is controlled according to the provisions of categories 1 to 9 â requiredâ is defined as that part of the information which is peculiarly responsible for achieving or extending the controlled performance levels characteristics or functions from the dual use control list these controlled performance levels characteristics or functions are generally very specific and high hereby thus limiting the technology that meets the â requiredâ threshold and thus limiting the technology for which one may seek to apply the de control notes â basic scientific researchâ and â in the public domainâ be aware that some research funding programmes require to do a dual use screening at the time of application for a research grant it is a good practice based on internal review mechanisms to detect early on in the research program or project which of the involved equipment or materials or the anticipated results such as publications may need further dual use export control scrutiny if such potential dual use export control issues are identified follow up is needed during and at the end of the research programs or projects the exporter is obliged to adequately assess the technology to determine if it meets the threshold for dual use control due to their expertise and knowledge of their own research the researcher is most suited to adequately classify its own research possibly with the support of trained administrative staff that is familiar with the structure of the eu dual use list presentations or publications will rarely in entirety meet the controlled technology threshold some subsections or small excerpts may meet the threshold only these parts are licence required if the researcher or research organisation is in need of guidance they can contact their national competent authority this enables the researcher or research organisation to make an informed choice regarding which parts should be submitted for export licence application before transmitting or publishing 2 3 5â â â de controls for dual use items the eu dual use regulation contains a number of de controls stating under which conditions a certain listed item is excluded from control hence while such item meets the technical requirements it will not require a license for export or transfer importantly the de controls can only be applied to listed dual use items basically there are two kinds of de controls on the one hand there are de controls specifically linked to a certain listed dual use items examples note 2 under 2b001 states that this control entry does not apply to special purpose machine tools limited to the manufacture of dental prostheses note 2 under 5a002 a does not control items where the â information securityâ functionality is limited to wireless â personal area networkâ functionality implementing only published or commercial cryptographic standards on the other hand there are systematic de controls for software and technology these de control notes are inserted in the nuclear software note the nuclear technology note general software note and the general technology note in annex i to the eu dual use regulation only listed dual use â softwareâ or â technologyâ can benefit from the de controls mentioned in the software and technology notes it is thus paramount to determine whether the research involves dual use items and if so what part s meet s the software or technology control entry in respectively subcategory d and e in conjunction with the software notes and technology notes â the nuclear software note highlights that the minimum necessary object code for the installation operation maintenance checking or repair of those items listed in category 0 whose export has been authorised is not controlled â the general software note includes three de controls for listed software in category 1 to 9 â software that is generally available to the public meaning that the software is sold from stock at retail selling points without restriction and designed for installation by the user without further substantial support by the supplier â software that is already in the public domain or â the minimum necessary â object codeâ for the installation operation maintenance checking or repair of those items whose export has been authorised in relation to information security software specified in category 5 part 2 it is important to note that the nuclear software note in its entirety and the general software note partially does not apply and thus cannot be used for releasing from control for listed dual use technology there are three de controls possible â technologyâ that is the result from â basic scientific researchâ â technologyâ that is already â in the public domainâ and the minimum necessary information for patent applications the latter does not apply to category 0 technology in the following part the guidance focuses on the de controls â basic scientific researchâ â in the public domainâ and minimum necessary information for patent applications key take aways for the de control note â basic scientific researchâ for technology the eu dual use regulation defines â basic scientific researchâ as experimental or theoretical work undertaken principally to acquire new knowledge of the fundamental principles of phenomena or observable facts not primarily directed towards a specific practical aim or objective while not stated explicitly it refers to fundamental research hereby excluding from de control non fundamental research or applied research this definition poses implementation challenges as it remained unchanged for many years and due to the evolving nature of the research ecosystem it is important to bear in mind that terminology can be an issue here a scientific classification of a research project as â basic researchâ does not necessarily or automatically comply with the definition of â basic scientific researchâ of the eu dual use regulation the compliance staff in your organisation or your competent authority may assist you with the classification in cases of doubt basic scientific research is a de control for listed dual use technology only it cannot be used for tangible items goods such as equipment and materials in essence it de controls the actual research output and not the intention to produce research output at the research funding stage this is a crucial distinction when to consider applying this de control note this guidance provides two criteria to assist in determining whether the de control note â basic scientific researchâ is relevant the technology readiness level and the prevalence of industry funding both criteria do not determine whether the de control note should apply this has to be decided on a case by case basis via the internal export screening procedures and where appropriate in consultation with the competent authority â technology readiness level trl is a scale 1 to 9 originally developed by the united states national aeronautics and space administration nasa and later taken over by others administrations institutions or agencies to assess the status of development of space technologies trl is a commonly used tool by the research community as well as within the european research and innovation programmes to assess the market readiness of new and emerging technologies for export control purposes research output stemming from trl 1 andâ 2 research are generally considered basic scientific research the eligibility of research output stemming from trl 3 andâ 4 are to be assessed on a case by case basis research output stemming from research above trl 4 is not considered as basic scientific research see appendix 8 for a description of the different technology readiness levels â industry funding sponsor involved research that is externally funded by an industry partner is more likely to result in a commercial development regardless of whether the project is initiated by industry itself or a public body furthermore in many cases via contractual arrangements the industry funder or sponsor is given the opportunity to review and comment on publications or presentations prior to their release and to request the temporary exclusive use of research results these types of collaboration can be indicative that the resulting research output will not be basic scientific research in some cases industry indeed funds fundamental research with no strings attached concerning publications or other research output in such cases the basic scientific research de control could be considered if it involves listed dual use technology and the trl level is low enough key take aways for the de control note â in the public domainâ for software or technology the eu dual use regulation defines â in the public domainâ as follows â technologyâ or â softwareâ which has been made available without restrictions upon its further dissemination copyright restrictions do not remove â technologyâ or â softwareâ from being â in the public domainâ in essence it de controls listed dual use software and technology anyone can obtain this eu guidance emphasises that controlled dual use software or technology that is not yet in the public domain cannot be de controlled under the â in the public domainâ de control note the definition clearly refers to software or technology which has been made available without restrictions upon its further dissemination the intended act of releasing the object code for software or technology in the public domain is not sufficient for becoming de controlled that means that a to be research output open source software publication conference material â can only benefit from this de control if the listed dual use software or technology that it contains is already in the public domain hence the act of releasing without an authorization could be a violation of export controls the reference to â without restrictionsâ has to be understood as not limiting the access to only a restricted group of persons if information is only made accessible after an individual decision has been taken by the information carrier or owner then not everyone has the possibility to access the information and thus the information cannot be considered as being in the public domain legal restrictions for example copyright restrictions without relevance under export control law do not affect eligibility for being de controlled similarly measures such as requesting a fee for access or prior registration to access is not considered as a restriction as long as everybody is allowed to pay the fee or register open source development is often conducted globally by communities in a collaborative way open source technologies or software that is published and made publicly available without restrictions can benefit from the public domain de control technology for the development of â intrusion softwareâ can be decontrolled in case the technology is in the context of â vulnerability disclosureâ or â cyber incident responseâ consult the latest version of annex i for the applicable definitions if a researcher refers to or integrates proliferation sensitive information from other sources that is already in the public domain then it does not make the research output automatically controlled dual use software or technology the fact that such listed dual use software or technology became available in the public domain without a licence is a violation of export control regulations but this cannot be attributed to this researcher key take aways for the de control â minimum necessary information for patent applicationsâ for technology the general technology note contains an exemption for the minimum necessary information for patent applications this minimum information needed to submit a patent application is thus exempt from export controls this de control makes no distinction between national eu or international patent applications once the patent information is published in the public domain it is no longer subject to export controls there is no definition in the eu dual use regulation of what entails â minimum necessary informationâ it is generally understood as the information needed to meet the filing requirements as determined by the european patent office or the patent offices of the eu member states 2 3 6â â â controlled activities not every research activity involving dual use items will require a licence the eu dual use regulation includes five different types of activities that require an authorisation section 2 3 7 details which types of licence exist for each of these activities the following two are constant authorisation requirements â an export authorisation is needed for the movement or transmission outside the customs territory of the union of any listed dual use item in annex i to the eu dual use regulation â a transfer authorisation is needed for the movement or transmission of items inside the customs territory of the union only for listed dual use items in annex iv to the eu dual use regulation the following three are authorization requirements on a case by case basis â a transit authorisation is needed for items passing through the customs territory of the union â a brokering authorisation is needed for the brokering of items between third countries from inside the customs territory of the union â an authorisation is required for provision of technical assistance related to dual use items the transit or brokering of listed dual use items and provision of technical assistance for listed dual use items may be prohibited or may require an authorisation respectively if the item is or may be intended in its entirety or in part for uses referred to in articleâ 4 1 of the eu dual use regulation it is the competent authority that decides whether an authorisation is required or a transit is prohibited some eu member states have adopted national measures concerning the transit brokering or provision of technical assistance controls for non listed dual use items a list of national measures adopted by member states in accordance with regulation eu 2021 821 is published and regularly updated by the european commission â 23 some items do not meet the technical specifications of annex i but are nonetheless proliferation sensitive due to their technical possibilities or suspected end use of concern transactions with such items and with suspected end use concerns could require an authorisation requirement for exports such controls for non listed dual use items are called â catch all controlsâ see also subsection 2 3 8 appendix 5 provides for a flow chart on determining the licence requirements under the eu dual use regulation 2 3 7â â â types of authorisations the eu dual use regulation contains the following types of authorisations â individual export authorisations covering one or more dual use items to one specific exporter for one end user or consignee in a third country â global export authorisations covering one or more dual use items which may be valid for exports to one or more specified end users and or in one or more specified third countries â large project authorisations covering one or more dual use items which may be valid for exports to one or more specified end users in one or more specified third countries for the purpose of a specified large scale project â union general export authorisations eugeas serve the aim to simplify the export of specific dual use items to certain countries of destination available to all eu based exporters who respect its conditions and requirements for use as listed in annexes iia to iif annex iia to iih correspond to the eight available eugeas eugea 001 to eugea 008 â national general export authorisations ngeas are additional simplified authorisations for specific dual use items to certain countries of destination as defined by national legislation these authorisations only apply to exporters based in the respective eu member stateâ 24 â authorisation for the provision of technical assistance from the customs territory of the union into the territory of a third country within the territory of a third country or to a resident of a third country temporarily present in the customs territory of the union â authorisation for brokering services for a set quantity of specific dual use items moving between two or more third countries â transit authorisation for non union dual use items that only transit the eu â intra eu transfer authorisation for annex iv dual use items from one eu member state to another eu member state eu member states may complement these authorisation requirements with national licence requirements or prohibitions an eu authorisation granted licence is valid in all 27 eu member states and can be used to export the items from anywhere in the customs union territory the validity of licences is determined by each ms examples publication researcher a would like to publish an article in an american journal the article contains technology covered by annex i to the eu dual use regulation more specifically 3e001 in relation to the development of 3a002 c signal analysers and will also be available outside the united states of america us after its publication 3e001 in relation to 3a002 c is covered by the items listed in eugea 001 the us is one of the countries of destination authorised in the eugea 001 researcher a however cannot use the eugea 001 to send the article to the american publisher as the exporter knows that the item will not remain in the eugea 001 country to

â controls on export for non listed dual use items some items do not meet the technical specifications of annex i but are nonetheless proliferation sensitive due to their technical possibilities or suspected end use of concern under articleâ 4 of the eu dual use regulation national authorities can impose an authorisation requirement for dual use items not listed in annex i if there is a suspected connection with use in a wmd program suspected military end use in a country subject to an arms embargoâ 25 or suspected use of the item as a component in military equipment that has been exported without or in violation of an authorisation this provision is known as the â catch all controlâ and in such a case where you have a suspected potential use of your items in one of the mentioned above cases it is recommended that you contact your national authority for further information under articleâ 5 of the eu dual use regulation the export of non listed cyber surveillance items may be subject to authorisation requirement in case you have been informed by your competent authority or if you are aware according to your due diligence findings â that there is an end use of concern in connection with internal repression and or the commission of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law under articleâ 9 of the eu dual use regulation an eu member state may prohibit or impose an authorisation requirement on the export of dual use items not listed in annex i for reasons of public security including the prevention of acts of terrorism or human rights considerations a list of such national measures is compiled by the european commission and published in the official journal it is also available on the website of the european commission â 26 appendix 7 summarizes the licence requirements for exports and intra eu transfers of dual use items 2 3 9â â â red flags being vigilant for signs of suspicious enquiries or collaborations is vital for countering the risks of wmd proliferation their means of delivery and the destabilising accumulations of conventional weapons sharing suspicious information with your internal compliance point of contact is highly recommended in some cases information sharing with the competent export control authority may be mandatory under eu and national laws and regulations appendix 3 contains a list of â red flagsâ to assist researchers or compliance staff to make an initial assessment whether dual use export controls may apply this list groups the red flags according to the research end use and end user shipment and funding finance and contract condition this list is particularly useful for non listed dual use items to determine whether catch all controls may apply it is a good practice as well to use this list when gathering necessary information during the licence application process for listed dual use items 2 3 10â â â control of technical assistance there are two types of controls of technical assistance one which is regulated in the dual use regulation and one which is regulated according to national law in the eu member states technology according to the eu dual use regulation may take the form of technical assistance such as verbal instruction training passing on of technical knowledge and skills or advisory services including by telephone or electronic means hence the instruction given to a colleague working at in a third country research institute can constitute technical assistance the technical assistance must be specific enough to meet the technology thresholds in annex i to the dual use regulation other than dual use listed technology in the form of technical assistance listed in annex i of the eu dual use regulation it covers all other technical support related to the repair development manufacture assembly testing maintenance or any other technical service intended for use in connection with the development production handling operation maintenance storage detection identification or dissemination of chemical biological or nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or the development production maintenance or storage of missiles capable of delivering such weapons or related to military end uses in destinations subject to an arms embargo 2 3 11â â â export controls and restrictive measures sanctions export controls and sanctions both impose prohibitions or restrictions while export controls are focussed on non listed items and case by case export screening sanctions are primarily focused on travel bans asset freezes and prohibitions to make economic resources available to designated persons and entities and or sectorial measures such as restricting certain items and services to specific countries in some cases to all end users in a specific country this guidance does not provide for specific information on eu sanctions see the eu sanctions map for an overview of all applicable eu sanctions at the moment and the list of designated persons and entities for general information on eu sanctions see additional guidance can be made available at the national level 2 3 12â â â frequently asked questions who is the exporter under the eu dual use regulation both natural persons and legal persons are covered by the definition of exporter this means that a researcher on his or her own behalf or the research organisation on behalf of the researcher can be the exporter the exporter definition applies not only to export operations but to all controlled activities of the eu dual use regulation including the intra eu transfers for items listed in annex iv it is up to the research organisation to make internal arrangements concerning who will apply for a licence it should be noted that the identification of the exporter is different from the identification of an export when a visiting third country researcher gets access to for instance controlled technology at a university campus inside the customs territory of the union then no export takes place when this researcher returns home to his her third country and brings with him her the controlled technology then an export takes place which requires an approved and valid licence hence prior to this export a licence application needs to be filed the last person inside the customs territory of the union deciding on the transmission of the controlled technology outside the eu needs to apply for a licence who may apply for this licence application is up to each eu member state to decide it may be the visiting third country researcher but in many cases this researcher will need to have a representative that is established inside the customs territory of the union regardless who is the exporter an export control violation takes place when this controlled technology leaves the customs territory of the union without an approved and valid licence if a publication contains controlled technology does the author the university or the scientific publisher have to apply for a licence the key point here is that a natural or legal person needs to apply for a licence and thus acts as the exporter who that is depends on the internal policy or the contractual arrangement between the author of the publication and the scientific publisher if the publisher is established outside the eu then the last person inside the eu deciding on the transmission of the controlled technology outside the eu needs to apply for a licence can an employee of a research organisation when traveling abroad on a professional visit remotely accessing controlled technology or software located on the server of an eu based research organisation employees accessing controlled technology or software abroad on a professional visit generally have to apply for a licence before traveling some eu member statesâ 27 consider the key determinant here whether the controlled technology or software is accessed abroad by other persons besides the employee s who needs to apply for a licence in case of a research consortium with partners in multiple eu member states and third country partners the exporter and thus the one who must apply for a licence is the one that is the contractual partner of the consignee in the third country and has the power for determining the sending or transmission of the items from the customs territory of the eu for annex i items in other words the consortium partner itself or the consortium leader itself may have to request a licence before sending off the dual use items this depends on the contractual arrangements between the consortium partners and the consortium leader section 3 setting up or reviewing an internal compliance programme for research involving dual use items the role of every internal compliance programme icp is to systematically address and mitigate one or more types of risk in order to ensure compliance with obligations set in the law or undertaken voluntary by an organisation in a research environment setting up compliance measures to conform to export control laws and regulations is a process that takes time and effort the section below lays out all the main elements that a research organisation should consider when it designs or reviews its internal dual use export compliance system 3 1â â â risk assessment while considering whether and to what extent it is concerned by dual use export controls a research organisation needs to conduct an initial risk assessment by examining the following parameters â 28 1 the subjects of its activities e g disciplines and research areas where it is active for an overview of research areas that are more likely to be affected by export controls see appendix 1 2 the type and scope of these activities e g field research online and distance learning and amount of international collaborations and foreign participation involved in its activities 3 the current status of institutional policies and standardised procedures e g type of organisation structure existing mitigating measures for security risks and predominant attitudes of the staff these parameters must be assessed against legal obligations set out in the eu and national export control laws â 29 at the end of this initial risk assessment a research organisation will be able to determine its specific dual use risk profile this will help the organisation to become aware of the parts of its research activities that need to be covered by the icp scope of its internal export compliance system and target the icp to the organisationâ s specific circumstances e g structure institutional procedures and available resources the initial risk assessment is instrumental in designing and implementing icp measures which are effective proportionate and tailored to the specific profile of the organisation it is often preferable to start by addressing activities research areas that require immediate action and such areas which are easily identified as involving dual use items following that the icp can be expanded to cover further risks and more robust mitigating procedures integrating dual use internal compliance measures to existing institutional policies and procedures is often a key to creating efficiencies and synergies research organisations should consider a dynamic legal and research environment where risks should be determined or re evaluated regularly and thus internal compliance measures depend on the evolving control lists and the activities of a research organisation undertaken each time indeed a more thorough evaluation and rating of materials equipment software and technology involved or produced in a research takes place under the â export screening process and proceduresâ as explained in core element 4 3 2â â â the core elements of an icp this section builds on commission recommendation eu 2019 1318 of 30â july 2019 on internal compliance programmes for dual use trade controls under council regulation ec noâ 428 2009 it presents an adaptation of the icp core elements to make them more suitable for use in a research context this adaptation is based on feedback received from the research community and it is articulated along the following subsections 1 top level management commitment to compliance 2 organisation structure responsibilities and resources 3 training and awareness raising 4 export screening process and procedures 5 performance review audits reporting and corrective actions 6 recordkeeping and documentation 7 physical and information security in appendix 4 a checklist for each core element is provided to support developing an icp or at a later stage reviewing an existing icp 3 2 1â â â top level management commitment to compliance top level management commitment and support to an icp is important for both symbolic and practical reasons a proclaimed statement of commitment to compliance with export control law by the top management body function of the organisation can raise the awareness of the staff increase the importance attached to such compliance measures and result to enhanced human and technical resources by other departments of the organisation what is expected from research organisations as in every organisation top level management commitment aims to increase legitimacy of compliance measures and create or enhance an organisational culture that is conducive to dual use export control imperatives in a research environment top management commitment is essential in order to encourage and actively support the deployment of an icp given that research organisations and particularly universities often feature decentralised models of organisation structure it might be useful to consider the expression of commitment at a department faculty or school level e g the different deans of faculties schools such an approach can be particularly relevant to organisations having just few departments potentially concerned by export controls this element is materialised by a written statement and support from top level management which results in adequate organisational human and technical resources for the organisationâ s icp such commitment statement calls all concerned staff to comply with the relevant eu and member state laws and regulations and take the necessary precautions when using controlled inputs or producing research outputs that are sensitive and might be controlled what are the steps involved develop a commitment statement stating that staff members scientific and administrative shall comply with all eu and national dual use export control laws and regulations by applying the mitigating measures foreseen in the organisationâ s policies and procedures refer to the possible consequences of non compliance incidents for the organisation and the individuals involved clearly and regularly communicate the commitment statement to all potentially concerned staff also staff with no role in dual use export control in order to raise awareness and promote a culture of compliance with the dual use export control laws and regulations consider using all available means either electronic or print outs to publicise the statement and sources of information about the internal compliance procedures of the organisation â 30 3 2 2â â â organisation structure responsibilities and resources each research organisation is unique and therefore there is not only one way to organise compliance procedures and allocate respective responsibilities however having a well defined set of procedures and responsibilities for export compliance can help the organisation to achieve its compliance objectives and improve its management model as a whole what is expected from research organisations in a research context there are different types of responsibility to be considered typically such responsibilities will be shared by both administrative and scientific staff the first type of responsibility concerns the overall responsibility for implementing the organisationâ s compliance policies which lies with the management of the organisation this responsibility might entail approval of license applications oversight that adequate resources are allocated to compliance as well as ensuring that there are regular reviews and updates of the compliance measures in place in some member states this function must be a member of the top level management the second type of responsibility requires the establishment of an export compliance function responsible for developing and or implementing the compliance measures of the organisation the tasks of this function may include responding to export control enquiries deciding whether a licence application is relevant and what mitigating measures are necessary for a given activity the export control function may also help staff to understand license conditions apply due diligence checks and maintain appropriate records this responsibility is typically assumed by a department having experience in complying with legal obligations and interacting with the organisationâ s staffs and external collaborators â 31 there should be at least one person in the organisation who is entrusted with export compliance if possible the export control function should be free from conflicts of interest also it should have direct access and a reporting obligation to the top management in addition to this it might be necessary to appoint points of contact in different departments of the organisation who can raise awareness guide the administrative and scientific staff whenever a relevant issue arises and if necessary refer enquiries and requests to the export control function the third type of responsibility concerns the implementation of practical steps to be taken by scientific staff in order to ensure conformity with the organisationâ s compliance requirements this function entails tasks such as identifying projects that might require a license apply end use end user checks and undertake the prescribed mitigating measures and approvals while performing research activities while all concerned staff must adhere to the organisationâ s compliance procedures when performing their work typically the responsibility to identify sensitive projects and apply the required checks lies with the project leader frequently this is the person who secures the funding and coordinates the project within an organisation known also in some research contexts as the principal investigator administrative staff e g from the procurement and legal department can oversee certain compliance tasks as foreseen by the compliance policies such staff can be part of the export compliance function or merely collaborate closely with it administrative staff might be able to identify issues that have escaped the attention of the research staff this way trained administrative staff could act also as the â gate keepersâ when other safeguards fail â 32 appendix 6 offers two examples of possible compliance organisation structure in research settings what are the steps involved determine which parts of your organisation are relevant for export control compliance identify and appoint the person s with the overall responsibility and attribute at least one person to the export compliance function depending on the organisationâ s needs this person may only have to handle tasks relating to dual use export control on a part time basis consider all different types of responsibility and compliance related functions define clear processes and responsibilities for both administrative and scientific staff start by the departments conducting research in a critical area and expand to address other less sensitive departments as your compliance system evolves do not overlook to define the delegation of powers e g in case of sickness or holidays and back up functions whenever possible ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to the icp and consider the knowledge and skillset needed in terms of both legal and technical expertise written job descriptions are recommended be ready to fully exploit expertise and experience already available in different parts of the organisation consult with colleagues of different departments e g procurement security and legal department on the ways that available policies and procedures could accommodate export compliance requirements consider setting up along with your it support online tools and procedures to facilitate the implementation of internal compliance measures codify the organisationâ s export compliance policies and procedures including the main chain of responsibility in manuals handbooks and make them available to the organisation online or in hard copy try to use language that is as precise and clear as possible consider including examples and practical cases such as the ones offered in this guidance or in national sources make sure that the scientific and administrative staff know what procedure to follow and who is the contact point whenever an export control question arises 3 2 3â â â training and awareness raising training and awareness raising is an important element of every icp and it should be tailored to the specific situation of a research organisation awareness raising is considered the first step in enabling both scientific and administrative staff to understand security risks and fulfil their responsibilities under the export control law and the organisationâ s icp training includes specialised courses tailored to the functions and staffs in the organisation that are affected by export controls what is expected from research organisations research organisations need to consider awareness raising and training initiatives at different levels through different means and with varying goals first general introduction to export control issues for all potentially concerned research staff and students is important for raising awareness and promoting a culture of responsibility throughout the organisation this can be accomplished through inclusion of references to export control objectives and related internal measures in codes of conduct webpages on ethics and research integrity as well as general safety and security courses provided regularly â 33 second general training and awareness raising activities should be developed for those scientific staff coming from the organisationâ s departments identified as of relevance to export controls in the initial risk assessment and subsequent re assessments the aim of these trainings is to make staff familiar with export control requirements and ensure that they can take the necessary action when an issue or concern arises in the design planning and execution of their research third targeted training should be conducted towards administrative staff dealing with the implementation of the different internal control procedures such as those relating to security procurement technology transfer contracts and research collaborations likewise specialised training should be organised for research staff being regularly affected by the implementation of export controls due to their involvement in sensitive projects requiring particular attention and control measures a research organisation may perform very different types of research and dual use export control lists relate to a wide spectrum of items and technologies this implies a need to consider developing training material and approaches tailored to audiences coming from different departments expertise and backgrounds considering the dynamic character of the export control laws and developments in this area training should be carried out on an annual basis while the staff having the main responsibility for the operation of the icp should update available tools and information material regularly please check with your national authority whether additional resources such as subscription to information sessions and newsletters national guidance and trainings are available what are the steps involved provide compulsory periodic training for all staff members potentially involved in export controlled dual use activities in order to raise awareness of export control issues and infuse a culture of responsibility throughout the organisation when possible use existing training initiatives such as introductory courses for newly recruited staff to incorporate references to export compliance measures and requirements follow the same approach with staff regulations and didactic material being already in use ensure via awareness raising tools e g decision trees intranet webpages information and acknowledgement notes in export control relevant procedures that all concerned staffs are aware of all internal policies and measures on export controls make use of material containing information on relevant eu dual use export control laws and control lists and restrictive measures as well as national measures and embargoes consider making user friendly tools developed in house or provided by external resources available to all concerned staff to facilitate easy navigation through these legal documents and their updates if possible consider customised trainings for both administrative and scientific staff consider whenever appropriate to make use of opportunities to receive national or eu training for dual use export controls incorporate lessons learnt from performance reviews audits reporting and corrective actions whenever possible in your training or export awareness programmes conversely take note of any findings alluding to an insufficient functioning of the compliance measures in place 3 2 4â â â export screening process and procedures this element contains internal measures the organisation should implement to ensure that no â â exportâ â takes place without the required license or against any relevant export restriction or prohibition the export screening process collects and analyses relevant information concerning the following aspects item classification risk assessment of the activity license determination and application and post licensing while following the steps mentioned below a research organisation needs to design and operate an export screening process taking into account the different types of activities undertaken existing institutional policies and procedures and the specific challenges linked to the risk profile of the organisation what is expected from research organisations the export screening process is at the very heart of the organisationâ s internal compliance measures the implementation of this element must be shared by administrative and scientific staff as their compliance roles have a mutually reinforcing impact on the operation of an icp the aim is to set up screening procedures that specify the steps involved for complying with the export control law and the organisationâ s internal control policies depending on the scope and the sensitivity of the research undertaken the export control screening process can be relevant to several activities â exporting items through tangible means of transfer â contracting primarily with international partners â 34 â patenting licensing of research results â publishing e g articles conference material software â electronic transmissions including making items available online â hiring staff and receiving visitors mostly sanctions related a research organisation can consider adjusting its institutional policies and procedures concerning all the activities mentioned above by inserting export control checks and verifications most of the time non university research institutes have centralised procedures in place that can be adapted to accommodate such screening and mitigating procedures universities can choose to follow the same approach tailored to their needs in a research organisation and particularly in a university export controlled activities can take place in the context of both formal collaborations with external partners and informal exchanges in the latter case the exchanges can take place mostly at the level of individual researchers therefore the export screening process shall address both possibilities and introduce screening procedures and checks for identifying whether a specific research activity entails the â â exportâ â of a controlled item individual researchers must be able to identify and report export control issues while conducting their research this can be materialised by using generic tools such as decision trees guiding researchers through the steps to be taken in identifying possible export control issuesâ 35 in addition targeted procedures and checks could be integrated into institutional processes authorising the aforementioned activities for example a research organisation could insert in its online system for approving travels abroad an information note and a requirement for researchers to perform export control checks prior to submitting a request â 36 furthermore export screening procedures should be included in the phase of planning a research project and prior to entering into a formal agreement with other partner organisations in this phase already the definition of the projectâ s objectives and the funding source might have implications from an export control point of view an export control issue can come into play in different phases of the project life in some cases an export control authorisation might become relevant only at the very final phase of a research project when the research organisation researcher chooses to share an export controlled output with third parties for instance through a license agreement this underlines the importance of introducing export control verifications in different institutional procedures in other situations particularly those involving collaborations with international partners a research can entail the disclosure of sensitive technologies and the consignment of export controlled outputs in different phases of the project therefore for projects flagged as sensitive it is appropriate to add export controls checks and mitigating measures throughout the projectâ s life this is important to be specified in the agreement signed with other organisations in all instances discussed above the export screening procedures to be set up shall consider the following aspects â item classification including software and technology â risk assessment of the activity â checks on embargoed sanctioned or sensitive destinations and entities â 37 â stated end use and involved parties screening â diversion risk screening â catch all controls for non listed dual use items if the result of the items classification and the risk assessment of the activity leads to the conclusion that the activity is controlled further aspects need to be addressed as below â determination of which license authorisation is needed e g for export brokering transfer and transit as well as application for such license and â 38 â post licencing including shipment control and compliance with the conditions of the authorisation in a limited number of cases it might be determined that the organisation or the individual researcher must refrain from a certain activity or that a project or engagement with a collaborating organisation cannot take place for example this can be the case where an involved party is included on a restricted list under sanctions or where the organisation deems the risk of a research output to be used for nefarious purposes in a third country as high likewise it is possible that the competent authority denies i e rejects an application for an export authorisation in accordance with applicable export control law e g if its assessment identifies proliferation risk in case of doubt or suspicion during the export screening process particularly regarding the results of the stated end use and involved parties or diversion risk screening consult with the competent authority in the eu member state where your organisation is established what are the steps involved set up export screening procedures allowing your organisation to perform a risk assessment that addresses all different potentially sensitive activities and sources of risk these procedures shall enable individual researchers students project leaders and administrative staff to contribute to the assessment of the export control risks relating to the organisationâ s activities where possible adjust your institutional policies and procedures to accommodate export control checks for potentially sensitive activities shipping contracting publishing sharing online etc and allow for mitigating measures concerning projects flagged as sensitive consider using generic risk assessment tools e g flow charts â 39 as well as data mining technicsâ 40 and other software for screening items projects and linked activities against export control lists and lists of restricted entities and destinations item classification this aspect of the screening procedure seeks to understand whether an item used or produced in the framework of a research falls within the scope of the control list s or whether a research project will be confronted with controlled items this is done by comparing the technical characteristics of an item against the eu and national dual use control lists if applicable identify whether the item is subject to restrictive measures sanctions and embargoes imposed by the eu or the eu member state in which your organisation is established â 41 please keep in mind that software and technology that meet the control specifications could be exempted if the â basic scientific researchâ and â public domainâ exemptions apply see section 2 3 5 try to determine whether an envisaged project will use controlled items and examine whether its contributions will meet the thresholds specified in the control list for projects identified as of high risk provide for export screening checks throughout the life cycle of the project pay particular attention to the classification of dual use components and spare parts and to the classification of dual use software and technology that can be transferred by e mail or made available via a â cloudâ service abroad as a precautionary measure consider verifying whether dual use items falling within the scope of the control lists exist in the laboratories and repositories of the organisation their presence can be an indicator of export control sensitivities examine the possibility to register in your inventories whether an item either new used or spare is of dual use relevance and thus requires special handling in case of export consult with the project leaders and available experts in order to collect information about the possible misuse of your dual use items in the context of conventional military weapons or wmds while collaborating with companies or other research organisations it is a good practice to request additional information about the technical parameters and the control status and classification of materials components subsystems that are to be used by your organisation from them as required by articleâ 11 9 of the eu dual use regulation concerning intra eu transfers mention in the relevant documents contract order confirmation invoice or dispatch note that the transaction involves listed dual use items and are subject to controls if exported from the eu risk assessment of the activity the export screening process also takes into account the partners involved to a sensitive research project and all different recipients of controlled research outputs as well as the risk that these recipients will use such outputs for unlawful purposes the list of the red flag questions offered in appendix 3 of this guidance is of help in assessing the various risks linked to an activity checks on embargoed sanctioned or sensitive destinations and entities ensure that none of the parties involved in a project or sensitive activity are subject to restrictive measures sanctions and embargoes by consulting the eu consolidated list of sanctionsâ 42 or national list where available stated end use and involved parties screening know your partner s and consider how they intend to use your research involving dual use items be aware of the existence of research organisations acting as cover for military research or having strong ties with state owned entities ask for an end use statement if the activity involves listed dual use items or when there are end use r concerns in the case of non listed dual use items â 43 consult the information provided by your competent authority for national rules and requirements concerning end use statements â 44 please be aware that end use statements can be requested also for sharing controlled software and technology be vigilant for diversion risk indicators and signs about suspicious enquiries or orders diversion risk screening be vigilant for diversion risk indicators and signs about suspicious enquiries for cooperation there might be indications suggesting that a partner will use dual use items shared or delivered by your organisation in the context of unauthorised military research or in relation to wmds and their means of delivery or other unlawful purposes please consider that also non listed dual use items might require an export authorisation if the stated end use and involved parties screening or the diversion risk screening raise some concern in the sense of the catch all provisions in articleâ 4 of the eu dual use regulation usually this situation concerns items having technical parameters close to the controlled ones catch all controls for non listed dual use items the export screening process should assess the possibility for a non listed dual use item to be used in connection to sensitive end uses specified under articleâ 4 of the eu dual use regulation if the researcher or research organisation is aware or suspects that an activity or project entails such a risk it must abstain from engaging further to this research and immediately inform the competent authorities who will conclude whether a license application is necessary for more information on the application of catch all controls see section 2 3 8 license determination and application including for controlled brokering transfer and transit activities the result of the item classification and risk assessment of the activity might be that a licence requirement is relevant gather and disseminate information about the range of license types including individual global and general licenses and controlled operations export brokering transfer and transit and about the license application procedures relating to the applicable eu and national dual use export controls be aware of national dual use export control measures for other activities such as technical assistance see section 2 for more information on the possible authorisation requirements consider making use of simplified licence procedures general licenses for destinations mentioned in the eu dual use regulation or national measures ensure that all concerned staff knows about the different types of licences and procedures to be followed internally and for submission to the authority who will be able to apply and what steps to follow post licencing including shipment control and compliance with the conditions of the authorisation before the actual shipment or transmission of a controlled item there should be a final check if all steps regarding compliance were taken this is a good moment to double check if items are correctly classified if red flags have been checked if the screening of entities was done and whether there is a valid licence for the shipment be aware that a change of relevant legislation could have taken place in the meantime for example the item is now a listed dual use item or the end user is now sanctioned ensure that the terms and conditions of the licence have been complied with including reporting please be aware that a licence may restrict the transfer of technology and software to only certain recipients and consider how partners involved in a sensitive research observe such requirements be aware that any changes to the organisationâ s details such as name address and legal status to the details of the end user and or intermediaries and to the details of the authorised items may affect the validity of your license 3 2 5â â â performance review

table of contents in may 2021 following its classified review of u s policy toward north korea the administration of u s president joe biden announced its intention to pursue a calibrated practical approach that is open to and will explore diplomacy with while the administration retains the long standing objective of denuclearization of the korean peninsula it acknowledges that it seeks to make practical progress to increase the security of the united states that of u s forces on and around the korean peninsula and that of u s allies like south korea and japan if north korea agreed to pursue practical steps toward risk reduction negotiators would face a range of challenges as they broke new ground among the thorniest of which would be the need for novel methods to monitor and verify compliance with agreed upon restraints the verification challenges north korea poses in recent years north korea s nuclear and missile forces have made tremendous qualitative advances in 2018 before the country s leader kim jong un turned to international diplomacy with south korea the united states china and others he called for north korea to mass produce ballistic missile and nuclear warheads official assessments since then including by the u s intelligence community and the united nations un panel of experts pursuant to un security council resolution 1874 have suggested that kim s directive has been implemented and continues to remain in effect at military parades in october 2020 and january 2021 kim further unveiled new missile capabilities including a new intercontinental ballistic missile possibly capable of carrying multiple warheads in the meantime kim has continued to emphasize that nuclear weapons represent the cornerstone of north korea s national defense strategy because the scope of north korea s nuclear complex has grown substantially since the failures of prior negotiated agreements to cap its capabilities such as the 1994 agreed framework and the six party talks in the mid 2000s a comprehensive agreement resulting in the country s rapid total disarmament is not a realistic near term prospect if washington and pyongyang resume either direct bilateral talks or multilateral talks on matters related to denuclearization of the korean peninsula the most realistic formula for progress would involve initial caps on parts of north korea s programs of concern including its nuclear and missile programs before a long term move toward reductions and eventually elimination negotiators and political decisionmakers sitting across from their north korean counterparts would seek to maximize the verifiability of each phase of any agreement that is reached verification and monitoring would be critically important not only to the political viability of any potential future agreement but also to generating measurable progress toward denuclearization as history shows orthodox approaches to verification with robust onsite inspections and other well defined protocols are anathema for pyongyang while north korea at times has allowed limited ad hoc inspections and onsite access it has only done so after protracted and difficult negotiations and the last time it did so was when its capabilities were considerably more limited notably north korea s checkered history with the international atomic energy agency has shown no signs of improving since agency inspectors were evicted from the country in april 2009 further given the near total lack of trust between the united states and north korea policymakers cannot expect ideal verification conditions for potential near term agreements even so they should recall that verification is not an end in itself it is a means of assessing and ensuring compliance with any number of potential agreements while also building confidence and sustainability along the way novel ways of verifying and monitoring north korea the nuclear policy program at the carnegie endowment for international peace with support from the korea foundation convened a group of international experts over several workshops in early 2021 to study novel tools and approaches to the verification and monitoring of a range of possible nuclear and missile restraints on north korea their findings and proposals are summarized in this compilation the experts broadly addressed potential accountable items in north korea including missiles fissile material stocks and warheads piecemeal and probabilistic approaches to general verification and nuclear safeguards open source intelligence techniques that might support verification and confidence building efforts import export monitoring and lessons from other monitoring regimes including the 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action with iran given the technical focus of this volume the included chapters do not assess the political viability of any specific potential agreements or the sorts of concessions that north korea may seek during implementation the fundamental objective of this volume is to facilitate policymakers understanding of a range of verification and monitoring approaches to facilitate practical and incremental progress on denuclearization while orthodox approaches to verification are unquestionably the preferred standard for any potential agreement near term political realities require flexibility and tempered expectations the ideas contained in this volume are intended to fit this purpose over time as agreements are implemented with these approaches and tools broader confidence building with north korea may facilitate a more favorable political environment that enables the application of more standard verification approaches about the editors ankit panda is the stanton senior fellow in the

keith b richburg is the director of the university of hong kong journalism and media studies centre and a former washington post correspondent hong kong now is increasingly a story of two cities occupying the same compact space but existing in parallel realities one hong kong is populated by bankers and financial services professionals real estate developers and property owners and businesspersons whose primary pursuit is trade with mainland china in this universe times are good and getting better the stock exchange this year reported its best quarter on record fueled by nearly 30 billion worth of new ipo listings profits are up 26 percent in the first half of the year property sales are up interest rates are low and new developments are being launched big banks are all on a hiring spree and offering new products to take advantage of china s rapid post pandemic economic recovery advertisement and the national security law which came into effect in july 2020 it has restored calm and stability after a year of often violent anti government protests the other hong kong is populated by people in the public space politicians journalists teachers labor leaders artists filmmakers those active in civil society groups as well as many students and young people to them hong kong has become unrecognizable a place where dissent is crushed and debate stifled they see no future here and no hope more than 100 people have been arrested under the national security law and thousands more still languish in jail or are on bail for various offenses related to the 2019 protest movement the city s most popular newspaper apple daily has had its assets frozen and its owner and top editors sent to jail political parties student and teachers unions human rights groups and civic organizations have all been targeted and some forced to disband even a popular cantopop singer had a venue cancel her bookings for an upcoming concert series advertisement many from this universe are voting with their feet nearly 90 000 people have left hong kong in the past year the biggest net outflow in more than half a century since records were kept leading to a steep 1 2 percent drop in the population the exodus has led to warnings about a pending shortage of teachers and medical professionals soon there might not be enough children to fill the vacancies in schools share this article share communist party authorities in beijing and their appointed leaders in hong kong are taking a gamble that the first universe the one of bankers and financial professionals can help the city thrive and prosper without the other they believe hong kong can become like singapore or shanghai prosperous cities largely devoid of distracting political debates from this view hong kong s future lies in integrating more closely into the southern china region known as the greater bay area linking hong kong and macao with nine cities in guangdong province and encompassing more than 70 million people the global travel market might be hammered by the pandemic but hong kong plans to launch greater bay airlines with its inaugural flight to beijing scheduled for oct 1 the 72nd anniversary of the communist party s takeover of china advertisement at a recent high level meeting in hong kong mainland officials from beijing chided the local government for not moving more quickly to integrate hong kong s economy and population with the mainland and hong kong officials seem eager to comply asked about hong kong s shrinking population plus the added burden of an aging demographic chief executive carrie lam was sanguine hong kong could attract mainland talent to fill the void she said and the elderly they could simply retire in mainland china to ease this city s burden with china s own looming challenges of finding jobs for university graduates hong kong could indeed be its safety valve many of those new banking and finance jobs are being taken by mainland professionals as one longtime expatriate businessman here wryly told me china wants to keep hong kong they just want to get rid of the hongkongers advertisement hong kong s role as a premier global financial center has always been underpinned by its respected legal system the new security law has created a parallel judiciary where handpicked judges have largely deferred to prosecutors and police but in normal cases not involving national security judges continue to rule impartially even in such cases relating to the 2019 protests judges have often acquitted suspects and criticized police for offering flimsy evidence or making contradictory statements finance and business professionals see a judicial system still functioning independently and cite the continued presence of foreign judges from common law countries those in the opposite universe warn of a gradual erosion of judicial autonomy can china get away with remaking hong kong into a financial center devoid of politics in truth it already has hong kong is in the final stages of becoming another shanghai or perhaps singapore an american business executive here said speaking like most anonymously
in an effort to keep the daily open thread a little more open topic we are going to start a new daily thread for presidential politics please use this thread to post anything relating to the joebama administration and presidency this is no small thing to restore a republic after it has fallen into corruption i have studied history for years and i cannot recall it ever happening it may be that our task is impossible yet if we do not try then how will we know it can t be done and if we do not try it most certainly won t be done the founders republic and the larger war for western civilization will be lost but i tell you this we will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night indeed we will make with our defiance such a sound as all history from that day forward will be forced to note even if they despise us in the writing of it mike vanderboegh this thread will refresh daily and appear above the open discussion thread whenever the possibility presents throw sand into the machinery
last week i wrote about the long and important relationship between arkansans and their dogs dogs were crucial to the survival of early settlers in arkansas as these people usually made their livings from the hunt with much assistance from dogs deer for food raccoons for both food and hides and most important of all the black bear for food but especially for its rendered oil dogs were also family pets but they were not yet generally considered members of the family as we so often hear today for a variety of reasons not the least being the disease rabies dogs faced a certain suspicion in urban areas the federal army issued an order in 1864 to kill all dogs found running at large in the city of fort smith in 1876 the city of newport declared stray dogs to be nuisances a local newspaper declaring that newport has commenced a war on the dogs all running at large will be shot this pointed to the fact that dogs generally were not spayed or neutered until relatively recently the large number of homeless dogs added to the movement to register and license them as well as charge a dog tax in march 1872 the city of little rock adopted a yearly dog registration fee with a provision that all animals of the dog kind found to be unregistered and running at large were to be killed other cities soon adopted dog taxes many with the same death sentence provision for the untaxed authorities in arkadelphia killed nearly 300 untaxed dogs in a two year period as you might expect not everyone welcomed the dog tax in august 1875 when the arkadelphia authorities killed his dog a black owner sued the city in may 1888 t h bass owner of the oakleaf hotel in little rock got into a fistfight with a dogcatcher mr bass resisting the officer and taking forcible possession of his animal for which he was fined 5 many people were hauled into court for failing to pay the dog tax the editor of the arkansas democrat newspaper complained in the summer of 1899 that the dog tax was being enforced with a sharp stick fully half of the defendants called before the pine bluff police court in july 1903 were dog tax violators each receiving a 3 fine perhaps the most interesting legal confrontation over the tax took place in fort smith municipal court in may 1907 when two black dog owners were fined for having untaxed dogs suddenly a prominent white attorney named took the floor to protest against the imposition of fines against two illiterate people who both took out licenses as soon as they came to know that they are expected to do so and the imposition of a fine is an injustice when challenged by the judge edmondson held his ground noting that it was neither just nor proper to impose a fine of 5 and after threatening to represent the dog owners in an appeal the judge reduced the fine to 2 dog tax revenue for that year in fort smith amounted to 1 417 not including fines the killing of unlicensed dogs might give the impression that arkansans were indifferent to their dogs but that was not the case indeed the newspapers often carried stories about heroic dogs which had come to the rescue of humans in 1907 the arkansas gazette reported that a worthless dog named growler had rescued a drowning child near monticello whereupon the father of the rescued girl offered 100 for the dog but was rebuffed other rescues involved alerting people to fires or other threats on a fall day in 1912 a rogers woman had a seizure and fell into a burning fireplace whereupon her faithful young bulldog ran to the backyard and raised a ruckus sufficient to bring help another bulldog saved his master from a house fire in conway in 1931 though the dog lost his life in the process perhaps the most poignant example of dog loyalty occurred in july 1934 when a 35 year old man was killed by a hit and run driver on a road near de queen in sevier county the man s german shepherd lay by the body for hours until authorities arrived the dog refused to allow anyone close to the body until the wife of the deceased could be brought to the scene arkansas has always been home to breeders usually producing hunting dogs but as time passed specialty kennels arose in some cities perhaps the most prominent was argyle kennels owned by wealthy little rock banker c a pratt one of the nation s early breeders of saint bernards by 1893 argyle was home to 22 dogs all valuable breeding stock on one occasion pratt sold three saint bernards for 20 000 to a relative of railroad magnet jay gould little rock was too hot for the heavy coated saint bernards and during the summer of 1895 pratt took his kennel of dogs to mount nebo a summer resort near dardanelle for those who could afford it we do not know if he took dogs with him to massachusetts where he owned a summer home pratt dogs especially a behemoth named sir bedivere which weighed 220 pounds and stood three feet in height took best of show awards in the growing number of shows held in several northern cities formal dog shows were slow to come to arkansas the earliest reference i could find was an 1893 effort at the small town of huntington south of fort smith information is scarce but that show was apparently limited to retrievers and it was not sanctioned by a national kennel authority the first show in arkansas sanctioned by a national kennel club was held in conjunction with the 1910 arkansas state fair in hot springs this was a large show with exhibitors coming from as far away as st louis tom dillard is a historian and retired archivist living near glen rose in hot spring county email him at arktopia td gmail com
extreme global market volatility is becoming a fact of life as investors are forced to make ever riskier choices says stephen jones cio of equities and multi asset solutions aegon asset management uk what went down came up the reflex recovery of this risk cycle complete markets are beginning to adopt a longer term perspective while talk of an equity bonanza powered by surging corporate profits is widespread concern is building around recent developments within bond markets if the global growth outlook is so good and with macroeconomic policy now having an inflationary bias why then are ultra long us nominal bond yields still less than the fed s 2 inflation target many attribute this to economic data coming in lighter than rather frothy forecasts in recent weeks two prominent commentators doom mongers to some have however recently voiced concerns of a structural nature there is now real doubt contends yanis varoufakis that central bankers can ever check out of their own hotel california ever since the global financial crisis gfc many companies have been sustained by the ultra low yields created by central bank buying his argument is that if the fed et al were to end their extraordinary support then borrowing costs would inevitably rise to levels that better reflect the compensation that banks would demand against risks of default unfortunately many companies are now so weak that a higher cost of debt would send them under causing significant increases in unemployment and untold sociopolitical problems as the gap between central banks and governments continues to narrow political leaders will never allow such a thing to happen on their watch though equity markets traded well through most of 2018 we watched as policy normalisation quickly became a market problem though they remained negative in real terms us policy rates rose gradually as the year progressed however when they rose above the rate of inflation equities fell sharply they only recovered when a chastened federal reserve signalled that there would be no more rate rises unable to absorb even a modestly positive real cost of capital western economies are now wholly dependent on central bank liquidity unavoidable depression nouriel roubini goes further arguing that with global debt ratios almost three times higher than in the early 1970s should central banks have to deal with an inflation problem this will unavoidably lead to a depression rather than a severe recession while high inflation has been more fear than fact for decades this time is different believes roubini higher prices will inevitably result from the failure of the supply side to respond to stronger post covid demand from strengthening protectionist trends and from moves to address inequality together with the ongoing decoupling of the us from china a major macroeconomic disruption is a matter of when not if one of the features of q4 2018 was how quickly the correction became a rout the subsequent rise in retail investor involvement irrational trading in meme stocks cryptocurrencies and special purchase acquisition companies spacs together with ultra tight credit spreads on so called junk bonds combine to increase the scope for a sudden and serious loss of investor confidence eclipsing that in 2018 this was the story of the covid catalysed slump of march 2020 while global multi asset portfolio managers recognise these challenges they struggle to find assets which offer genuine diversification under crisis conditions unwilling to add a significant weight to chinese government bonds and unable to find a diversifier that they deem attractive on a standalone basis they are drawn afresh albeit reluctantly to advanced economy bond markets adding to a stronger co dependency between asset markets and the real economy is the latest european commission ageing report which predicts that by the end of this decade there will be roughly 17 more pensioners in europe than today and 4 fewer workers put differently half of the uk france or italy s workforce will disappear pressure to sustain living standards in retirement will further pressure otherwise cautious investors into riskier assets frantic panic driven market selloffs are inevitable no cause for alarm those of a more positive persuasion frequently argue that if capital markets can withstand the gfc a major european existential crisis around greece and covid then there is no cause for alarm the point here is that the bill for resurrecting risks assets increases with each setback for example support programmes previously in billions are now measured in trillions cumulatively the burden will soon or already has become simultaneously irreversible and unsustainable wild gyrations the near term outlook for global companies is strong forecast corporate profits are now well above pre pandemic levels with many looking for a particularly strong rebound in capital investment the lifeblood of future prosperity however an endogenous or exogenous shock is as likely as a rainy glasgow fair if not this year then next the wild gyrations of recent years are likely to be the shape of things to come rather than exceptions challenging retail and institutional investors alike 2021 funds europe
it s time to take vaccines to the masses says expert a lack of communication and transparency on the part of government over the importance of the covid vaccination and its safety allowed a small but vociferous group of anti vaxxers to seriously slow down the jabs roll out says an expert epidemiologist dr jo barnes said the first problem with vaccinations had occurred right at the beginning when the government was so slow in negotiating the purchase of vaccines when it became clear that they would have to acquire a large number of vaccines other countries had already secured stocks and south africa found itself at the back of the queue she said the next problem occurred when the astrazeneca vaccines that were put on hold while investigations were completed were disposed of instead of being used all this and other logistical issues meant that south africa had a very slow start to its vaccine roll out programme barnes said while the purchasing was in progress the information and education campaigns which should have kicked off in high gear from the start were very low key and contained almost no facts that could educate and convince the general public that gave the small but vociferous anti vaxx group the perfect opening to start taking over the communication gap they did that with frightening success she added the aids healthcare foundation ahf said south africa needed to improve its technology and logistics to recover and improve the speed of the vaccination roll out ahf s country programme manager dr nduduzo dube questioned whether sa s vaccine distribution was done effectively and said although more than 8 million of the 59 million people in sa had now been fully vaccinated the roll out remained slow for various reasons dube suggested the health department work closely with major employers such as retailers and manufacturers as well as with the labour department and the department of social development to use existing employee and beneficiary data to reach people for scheduled vaccinations this is especially important now that the country is targeting not only the vulnerable but also the wider population with the aim of vaccinating 67 of people to achieve herd or population immunity he said even with vaccines being available south africa has seen a lag in vaccination the impact of employees going to line up to get vaccinated impacts business productivity and may even be a deterrent but he noted granting employees a day off work to get vaccinated may cost employers a day of productivity but it would save a lot of days by preventing illness and infections barnes said south africa was now faced with high vaccine hesitancy a better but by no means good roll out programme and mistrust in the process by the general public this is a tall order to overcome in my opinion lessons from past mistakes will take us out of this crisis she said those lessons should include much better information openness on the part of all government structures explanations rather than orders and taking the vaccines to the people taking vaccines to the people had started and the successes were encouraging dube said much still needed to be done to achieve patient data digitisation so businesses and workers could plan together with the health department when and where to access the vaccine for a swifter distribution process he said this would also result in sufficient vaccines being made available when and where they were most needed and importantly limit wastage we believe a real solution lies in opening up lines of communication between the departments of labour health and businesses to streamline the digitisation of patient records dube said or at least for now of the working population and in due course for the almost 14 million people who are on social grants to improve citizens immediate access to the vaccine through some kind of loose appointment system at their closest inoculation centre churches are starting to help religion has been one of the barriers to mass vaccination against covid and a major reason behind vaccine hesitancy among believers the religious forum against covid 19 yesterday launched the vaxumzansi national campaign in phoenix kwazulu natal aimed at addressing vaccine hesitancy and building pillars of support for the vaccine in religious circles according to the south african council of churches the campaign was rooted in the premise of being a positive change agent with the goal to get at least 70 people in their congregations and communities vaccinated the council s bishop malusi mpumlwana said the forum against covid which was convened earlier this year continued in its advocacy work against the scourge mpumlwana said the campaign would allow the use of religious infrastructure as vaccination sites in partnership with the national department of health and other commercial partners already vaccine teams are working at places like the grace bible church in

on the hunt for a birthday present for a friend last week i darted into one of those knick knack shops that remain open despite only selling mugs and novelty fridge magnets about gin are these shops a front for money laundering or do some people just really like novelty fridge magnets while browsing i spied a mug wrapped with a slogan that said i need a coffee the size of my ass i stood blinking at it trying to imagine who i might buy such a mug for imagine just imagine buying this mug for a friend handing it over in a little wrapped box the friend all excited and grateful before they even make a start on opening it oh you really shouldn t have and so on then imagine their face when they finally pull the mug out of its box i m not saying i need jean paul sartre with my coffee in the morning but if someone bought me a mug saying i need a coffee the size of my ass i might start re evaluating a few things my friends certainly before the size of my bottom it s the same with greetings cards stepping into a branch of scribbler now is like being placed into the village stocks bawdy insults being hurled at you by punters stumbling from the tavern happy birthday i ve done a fart in this card and it proper stinks sorry is one of the very few options i can even mention here it s as if a five year old boy obsessed with k jokes is in charge of the creative team why go to all the trouble of buying a card signing it remortgaging to buy a first class stamp and remembering to post the thing if all you re going to say is happy birthday you absolute b end i m afraid to say i did briefly laugh at a scribbler mug that said pg tits tastefully illustrated with a pair of cartoon breasts but then i remembered myself i ve had the builders back in my flat again this week and envisioned handing ray the decorator this mug with milk and his 43 sugars i m not sure who would be more embarrassed who are these cards and mugs for stashed in my cellar is a big plastic box of all my old birthday cards and letters dating back to when i was a child the jokes on the front of them barely pass as jokes but they re very endearing and inoffensive why the big orse says a small man sitting on the back of a very large horse reads a card from an old school friend big orse it s your birthday it says inside what s it called when a little yellow bird ties a rubber band to his foot and jumps off his perch asks another from my sister budgie jumping comes the pathetic answer my mother and i often send one another new yorker cards little black and white genuinely funny cartoons call me an old stick in the mud but i simply cannot imagine the occasion on which i would send her something that says mum i was going to get you a really funny card but then i remembered bladder control can be an issue at your age if in doubt just remember nobody was ever upset by a plain card without a slogan or a nice plain mug for that matter and if you re really stuck you re never more than 3ft away from a knick knack shop flogging novelty fridge magnets the iceman cometh and tells us how to avoid colds

percent of this is rubbish ceos won t do anything that hurts their bottom lines they re in the business of making as much money as possible not solving social problems in fact real social change would prevent them from doing many of the hugely profitable things they now do which means they won t change their ways unless they re required by law to change and even then only when the penalty times the probability of getting caught is higher than the profits from continuing anyway their soothing promises of social responsibility are intended to forestall such laws i ve seen this repeatedly when i was secretary of labor big corporations would violate laws on worker safety wages and hours and pensions whenever doing so was cheaper than obeying the laws and they d fight like hell against such laws to begin with all the while telling the public what wonderful citizens they were you may recall that in august 2019 the business roundtable one of washington s most prestigious corporate groups on whose board sit the ceos of apple walmart and jpmorgan issued a widely publicized statement expressing a fundamental commitment to the wellbeing of all of our stakeholders emphasis in the original including their employees communities and the environment corporations will do whatever they can to maximize their profits and share values social responsibility be damned the statement was widely hailed as marking a new era of corporate social responsibility since then the roundtable and its members have issued a continuous stream of jejune statements about their dedication to such things as providing childcare pre k and affordable healthcare promoting community college and workforce training alleviating poverty and reversing climate change it turns out these are exactly the priorities in joe biden s 3 5tn reconciliation bill but guess what the business roundtable isn t lobbying for the bill it s lobbying intensely against it jessica boulanger a spokeswoman told the washington post the roundtable is engaged in a significant multifaceted campaign to stop tax increases that would finance the bill and will continue to ramp up our efforts in the coming weeks the group is launching a seven figure digital advertising campaign to oppose the bill hypocrisy only if you believed the roundtable bs about corporate social responsibility if you know the truth that corporations will do whatever they can to maximize their profits and share values social responsibility be damned there s nothing surprising here why didn t business groups fight the president s infrastructure bill because government spending on infrastructure helps their bottom lines by lowering their costs of procuring supplies and getting goods to market social responsibility had nothing to do with it it s tempting to chalk all this up to corporate greed but that makes sense only if you think corporations are capable of emotions such as greed they re not corporations aren t people no matter what the supreme court says they re bundles of contracts the specific people who enter those contracts on behalf of big corporations as well as thousands of people who run vast investment funds on behalf of millions of shareholders are neither greedy nor socially responsible they re merely doing what they understand to be their jobs greed and social responsibility have been laundered out of these transactions if we want these transactions to change to align better with public needs rather than private profits laws must change for example taxes on big corporations must rise in order to fund public investments and safety nets but such laws won t change if corporations continue to spend vast sums on politics corporate spokespeople like boulanger of the business roundtable along with platoons of corporate lobbyists and influence peddlers corporate lawyers and hired gun economists corporate political operatives and pr flaks together form in effect a fourth branch of government wielding huge and increasing power about one out of every four people now working in downtown washington fills one of these roles the result is clear the most telling trends over the last three decades have been the growing share of the economy going into corporate profits generating ever greater compensation packages for top executives and ever higher payouts for big investors all of whom live off shares of stock and the declining share going to most americans as wages and salaries the meaningless blather over corporate social responsibility is intended to mask these trends biden s 3 5tn plan is aimed at reversing them but big business is doing everything in its power to sabotage biden s plan the only way to stop this sabotage is to ignore all mention of corporate social responsibility and make one hell of a ruckus in support of biden s plan as well as laws to reduce the power of big money in politics
in an effort to keep the daily open thread a little more open topic we are going to start a new daily thread for presidential politics please use this thread to post anything relating to the joebama administration and presidency this is no small thing to restore a republic after it has fallen into corruption i have studied history for years and i cannot recall it ever happening it may be that our task is impossible yet if we do not try then how will we know it can t be done and if we do not try it most certainly won t be done the founders republic and the larger war for western civilization will be lost but i tell you this we will not go gently into that bloody collectivist good night indeed we will make with our defiance such a sound as all history from that day forward will be forced to note even if they despise us in the writing of it mike vanderboegh this thread will refresh daily and appear above the open discussion thread whenever the possibility presents throw sand into the machinery
by robert skidelsky london amid all the talk of when and how to end or reverse quantitative easing qe one question is almost never discussed why have central banks massive doses of bond purchases in europe and the united states since 2009 had so little effect on the general price level between 2009 and 2019 the bank of england boe injected 425 billion pounds 588 billion about 22 5 percent of the united kingdom s 2012 gross domestic product gdp into the u k economy this was aimed at pushing up inflation to the boe s mandated medium term target of 2 percent from a low of just 1 1 percent in 2009 but after ten years of qe inflation was below its 2009 level despite the fact that house and stock market prices were booming and gdp growth had not recovered to its pre crisis trend rate since the start of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 the boe has bought an additional 450 billion pounds worth of u k government bonds bringing the total to 875 billion pounds or 40 percent of current gdp the effects on inflation and output of this second round of qe are yet to be felt but asset prices have again increased markedly a plausible generalization is that increasing the quantity of money through qe gives a big temporary boost to the prices of housing and financial securities thus greatly benefiting the holders of these assets a small proportion of this increased wealth trickles through to the real economy but most of it simply circulates within the financial system the standard keynesian argument derived from john maynard keynes s general theory is that any economic collapse whatever its cause leads to a large increase in cash hoarding money flows into reserves and saving goes up while spending goes down this is why keynes argued that economic stimulus following a collapse should be carried out by fiscal rather than monetary policy government has to be the spender of last resort to ensure that new money is used on production instead of being hoarded but in his treatise on money keynes provided a more realistic account based on the speculative demand for money during a sharp economic downturn he argued money is not necessarily hoarded but flows from industrial to financial circulation money in industrial circulation supports the normal processes of producing output but in financial circulation it is used for the business of holding and exchanging existing titles to wealth including stock exchange and money market transactions a depression is marked by a transfer of money from industrial to financial circulation from investment to speculation so the reason why qe has had hardly any effect on the general price level may be that a large part of the new money has fueled asset speculation thus creating financial bubbles while prices and output as a whole remained stable one implication of this is that qe generates its own boom and bust cycles unlike orthodox keynesians who believed that crises were brought on by some external shock the economist hyman minsky thought that the economic system could generate shocks through its own internal dynamics bank lending minsky argued goes through three degenerative stages which he dubbed hedge speculation and ponzi at first the borrower s income needs to be sufficient to repay both the principal and interest on a loan then it needs to be high enough to meet only the interest payments and in the final stage finance simply becomes a gamble that asset prices will rise enough to cover the lending when the inevitable reversal of asset prices produces a crash the increase in paper wealth vanishes dragging down the real economy in its wake minsky would thus view qe as an example of state created financial instability today there are already clear signs of mortgage market excesses u k house prices increased by 10 2 percent in the year to march 2021 the highest rate of growth since august 2007 while indices of overvaluation in the u s housing market are flashing bright red and an econometric study so far unpublished by sandhya krishnan of the desai academy of economics in mumbai shows no relationship between asset prices and goods prices in the u k and the u s between 2000 and 2016 so it is hardly surprising that in its february 2021 forecast the boe s monetary policy committee estimated that there was a one third chance of u k inflation falling below 0 percent or rising above 4 percent in the next few years this relatively wide range partly reflects uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic but also a more basic uncertainty about the effects of qe itself in margaret atwood s futuristic 2003 novel oryx and crake helthwyzer a drug development center that manufactures premium brand vitamin pills inserts a virus randomly into its pills hoping to profit from the sale of both the pills and the antidote it has developed for the virus the best type of diseases from a business point of view explains crake a mad scientist would be those that cause lingering illness the patient would either get well or die just before all of his or her money runs out it s a fine calculation with qe we have invented a wonder drug that cures the macroeconomic diseases it causes that is why questions about the timing of its withdrawal are such fine calculations but the antidote is staring us in the face first governments must abandon the fiction that central banks create money independently from government second they must themselves spend the money created at their behest for example governments should not hoard the furlough funds that are set to be withdrawn as economic activity picks up but instead use them to create public sector jobs doing this will bring about a recovery without creating financial instability it is the only way to wean ourselves off our decade long addiction to qe robert skidelsky a member of the british house of lords is professor emeritus of political economy at warwick university this article was distributed by project
