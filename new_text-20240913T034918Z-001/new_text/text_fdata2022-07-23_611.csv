even though markets pulled out another winning week recession and inflation worries are still nipping at investors heels manhattan cn equities secured another positive week albeit with a slight dip on friday as investors have based their trades on moderately positive earnings reports and the prospect of another aggressive interest rate hike next week all three indices finished the week in the black mostly due to a tech rally on tuesday with the dow jones industrial average increasing 612 points since last friday the s p 500 netting 98 points and the nasdaq gaining 382 points corporate earnings helped drive the rally earlier in the week and likely will continue to keep stocks afloat throughout the summer in its report tesla beat analyst expectations while american express saw a 31 increase in its second quarter revenue from a top line perspective results have been good not great james vogt at tower bridge advisors wrote in an investor s note on friday adding key earnings reports from google microsoft and oil giants are soon due next week will be critical in determining the next phase of this bottoming process data this week however have experts again worrying about a recession unemployment insurance claims not a major issue for months increased to 251 000 claims for the week ending july 16 while continuing claims rose to 1 3 million for the previous week unemployment claims typically increase in july as certain manufacturers lay off or furlough workers but the numbers certainly justify opinions the u s economy is at least cooling if not at the precipice of a recession other economic indicators also hint at an economic slowdown the conference board s leading economic index fell 0 8 in june after a similar decrease in may though the index still is 4 2 points higher than it was in june 2019 the conference board noted it expects economic growth to continue to cool throughout the rest of the year and predicts a recession by the end of the year on monday the national association of home builders announced that its builder confidence index plunged for july falling 12 points to hit its lowest reading since may 2020 the trade group blamed production bottlenecks rising home building costs and inflation for the decline in confidence noting 13 of respondents said they reduced home prices in the last month affordability is the greatest challenge facing the housing market nahb chief economist robert dietz said in a statement significant segments of the home buying population are priced out of the market some analysts are even more concerned most concerning traffic of prospective buyers fell the lowest since may 2020 suggesting that the housing market has more downside to go as interest rates trek higher and inflation chisels away consumer purchasing power said jeffrey roach chief economist at lpl financial roach contends that the residential real estate market is in a contraction though he also notes that raw material prices are falling from recent highs which could mean better months ahead for builders the recent data points likely haven t dissuaded the federal reserve from continuing to aggressively raise rates when the central bank meets next week with many analysts predicting the fed again will hike rates by 75 basis points at its july 27 meeting beyond the key question is how quickly and how far the fed will drive the policy rate into restrictive territory kathy bostjancic chief u s economist at oxford economics wrote in an investor s note with inflation posted to remain about 9 through september we anticipate another 75bps rate increase in september before the fed starts to downshift to 25bps rate increases through early 2023 though there is an outside chance of a 0 5 interest rate most investors seem to have baked a 0 75 rate hike as well as other potential bad news into their trades the economy will most likely take the upcoming fed rate hike in stride but as the economy becomes more vulnerable the probability of the fed breaking something increases as the economy moves into 2023 roach said yet it is also likely the fed s aggressive stance now will pay off in early 2023 with some predicting inflation to begin its sharp decline in march of next year
1 stay within your budget 2 do not rush 3 have savings in case of emergencies 4 invest in profitable properties 5 diversify your sources of income each country in this world has had its real estate crisis depending on the market situation for example in the united states there was a real estate crash in the 2000s and the prices started to fall in 2005 2006 some investors were seized by panic and had to sell their property at a big discount today we are in another cycle and no one can predict when the next crash will occur as a real estate investor you need to be prepared for this and you have to protect yourself in case of a new real estate crash here are five tips for investors looking to protect themselves from a real estate market crash even if some investments may be tempting it is necessary to know your financing capacity and to always stick to it to achieve this you can check with the bank or another financing organization make sure you only invest in properties that you can afford the risk if there is a real estate crash is that your property will lose its value if you add to this the financial difficulties that a crash can cause you will no longer be able to pay back your loan and you will have to sell your property in the middle of a crisis your property will be at its lowest price although this is unlikely given the current property bubble it is necessary to plan for this outcome so as not to be caught unprepared if this event occurs whatever happens it is necessary to keep calm and not rush into buying or selling a property as an investor every decision you make should be the result of a mature reflection you should first carry out an analysis of the current real estate market before embarking on any investment in times of crisis you may be caught up in the frenzy of buying at a high price if you are afraid that the price will rise even higher but as with any investment to be profitable you need to do things differently from the crowd when everyone is rushing to buy you must keep in mind that this is not the time to invest so as not to have to pay more than the property is actually worth when you invest in a property you are making a 10 20 or even 25 year commitment you need to have some savings in case you are unable to make your monthly payments various insurances such as the insurance for unpaid rent or the rental vacancy insurance can help you in this respect but having some cash set aside also allows you to take advantage of other investment opportunities and it allows you to shelter yourself for a few months in the event of a real estate market crash the study of the profitability of the property is an essential step before proceeding with the actual investment a profitable property even in the event of a real estate market crash is less likely to lose its value moreover in the case of a rental investment your tenants are still obliged to pay their rent since even in a crisis the need for housing remains vital in this case there is very little chance that you will sell your property and that you will be affected by a real estate crash for this reason it is very important that you study carefully your investment project if possible do this with the help of an expert in this field this last strategy is essential because it can minimize your risks of loss if you only invest in real estate a crash in this market can cause you to lose your entire fortune thus diversification is important if you want to secure your investment as much as possible for example this could be investing in the stock market in gold or in a physical or a virtual business in any case putting all your eggs in the same basket is never a good idea in order to successfully diversify your various investments you may want to enlist the help of a professional in the field who will have all the qualifications to guide you
by matthew rusling washington july 22 xinhua u s markets ended the week on an overall uptick but gains were pared on friday in all three major indexes the dow jones industrial average shot up 423 points since monday the s p 500 rose by 78 points and the nasdaq increased 272 points over the week but some of those gains were lost on friday the s p 500 dropped by 37 points from the previous day as investors reacted to a disappointing earnings report from social media company snap which caused the stock prices of companies including facebook to drop like a rock the dow jones industrial average and tech heavy nasdaq pared their gains from the previous day as well by 137 points and 225 points respectively on a positive note the week saw airlines profit from heavy demand as air travel has made a big comeback more than two years after covid 19 hit the united states covid 19 restrictions are largely a thing of the past and americans are keen to take to the skies and head out on vacation this summer the nation s three largest carriers america united and delta put out their quarterly earnings and each has expressed optimism about demand for the second half of the summer but at the same time the travel boom has caused headaches due to higher ticket prices increased flight cancellations and worker shortages among a host of other issues meanwhile microsoft with a nearly 2 trillion u s dollar market cap announced it would cut back on hiring new employees amid inflationary pressures on consumers also of concern is the possibility of recession on the horizon a point of debate among many economists a microsoft spokesperson told cnbc earlier this week that as the tech giant gets ready for the new fiscal year it is making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity other big tech companies are scaling back on hiring for certain teams including alphabet facebook and apple in a sign that americans are moving on from covid 19 markets this week paid little attention to the news that u s president joe biden tested positive the president has been both fully vaccinated and boosted and is taking paxlovid the antiviral treatment from vaccine maker pfizer desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute and a former official at the international monetary fund told xinhua that in the coming months stock prices are likely to be determined by the economy s performance and the federal reserve s interest rate policy my view is that we will experience a meaningful recession by the end of the year lachman said adding that he believes the fed will maintain its hawkish monetary policy stance in a bid to fight inflation on that basis stock prices have yet further to fall despite already seeing a significant drop in recent months lachman said he believes that the stock market decline will end when the fed shifts to a less hawkish monetary policy stance i expect that this will occur by year end at which stage we could see stock prices begin to recover lachman said dean baker senior economist at the center for economic and policy research noted that the market was priced very high before its recent fall it is still priced high but it is not nearly as out of line as in the fall also there is no reason to expect a surge baker said all this occurs as biden s approval rating has hit all time lows mostly on record inflation and gasoline prices biden s approval rating stands at 37 2 percent lower than any president at this point in office since the 1950s around half of americans have some sort of investment in the stock market and the question remains whether the still volatile market will hurt biden christopher galdieri assistant professor at saint anselm college told xinhua that in terms of stock market drops i don t think this specifically is going to hurt biden what s dragging him down is inflation gas prices the lingering pandemic but bad economic news of any sort is just one more thing that s going to pull down his approval ratings said galdieri clay ramsay a senior research associate at the center for international and security studies at the university of maryland told xinhua it s a reasonable guess that over half of voters this november will have some stock market involvement but the effects of inflation on household income are more significant and in some ways more widespread these factors are likely to resonate even more than the bad news about stocks ramsay said

stock market entering a bear market darren415 istock via getty images â for everything there is a season â â ecclesiastes 3 1 our last two quarterly letters conveyed a cautious attitude regarding both the economy and financial markets the cautious season persists this quarter in the first three months of 2022 the only major asset class with a positive return was commodities the second quarter saw a similar result though this time the commodity indexâ s gain was modest at 2 it is too early to know for sure but commodities may well have hit their cycle peak in early june joining every other major asset class in a bear market on june 8 the gsci commodity index closed at 26 34 just above the intra day peak on march 8 of 26 08 from that june 8 peak to the end of the month the gsci commodity index fell 12 3 and continued to work lower through the first half of july industrial metals are already down 32 3 from their cycle peak on march 4 oil too peaked in early march with a closing high of 123 70 on the 8th now below 100 oil is approximately 20 from the peak both metalsâ and oilâ s highs were on the heels of the russian invasion of ukraine while the fighting continues markets appear to be finding a lower equilibrium every other primary asset class was down meaningfully in the second quarter gold was down 6 8 april through june long dated us treasury bonds were down 12 6 over the same period typically â safe havenâ assets treasury bonds and gold offered no shelter from the storm not much of a defense for gold or treasuries but risky equities did perform worse the s p 500 was down 16 1 during the quarter with global equities just slightly better down 15 1 for the full first half of the year commodities are still a significant winner up 35 gold is down 1 5 both the s p 500 and long dated treasury bonds are in a classic bear market the s p 500 is down 20 and long dated treasury bonds are slightly worse down 21 9 a 60 40 benchmark was down 16 grey owlâ s all weather strategy

analysis makes this clear of greatest significance market internals have been weaker during the current equity market rally that began june 16 compared to the rally from may 12 to june 2 the net spread between buying power and selling pressure reached a new low during the week of july 10 figure 1 lowry research cfra business 2022 to mark an end to the equity bear market the lowry research is looking for 1 extreme and indiscriminate capitulation selling 2 followed by significant broad buying and 3 positive divergences in market internals i e more positive breadth and momentum relative to price indices we have yet to see any sign of the above economic growth as we showed last quarter the u s ism manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi has been slowing since november what was already a meaningful deceleration continues from 57 in march the pmi has dropped to 53 in june the ism pmi is a reasonably accurate leading indicator of overall economic growth its slowdown portends a decelerating u s economy figure 2 us ism manufacturing pmi monthly corporate profits as we write the second quarter earnings season has begun jpmorgan jpm reported last week eps earnings per share of 2 76 for the quarter compared to 3 78 for the same quarter last year â a decline of 27 while not a perfect microcosm of the overall market broad earnings declines appear likely yet expectations remain for growth as of the end of june the consensus expected 224 54 for s p 500 full year 2022 operating eps this implies 8 growth over 2021â s 208 21 reasonable in the context of 5 7 annual earnings growth from 1999 to 2019 however if we pull out the anomalous 2020 and 2021 numbers a different picture emerges 2019 saw eps of 157 12 the highest level of eps at that point starting from the 2019 number the 2022 estimate implies 12 6 annual growth double the 20 year rate does that rate of growth really seem likely now that the trillions of dollars of government direct subsidies to businesses and transfer payments to individuals are gone we think downward revisions in earnings are probable until that occurs continued pressure on equities and other risky financial assets remains likely update on fixed income while our caution on equities has proved sensible we clearly added exposure to â safe havenâ fixed income too early up to this point the current inflation measures have trumped any fear of pending recession there is at least some reason to believe we may be nearing a turning point despite a june consumer price index inflation rate of 9 1 and producer price index rate of 11 3 inflation expectations have been decreasing since late april markets expect the 5 year outlook for inflation 5 years from now to be just above 2 figure 3 federal reserve bank of st louis in addition

g k chesterton once said that he owed his success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice and then doing the exact opposite this is how we have felt over the past year and half while the vast majority of establishment economists consistently were wrong about inflation they forecast that inflation would stay mild that it would stay confined to a few things related to passing shortages and the reopening that it would prove transitory and that it had peaked we consistently argued that this was nonsense and predicted inflation would keep rising there were of course some establishment types who got things right and plenty of heterodox economists especially on the left who were as wrong as the establishment types larry summers oliver blanchard jason furman all thoroughly establishment and left of center predicted higher inflation or warned that it might prove more persistent than the rest of the establishment including federal reserve and biden administration officials were forecasting how exactly did we get it right the answer is not as complicated as many of those who are now re assessing their errors suspect the economic recovery was well under way in 2021 when the biden administration took office the unemployment rate for example had been plunging from its height of 14 7 percent in april 2020 to 6 4 percent in january of 2021 perhaps the most rapid labor market rebound in u s history maybe in the history of the world there were 7 9 million job vacancies in march of 2021 exceeding the pre pandemic level gross domestic product had soared at an annual rate of 6 9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 american households had piled up a 2 7 trillion nest egg of excess savings the economy in short was booming one of the reasons for this boom was the extraordinary efforts of the u s government to rescue the american economy from a deep and lasting recession that would likely have otherwise gripped the nation on the coattails of the pandemic the trump administration together with allies on capitol hill crafted a plan that was heavily criticized before and during its deployment but was also highly effective the u s economy fared better than peer economies around the world with fewer business failures better economic growth less unemployment and less hardship for households the federal reserve did its part by keeping interest rates low and providing an immense amount of liquidity to credit markets which filtered through to broader financial markets and the real economy we supported the rescue efforts of 2020 indeed we were advocates for something like the plan that was adopted early in 2020 even before it was announced we argued that only the government had the means to prevent an economic disaster and that the government had the duty to prevent it because so much of the economic pain was the result of measures undertaken to protect public health when you ask people to stay home to close their businesses to school their children at home for the sake of the public good it is imperative that you compensate them for their sacrifices that is what the u s did so effectively in 2020 the trouble set in when the biden administration decided that it needed to make its mark on the pandemic response by pushing the 1 9 trillion american rescue plan the economy very simply did not need the additional deficit spending the time for stimulus had passed what was needed was steady handed growth in which supply chains could be unsnarled consumer spending could peaceably migrate back toward a more typical balance of goods and services and production allowed to catch up with demand the impetus was purely political if the biden administration did not enact a rescue plan history would show that it was the trump administration that had rescued the american economy this was not an acceptable outcome for a political party and its establishment media arm that had insisted that trump had badly damaged the economy with his allegedly bungled response to the pandemic the american rescue plan was not an economic necessity but it was a political necessity for the left and the anti trumpers the argument from summers and blanchard against the rescue plan was mainstream keynesian they argued that the additional spending was too large and that if it had a normal sized fiscal multiplier it would overheat the economy demand for labor and goods would rise faster than supply triggering inflation this was right as far as it went but our analysis went further from our point of view the economy was likely to remain supply constrained because of the climate change agenda that had declared war on fossil fuels this would cause fuel shortages and drive up energy prices hurting production the threat of higher taxes on corporations wealth taxes and windfall profits taxes would diminish investment stimulus payments extended and super sized unemployment benefits student loan payment suspensions and eviction moratoriums not only increased consumer spending but bit into the incentive to work diminishing the labor supply by decreasing the opportunity cost of choosing leisure or activism over a paying occupation the possibility of lifting tariffs would discourage the reshoring of manufacturing leaving the u s economy vulnerable to supply constraints from abroad what s more it was not just the spending in the american rescue plan that the biden administration was pushing there was the infrastructure plan and the build back better plan more spending was looming as far as the eye could see prospective spending contributes to inflation by shifting expectations about the availability and pricing of resources labor and goods the fed was not blameless fed officials insisted that inflation was transitory and would likely remain confined to a relatively narrow part of the economy positions that were adopted by the biden administration whole cloth making matters worse the fed began to announce that it was now applying a sort of racial quota system to its maximum employment goal it was not enough for unemployment to fall the fed said it now would work to reduce racial gaps in unemployment this was an incredible undertaking because that gap was one of the most persistent facts about the economy ever recorded although it did narrow dramatically during the pre pandemic trump era in effect the fed was saying it would let inflation run hot until it had squeezed systemic racism out of the unemployment rate one of the most frustrating things about the insistence that narrow inflation meant inflation would be transitory is that there was good economic research from the federal reserve bank of dallas no less suggesting exactly the opposite in an article we published in august of 2021 we pointed to a recently published piece by a team of economists at the dallas fed that explained arrowly based extreme price surges often reflect supply demand imbalances that can potentially affect prices for a broader range of goods and services while these imbalances initially show up in pce components with more flexible faster moving prices they eventually bleed into more moderate increases in a broader range of slower moving prices in other words narrow inflation was likely to lead to broad inflation which is exactly what happened we were encouraged in our confidence that inflation would not fade by the insistence of the biden administration and fed officials that it would this was undermining public confidence that the political fiscal and monetary authorities would act to tame inflation and a public that loses confidence that inflation will be kept under control is one whose expectations for inflation become unmoored contributing to even more inflation stability breeds instability hyman minsky taught us long ago he pointed out that when people are optimistic about the present economic outlook they tend to increase spending borrowing and investment to such an extent that the economy becomes fragile risk laden and eventually panic ensues for fiscal and monetary authorities a similar rule applies stable prices breed inflation this is because the stability encourages policymakers to ignore the risks form narratives explaining away signs of inflation and refuse to recognize disastrous price instability until it s too late we do not mean to claim too much credit the point after all is not to bruise our own backs with self congratulatory pats but to explain to our readers why we were right where so many others were wrong as we noted there were others who saw inflation coming in addition richard curtin the long running and recently retired guru of the university of michigan survey of consumers warned month after month that consumer sentiment risked tipping into an inflationary beast mode where consumers would accelerate inflation by purchasing goods in advance of expected price hikes and shortages that behavior of course contributes to inflation becoming a self fulfilling prophecy now it looks as if the economy is heading toward a recession as consumers pull back on discretionary spending due to the high cost of living this too was something we saw coming early when we noticed that many apparent indicators of expansion were nothing of the sort nominal figures showed rising spending but when adjusted for inflation they suggested contraction this was at first confined to a narrow group of products especially household goods and discretionary or even luxury items that had been the focus of intense spending throughout the pandemic like inflation it has spread from narrow to broad and now we re seeing the services sector contract this too we had been warned about by professor curtin who repeatedly forecast that eventually consumers would balk at high prices and pull back from spending initiating a contraction the whole experience has been a lesson in the wisdom of resistance to the advice of the experts chesterton got it right and by following his example so did we

aspen colo the biden administration is bolstering u s arms production to sustain the war in ukraine and to support taiwan in preparing to fend off a future russian style invasion from china white house national security adviser jake sullivan said mr sullivan told a major security conference friday that the administration is urging taiwan s political and military leaders to purchase arms better suited to fighting the chinese military if beijing launches an invasion of the democratically ruled island because of the need to produce more weapons faster the pentagon is working on ways to increase the capacity of the american defense industrial base as well as allied defense industries to make sure weapons and other military equipment can be produced to deter adversaries he said the weaponry mr sullivan said includes all types of artillery coastal defenses and naval mines the united states has sent more than 5 6 billion in weapons and other security aid to ukraine s military forces including anti tank and anti aircraft missiles and sophisticated artillery as it deals with an invasion of russian forces that marked its five month milestone sunday the aid shipments are raising questions about whether u s military stocks can be replenished and whether similar arms would be available to assist taiwan should china use military force against the island there are longer term questions about ensuring that the american industrial base and our allies defense industrial base can be put in a position to sustain the kind of security assistance that we are going to need to keep supplying ukraine as well as taiwan as well as ourselves to ensure that we are maintaining a proper level of deterrence mr sullivan said in remarks to the aspen security forum an annual conference in colorado strengthening the ability to produce more weapons will require increased investment a larger industrial workforce and a new emphasis on supply chains that provide components for maintaining weapons systems especially munitions he said deputy defense secretary kathleen hicks is heading up the effort we ve got a good strategy and we re working it mr sullivan said the white house adviser said there is some overlap between the kinds of weapons sent to ukraine and what taiwan would need against a chinese military assault there are also some big differences because of the nature of the contingency the conflict can be quite different from land war in europe and a potential contingency across the taiwan strait mr sullivan said gen mark a milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff amplified mr sullivan s concerns about china on a visit sunday to indonesia he told reporters that the chinese air and naval forces had become significantly more and noticeably more aggressive in this particular region over the past five years it was the first visit to jakarta by a head of the joint chiefs the pentagon s top military officer in almost 15 years and was a sign of growing u s and allied concern over beijing s outreach to island nations across the south pacific in recent weeks this is concerning because china is not doing it just for benign reasons gen milley told reporters traveling with him sunday according to the associated press they re trying to expand their influence throughout the region and that has potential consequences that are not necessarily favorable to our allies and partners in the region mr sullivan said friday that the administration accelerated dramatically previous administrations efforts to provide taiwan with more asymmetric warfare capabilities that would lend themselves to ukrainian style defense of the island located about 100 miles off the southern coast of china the porcupine strategy will supply arms and other military forces that are going to be most useful in the kinds of contingencies we can expect he said the administration has been urging taiwanese leaders to seek u s weapons better suited to repelling an amphibious assault from china u s defense officials said the pressure involves persuading the taiwanese military to buy fewer aircraft and more systems like m109a6 paladin self propelled howitzers and himars rocket artillery launchers precision strike himars artillery was sent to ukraine although the 190 mile range army tactical missile system atacms was denied because of concern that it would be too provocative to the kremlin additional shoulder fired stinger anti aircraft missiles and harpoon anti ship weaponry also could be sent to taiwan as part of the strategy coastal air defense missiles armed drones and sea mines are part of the planned post ukraine defense upgrade studying ukraine earlier in the conference cia director william burns and british mi6 intelligence chief richard moore said china is closely studying russian military operations and ukrainian defenses in the european conflict one troubling lesson is that beijing may not be deterred from attacking taiwan because the chinese will see the faults of the russian military operation and say how do we do it better mr sullivan said he added that he is not predicting an invasion of the island mr sullivan said taiwan also is studying the war they are learning lessons about citizen mobilization and they are working rapidly at that he said should ukraine prevail and ultimately win the war against russia the success could help deter china from its goal of taking over taiwan chinese president xi jinping has said retaking taiwan which broke from the mainland in a civil war between communists and nationalists is a high priority i do think that part of our objective in ukraine has to be able to show strength resilience staying power candidness capability because that will have some impact on our ability to effectively deter others elsewhere mr sullivan said u s policy toward taiwan has not changed despite president biden s three public statements asserting that the united states would defend taiwan from a chinese attack mr sullivan said the policy of strategic ambiguity regarding whether beijing or taipei is the sole government of taiwan has kept peace and stability across the strait and therefore should be kept in place he said the national security adviser outlined the administration s policy toward china which involves investing in u s strengths aligning with allies and competing in all areas military economic technological and soft power however the strategy calls for not allowing competition to drift or trip into conflict or a new cold war mr sullivan said that is how we try to approach things he said i believe that we have hit our marks in terms of what we set out to do the administration is attempting to counter the chinese propaganda narrative in asia and elsewhere that china inevitably will surpass the united states as the world s most powerful nation and that u s decline is inevitable it s never a good bet to bet against the united states of america mr sullivan said china has its own economic troubles and is failing in its draconian zero covid policy aimed at stemming outbreaks of the disease i think there are real questions about what trajectory is going forward and that is something countries both near and far from china are having to factor in he said bill gertz can be reached at bgertz washingtontimes com

exercise caution before the next long weekend the benchmark set index moved sideways in volatile trade early this week thai shares tracked external gains higher on monday to hit 1 546 points before heading down to 1 520 the following day on worries over myanmar s partial capital controls potentially affecting stocks with exposure in myanmar such as mega osp and cbg equities on wednesday and thursday were pressured by jitters over the spillover effect from the crypto meltdown after zipmex temporarily suspended redemption for certain accounts as a result of its investment in other troubled digital asset platforms second quarter earnings reports by major banks also affected sentiment late in the week the market next week will likely be influenced by speculation about the size of the us interest rate increase when the federal reserve meets on tuesday and wednesday since the bourse will be closed on july 28 29 for holidays investors should not rush to load up stocks in their portfolios we expect the set to move sideways up in the 1 510 1 600 range in august key factors will include rate decisions by the fed and the bank of thailand on aug 10 as well as key macro data such as us core consumer expenditure and inflation figures for july recession fear priced in global equities as well as other risk assets have to a certain extent reflected worries that high inflation could lead to an economic recession and some analysts believe a lot of this concern is now priced in if us inflation in august and september turns out to be below 8 9 year on year or 0 5 month on month in other words no worse than it is now it could generate a more positive environment for monetary policy decisions by global central banks the fed may raise its key rate by 75 or 100 basis points only once or twice more before returning to more modest increases of 25 50 bps while the bank of thailand may not raise local rate as rapidly or as much as the market has feared the rapid appreciation of the dollar may pause or slow while the baht could gain ground after its persistent depreciation to nearly 37 to the dollar the bank of thailand has stated clearly that it will let the baht move with the market and and will not intervene for the time being another key external factor to monitor is the russia ukraine war some observers believe russia wants to end the war before winter when fighting conditions become more difficult they note that it is allowing ukrainians to apply for russian citizenship if they want to while president vladimir putin has started to travel abroad to friendly countries other measures could follow and bring the situation under control faster than the market had anticipated here at home after the parliamentary censure debate ends with today s vote investors should monitor government stimulus measures given that a general election is looming early next year in light of the appointment of yet another economic crisis management committee chaired by the prime minister we foresee the eventual introduction of new stimulus measures domestic tourism remains active particularly during the most recent long weekend and another one this week foreign tourist arrivals have been beating most expectations while hotel occupancy shows signs of improvement such as room rate adjustments many hotels could swing back into the black in the third quarter or in the high season during the fourth quarter the positive impact will also spill over to other businesses in the tourism and hospitality supply chain as well among negative factors recession remains a real concern in the united states which would have an inevitable knock on impact in the rest of the world numerous corporate giants including google and apple have signalled a hold on new employment amid such uncertainty preliminary second quarter us gdp figures due next week are expected to show a second straight year on year contraction investors should closely monitor how steep the contraction is oil price impact meanwhile persistent rises in the prices of fertiliser and liquefied natural gas could ignite a fresh wave of inflation jitters in many countries an oil price downtrend could weigh on thai commodity plays given their substantial weighting on the set but it would be positive for stocks that move in the opposite direction of oil trends with earnings season just getting under way companies with high exposure to energy prices could register weaker than expected results and trigger earnings downgrades however the set has reflected this factor already to some extent investors should also monitor how the meltdown in crypto markets is creating an increasingly pronounced chain reaction in other markets something that wasn t the case just a few years ago
the uk s hottest day on record has given local fire services their busiest day since world war ii wildfires blaze across the mediterranean and july s unprecedented european heatwave is yet another example of how climate change will challenge nations these challenges are expected to roll on in the short term with over a month left in what is considered the meteorological summer for australia experts say the tumbling hot weather records in europe are a warning to a nation famous for its own sizzling summers records shattered in europe the headlines coming out of the region paint a concerning picture a new record temperature for the uk exceeding 40 c has been reached at the same time the nation s first ever code red extreme heat warning was issued cities along france s western coast also saw a mass breaking of temperature records on monday in some of these towns the anomaly or variation in temperature above the average has exceeded 16 c the uk has seen some temperatures clear 20 c above the average and although some britons have pointed to their nation s 1976 heatwave as proof these temperatures are nothing new meteorologists have swiftly pointed to the widespread nature of these excessive temperatures people keep telling me that because the uk had a heatwave in 1976 climate change is overhyped so here s the global heat anomaly maps from june 1976 and june 2022 pic twitter com tngigoeeul will norman willnorman july 17 2022 in 2020 the metoffice produced a hypothetical weather forecast for 23 july 2050 based on uk climate projections today the forecast for tuesday is shockingly almost identical for large parts of the country pic twitter com u5hqhzwoti dr simon lee simonleewx july 15 2022 we have not seen anything like it we can t compare this looming heat emergency to summer 1976 a warmer world thanks to human induced climate change makes it almost effortless to break extreme heat thresholds we continue to see this across the planet not just in europe pic twitter com z0fpz3mcbb scott duncan scottduncanwx july 17 2022 eagle eyed readers will note these present day anomaly maps show a redder globe to those of 46 years ago the result of far hotter temperatures than average in most parts of the planet now that ominous red patch over europe extends into northern africa home of nations like morocco and algeria which have also battled blazes along their coasts this week although wildfires are known events in mediterranean regions the severity of fires blazing across portugal spain france italy and greece is such that tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes and holiday areas these types of events have been predicted for some time and the intergovernmental panel on climate change s 2022 adaptation report emphasised heatwaves and wildfires would continue to impact human health food security and ecosystem survival although heatwaves and vegetation fires are nothing new in parts of europe and northern africa dr rachael nolan a researcher in fire ecology from western sydney university says the impact of warming temperatures is creating fire prone conditions in areas unaccustomed to them in many places around the world we are seeing wildfires occurring in places that don t usually see fire says nolan this is driven by climate change pushing up temperatures and drying out fuel during heatwaves high temperatures and low humidity causes vegetation to dry out leaving areas primed for fire fires can then spread quickly when there is an ignition this is what we are seeing in the uk at the moment we are also seeing fires in the mediterranean basin and although fires in this region are not unusual they are also occurring at the moment due to the heatwave credit rsndetre getty images the consequences for human health are many as is being witnessed the uk s building stock is not designed or built for heat says professor darryn mcevoy a research professor in urban resilience and climate adaptation from rmit building materials like concrete are effective at retaining and amplifying heat in built up areas a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect this can increase the likelihood of heat related deaths and illnesses which mcevoy says points to the need to modify towns and cities for the climate of the future the heat impacting europe re emphasises the need to not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions as a matter of urgency by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and moving to net zero but also to adapt our urban environments for what inevitably will be a hotter future mcevoy says heat effects aside urban areas are also more polluted that less densely populated ones this means atmospheric pollutants particulate matter that degrades air quality and ozone formation from solar radiation are more likely to occur in periods of extreme heat it s why the risk of more severe weather events due to global warming is of concern to health authorities around the world when a heatwave goes along with high levels of pollution it exacerbates respiratory cardiovascular diseases and conditions especially in large urban spaces that are not adapted to cope with these high temperatures explains maria neira director of environment and health at the world health organisation we have been alerting for a long time that climate change is severely affecting human health and therefore taking measures to reach the zero carbon and accelerating the transition to clean renewable sources of energy will be extremely important wildfires like those experienced by parts of europe and the uk add another complication with heatwaves capable of exacerbating pollution effects the release of more toxic substances from widespread vegetation burning increases the risks to human health research released on wednesday by curtin and murdoch universities found a direct link between smoke exposures and attendance at emergency departments perth western australia where these universities are located has endured several particularly damaging bushfire seasons in recent years dr adeleh shirangi from curtin s school of population health led the research that found a 7 increase in emergency admissions the likelihood of hospitalisations was also higher for those over 60 years of age from socioeconomic disadvantage and those with pre existing heart and lung issues for nations with increasingly ageing populations this could present healthcare providers with a perfect storm as climate change s impacts are felt in coming years bushfire smoke consists of a complex mix of particulate matter pm and gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide and ozone explains shirangi and the size of particulate matter that is in bushfire smoke is so small 2 5 micrometres in diameter which is about 50 times smaller than the thickness of a strand of human hair when we inhale pm2 5 this tiny particulate matter is small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and the bloodstream this can lead us to have various serious diseases affecting the heart lungs and brain and during bushfires the levels of pm concentration in the air are significantly higher than regulatory air quality standards so it s become extremely unsafe two firefighters confronting a fire near nowra new south wales during the black summer bushfires of 2019 2020 credit saeed khan afp via getty northern hemisphere events are an advance warning for australia just as australia was stunned by consecutive years of record flooding events more often associated with rainy european winters so has the northern hemisphere been unprepared for heatwaves that have long been part of the australian psyche it s that australian preparedness for heatwaves and bushfire events that may leave the uk and european nations exposed tragic drownings of britons retreating to lakes and streams for respite as well as increased hospitalisations from heat stress and smoke inhalation may become more common headlines in the coming years while more than three in four australian households have air conditioning just 1 of uk homes has a cooling system just as australia looks to the potential impacts of climate change on coastline and floodplain communities so too will european nations need to consider what adaptations are needed to reduce the burden on an already challenged health system something dr sharon campbell from the menzies institute for medical research at the university of tasmania describes as being caught in a perfect storm of social cultural and political factors an adaptive response is important for already heat prone nations like australia in january 2022 the mercury reached a continental record of 50 7 c in onslow a coastal town in western australia s pilbara region so although the global focus this week is on temperature records broken in the uk and france australia too must consider the impacts of hotter summers on its built up areas and high fuel vegetation these factors combine to make this event a human and environmental disaster says campbell the uk has a health system already at breaking point a government distracted by leadership battles and an emergency fatigued population just wanting to have a summer of fun driven by human induced climate change extreme and record breaking temperatures have hit australia the united states and now europe across successive summers australia needs to actively prepare for 50 c in major population centres like western sydney this takes government leadership and community understanding we have seen a shift to greater recognition of these risks with a recent change in federal government and this needs to be urgently followed by greater investment in research adaptation initiatives and education

according to david pulla manager national sales plt sailun tire americas a dedicated winter tire is the route you would want to go especially with the canadian climate photo shutterstock with many driver going back to the office and students heading off to college and university retailers can look forward to a strong winter tire season this year s winter tire season should be a healthy one offering tire retailers an increased opportunity to sell more winter tires than they have in recent years looking at 2022 i think there might be a better volume of sales as more people return to work after the pandemic and more people are on the road says james mcintyre vp of sales canada sailun tire the last year or two has been a little softer although you wouldn t know it from some of the stats in 2021 almost 70 of canadians had winter tires on their vehicles while canadian drivers are clearly big fans of winter tires there s another trend that is likely to increase the demand for dedicated winter tires this year we re seeing a lot of performance sedans sold with uhp tires mcintyre adds they re going to need winter tires because what s on the car won t work in the winter and that s been a trend over the last few years ian mckenney strategic product manager consumer replacement bridgestone agrees adding that all weather tires which come with a 3 peak mountain snowflake rating are taking a bite out of winter tires sales in the u s a but not in canada as more and more all weather products hit the market in the united states we re seeing more of a shift where people are starting to adopt these instead of having dedicated winter products mckenney explains whereas the canadian market is still pretty solidly entrenched even though there is an all weather product there is something to be said for the performance that you re getting from a dedicated winter product and so in markets that are going to have a lot of snowfall it makes sense to continue to make that jump to a dedicated winter product david pulla manager national sales plt sailun tire americas says that canadians see the value of dedicated winter tires there is a demand for all weather tires and there is a market for them he explains but at the end of the day a dedicated winter tire is the route you would want to go especially with the canadian climate the vast majority of consumers that are commuting anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour to work definitely want to ensure that you have dedicated winter tires on their vehicles it s just a matter of safety supply demand although the pandemic has taught us to expect supply issues and shipping delays despite the foretold strong demand for winter tires this year tire manufacturers don t foresee a shortage because they have planned ahead and have the stock they need to supply tire retailers we ve actually planned ahead to pull more winter volume in than we traditionally would have just to make sure that there aren t any supply constraints for those folks who want winter products mckenney adds studded tires guy letellier technical advisor commercial products for point s canada says he s seeing more studded tires coming to market recently at least in the province of quebec in the last couple of years i ve seen the comeback of studded tires he explains many manufacturers offer tires already studded from the factory they do a great job when you look at the studs they are all very well inserted into the the tread we ve seen a lot of these tires in the last two years they re very popular despite the rise in popularity of studded winter tires letellier says it s not something he recommends to customers they re too noisy and they re more slippery on dry asphalt than a good ice and snow tire he adds that the hassle isn t worth it since consumers have to remove studded tires from their vehicles by a specified date they can t enter some parking lots with studded tires and when the temperature drops below something like 35 degrees celsius the ice becomes so hard that the studs no longer offer extra grip 3pmsf what separates winter tires and all weather tires from the pack is the three peak mountain snowflake symbol 3pmsf introduced in 1999 by the u s tire manufacturers association ustma and the rubber association of canada rac the 3pmsf on a tire s sidewall indicates that the tire meets required performance criteria in snow testing the performance based standard for winter tires was first applied to passenger and light truck vehicles and then eventually to commercial tires before this 3pmsf standard was in place explains dustin lancy commercial product marketing manager goodyear we could do computer modelling and mud traction tests on our own tracks but we had nothing to compare it against this gave us a standard baseline today the 3pmsf helps consumers determine which tires have been engineered to deal with the cold ice and snow that are part of daily life here in canada during the winter months whether studded or not with many people resuming their daily commutes to work and many young adults heading off to university winter tires should be in high demand as canada gets back to business and that s good news for tire retailers everywhere

film acting may be the most mysterious of the arts a film script is shorter than a stage play but it leaves more for the actor to sketch in because devices like stage direction and soliloquy are largely unavailable every choice therefore bears added weight at the same time the large screen which records every facial twitch for posterity compels an economy of gesture what the actor must do at a minimum and this is merely where the mystery begins is get through the screen beauty and talent aside some actors can hold our attention those who cannot pass this first decisive test don t get cast even the most resourceful critics struggle to say why one performance leaves a lasting impression while another fades it s not that there aren t enough english adjectives but rather that adjectives often seem like the wrong tools imagine describing to a friend the pathos marlon brando evokes as a washed up boxer in on the waterfront or what paul newman does with his alcoholic lawyer in the verdict no words quite substitute for the experience of watching a great actor in full flight eight and a half years have passed since the february 2014 death of philip seymour hoffman of a heroin overdose at age 46 hoffman s absence still provokes sadness he was not quite a movie star he was something much better only in retrospect has the scale of his ambition become clear one role at a time he was trying to take on the whole of our collective experience to get inside the loneliness the self loathing and the desperation above all the desperation of life in a nation poking at its own psychic wounds hoffman s most durable role was probably in capote for which he won an academy award in 2005 he portrayed writer truman capote during a pivotal period in capote s career as he researched and composed his greatest book the true crime story in cold blood the book both made capote s reputation and drained him emotionally beginning the moral and physical collapse that ended in his premature death totally lacking in physical vanity hoffman made himself smaller raised his voice several octaves mastered capote s distinctive gestures it was a triumph not merely of technique but of understanding hoffman played capote as a man both exquisitely self possessed and entirely captive to his own ambition hoffman could underline capote s self deceptions in his pursuit of the truth about the murders of the clutter family because he understood the artistic stakes the writer was playing for contrast capote with hoffman s performance in sidney lumet s 2007 crime thriller before the devil knows you re dead as he is delicate in capote here he is bullying and brutal his andy an inept criminal and a worse son and brother is hateful and cruelly manipulative he brings ruin and death to the people around him but hoffman connects us to andy s need just as he connected us to capote s and when andy breaks open in a pivotal scene we see the unloved little boy he once was as his plan unravels andy commits terrible violence but he never quite loses our sympathy hoffman was interested in male sexual frustration and dysfunction in happiness he played a proto incel a man who feels an overwhelming need to express himself sexually but has no way to connect his jacob in 25th hour and scotty j in boogie nights are rendered almost mute by obsession these men have pornography at their fingertips but sexual intimacy is on the other side of the moon his lester bangs in almost famous delivers an aria for the uncool telling a journalistic protégé that women will always be a problem for guys like us in doubt hoffman invites the audience to consider that his father flynn a man of intelligence and wit a man who truly cares for children might also be a predator in a nation increasingly defined by its addictions hoffman himself was an addict he was dependent at various times on alcohol and heroin and more loosely on food and cigarettes anything by mouth he joked he played addicts time and again capote s life was destroyed by alcohol hoffman s grieving widower in love liza sniffs gasoline of course anyone can play a crazed dope fiend as frank sinatra did to dubious effect and an academy award nomination in the man with the golden arm hoffman merged the addictions of his characters into their broader psychology their peculiar sense of what was missing and what they were owed an actor must be specific and no one was more specific about suffering than hoffman hoffman s consuming career and early death invite the cliché of the suffering artist he would have rejected this idea as the kind of lazy first thought he worked to get past in his roles heroin killed hoffman just as heroin and other opioids will kill 50 000 americans this year who are not as gifted or driven as he was it would be speciously romantic then to say that fame or self imposed pressure was what led to his death but did the emotional risks hoffman took for his work contribute to his early death the only sensible answer is yes the intensity of his performances especially his theatrical runs as willy loman in death of a salesman and james tyrone jr in long day s journey into night threatened his emotional equilibrium john le carré who met hoffman on the set of a most wanted man wrote that philip took vivid stock of everything all the time it was painful and exhausting work and probably in the end his undoing ethan hawke worked with hoffman in before the devil knows you re dead he told charlie rose it didn t come for free hoffman used whatever he needed to get himself to the stage or set every day holding the audience in the palm of your hand he spoke of that as an addiction too when a performer of rare talent and creative drive dies early we feel guilt because we know that on some level they were doing it for us at the moment american movies are growing commercially but the creative path ahead is less promising the adult themed midsize films in which hoffman made his name were dying even as his career began most probably would not even be made today the blockbusters and sequels that fit the new global distribution model feature characters whose motives are transparent and whose emotions pass through them one at a time like boats in a parade flotilla for this you don t need someone like hoffman except maybe to lend an air of legitimacy to a dubious enterprise as hoffman did for the 2007 tom cruise vehicle mission impossible iii american movies now exist in an eternal present outside of any particular language or culture they do us no credit philip seymour hoffman left behind a dozen remarkable performances his admirers remember him as the best of an art form that fascinates us frustrates us and occasionally moves us beyond words photo by

august 1 2022 is the license renewal application filing deadline for commercial and noncommercial tv broadcast stations licensed to communities in the following states full power tv class a lptv and tv translator stations california overview the fcc s state by state license renewal cycle began in june 2019 for radio stations and in june 2020 for television stations tv stations licensed to communities in the respective states listed above should be moving forward with their license renewal preparation this includes becoming familiar with the requirements for the filing itself as well as being aware of changes the fcc has made to the public notice procedures associated with the filing discussed below the license renewal application fcc form 2100 schedule 303 s primarily consists of a series of certifications in the form of yes no questions the fcc advises that applicants should only respond yes when they are certain that the response is correct thus if an applicant is seeking a waiver of a particular rule or policy or is uncertain that it has fully complied with the rule or policy in question it should respond no to that certification the application provides an opportunity for explanations and exhibits so the fcc indicates that a no response to any of the questions will not cause the immediate dismissal of the application provided that an appropriate exhibit is submitted an applicant should review any such exhibits or explanations with counsel prior to filing when answering questions in the license renewal application the relevant reporting period is the licensee s entire 8 year license term if the licensee most recently received a short term license renewal the application reporting period would cover only that abbreviated license term similarly if the license was assigned or transferred via fcc form 314 or 315 during the license term the relevant reporting period is just the time since consummation of that last assignment or transfer schedule 303 s application for renewal of tv broadcast station licenses parties to the application some of the certifications an applicant is asked to make in schedule 303 s relate solely to the station and some such as character certifications relate to any party to the application a party to the application is any individual or entity that has an attributable interest in a station this includes all parties whose ownership interest positional interest i e an officer or director or other relation to the applicant confers on that party a sufficient degree of influence or control over the licensee to merit fcc attention for a corporation this typically includes all officers directors and shareholders with a 5 or greater voting interest for an llc its officers and members and for a partnership all partners however each form of entity comes with its own caveats limitations and unique rules for determining attributable interest holders for example limited partners are normally attributable interest holders unless they have been insulated from partnership decisions pursuant to very specific fcc requirements filers should reach out to counsel prior to filing if there are any questions about who the fcc would consider a party in interest to the license renewal application character issues adverse findings and fcc violations pursuant to the fcc s statutory obligation to consider any serious rule violations or patterns of abuse each licensee must certify that neither it nor any party to the application has had any interest in or connection with an application that was or is the subject of unresolved character issues where the applicant is unable to make this certification it must include an exhibit identifying the party involved the call letters and location of the station or file number of the fcc application or docket and describe the party s connection to the matter including all relevant dates the applicant must also explain why the unresolved character issue is not an impediment to grant of the license renewal application applicants must also certify whether the licensee or any party to the application has been the subject of an adverse finding in any civil or criminal proceeding involving a felony a mass media related antitrust or unfair competition charge a false statement to another governmental entity or discrimination the applicant must report adverse findings from the past ten years and include an exhibit explaining the matter in detail and why it should not be an impediment to a grant of the license renewal application note however that a station does not need to report an adverse finding that was disclosed to the fcc in the context of an earlier station application where it was subsequently found by the fcc to be not disqualifying the application form also asks the applicant to certify that there have been no violations by the licensee of the communications act of 1934 as amended or the rules or regulations of the commission during the preceding license term the instructions to the form make clear that this question is only asking the applicant to certify that there have been no formal findings of a violation by the fcc or a court such as a notice of apparent liability notice of violation or similar finding of a rule violation applicants should not use this section to self disclose any violations not previously identified by the fcc foreign ownership and control the applicant must also certify that the licensee has complied with section 310 of the communications act regarding foreign influence over the station section 310 generally prohibits the fcc from issuing a license to an alien a representative of an alien a foreign government or the representative thereof or a corporation organized under the laws of a foreign government it also prohibits a license being issued to an entity of which more than 20 of the capital stock is owned or voted by aliens their representatives a foreign government or its representative or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country or absent a special ruling from the fcc to an entity whose parent company has more than 25 of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens their representatives a foreign government or its representative or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country station operations the license renewal application also requires stations to certify that they are currently operational as the fcc will not renew the license of a station that is not broadcasting in a similar vein section 73 1740 of the fcc s rules sets forth the minimum operating hours for commercial broadcast stations in the license renewal application stations must certify that they were not silent or operated less than the required minimum number of hours for a period of more than 30 days during the license term if they cannot they must include an exhibit disclosing the relevant details and explaining why it should not adversely affect the station s license renewal stations must also certify as to several statements regarding radiofrequency electromagnetic rf exposure of the public and workers at the transmitter site stations that were previously renewed and which have had no changes at their transmitter site since their last renewal application will generally be able to certify compliance with this statement stations that have had a material change in the rf environment at their transmitter site must assess the impact of that change before certifying rf compliance and may need to submit an exhibit demonstrating the station s compliance with rf requirements related filings and materials other certifications successfully navigating the license renewal application also requires stations to certify that the rest of their regulatory house is in order for example applicants must certify that they have timely made other regulatory filings such as the biennial ownership report on fcc form 323 or 323 e and confirm that their advertising agreements do not discriminate on the basis of race or gender and contain non discrimination clauses applicants must also certify that they have placed all items required to be in the station s public inspection file in the file and that they have done so on a timely basis public file violations have traditionally been a significant cause of fines at license renewal time as the public inspection file is now online stations should be mindful that third parties are able to easily review and confirm the timeliness of public file documents as with all other certifications in the application form stations must accurately respond and be prepared to provide documentation supporting their certifications if later requested by the fcc eeo depending on staff size one of the items stations must certify is that they have timely placed in their public inspection file as well as on their website the annual equal employment opportunity eeo public file report generally a station that is part of a station employment unit that employs fewer than five full time employees is exempt from these requirements however at license renewal time all stations regardless of staff size must file fcc form 2100 schedule 396 the broadcast eeo program report stations in a station employment unit with fewer than five full time employees will only need to complete part of the form before filing it as a practical matter because of the mechanics of the fcc s filing system an applicant will generally be unable to file its license renewal application until it can provide in that form the file number generated by the fcc when the station s completed schedule 396 is filed certifications for full power tv and class a tv stations only while there is significant overlap between the certifications included in both the radio and tv license renewal applications an important portion of the form specific to full power tv and class a tv stations concerns certifications regarding the station s children s television programming obligations the children s television act of 1990 requires commercial full power tv and class a tv stations to 1 limit the amount of commercial matter aired during programming designed for children ages 12 and under and 2 air programming responsive to the educational and informational needs of children ages 16 and under while stations have been required to submit children s television programming reports and commercial limits certifications demonstrating their compliance with these requirements on a quarterly or annual basis 1 the license renewal application requires applicants to further certify that these obligations have been satisfied and documented as required over the entire license term and to explain any instances of noncompliance stations can find additional information on the children s television programming and reporting obligations in our most recent children s television programming advisory although noncommercial tv stations are not subject to commercial limitations or required to file children s television programming reports such stations are required to air programming responsive to children s educational and informational needs in preparation for license renewal such stations should therefore ensure they have documentation demonstrating compliance with this obligation in the event their license renewal is challenged for class a television stations in addition to certifications related to children s television programming the application requires certification of compliance with the class a eligibility and service requirements under section 73 6001 of the fcc s rules specifically such stations must broadcast a minimum of 18 hours a day and average at least three hours per week of locally produced programming each quarter to maintain their class a status applicants must certify that they have and will continue to meet these requirements post filing license renewal announcements in prior license renewal cycles stations were required to give public notice of a license renewal application both before and after the filing of that application for the current cycle the fcc eliminated the pre filing public notices and modified the procedures for post filing notices these changes modify the timing and number of on air announcements required replace newspaper public notice requirements with an online notice and revise the text of the announcements themselves as a result full power and class a tv stations as well as lptv stations capable of local origination must broadcast a total of six post filing license renewal announcements over four consecutive weeks with at least one airing each week and no more than two airing in any week each of which must air on different days the first such announcement must air within five business days after the fcc has issued a public notice announcing its acceptance for filing of the application on air post filing announcements must be broadcast on a weekday monday through friday between 7 00 am and 11 00 pm local time based on the applicant station s community of license the text of the announcement is as follows on licensee of filed an application with the federal communications commission for renewal of its license members of the public wishing to view this application or obtain information about how to file comments and petitions on the application can visit publicfiles fcc gov and search in public file for those types of stations that do not have public inspection files the on air post filing announcement should instead be on licensee of filed an application with the federal communications commission for renewal of its license members of the public wishing to view this application or obtain information about how to file comments and petitions can visit www fcc gov stationsearch and search in the list of filed applications for television broadcast stations when these on air announcements are presented aurally the public notice text must also be presented visually onscreen special rules apply to noncommercial educational stations that do not normally operate during any month when their announcements would otherwise be due to air as well as to other silent stations these stations should contact counsel regarding how to provide the required public notice certification of compliance within seven days of the broadcast of the last required announcement full power tv station and class a tv station license renewal applicants should complete the attached statement of compliance and place it in the station s public inspection file lptv license renewal applicants should complete the attached statement of compliance and place it in their station records file online public notice required for tv translator and certain lptv stations tv translator and lptv stations not capable of local origination are not required to broadcast post filing announcements and have typically been required to publish public notices in a local newspaper instead the fcc has eliminated the newspaper publication requirement in favor of online notices requiring such stations to publish written notice on a station affiliated website upon filing a license renewal application a prominently displayed link or tab that reads fcc applications must be posted on the station website homepage and link to a separate page containing the following notice on of filed an application with the federal communications commission for renewal of its license members of the public wishing to view this application or obtain information about how to file comments and petitions on the application can visit this separate page must also include the date the page was last revised the notice and corresponding link to the license renewal application must be posted within five business days after the fcc has issued a public notice announcing its acceptance for filing of the application and remain on the station s website for 30 consecutive days at the end of the 30 day period the notice can be removed and if no other applications requiring online notice are pending the webpage should be updated to include the following text instead there are currently no applications pending for which online public notice is required the rules contain specific requirements as to where station applicants that do not have websites should post their announcement these stations should consult with counsel on the proper online notice procedures after publishing the notice the licensee should complete and execute a statement of compliance regarding that publication and place the statement of compliance in its public inspection file while tv translator and lptv station licensees are not required to keep a public inspection file they are required to maintain and make available to fcc representatives a station records file that contains their current authorization and copies of all fcc filings and correspondence with the commission for them the completed statement of compliance should be included in their station records file please see statement here 1 note that in 2019 the fcc changed the obligation to file the children s television programming report and place the commercial limits certification in the public inspection file from a quarterly requirement to an annual obligation
it s essential to every studio but acoustic treatment can also affect our health and that of the planet in this short series i ve been finding out what can be done to make the audio industry more sustainable so far we ve encountered two companies whose primary business is in high value electronic goods in this third part we ll look at how portuguese manufacturers vicoustic are trying to bring about change in a rather different market sector historically acoustic treatment has been made using one of two absorbent materials so called acoustic foam is produced from polyurethane or from extruded melamine foam while mineral wool is manufactured by blowing air through molten glass or rock neither is a renewable material and both are also controversial from a health point of view as vicoustic s gustavo pires puts it those products were designed only in terms of acoustic performance and not with a holistic view of thinking about what the product will do when you put it in a certain place and when you put a product in a room for example you need to think about several issues acoustic performance of course but also safety and air quality for example we know that foam products release vocs so imagine that you have an audio engineer working for 20 or 40 years in a studio with foam it ll not be good for their health so we cannot say that that room will be fit for the purpose of audio engineering because his purpose is to be in a healthy environment as well as an acoustically controlled environment with mineral wool we know that it releases particles to the atmosphere and it s hard to handle it gets itchy and causes problems for your skin so when you think of a product with a certain purpose you need to think with a broader view and not only ok let s attack the acoustics what about the rest the health risks associated with acoustic foam and mineral wool are hotly debated and officially both are considered safe to use and to work with when it comes to sustainability however they definitely fall short of the mark neither can easily be recycled or reused neither comes from renewable sources neither is biodegradable and both are energy intensive to make inasmuch as mineral wool has green credentials they have nothing to do with its being a low impact material in its own right and more to do with its ability to save energy in its role as an insulating material this is becoming increasingly problematic not only in the studio world but in the wider construction industry where large scale building projects are often required to meet green building standards these standards prohibit the use of non reusable non renewable materials but they also demand the use of acoustic treatment as gustavo explains basically there are four different acoustic criteria in green building certification schemes one is environmental noise we want to put buildings in sites where you don t have a lot of environmental noise and if you have you need to think about how to deal with it so you have acoustic barriers and you put the most sensitive areas in the central part of the building so you have a shield from the environmental noise then you have sound insulation between different spaces within the building and then you have reverberation time so for example for schools or for offices you have targets for the reverberation time in the medium frequencies where speech occurs and then you have noise control you put things like hvac and elevators that produce noise within the building and you want those noises accommodated so that you don t create noise nuisance to the people inside the building and the step forward i think is to pick this mentality and go to the audio sector because the problem is the same in terms of sustainability it makes us want to have audio rooms fit for their purpose and to have that we need to think in a holistic way and not only in a performative way like we were doing until now i think so i think that is starting to come in in the audio world as well this situation has created both an opportunity and a challenge for manufacturers like vicoustic now that buildings are designed with acoustics in mind demand for acoustic products is potentially much higher however that demand can t be met using traditional materials because they are ruled out by the same green building standards that mandate acoustic treatment in the first place a manufacturer who can find a sustainable alternative thus has the potential to exploit not only traditional markets such as recording and broadcast studios but new markets too but what could that alternative be polyethylene tetraphthalate or pet is a hard plastic which is typically used for drinks bottles it s widely collected for recycling but not widely enough and discarded pet bottles are endangering marine ecosystems around the world at one of the many trade shows vicoustic attend césar carapinha encountered a company from belgium that took in pet waste processed it and turned it into new raw materials among them a wool like substance with a density appropriate to use in acoustic panels the seeds of a new product range were sown but getting it to market has been a painstaking process what s difficult is to create professional looking finished products from pet without compromising its acoustic performance or its sustainability it sounds easy to come up with this idea says per larsen but it s been a long journey to get to the quality and to the acoustic performance that we have today this journey has involved working with their suppliers to optimise the acoustic performance of the material as well as ensuring that it can be delivered in appropriate sizes and shapes but in order to meet green building criteria vicoustic s products don t only need to be made from recycled material they need to be capable of being recycled or reused themselves this has meant taking a new approach to the design of the panels in a sense the decision to use pet as an acoustic material is the easy part and vicoustic are by no means the only manufacturer to do so what s much more difficult is to create professional looking finished products from pet without compromising its acoustic performance or its sustainability and that is the challenge vicoustic have addressed with their unique patent pending virtual material technology in order for acoustic treatment to be acceptable in any work or domestic environment it s vital to have control over its appearance in commercial acoustic panels this is often achieved by glueing fabric over the absorbent foam mineral wool or pet but doing this creates a mixed material that can no longer be recycled or considered sustainable other methods of creating coloured pet panels meanwhile involve injecting resin and other substances throughout the material compromising its acoustic performance and using large quantities of industrial chemicals the problem facing césar and his team was to find a way of making pet based panels look good without compromising their performance or their green qualities the solution was ingenious a friend of césar s ran a t shirt printing company which used a process called sublimation to transfer patterns onto clothing the process works rather like a temporary tattoo the pattern is printed onto a sheet of paper which is placed printed side down onto the material pressure heat and moisture are then applied in controlled circumstances and the pigment migrates from the paper onto the material after which the paper can simply be peeled off making this work reliably and repeatably took a lot of work but the payoff is that panels in the vmt range are 100 percent recyclable and can be given almost any appearance imaginable from simple block colours to surprisingly convincing wood marble and concrete patterns hence the name virtual material technology custom colours and patterns are also straightforward to produce for putting an image on an acoustic panel the standard technique is to print on fabric and then glue the fabric into the panel explains gustavo we were able to overcome that by using only raw material and then the process that puts the ink in the panel so you don t need anything else other than the ink and the raw material making the sublimation technique work on their recycled pet panels required a lot of experiment as per explains i think most of the machinery we have is bought off the shelf but it s the combination of how to use it in a proper manner the heat you use the pressure you use to produce this panel it took a lot of trial and error to get there another issue with traditional acoustic panels that tends to make them non reusable is mounting panels are often simply glued to the wall which obviously makes it hard to reposition them without damage for this reason vicoustic have also invented a new mounting system for the vmt range we changed from the standard glue process to a mechanical fixation for at least two reasons explains gustavo one is that if you want to move your room you can take your panels so the investment is a long term investment it s not only for that room but also it gives you the possibility of changing acoustic treatment configurations imagine that you have a room with diffusers and with absorbers by having this mechanical fixation system you are able to change the acoustics of your room for example having first reflections treated with absorption is a completely different experience from having first reflections treated with diffusers with electronic music with faster tempos that change very quickly maybe it s better to have absorption and to have more control to be able to distinguish all the changes with classical music maybe it s more pleasant to have diffusers there so this system gives you that possibility as well vicoustic will have even more scope to realise their green ambitions when their new factory is completed in a year or so s time one of the reasons why we are moving into a new building is so that we can invest in being more productive and being more sustainable as well says césar today we already have a lot of machines that are using waste for example in the wood factory one of the press machines uses waste wood to heat the boilers and these boilers are used to glue the laminate on the mdf for example but the heating that we have in the winter still uses gas so we re going to change that to use more waste again we re going to have a system to capture rain water to use in the toilets and also on the garden so we don t need to use purified water for this and of course we are making a very big investment in solar energy as well so that we lower our dependence on energy in the new factory we will have new machines to cut the pet waste into small pieces and include that in new products adds marisa cruz duarte right now after the vmt process the waste goes to the operator or into the packaging but in the future we want to take those small pieces of pet and use them ourselves the waste pet that today we are sending to the recycling companies to be transformed again we will shred it and we will use it to make acoustic panels out of shredded pet agrees césar we cannot do that now because we don t have the space nearly all new vicoustic products now use vmt rather than conventional absorbers and some older products have also been updated to use the new material which now accounts for more than half the company s sales but as is often the case with new technologies there are still challenges associated with selling vmt in some sectors innate conservatism means there s a tendency to resist change we have a lot of products that we want to change but our clients want those products says marisa and the costs involved in developing and producing the new material mean it s a premium product at a premium price at vicoustic we make market leading premium products and can handle the expense that recycled materials bring with them because honestly speaking it s the right thing to do and it is a price worth paying in our opinion says césar we focus on sustainability and quality the next step that we are thinking about is to use pet that is captured 100 percent from the seashores and from the sea the problem is that the price would be so high that then the products would be too expensive and there must be a balance because if we don t sell the recycled products then the recycling doesn t happen so there is a balance between a commercial viable product and being 100 percent super sustainable i always tell people when we talk about recycling that i don t believe in changing a plastic bag into another plastic bag because you are giving it another five days of useful life but then it will probably end up on the trash again so our vision is to have the plastic transformed into long lasting products it s not just vicoustic agrees per it s actually a bigger mission being a part of solving a big problem in the world with the plastic waste at least for me that made a huge difference when we discovered this material and we realised we can actually make an impact here we have turned over 250 tonnes of plastic waste into fantastic products i think that s a great mission

cardholders were spending more advertisement sandwiched between last week s dispiriting report on inflation and next week s decision by the federal reserve on interest rates the s p 500 still delivered its best week in a month after a collection of mostly better than expected reports on corporate profits falling yields in the bond market also helped easing the pressure on stocks after expectations for rate hikes by the fed sent yields soaring much of this year on friday the two year treasury yield tumbled again to 2 98 from 3 09 late thursday and from 3 14 a week ago on worries about the economy a report friday morning indicated u s business activity may be shrinking for the first time in nearly two years with service industries particularly weak business who is to blame for the summer of flight delays and cancellations the summer travel season has been chaotic industry insiders put much of the blame on airline executives who scheduled thousands of extra flights to cash in on demand manufacturing has stalled and the service sector s rebound from the pandemic has gone into reverse as the tailwind of pent up demand has been overcome by the rising cost of living higher interest rates and growing gloom about the economic outlook chris williamson chief business economist at s p global market intelligence said in a statement accompanying the survey data similar reports earlier in the morning also suggested weakness in europe underscoring how fragile the global economy is as central banks jack up interest rates in order to tame inflation higher rates make economic conditions more difficult and too aggressive hikes could cause a recession friday s reports are the latest to show parts of the economy are slowing more than expected while that raises the threat of a recession it also has traders ratcheting back expectations for the federal reserve s aggressiveness next week instead of a full percentage point traders now see an increase in rates of 0 75 of a

after it delivered better profit for the spring than analysts expected it said customers spent more on travel and entertainment in april than they did before the pandemic the first time that s happened the encouraging data bolstered some recent comments from chief executives at big banks who said their customers appear to be in solid financial shape despite all the worries about inflation and the economy advertisement despite friday s drops for wall street the s p 500 still rose 2 5 for the week besides the easing of treasury yields through the week dropping prices for crude oil and

provided by xinhua economist desmond lachman believes that the stock market decline will end when the fed shifts to a less hawkish monetary policy stance i expect that this will occur by year end at which stage we could see stock prices begin to recover he said by matthew rusling washington july 22 xinhua u s markets ended the week on an overall uptick but gains were pared on friday in all three major indexes the dow jones industrial average shot up 423 points since monday the s p 500 rose by 78 points and the nasdaq increased 272 points over the week but some of those gains were lost on friday the s p 500 dropped by 37 points from the previous day as investors reacted to a disappointing earnings report from social media company snap which caused the stock prices of companies including facebook to drop like a rock the dow jones industrial average and tech heavy nasdaq pared their gains from the previous day as well by 137 points and 225 points respectively on a positive note the week saw airlines profit from heavy demand as air travel has made a big comeback more than two years after covid 19 hit the united states covid 19 restrictions are largely a thing of the past and americans are keen to take to the skies and head out on vacation this summer the nation s three largest carriers america united and delta put out their quarterly earnings and each has expressed optimism about demand for the second half of the summer but at the same time the travel boom has caused headaches due to higher ticket prices increased flight cancellations and worker shortages among a host of other issues provided by xinhua meanwhile microsoft with a nearly 2 trillion u s dollar market cap announced it would cut back on hiring new employees amid inflationary pressures on consumers also of concern is the possibility of recession on the horizon a point of debate among many economists a microsoft spokesperson told cnbc earlier this week that as the tech giant gets ready for the new fiscal year it is making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity other big tech companies are scaling back on hiring for certain teams including alphabet facebook and apple in a sign that americans are moving on from covid 19 markets this week paid little attention to the news that u s president joe biden tested positive the president has been both fully vaccinated and boosted and is taking paxlovid the antiviral treatment from vaccine maker pfizer desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute and a former official at the international monetary fund told xinhua that in the coming months stock prices are likely to be determined by the economy s performance and the federal reserve s interest rate policy my view is that we will experience a meaningful recession by the end of the year lachman said adding that he believes the fed will maintain its hawkish monetary policy stance in a bid to fight inflation on that basis stock prices have yet further to fall despite already seeing a significant drop in recent months lachman said he believes that the stock market decline will end when the fed shifts to a less hawkish monetary policy stance i expect that this will occur by year end at which stage we could see stock prices begin to recover lachman said provided by xinhua dean baker senior economist at the center for economic and policy research noted that the market was priced very high before its recent fall it is still priced high but it is not nearly as out of line as in the fall also there is no reason to expect a surge baker said all this occurs as biden s approval rating has hit all time lows mostly on record inflation and gasoline prices biden s approval rating stands at 37 2 percent lower than any president at this point in office since the 1950s around half of americans have some sort of investment in the stock market and the question remains whether the still volatile market will hurt biden christopher galdieri assistant professor at saint anselm college told xinhua that in terms of stock market drops i don t think this specifically is going to hurt biden what s dragging him down is inflation gas prices the lingering pandemic but bad economic news of any sort is just one more thing that s going to pull down his approval ratings said galdieri clay ramsay a senior research associate at the center for international and security studies at the university of maryland told xinhua it s a reasonable guess that over half of voters this november will have some stock market involvement but the effects of inflation on household income are more significant and in some ways more widespread these factors are likely to resonate even more than the bad news about stocks ramsay said

on july 12 2022 the district of columbia council voted to modify key aspects of the ban on non compete agreements amendment act the act passing the non compete clarification amendment act of 2022 the amendment as we previously reported the act which was enacted in january 2021 but has yet to take effect sought to impose the broadest non compete prohibition in the country barring with narrow exceptions all simultaneous and post termination employment restrictions for employees in d c since its inception the act has been subject to criticism which has led to numerous extensions of its applicability date now in response to those criticisms the d c council has taken action the amendment if signed into law as expected and not blocked by congress contains a number of significant clarifications to the act and gives employers with d c employees options for utilizing non competition agreements and other policies such as conflict of interest policies that were to be banned by the act as discussed in detail below the amendment among other things narrows the coverage of its non competition restrictions permits the entry into non competes with highly compensated individuals subject to certain requirements permits the inclusion of non competition provisions in long term incentive agreements and contains numerous carve outs permitting certain common employer limitations on simultaneous employment such as conflict of interest policies as a general matter the amendment is a welcome development for employers with employees in d c employers with d c employees should become familiar with the new law in advance of its october 1 2022 effective date to ensure they understand what will be permitted after the effective date comply with its technical requirements and do not engage in prohibited acts even employers that do not utilize non competition agreements need to be aware of the law as it impacts policies typically not thought to be regulated by non competition laws covered employees definition narrowed the amendment redefines which employees are subject to the act s non compete ban the act broadly covered any individual who performs work in the district on behalf of an employer and any prospective employee who an employer reasonably anticipates will perform work on behalf of the employer in the district excluding only certain unpaid volunteers lay members elected or appointed to office within the discipline of any religious organization and engaged in religious functions an individual employed as a casual babysitter in or about the residence of the employer and certain medical specialists the amendment revamps this definition helpfully limiting employees covered by the act in significant ways as discussed below the amendment excludes highly compensated employees from the non compete ban subject to specific conditions in addition it adds helpful detail regarding which non highly compensated employees are covered for example only employees who i spend more than 50 of their time working in d c or ii if they spend a substantial amount of their work time for the employer in d c and do not spend more than 50 of their work time in another jurisdiction as well as new hires expected to meet either of these requirements are covered covered employees also include broadcast employee regardless of whether they are highly compensated employees broadcast employees are defined as on or off air creator such as an anchor disc jockey editor producer program host reporter or writer of a legal entity that owns or operates a television radio or cable station or network a satellite based service similar to a broadcast station or network or any other entity that provides broadcasting services such as news weather traffic sports or entertainment programming the amendment continues to exclude casual babysitters employed in or about the residence of the employer from coverage but has dropped the unpaid volunteer and lay religious leader exclusions further the amendment adds a new exclusion from coverage for partner in a partnership the scope of prohibited non competes significantly narrowed the amendment narrows the scope of what constitutes a prohibited non compete provision by both modifying the term s definition and by expressly excluding certain categories of restrictions from that definition the amendment redefines the term non compete provision as a provision in a written agreement or a workplace policy that prohibits an employee from performing work for another for pay or from operating the employee s own business notably this definition still covers employer policies both written and those implemented as a matter of practice not just agreements with employees the non compete provision definition also covers restrictions during the employee s employment with the employer and not just post employment restrictions beginning october 1 2022 employers will be barred from requiring or requesting covered employees enter into agreements or comply with workplace policies that include a non compete provision non compete provisions that violate the law are deemed void as a matter of law and unenforceable however the definition of non compete provision expressly excludes a number of categories of restrictions provided they are otherwise lawful meaning all employees may be subject to the following provisions restricting employees from isclosing using selling or accessing the employer s confidential employer information or proprietary employer information although a similar carve out was included in the act the amendment s version is more detailed notably confidential employer information is defined as information owned or possessed by the employer which is not available to the general public and which the employer has taken reasonable steps to ensure is protected from improper disclosure and proprietary employer information is defined as information unique to an employer that is compiled created or solicited by the employer including customer lists client lists and trade secrets as that term is defined in section 2 4 of the uniform trade secrets act of 153 1988 effective march 16 1989 d c law 7 216 d c official code 36 401 4 provisions restricting employees from ccepting money or a thing of value for performing work for a person other than the employer during the employee s employment with the employer because the employer reasonably believes the employee s acceptance of money or a thing of value under such circumstances will esult in the employee s disclosure or use of confidential employer information or proprietary employer information onflict with the employer s industry s or profession s established rules regarding conflicts of interest onstitute a conflict of commitment if the employee is employed by a higher education institution with conflict of commitment defined as conduct that would compromise the ability of an employee of a higher education institution to perform employment duties for the institution because the activities risk interfering with the employee s primary duties for the institution or mpair the employer s ability to comply with district or federal laws or regulations a contract or a grant agreement provisions hat provide a long term incentive which is defined as bonuses equity compensation stock options restricted and unrestricted stock shares or units performance stock shares or units phantom stock shares stock appreciation rights and other performance driven incentives for individual or corporate achievements typically earned over more than one year the definition of non compete provision also excludes provisions ontained within or executed contemporaneously with an agreement between the seller of a business and one or more buyers of that business wherein the seller agrees not to compete with the buyer s business employers are permitted to enter into non competes with highly compensated employees under certain conditions the amendment would permit non compete provisions for highly compensated employees highly compensated employees are defined as those who are reasonably expected to earn from the employer in a consecutive 12 month period compensation greater than or equal to the minimum qualifying annual compensation or hose compensation earned from the employer in the consecutive 12 month period preceding the date on which the proposed term of non competition is to begin is greater than or equal to the minimum qualifying annual compensation minimum qualifying annual compensation for highly compensated employees is defined as 150 000 except for medical specialists essentially licensed physicians who are primarily engaged in the delivery of medical services and who have completed their medical residency in which case the compensation minimum is 250 000 these amounts are subject to annual adjustments to reflect increases in the consumer price index notably compensation is broadly defined to include all monetary remuneration an employer may pay or promise an employee the amendment specifies that compensation includes hourly wages salary bonuses or cash incentives commissions overtime premiums vested stock including restricted stock units and other payments provided on a regular or irregular basis however compensation does not include fringe benefits other than those paid to the employee in cash or cash equivalents the amendment also imposes certain requirements for a highly compensated employee s non compete to be enforceable specifically the agreement must be in writing and provided to the employee t least 14 days before the individual commences employment for the employer or f the employer already employs the highly compensated employee at least 14 days before the employee must execute the agreement and specify the functional scope of the competitive restriction including what services roles industry or competing

the online car dealer s shares are ignoring a spate of bad publicity lately what happened shares of carvana cvna 6 88 have bucked the broader market trend this week rising 20 4 from where they closed last friday according to data from s p global market intelligence the s p 500 is up only 2 2 over the same time frame there was no real good reason for the online car dealer to see such a strong response especially since its license to operate in illinois was suspended again not the first run in with regulators carvana has had it s had similar experiences in pennsylvania michigan and north carolina so what not being able to sell cars in a particular market is kind of a big thing for a car dealer and its stock was appropriately walloped as a result though it did recover and eventually eke out a gain for the day but the very next day carvana s shares were off to the races again surging 20 in one day there was no company specific news to account for the jump but carvana s stock is one of the most heavily shorted issues with the fly recently reporting its estimated short interest stood at over 40 that could rally meme stock traders who favor companies with big bets against them by piling into the stocks and buying up their shares they hope to trigger a short squeeze which would bid their prices up even higher as short sellers raced to cover their positions now what aside from run ins with regulators carvana is facing other pressures as well including elevated gas prices inflation rising interest rates and high new and used car prices an ongoing supply chain crisis that makes critical components for cars difficult to obtain also adds to the list of industry woes and has led many auto manufacturers to ship cars to dealers without computer chips for non safety related amenities carvana may also be having trouble securitizing its subprime loans on the market if a noted short seller is to be believed levfin insights contends it hasn t sold any such loans on the public markets this year which could indicate the car dealership is having difficulty finding buyers the steady drip of negative news about carvana and the auto industry generally has seen the e commerce company s stock price crater in 2022 shares are down 88 this year and sit 93 below their 52 week highs

welcome to the ir team and your first earnings call and good morning everyone thanks for joining us for our second quarter call we had an outstanding quarter revenues were up 31 reaching a record high and earnings per share were 2 57 card member spending was at record levels billed business was up 30 from a year earlier on an fx adjusted basis led by a vigorous rebound in travel and entertainment spending and continued strong growth in goods and services we added 3 2 million new proprietary cards in the quarter driven by continued strong demand for our fee based premium products acquisitions of our u s consumer platinum gold and delta co brand cards were all at record highs customer retention and credit quality both remain at exceptionally strong levels while our strong growth may be somewhat surprising given the uncertainties in the external environment there are a number of reasons for our continued momentum first the decisions we made through the pandemic continue to pay dividends at the outset we made it a priority to be there for our customers focusing on delivering great service providing financial relief programs expanding our shop small initiatives and injecting new value into our premium consumer and business products with benefits that were relevant for the times we then ramped up investments early in the recovery to rebuild our momentum and grow our customer base refreshing our premium products through a series of new benefits that enhanced our generational relevance and we accelerated our acquisition engine these decisions lay the foundation for the strength in customer retention engagement and acquisitions that you ve seen over the past year and our results today other key factors driving our performance include the many competitive advantages that we have that differentiate us as well as several structural shifts and some near term recovery tailwinds which you remember we discussed at our investor day a critical competitive advantage is our global premium customer base which is at scale unrivaled in the industry with millions of high spending super prime loyal consumer and business customers across generations and geographies importantly millennials and gen z consumers are a large part of our existing customer base and our fastest growing age cohort making up 60 of all new consumer card members we re acquiring and around 75 of new u s consumer platinum and gold card members our new customers have excellent credit profiles are highly engaged in the premium benefits that come with american express membership and are spending more from the start of their relationship with us than previous newcomers giving us a long runway for growth in fact spending by this age group grew 48 in the second quarter significantly outpacing other generations our momentum is also being aided by several structural shifts which we believe give us significant opportunities to sustain our growth across all lines of business over the longer term these include the growth in the premium consumer card space around the world the ongoing increase in online commerce and digital engagement among consumers the strong pace of small business creation and the acceleration in the digitization digitizing of commercial payments finally in the near term we re benefiting from recovery tailwinds in our businesses outside the u s in the large and global corporate space and in travel and entertainment the travel rebound in particular has been faster and stronger than anyone expected total t e spending exceeded pre pandemic levels in april for the first time it was at 108 of 2019 levels for the quarter led by strong growth in global consumer and sme spending and a significant uptick in large and global corporate travel and we don t see demand in the t e categories declining significantly anytime soon based on the strength of future bookings coming through our consumer travel agency and the trends our partners in the travel industry like delta are experiencing particularly in the premium space of course we are wary of the uncertainties in the current economic environment and the impact it s having on our business the historically low unemployment rate is a positive factor as it s helping to drive our strong credit metrics and we continue to see no significant signs of stress in our consumer base inflation is a bit of a mixed bag it s a modest contributor to our strong growth in volumes but inflation when combined with low unemployment also puts pressure on operating costs for example like everyone else we re seeing intense competition for the best talent but because our colleagues are a key driver of our success we continue to invest in talent which is having an impact on our operating expenses looking forward as i ve emphasized many times before we run the company for the long term and our investment strategy is grounded in this principle as we sit here today we have an abundance of great opportunities and we ll continue to make our decisions with a longer term view like we did during the pandemic that means we will continue to invest at high levels in those areas that will drive sustainable growth including our brand value propositions customers colleagues technology and coverage we remain confident that the successful execution of this strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10 and mid teens eps growth in 2024 and beyond thank you and i ll now turn it over to jeff jeff campbell chief financial officer well thank you steve and good morning everyone good to be here to talk about our second quarter results which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan starting with our summary financials on slide 2 most importantly our second quarter revenues were 13 4 billion up 33 on an fx adjusted basis strengthening sequentially from last quarter s already strong 31 year over year growth rate our reported second quarter net income was 2 billion with earnings per share of 2 57 now as i said last quarter given that year over year comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the volatility that the pandemic caused in credit reserve adjustments we are including pre tax pre provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter which we believe gives you additional insight into the trends of our underlying earnings on this basis second quarter pre tax pre provision income was 3 billion up 27 versus the same time period last year so now let s get into a more detailed look at our results beginning with volumes turning on slide 3 you can see the continued momentum in spending from our strong customer base that steve noted earlier billed business and total network volumes were up around 30 year over year on an fx adjusted basis in the second quarter we feel really good about both our year over year growth as well as our sequential growth the second quarter saw us achieving our highest ever level of quarterly billed business and if you were to compare to 2019 the first quarter grew 15 while the second quarter growth rate accelerated even further to 28 importantly our spending volumes strengthened as we went through the quarter with the month of june also reaching a new monthly record high and as we sit here today this momentum has continued into early july now i would point out that when you think about year over year growth rates volumes in 2021 were of course in a steep phase of recovery as the year progressed so i do expect that our year over year growth rates will moderate as we progress through the rest of 2022 our spending metrics are being driven by both sustained growth in goods and services spending and by an acceleration in t e recovery in the second quarter starting first with goods and services spending on slide 4 we saw a year over year growth of 18 in the second quarter we are now multiple quarters into seeing the effects of the structural shift in online commerce spending patterns which is accelerated by the pandemic with our growth rates remaining steady specifically online and card not present spending grew 15 in the second quarter in contrast total t e spending as you see on slide 5 showed an acceleration in its recovery this quarter even more than we and many others would have expected reaching 108 of 2019 levels the high demand for travel will be a steep recovery across all customer types this strength in both goods and services and t e spending is also evident as we break spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses with a few other key points that i d suggest you take away first beginning on slide 6 millennial and gen z customers continue to drive our highest global consumer billed business growth with their spending up 48 year over year i d also call out that this quarter all other age cohorts have now reached pre pandemic levels of t e spending including baby boomers who had been slower to recover in our commercial business on slide 7 spending from our small and medium sized enterprise clients continue to drive our overall growth with spending up 25 year over year while a smaller part of our business it is worth noting the significant acceleration in growth of 58 of the large and global corporate customers significantly above last quarter s growth rate this is a sign of a more meaningful business travel recovery so overall we are pleased that our strength in spending volumes has exceeded our original expectations for the year and again this quarter the majority of our high level of growth was driven by the number of transactions flowing through our network with some modest additional impact from inflation this positions us well for our long term growth aspirations moving on now to receivable and loan balances on slide 8 we saw a good sequential growth in our loan balances which are now well above pre pandemic levels this quarter the interest bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to consistently increase quarter over quarter but remains a bit below 2019 levels as paydown rates have remained elevated as you then turn to credit and provision on slides 9 through 11 the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our extremely strong credit performance card member loans and receivables write off and delinquency rates remain well below pre pandemic levels and though they did continue to tick up slightly overall this quarter as we expected they are trending a bit better than our expectations when we started the year turning then to the accounting for this credit performance on slide 10 as you know there are a couple of key drivers of provision expense first actionable credit performance which as we just discussed is extremely strong and second changes in credit reserves under the cecl methodology we built a small amount of reserves this quarter as our loan balances grew and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our cecl models got slightly worse relative to the outlook back in q1 both partially offset by improved portfolio quality this reserve build combined with our low net write offs drove 410 million of provision expense for the second quarter as you see on slide 11 we ended the second quarter with 3 2 billion of reserves representing 3 1 of our loan balances and 0 2 of our card member receivable balances respectively this remains well below the reserve levels we had pre pandemic going forward we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time but to remain well below pre pandemic levels this year i do expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter given our expected loan growth but the overall range and timing of reserve adjustments will be heavily influenced by how the macroeconomic outlook evolves between now and the end of the year moving next to revenue on slide 12 total revenues were up 31 year over year in the second quarter or 33 on an fx adjusted basis as we continue to see a stronger u s dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which we operate overall these results were above our original expectations before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that service fees and other revenue was up sharply at 79 growth year over year largely driven by the uptick in travel related revenues that accelerated this quarter with cross border spend in particular surpassing pre pandemic levels our largest revenue line discount revenue grew 32 year over year in q2 on an fx adjusted basis as you can see on slide 13 driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and the accelerated t e recovery that you saw in our spending trends net card fee revenues were up 19 year over year in the second quarter on an fx adjusted basis with growth continuing to accelerate as you can see on slide 14 largely driven by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee paying products as a result of the investments we ve made in our premium value propositions this quarter we acquired 3 2 million new cards with acquisitions of u s consumer platinum card numbers again reaching a record high and increasing 20 above last quarter s record levels demonstrating the great demand we re seeing especially for our premium fee based products moving on to net interest income on slide 15 you can see that it was up 31 year over year on an fx adjusted basis accelerating above last quarter s growth rate due to the continued recovery of our revolving loan balances looking forward while i would expect our loan balances to continue to recover at higher growth rates the rising rate environment will likely cause our net interest income growth rate to slow given our sizable non interest bearing charge balances to sum up on revenues on slide 16 we re seeing continued strong results and sustained momentum across the board so looking forward we now expect to see revenue growth of 23 to 25 for the full year of 2022 so the revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we ve made in our brand value propositions customers colleagues technology and coverage and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide 17 starting with variable customer engagement expenses these costs came in as expected at 42 of total revenues for the quarter and are tracking with our expectations for variable customer engagement costs to run at around 42 of total revenues on a full year basis on the marketing line we invested 1 5 billion in the second quarter we feel really good about the strong demand for new card acquisitions as we showed on slide 14 more importantly we feel good about the spend credit and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing in to american express membership which continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre pandemic i would now expect to spend a little over 5 billion on marketing in 2022 moving to the bottom of slide 17 brings us to operating expenses which were 3 3 billion in the second quarter there s often some quarterly volatility in this number due to the varied timing of certain accruals and entries this quarter for example we see the impact of the prior year including a sizable benefit from net mark to market gains in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio as i said last quarter and as steve discussed earlier inflation while driving some modest positive impact on volumes it s also putting pressure on our operating expenses particularly in our compensation costs taking everything into account we now expect our full year operating expenses to be around 13 billion as we invest in our talented colleague base technology and other key underpinnings of our growth given our tremendously high levels of revenue growth turning next to capital on slide 18 we returned 1 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter including common stock repurchases of 611 million and 394 million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation our cet1 ratio was 10 3 at the end of the second quarter within our target range of 10 to 11 we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth given the concerns about the macro economy and the market it is worth noting that in the fed s ccar stress test results released last month american express was again one of the few firms that remained cumulatively profitable under the fed s macroeconomic stress scenario and we had the highest profit margin as a percentage of assets of any participating bank that brings me to our growth plan and 2022 guidance on slide 19 our performance year to date and our full year guidance reinforce several points that steve and i have now both discussed first and most importantly we clearly have momentum across all of the areas critical for us to drive sustained high levels of revenue growth including customer acquisition engagement and retention evidenced by our strong q2 results inflation is additionally providing some modest benefit to our revenues the combination of all of these things led us to increase our expectations for full year revenue growth to 23 to 25 up from our original range of 18 to 20 for now though our eps guidance remains unchanged from between 9 25 and 9 65 let me walk you through our thinking here as i talked about earlier we feel really good about the strong results generated by our marketing investments this year and that s why we now expect to spend a little over 5 billion for the full year modestly above our original expectations both steve and i also talked about the fact that there are some pressures on our operating expenses particularly around compensation and partially fueled by inflation and therefore we now expect our operating expenses to be around 13 billion this year lastly and most importantly as we think about our eps this year as i talked about in the credit section while our credit performance and metrics remain extremely healthy we can t predict how the macroeconomic outlook will evolve that makes it difficult sitting here today to predict a precise range of outcomes for any potential cecl reserve adjustments for the balance of the year that said should the macroeconomic outlook not change meaningfully between now and the end of the year and therefore not have a large impact on current reserves in the balance of the year we would expect to be at or even a bit above the high end of our eps guidance range in any environment we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10 and mid teens eps growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond with that i ll turn the call back over to kerri to open up the call for your questions kerri bernstein head of investor relations thanks jeff thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator questions answers operator our first question comes from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead ryan nash goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everyone maybe just to start on revenue growth steve so it s obviously coming in much better than expected and you re choosing to invest more to propel future growth so i was just hoping maybe you can just talk a little bit about the additional investments that you re making across the company whether it s in opex or in card member engagement how much of this is offensive versus to drive revenue growth versus defensive and then given the acceleration of investments that we re seeing through 22 could this position us for better revenue growth in the intermediate time frame steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer so i think everything that we re doing here is offensive i mean you could argue that raising compensation is defensive but i think you re going to you ve seen compensation being raised across so if i break out the categories you re going to see opex up and you see an opex up for two reasons number one we are investing a little bit more in from an operating perspective but that investment the main investment from an operating perspective is you can t grow your billings 30 and with the majority of those billings being grown by 30 by more transactions without having more people to be able to serve your customers to be able to engage with them from a travel perspective and you have to remember one of the huge differentiating factors that we have in our business model is our ability to serve our customers when and where they need to be served and as you get more and more transactions as you get more and more customers you do have this step function increase and so a lot of our operating expense growth has been done has been to the addition of people which is not maybe a popular topic right now that people are talking about but we re adding people we re not subtracting people from our business and we re adding people to make sure that we can continue the level of service that we had and i don t mind doing that especially in a growth environment which is what we re expecting look you re also seeing wage increase and you have to pay more to keep your best talent and so we will do that that is shortsighted not to do that and we will continue to do that from a marketing perspective i ve been doing this for a number of years now and one of the things that you hear us say is we have lots and lots of good investment opportunities and to let those investment opportunities go by the board because we thought we might have spent 5 billion but maybe it will be 5 2 billion whatever that s shortsighted because we re running the company for the longer term so i would say that the investments that we re making and additional investments in technology are truly all longer all thinking about the long term here as far as revenue goes for next year look we re building up momentum but i think when we came out and said we were going to grow 18 to 20 this year there was probably some skepticism and now we re coming out and saying we re going to go 23 to 25 which is going to put the level of revenue at the end of this year obviously higher than what we thought we have a plan to get us to in 2024 at 10 plus revenue growth on a sustainable basis which means in 2023 we ll certainly exceed 10 what that number will actually be i don t know sitting here right now i don t know but i can tell you it will be on our growth trajectory and as long as we have good revenue opportunities and as long as we can continue to grow this business i will continue to invest and that s where we are and as jeff said we ve decided not to and i think it s really important we ve decided not to raise our earning our eps guidance because of the uncertainty with cecl which quite honestly we don t have a lot of control over and so for us to sit here today and say hey look let s just raise it to then come back in the third quarter or the fourth quarter and say hey we had to drop it it s just it s fool hearted but the revenue it s what we see and so when we re asked questions about what do you think about the economy and you see a slowdown if i was thinking there was a slowdown in the next couple of quarters i wouldn t be sitting here raising revenue to 23 to 25 so that s how i think about it operator the next question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani keefe bruyette and woods analyst thanks good morning t e was a big driver of the upside and i think jeff you mentioned there s been further strength in july which makes sense given we re moving into the heart of the summer months are you guys concerned this is sort of a pull forward and you see a slowdown thereafter and maybe that ties into what we saw in corporate t e because that also moved up quite a bit where do you think the new normal shakes out steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer so if you look at where we are right now and yes we re at 100 we re at 8 growth over 2019 and that s not really a big number when you think about it when you think about 8 growth over 2019 from a t e perspective and you think about sort of airline prices you think about some of the inflation built in i d say there s more room to run on t e and when you disaggregate sort of t e and you look at it and you see that the consumer is running sort of 38 above and you ve got international consumer running only 8 above and you got sme running probably 8 above and corporate travel is only 60 of what it was in 2019 i wouldn t call out a pull forward and when i look at my bookings my future bookings in my consumer business they re strong and then when you get then you sort of disaggregate and you go below those numbers and you look and you say ok what s really driving it and you see a tremendous growth right we re seeing a tremendous growth like 48 growth in restaurant lodging is huge airline is way up but lodging and airlines are still below 2019 levels in aggregate so and the airline industry is probably only about 85 90 of their capacity and they have some staffing issues and what have you and they re sort of canceling so i don t think this is a pull forward at all i think there s a huge pent up demand obviously to get out and travel and see the world or see anybody at this particular point in time but no i m not really concerned about a pullback because i don t think we ve gotten to a normal level yet i really don t believe we ve gotten to a normal level of t e so now we re going to see 90 year over year growth rates no but i look at absolute aggregate numbers and i can t get too focused on just the growth rates we re not at a normal level of t e yet in our business operator the next question is coming from betsy graseck of morgan stanley please go ahead betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning yes it s really great great results here i wanted to dig in a little bit on how you re thinking about the loan growth on the sme side i know that s been accelerating here just give us a sense as to where pockets of opportunity are and how you would flex if there was a slowdown steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer look we re our stated goal for our sme business is be the working capital provider for small businesses and so i think that what we re trying to do is to be able to provide liquidity to them using cards we ve got some short term working capital loans we ve got some shorter term term loans and they re taking advantage of it but i ll send you back to the pandemic i mean when you look at our small business base i think everybody was really concerned about how stressed this was because or how stressed this could be because of what the perception is the makeup of small businesses and i ve said this over and over again when people think about small businesses they think about restaurants and they think about small retail on main street and it s much more than that and so i think that and you saw how we performed i mean our credit metrics performed brilliantly through the pandemic and we ve always grown in the last few years a little bit well pre pandemic we ve always grown faster than the market we have a very low share of our small businesses lending volume relative to their spending volume i mean we probably have over 40 of their spending volume but 40 of the spending level but we have less than maybe 20 of the land so there is opportunity and we will go after this opportunity the same way we go after everything else in a very measured analytical and risk adjusted way and so we re not trying to grow crazily we are just providing our customers with what they need having said that i think you ve seen our ability to pivot and if need be we will pivot again but what i do really love about our small business base not only that it continues to grow but it is so diverse across so many different types of industries and that s really really really important operator our next question is coming from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead bob napoli william blair and company analyst thank you good morning and also congratulations on the super strong numbers really great to see i guess maybe a question on network coverage one of your key areas of focus and incremental investment and just maybe any update on how you re performing versus your plan on network expansion either kind of obviously international seems like where you have the most opportunity from a network expansion any thoughts on or any metrics you can give on international and your thoughts on where your coverage should be internationally over the long term steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer yes look i mean from a u s perspective we continue to remain in parity coverage and as we virtual parity coverage and as we said it doesn t mean you re not going to run into somebody that doesn t accept the card now and again but usually it s when we do that we re able to sign them up because it s sort of old news in terms of what the rates are and how we and so forth so i m not really can i should say i m not concerned about the u s but i like where we are in the u s and i like our approach to the u s from international i think we ve been really really really clear we ve been focusing on priority cities and continuing to drive those numbers higher and those continue to do well we ve probably signed well over 3 million merchants this year which is i think we re on pace to sign as many as we did last year from an international perspective and we ll continue to provide information not on a quarterly basis but on an as needed basis to show you that the progress that we re making but we re really pleased with the progress that we re making in our priority cities and that doesn t mean we re not focused on signing every merchant that doesn t accept the card we do but we think it s more important to sign those merchants where card members actually are and that s why the priority cities and the priority countries are so important for us and we feel really good about it and you only have to look at the international spending to say is it really working and when you look at sort of our international spending this year it s up higher than our consumer spending year over year for this quarter so it s a big driver for growth for us operator the next question is coming from mark devries of barclays please go ahead mark devries barclays analyst thanks i had a question for steve about the 48 growth in millennials and gen zs i assume it s normal for the younger generations to have stronger growth just as a combination of what i assume are kind of stronger new account acquisitions and also just the ramping of spend as they age and their incomes grow can you give us a sense of what the breakdown is in that 48 between new account acquisition and then actual organic spend on an individual account basis i know you indicated that they are spending more than previous newcomers but any sense of kind of dimensionalizing that how that compares and then just finally on comparing across the different cohorts kind of how what your market share is for these newer cohorts compared to gen x and boomers at points in their age steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer yes so we don t really get into all of that either in our release or talk about but let me give you a couple of points when we look at sort of how we re getting card member spending we really look at share of wallet share of wallet is really important for us and from millennials and gen zs we re getting a higher share of their wallets off the bat that s key because what happens is with a lot of our boomers and so forth and especially our boomers they were used to an american express that was accepted in a limited universe our gen z and our millennials are used to an american express that s really accepted everywhere and so we re able to penetrate their wallets more right out of the gate because number one they re more card savvy and they tend to use no cash and they re more value proposition savvy and they tend to figure out how to utilize the card in the best way for them and so we re getting a higher percentage of their wallet as they grow as their wallets grow as they progress through life our aim is to continue to keep that wallet share and that s a big deal plus as you acquire gen zs and millennials they tend to have a longer runway for tenure with the card product as far as the 48 growth and breaking it out sort of i mean really what you re asking for is same store sales versus new store sales i don t really have that at the tip of my fingertips here jeff campbell chief financial officer yes we don t disclose the exact numbers mark but we do pull it apart just like you described and we certainly have made the point that a disproportionate share of our new account acquisitions are going to that millennial and gen z demographic but then when you break out just to steve s raised the same store sales it is also the fastest growing demographic on a same store sales basis so both contribute both the same store sales effect and the fact that they are disproportionate and our new customers operator the next question is coming from dominick gabriele of oppenheimer please go ahead dominick gabriele oppenheimer and company analyst hey great thank you so much obviously you re reporting incredibly strong recovery spending numbers if you just think about the spending cycle and inflation boosting nominal pce versus real pce how should we think about the effects on your high end consumer base versus the average u s consumer in terms of their susceptibility to a spending slowdown and perhaps why could this customer base that you have act differently versus the average consumer in the next spending cycle and i m just talking about total spending if you if that works steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer well i think the simple answer is they have more money but when you look at sort of what s going on in the economy and the stock market going up and down we ve never really been tied to that i mean and i ve been here for forever right 35 years or so and i ve never seen a correlation between that what i have seen a correlation between is sort of unemployment and people losing their jobs and not being able to pay their bills and so that s potentially an issue down the road but we re in a very crazy sort of environment and jeff called this out in his own remarks i mean we ve got high inflation and low unemployment and it s actually hard to hire people right now and so yes you re seeing some layoffs and some companies talking about slowing down their hiring and things like that but it s not broad based and it s not broad scale at this particular point in time and so i think as far as i look at this the cohort that we have which is a small segment right of the u s population but a very powerful segment of the u s population you would have to see a huge credit crunch driven by unemployment i think for this cohort to be hit the other thing i would say is when we pull apart our numbers this spending is not inflation driven and that s not to say there s not inflation in these numbers but you have to remember that coming out at the end of last year when no one wanted to talk about it we had inflation in those numbers last year so whether you look at 8 or 9 sort of spending inflation out there in the environment it s not an 8 8 or 9 benefit to our business because you do have a grow over but the most important thing for us is we re seeing an increase in transactions and that s what s really driving our growth right now is an increase in overall transactions in our business and that s an important indicator for us we look at not only transactions but we look at transaction size and then we look at that transaction size a little bit on a normalized basis as you take the effects of inflation out and we ve got real growth when you do that jeff campbell chief financial officer yes the only thing i d add is that we have said consistently a modest level of inflation and i d still use the word modest for where we are absent a spike in unemployment like steve said is generally net a positive thing for our business it helps revenues a little bit it puts a little pressure on cost but it nets to a positive and as long as the labor market stays where it is that s why we feel pretty good about the guidance we ve given you for the rest of the year operator the next question is coming from bill carcache of wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache wolfe research analyst thank you good morning steve and jeff could you speak to how much the competitive environment for high spending customers has intensified post pandemic particularly as other issuers look to compete beyond cash rewards to provide their customers with greater experiential value by investing in things like airline lounges travel portals and the like and then i guess more specifically on if i may just squeeze in on the acceleration in spending among large global corporates could you discuss which products are enjoying the greatest uplift there steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean this environment has been a highly competitive environment since the financial crisis and it hasn t really changed yes i mean us in more things i mean we ve all raised the price of poker here a little bit but we figure our competitors will continue to invest we figure that our competitors will copy what we re doing and that s why it s important for us to stay ahead and so has it intensified i mean we just work under the assumption it s a highly competitive environment and it will remain a highly competitive environment and you re really talking about the u s consumer segment but you ve got high competition in small business you ve got high competition in various markets you ve got high competition in corporate card but what we strive to do is put the best products and services out there and that s worked out pretty well for us and so yes it requires a little bit more investment it requires investment across the board but in the long run i think you just have to look at the results and right now we re acquiring more cards than we ve ever acquired but we ve said this before what s really important for us is that we re looking to acquire revenues and we re looking to acquire billed business we talk in terms of cards but those cards are generating new billed business and generating revenue for us obviously because we re raising our revenue guidance as far as corporate i m not sure i really understand the question all that much but we only have a corporate card so and yes companies are spending but we re only at 60 our t e is only at 60 and jeff where are we overall on corporate card spending i don t know jeff campbell chief financial officer it s a little higher because the travel never went down as much so the overall number is at about closer to 80 pre pandemic steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer so but we re not back yet but you re seeing pockets of it and consultants are back out there on the road and bankers are back out there on the road and i think people are having a lot more meetings i know we had one in june and it was hard to get conference room space for like 100 or 150 people and even looking to book for next year for the same type of meeting boy people are out there booking a year year and a half in advance and i think that s good for the lodging business it s good for the airline business it s good for us so that s kind of where it is operator the next question is coming from lisa ellis of moffetnathanson please go ahead lisa ellis moffetnathanson analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question steve and jeff you ve commented earlier on some of the near term investments that you re making given the strong growth in top line you re seeing in wages and marketing etc can you also comment a bit perhaps on some of the longer term investments that you re leaning in on kind of taking advantage of the strong growth in the business to be able to lean in and position amex even better for the next sort of three to five years steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer yes well i mean we re always making there s always the balance between long term investments and short term investments and we don t talk a lot about the long term investments until they actually happen but you have to invest in your technology and we ve done that and i ve talked about that before because we ve been one of the only companies that have said we re not taking step function changes in our technology investment because we ve been investing in technology all along we re constantly investing in value proposition and when people look at that and we sit here on the phone here and we talk about it like ok so what are you going to do to the platinum card well it s not the platinum card it s the 29 proprietary countries that we operate in the small business cards that we operate in those countries and the corporate cards we operate in those countries and the co brand cards we operate in those countries and the personal cards green gold platinum and so we re constantly investing and i think we use the platinum card in the u s either business or personal as a proxy for our overall investment and that s not it because we re investing in all our card products across the globe on an ongoing basis you can t have product refreshes by just snapping your fingers and saying hey we re going to have a product refresh this is months and months and months in the making and negotiations and partnerships and so forth but look we continue to invest in our lounge program we continue to look at those things that add more value i mean you ve seen the expansion of things that we ve done whether it s checking accounts and debit cards for our consumers and our small businesses and what we re trying to do is to create more stickiness and more reason to interact with american express on an ongoing basis i mean just look at sort of how the services around our card products have evolved over the last few years whether that be from a small business perspective where we can meet a wide variety of reworking capital needs banking needs and so forth and then look at it from a consumer perspective and look at what we ve done with resi with over 30 million registered users on resi and we have cards on file a huge acquisition so we ll continue to make those longer term investments but you ll continue to hear about them as they happen operator the next question is coming from moshe orenbuch of credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch credit suisse analyst great thanks and steve certainly note your comments that you re not anticipating a recession in the next couple of quarters given what you re seeing in your customer base but could you just talk conceptually about how you think about account acquisition in terms of kind of new accounts a high level of new accounts obviously industry as a whole is still doing that but clearly less seasoned accounts are the ones that always would carry somewhat more risk and maybe talk about the things you do to kind of mitigate that or steps you would take if you saw that and the rates start to rise jeff campbell chief financial officer well let me maybe start moshe by just reminding everyone of the highly analytical process we have for determining who we bring into membership in the franchise and it s based on searching for that premium customer whether they are a consumer or a small business it s based on the vast amounts of data and history we have and it s based on having very high financial cutoffs for who we allow into the franchise or not and when you look at the outcome of that process right now we are on average bringing in new customers who have higher credit qualities than when we saw pre pandemic in 2019 who are showing much higher spending profiles and who are also carrying balances at a greater rate so we feel really good about the people we re bringing into the franchise and as you ve heard steve and i and doug and others talk about we also always when we bring people in model their results assuming there will be a recession i don t know when there will be a recession but there wealthy and so we build a through the cycle view of the economics right into our upfront calculation of whether we think it s a good idea or not to bring a given customer into the franchise at a given level of marketing spend steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer yes and the other thing i d say is that changes that can change daily that can change weekly those criteria could change monthly it all depends on how we re looking at and what our models are showing and what we re feeling the other reality is we could lower our thresholds spend even a lot more money but there s that balance that you have and that balance of making sure that we re growing the bottom line is in an appropriate fashion and also making sure that we have a higher quality consumer and small business as part of our franchise but it is something that s been developed over many many years and it s not static i mean i think that s the key point this thing is not static and we continue to adjust it and modify it jeff campbell chief financial officer steve the other thing i would add and i m going to quote you is we run the company for the long term we make these decisions on a through the cycle basis there will be a recession at some point i don t know when but the thing about recessions is they re always followed by a recovery and we re running the company to achieve the highest possible sustainable level of long term growth and we think that the process we have and the analytics we have for bringing people into the franchise are very consistent with that operator the next question is coming from chris donat of piper sandler please go ahead chris donat piper sandler analyst good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to dig try to dig a little deeper on the travel and entertainment recovery and the slide 23 you had and revisit the question of a possible pull forward i heard the commentary around bookings and so that seems good for visibility for airlines and lodging what i m wondering about is should there be any reason to be concerned around restaurant spending which has been really strong and is restaurant spending highly correlated with lodging and airlines so maybe we don t need to worry about it or just if you re seeing anything that could be a cause for concern and maybe future pullback in restaurants steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer the only thing i would say is that if restaurant spending is really highly correlated with lodging and airlines you re going to expect it to go up but i think look i mean anybody that s been to a restaurant prices are a little bit higher because they re they got wages and they got fluid costs and so forth but look from my perspective restaurants really sort of a lot of them change their business models during the pandemic because restaurants that weren t doing takeout do take out and so people are eating out a lot more and they re spending more time at restaurants and ordering for restaurants so no i really don t think it s highly correlated at all and in fact if you took restaurant out and we just said travel and travel being defined as car rental lodging and air we re not back yet right what s pulling t e over the finish line here to go past that 2019 is truly restaurants so if anything as people travel more you might see more restaurant spending and the other side of that is well you won t see more restaurant spending because now lead to different locations so i don t think it s i don t think a pullback here will really hurt restaurants all that much operator the next question is coming from rick shane of j p morgan please go ahead rick shane j p morgan analyst thanks guys for taking my question when i think about the numbers two things stand out one is the loan growth and the other is obviously the strong penetration for millennial and gen z card growth i am curious if as millennials and gen z customers are taking cards if those are being delivered with additional features enabled on borrow or are there behavioral factors that are causing your younger demographic to borrow more jeff campbell chief financial officer well maybe i ll start steve so first we have moved over the last couple of years rick to add to the majority of our charge products a pay over time capability for existing card members that phases in in a variety of ways for new card members that capability is on as it is as they get the card so i do think that has some impact on our results there also is a demographic feature as i talked about earlier if you look at who we re bringing into the franchise now and there is a skew toward the millennials and gen zs they are higher spending higher credit quality and there is a propensity to carry balances that is a little higher than what we see in the older demographic steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer yes and they also tend to use our pay and plan it feature a little bit more which is and i ll use these words buy now pay later but on the back end as opposed to a point of sale i mean they can go on to their statement and decide look for this particular charge i m going to pay it in six installments and i m going to pay it at 100 a month but i m going to pay the rest of my balance in full so i think that ability of looking at your statement deciding which things you might want to pay in an installment deciding which thing you might want to use pay with points to pay deciding which thing you may want to revolve and then deciding which things you want to pay in full is a pretty good feature of the product and so when you look at meeting somebody s entire payment needs that kind of does it in one stop shopping operator the next question is coming from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions i wanted to ask a little bit about just longer term right i mean i appreciate your comments about making investments now while the opportunity is available but i was wondering just longer term for example in 2023 you ve guided to longer higher than longer term revenue growth in 2023 so will that also translate in higher than long term eps growth or higher than long term ppnr growth or is there just so much white space available for you just the amount of growth opportunity that 2023 could also be another big investment year just trying to understand how you balance that all this revenue upside you see versus the investment opportunities available to you jeff campbell chief financial officer well i can t resist my start by pointing out that yes steve and i talked a lot about the heavy investments that we re making this year we re also growing our pre tax pre provision profit by 27 this quarter in line with the 31 revenue growth look as steve said earlier we ll have to see i think we feel really good about the revenue momentum we have and so just mathematically given our long term sustainable goals and a steady state environment for 2024 and beyond i expect to be above that easily above the 10 level on revenue growth next year how much don t know we ll have to see and that provides a pretty darn good platform for good earnings growth all that said it s only july 22 we haven t given you specific guidance for next year and the wildcard from a gaap eps perspective in all this is the volatility that you ve seen so much of in the last 10 quarters in the cecl credit reserves because we have good i think visibility and beliefs about the trajectory of our own business but the consensus macroeconomic forecast and how it evolves is going to have a big influence on what we book for credit reserves steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer but just think of how those two numbers that jeff threw out 31 revenue growth and 27 ppnr growth would you have felt better if it was 32 and we decided not to invest i wouldn t and i think what s really important and i ll take you back to investor day this is a flywheel scale is important scale begets more scale and not crazy scale but scale with premium card members from a small business perspective and a consumer perspective that merchants want to see and merchants want to provide value to which continues that strength in the flywheel and that s one thing as you know we talked about do you see more competition the one thing that is really really hard to replicate and we haven t used these words but this enclosed cycle that we have otherwise known as the famous closed loop the ability to have those merchants and have those card members and to be able to feed off one another from a value perspective is really really critical and the value that we re able to provide merchants with high spending card members and the value that those merchants are able to provide to our card members is really really important and so as we sit here and look at our business and look at it long term what s really important is that growth and that sustainable growth and again throw all the noise out around cecl and credit reserve releases and bills and so forth and if you focus on that number well 31 and 27 is pretty good and so we feel really good about the level of investment that we ve made in the business and quite honestly don t necessarily focus on any of those individual line items but focus on the aggregate in what it s driving and the value it s creating and if you re just going to measure value through a quarterly eps growth you re missing the point what you need to measure value is on how sustainable your business model is over the long term and all we re doing is enhancing our business model over the long term with these investments operator our final question will come from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead don fandetti wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning can you provide an update on b2b progress are you seeing small businesses accelerate their automation of accounts payable and also large corporates on the supplier side are they accepting more cards steve squeri chairman and chief executive officer the short answer is yes we don t we re not sharing all the statistics but small businesses continue when you look at our small business base probably over 8 of their spending is b2b spending versus t e spending and we continue to see acom pay go up for us our partnerships continue to yield more value we re seeing what jeff talked about it we re about 80 of where we were from a corporate card perspective but yet only 60 from a travel perspective so that s driven by more
