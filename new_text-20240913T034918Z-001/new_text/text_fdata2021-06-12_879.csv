fort lauderdale fla ap the gunman who stalked and then fatally shot a grandmother and her 1 year old grandson inside a florida supermarket had been threatening to kill people including children on his facebook page but no one reported him a florida sheriff said friday timothy j wall 55 had been making the threats for some time before he walked into a publix in royal palm beach on thursday stalked his victims in the produce aisle before first shooting the child and then the woman before killing himself palm beach county sheriff ric bradshaw and his detectives said detectives have found no connection between wall and the woman he has said i want to kill people and children he s got friends obviously they saw that his ex wife said that he has been acting strange he thinks he is being followed he s paranoid do you think a damn soul told us about that no bradshaw said at a press conference if it sounds like i m angry i am under florida s so called red flag law a law enforcement agency can seek an order from a judge to seize the firearms of anyone shown to be a danger to themselves or others and hold them for a year that can be extended if an agency shows the person is still a danger it was enacted in 2018 by the republican led legislature shortly after a former student with a history of mental and emotional problems killed 17 students and staff at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland less than an hour s drive from thursday s shooting facebook also allows users to report troubling posts and will forward them to law enforcement that s how this could have been prevented if somebody would have let us know who he is we would have contacted him seen if he has got a gun gotten him into mental health and you wouldn t have two people dead bradshaw said this didn t have to happen the ex wife s family told the palm beach post she did try to get wall help but no one listened he had mental issues he wasn t taking care of himself said maia knight wall s former sister in law my sister was going to the courthouse going to police telling everyone he needs help my sister was trying to help him but didn t know how the associated press isn t naming the ex wife to protect her privacy she did not return a call friday seeking comment wall s family released a statement to the associated press an attorney for the family said the relatives weren t interested in doing interviews and they were hoping reporters would stop trying to contract wall s elderly mother we are heartbroken at the loss of a child and a grandmother and of timothy s death the statement said we want to express our deepest condolences to the family of the young victim and his grandmother during this difficult time we ask that our family be given the time and respect to grieve and process this horrible tragedy we hope that the same respect will be given to the victims and their family members maj talal masri the lead detective said the 69 year old woman pushed her grandson into the store shortly after 11 a m thursday using a cart shaped like a race car so toddlers can play while the adult shops authorities have not released the victims names citing a state law that allows survivors to block their release about 20 minutes later wall arrived at the store on a red scooter he and his ex wife had previously owned a dry cleaner in the shopping center state records show but it is unknown when it closed video shows he had been inside both the publix and a nearby drugstore earlier in the morning and had approached people but then turned away masri said this time wall entered the publix using a golf putter as a walking stick he walked around for a few minutes before entering the produce section where the woman was shopping with her grandson still in the cart he followed them for about three minutes before he pulled a handgun and shot the child masri said the woman jumped on him and wall s gun briefly jammed she fell to the floor and he shot her and then himself all died at the scene the shooting sent dozens of employees and customers fleeing the store but no other injuries were reported wall had been in financial and personal disarray for years before the shooting earlier this year wall had declared bankruptcy in his filing he listed 6 000 in assets including 9 in checking 18 in savings 4 100 in a stock trading account 740 in bitcoin and a 300 gun he said he earned 24 000 last year as a laborer working through a temp agency and his mode of transportation was the 600 scooter he rode to the killings meanwhile he had accumulated more than 215 000 in debts most of it owed on the home his ex wife now owns the bankruptcy file shows she divorced him in 2018 and he had signed over their house to her in 2019 palm beach county court records show no previous criminal record for wall could be found wall s bankruptcy lawyer ryan loyacano did not return a call and an email seeking comment publix is florida s largest grocery chain and has more than 1 200 stores in the southern united states the company said in a thursday statement that it was cooperating with law enforcement the sheriff s office said the supermarket would be closed

texas gov greg abbott signed a heartbeat bill into law in may barring abortions in the state as early as six weeks it went into effect on sept 1 update the supreme court voted 5 4 to deny an emergency appeal from abortion providers and reproductive rights groups to block the texas heartbeat act or senate bill 8 sb 8 the bill which went into effect on sept 1 bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected chief justice john roberts dissented along with the high court s three liberal justices justice sonia sotomayor justice elena kagan and justice stephen g breyer each of the four dissenting justices wrote separate statements expressing their disagreement with the majority previous update on sept 1 the texas heartbeat act also known as senate bill 8 sb 8 went into effect the bill bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected sb 8 differs from previous abortion bills passed in texas because the state s top attorney won t enforce it the public will the bill states this law will be exclusively enforced through private civil action several reproductive rights groups including the aclu and planned parenthood filed an emergency request with the u s supreme court asking it to block sb 8 on aug 30 kvue reports the filing comes after the fifth circuit court of appeals denied the plaintiffs request on aug 29 to block the law the supreme court has yet to act on an emergency appeal to put the law on hold previous report on may 19 texas governor greg abbott signed into law the texas heartbeat act also known as senate bill 8 sb 8 which bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected in an email verify viewer cassie said she has recently been reading conflicting reports on whether or not the bill allows abortions in the case of rape or incest or if the mother s life is in danger the question does the new texas heartbeat bill senate bill 8 allow abortions in the case of rape incest or if the mother s life is in danger the sources the answer no the new texas heartbeat bill senate bill 8 does not allow abortions in the case of rape or incest but makes an exception if the mother s life is in danger what we found while senate bill 8 sb 8 does not mention allowing abortions in the case of rape or incest sec 171 205 does make an exception for medical emergency according to the bill a physician who performs or induces an abortion under medical emergency shall make written notations in the pregnant woman s medical record of the physician s belief that a medical emergency necessitated the abortion the physician must also make note of the pregnant woman s medical condition and maintain a copy of the notations made in the physician s practice records the new bill sb 8 does not allow an exception to the law for rape or incest and so if you are somebody who has been sexually assaulted or have been raped and you ve gotten pregnant as a result of that you will not be able to get an abortion after six weeks gestation in texas under this law drucilla tigner policy and advocacy strategist at the aclu of texas told verify there is an exception for what is called in the bill medical emergency which is kind of left up to the doctor to make that determination dr joe pojman executive director of texas alliance for life told verify that the pro life organization he founded in 1988 was adamant that there must be an exception included in sb 8 to allow a physician to terminate a pregnancy if the mother s life is in danger we have to have those exceptions for the life of the mother fortunately those cases are very rare with modern science but it could happen in the case of an ectopic in other words tubal pregnancy when the unborn child is developing not in the uterus of the mother but in a fallopian tube and if left unattended that fallopian tube could rupture the child will certainly die and it could risk the life of the mother through hemorrhaging so that has to be treated and the treatment is to take action to the end of pregnancy the intent of course is not to take the life of the child but to save the mother s life and an unintended result is that the child will die said dr pojman pojman says his organization did not recommend that the texas legislature include exceptions in the case of rape or incest we have to recognize that the terrible violent act of aggression of a rapist against a woman is an absolutely hideous act it s a bodily violation of that woman but the question is if in rare cases that that act results in the pregnancy of the woman what s the best thing for all parties involved and of course we re talking about the mother and the unborn child we do not think a compassionate society should advocate the death of the unborn child because of the terrible act of the father of the child that child is also an innocent victim just as the woman said pojman kelly hart the senior director of public affairs at planned parenthood of greater texas says sb 8 is unique in that the state of texas has decided to give up its enforcement authority and allow anyone including non texas residents to file a private lawsuit against anyone they believe helped a woman get an abortion we re not just talking about the doctors who provide the abortions we re talking about a counselor who gave a woman the phone number to an abortion health center we re talking about a friend who drove a person to get the abortion we re talking about another friend who loaned some money for that person to be able to afford the procedure hart told verify this is unique and dangerous basically allowing citizens who you know in most cases won t really know the medical history of the person and the people involved interfering with private medical decisions in this way sb 8 is currently facing opposition from licensed attorneys and licensed physicians in the state of texas prior to gov abbott s signage of the bill on may 19 both groups wrote open letters to the texas house of representatives to voice their concerns the bill which could be deemed unconstitutional due to the supreme court s roe v wade ruling in 1973 that legalized abortion in the u s is set to go into effect on sept 1 unless it is blocked by a lower court although roe v wade is the law of the land according to the guttmacher institute 18 states have passed laws in an attempt to ban abortion at or before 20 weeks those states include alabama arkansas arizona georgia idaho iowa kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and utah however most of the bans are not in effect because they have either been blocked by a court or are expected to be blocked in court on may 17 the supreme court announced that it will hear a case on mississippi s ban on nearly all abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy abortion rights advocates have voiced concern that the high court could soon decide to weaken abortion rights nationwide the supreme court has changed over the past four years the concern now is that the court is going to undermine or even overturn abortion rights and then bans like texas s six week abortion ban could go into effect said elizabeth nash the principal policy associate state issues at the guttmacher institute we re expecting a legal challenge to it very soon but should the supreme court weaken abortion rights then that s where people start to be concerned about whether or not this ban could go into effect we re worried that the new conservative majority on the supreme court might be willing to revisit roe v wade but there s almost 50 years of supreme court jurisprudence that backs up the constitutional right to abortion and we hope that the court will do its duty and follow that precedent and uphold the fundamental right and the constitutional right to accessing abortion said tigner meanwhile pojman says pro life advocates are hoping the supreme court will take a fresh look at the case and possibly allow states more latitude so they can better protect unborn children who are not yet viable

save the mother s life and an unintended result is that the child will die said dr pojman pojman says his organization did not recommend that the texas legislature include exceptions in the case of rape or incest we have to recognize that the terrible violent act of aggression of a rapist against a woman is an absolutely hideous act it s a bodily violation of that woman but the question is if in rare cases that that act results in the pregnancy of the woman what s the best thing for all parties involved and of course we re talking about the mother and the unborn child we do not think a compassionate society should advocate the death of the unborn child because of the terrible act of the father of the child that child is also an innocent victim just as the woman said pojman kelly hart the senior director of public affairs at planned parenthood of greater texas says sb 8 is unique in that the state of texas has decided to give up its enforcement authority and allow anyone including non texas residents to file a private lawsuit against anyone they believe helped a woman get an abortion we re not just talking about the doctors who provide the abortions we re talking about a counselor who gave a woman the phone number to an abortion health center we re talking about a friend who drove a person to get the abortion we re talking about another friend who loaned some money for that person to be able to afford the procedure hart told verify this is unique and dangerous basically allowing citizens who you know in most cases won t really know the medical history of the person and the people involved interfering with private medical decisions in this way sb 8 is currently facing opposition from licensed attorneys and licensed physicians in the state of texas prior to gov abbott s signage of the bill on may 19 both groups wrote open letters to the texas house of representatives to voice their concerns the bill which could be deemed unconstitutional due to the supreme court s roe v wade ruling in 1973 that legalized abortion in the u s is set to go into effect on sept 1 unless it is blocked by a lower court although roe v wade is the law of the land according to the guttmacher institute 18 states have passed laws in an attempt to ban abortion at or before 20 weeks those states include alabama arkansas arizona georgia idaho iowa kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and utah however most of the bans are not in effect because they have either been blocked by a court or are expected to be blocked in court on may 17 the supreme court announced that it will hear a case on mississippi s ban on nearly all abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy abortion rights advocates have voiced concern that the high court could soon decide to weaken abortion rights nationwide the supreme court has changed over the past four years the concern now is that the court is going to undermine or even overturn abortion rights and then bans like texas s six week abortion ban could go into effect said elizabeth nash the principal policy associate state issues at the guttmacher institute we re expecting a legal challenge to it very soon but should the supreme court weaken abortion rights then that s where people start to be concerned about whether or not this ban could go into effect we re worried that the new conservative majority on the supreme court might be willing to revisit roe v wade but there s almost 50 years of supreme court jurisprudence that backs up the constitutional right to abortion and we hope that the court will do its duty and follow that precedent and uphold the fundamental right and the constitutional right to accessing abortion said tigner meanwhile pojman says pro life advocates are hoping the supreme court will take a fresh look at the case and possibly allow states more latitude so they can better protect unborn children who are not yet viable

case no c 41916 originally captioned as staubus et al v purdue pharma l p et al specifically on june 8 2021 the tennessee court of appeals declined to review the default judgment order on a

global oil majors including bhp billiton ltd bhp nyse bhplf otcpk and royal dutch shell plc rds a nyse rds b nyse are beginning to transition toward a green energy future as political and

calling the events a watershed day for the oil industry but it remains to be seen how oil output and demand will be affected in the short term or if a shift toward solar and wind might be what helps

according to the wall street journal businesses purchased a record 25 gigawatts of renewable energy globally last year up 25 from the previous period however renewable energy still has a long way to go before it truly becomes the new normal a recent survey conducted by the pew research center found that nearly two thirds of americans believe climate change is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed yet only one third of respondents are okay with completely phasing out fossil fuels indicating the clean energy transition will be a very gradual process oil industry prepares for a green transition as mrp noted earlier this year big oil companies are beginning to prepare for an increasingly inevitable clean energy future and events over the last week have accelerated that transition bloomberg reported that a dutch court ordered royal dutch shell plc to slash its carbon emissions much faster than the company had anticipated shell had previously pledged to cut its carbon emissions by 20 within the decade but the new verdict would order shell to slash carbon emissions by 45 before 2030 and 72 by 2040 bloomberg wrote that shell s greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were around 1 65

would be spending 3 billion over the next five years to develop a low carbon business unit more recently the company announced it would be expanding its five year agreement with global clean energy to

dominant source of energy accounting for 81 of global energy consumption in 2019 according to the iea however these recent rulings and shareholder meetings are leading oil companies closer to a lower

is being made easier by the rocketing housing markets in some canadian cities the covid 19 lockdowns have also meant there s greater acceptance of working from home and or remotely on my many weekend trips to canmore banff or lake louise in alberta i ve recently met a number of people who have moved to alberta from the greater toronto area they aren t just retirees either but business owners investment advisers bankers service sector workers and even those in the tech sector article content such a move certainly makes a lot of sense for someone who is retired since they can sell their home in toronto and buy an equivalent home in calgary for half the price with more than enough left over to buy a second home in a warmer location such as the beautiful okanagan valley in british columbia or further south in places such as palm springs in california or cabo san lucas in mexico for those who are still working buying an average starter home can become a reality in a place like calgary a family can buy an entire detached home with a view of the mountains for the equivalent cost of a 500 square foot one bedroom condo in toronto noon news roundup your weekday lunchtime roundup

of living are noticeably cheaper in alberta including lower private and specialized school tuition fees lower property and income taxes and there isn t a provincial sales tax recreational activity is also inexpensive the rocky mountains are within a 45 minute drive of downtown calgary so people can access great biking skiing hiking and camping for the cost of an annual park pass of course you ll need a job if you re not retired and there is no doubt that the prairies are still too focused on oil and gas extraction but that is quickly changing since the industry is working hard to clean up its act industry consolidation has created tremendous synergies and operating efficiencies resulting in much stronger free cash flow and profitability even when oil and gas prices are lower due to current capital constraints many energy companies are paying off debt undertaking share buybacks and increasing dividends instead of deploying money into new projects but the industry is also launching environmental initiatives including carbon capture technologies improving overall energy efficiencies exploring carbonate fuel cell research and development and even investing in renewable projects such as wind farms this means there will be significant demand for people who have experience in clean technologies advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your

planned parenthood filed an emergency request with the u s supreme court asking it to block sb 8 on aug 30 kvue reports the filing comes after the fifth circuit court of appeals denied the plaintiffs

recently been reading conflicting reports on whether or not the bill allows abortions in the case of rape or incest or if the mother s life is in danger the question does the new texas heartbeat bill senate bill 8 allow abortions in the case of rape incest or if the mother s life is in danger the sources the answer no the new texas heartbeat bill senate bill 8 does not allow abortions in the case of rape or incest but makes an exception if the mother s life is in danger what we found while senate bill 8 sb 8 does not mention allowing abortions in the case of rape or incest sec 171 205 does make an exception for medical emergency according to the bill a physician who performs or induces an abortion under medical emergency shall make written notations in the pregnant woman s medical record of the physician s belief that a medical emergency necessitated the abortion the physician must also make note of the pregnant woman s medical condition and maintain a copy of the notations

you ve gotten pregnant as a result of that you will not be able to get an abortion after six weeks gestation in texas under this law drucilla tigner policy and advocacy strategist at the aclu of texas told verify there is an exception for what is called in the bill medical emergency which is kind of left up to the doctor to make that determination dr joe pojman executive director of texas alliance for life told verify that the pro life organization he founded in 1988 was adamant that there must be an exception included in sb 8 to allow a physician to terminate a pregnancy if the mother s life is in danger we have to have those exceptions for the life of the mother fortunately those cases are very rare with modern science but it could happen in the case of an ectopic in other words tubal pregnancy when the unborn child is developing not in the uterus of the mother but in a fallopian tube and if left unattended that fallopian tube could rupture the child will certainly die and it could risk the life of the mother through hemorrhaging so that has to be treated and the treatment is to take action to the end of pregnancy the intent of course is not to take the life of the child but to save the mother s life and an unintended result is that the child will die said dr pojman pojman says his organization did not recommend that the texas legislature include exceptions in the case of rape or incest we have to recognize that the terrible violent act of aggression of a rapist against a woman is an absolutely hideous act it s a bodily violation of that woman but the question is if in rare cases that that act results in the pregnancy of the woman what s the best thing for all parties involved and of course we re talking about the mother and the unborn child we do not think a compassionate society should advocate the death of the unborn child because of the terrible act of the father of the child that child is also an innocent victim just as the woman said pojman kelly hart the senior director of public affairs at planned parenthood of greater texas says sb 8 is unique in that the state of texas has decided to give up its enforcement authority and allow anyone including non texas residents to file a private lawsuit against anyone they believe helped a woman get an abortion we re not just talking about the doctors who provide the abortions we re talking about a counselor who gave a woman the phone number to an abortion health center we re talking about a friend who drove a person to get the abortion we re talking about another friend who loaned some money for that person to be able to afford the procedure hart told verify this is unique and dangerous basically allowing citizens who you know in most cases won t really know the medical history of the person and the people involved interfering with private medical decisions in this way sb 8 is currently facing opposition from licensed attorneys and licensed physicians in the state of texas prior to gov abbott s signage of the bill on may 19 both groups wrote open letters to the texas house of representatives to voice their concerns the bill which could be deemed unconstitutional due to the supreme court s roe v wade ruling in 1973 that legalized abortion in the u s is set to go into effect on sept 1 unless it is blocked by a lower court although roe v wade is the law of the land according to the guttmacher institute 18 states have passed laws in an attempt to ban abortion at or before 20 weeks those states include alabama arkansas arizona georgia idaho iowa kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and utah however most of the bans are not in effect because they have either been blocked by a court or are expected to be blocked in court on may 17 the supreme court announced that it will hear a case on mississippi s ban on nearly all abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy abortion rights advocates have voiced concern that the high court could soon decide to weaken abortion rights nationwide the supreme court has changed over the past four years the concern now is that the court is going to undermine or even overturn abortion rights and then bans like texas s six week abortion ban could go into effect said elizabeth nash the principal policy associate state issues at the guttmacher institute we re expecting a legal challenge to it very soon but should the supreme court weaken abortion rights then that s where people start to be concerned about whether or not this ban could go into effect we re worried that the new conservative majority on the supreme court might be willing to revisit roe v wade but there s almost 50 years of supreme court jurisprudence that backs up the constitutional right to abortion and we hope that the court will do its duty and follow that precedent and uphold the fundamental right and the constitutional right to accessing abortion said tigner meanwhile pojman says pro life advocates are hoping the supreme court will take a fresh look at the case and possibly allow states more latitude so they can better protect unborn children who are not yet viable

istock it s no surprise that the highest rate of unemployment in u s history was during the great depression when rates jumped to 24 9 percent in 1933 four years after the infamous black thursday stock market crash caused total economic collapse and led to widespread poverty but what would surprise most americans is that military spouses have faced depression era levels of unemployment for decades prior to covid 19 when u s unemployment rates dropped to modern lows of 3 5 percent military wives unemployment rate was stuck at 25 percent due to frequent moves deployments career interruptions childcare issues and occupational licensing requirements federal and state governments made good faith efforts to help with programs for re licensure reimbursement dod scholarships and business owner residency rules through legislation and programs but military spouse unemployment rates didn t budge despite these comprehensive programs congress has authorized several initiatives to support military spouse education employment and career development though relatively little is known about their effectiveness considering that the unemployment rate among military spouses has remained persistently high for the last two decades the national military spouse network suspects these initiatives are not having the impact they were designed to have stated a 2021 white paper addressing the seemingly unyield military spouse unemployment issue generally education and qualifications are not an issue for military spouses 45 percent of whom have bachelor s or advanced academic degrees compared to 33 percent of civilian counterparts however about 35 percent of military spouses have careers that require professional licensing specific to each state in a 2012 survey of spouses who had pcsed only 11 percent got a new occupational license after the move as a licensed attorney i know this all too well while stationed in virginia i jumped through time consuming and expensive hoops to get an additional license to practice law in the district of columbia but ironically the license was not issued until months after we were already on to the next duty station in california and we were never stationed near d c again an even bigger problem is military spouse underemployment which mostly affects the 93 of military spouses who are female two thirds of working military wives report that their employment does meet their qualifications education or occupational goals active duty military spouses generally earn 38 percent less than their equally qualified civilian counterparts to make matters worse during the pandemic when america s unemployment rates peaked at 14 8 percent in april 2020 data suggested that military spouse unemployment hovered a staggering 20 percentage points higher than the general population putting rates somewhere between 30 to 35 percent for milspouses during the pandemic employed military spouses were either losing their jobs or were leaving their jobs to care for children during shutdowns all of these factors impact military financial readiness by decreasing family earnings over time diminishing opportunities for career advancement decreasing their ability to save for emergencies retirement and their ability to amass long term wealth concluded one study with more than a third of military spouses now unemployed and two thirds of working military spouses underemployed is there a solution that might bridge this massive income gap for military families maybe the number of people teleworking from home skyrocketed from only 7 percent before the pandemic to more than 60 percent today with many companies planning to continue remote work programs also the army has begun providing coworking spaces for military spouses on some bases some postulate that these trends will finally nudge military spouse unemployment numbers off of their high perch by offering portable work opportunities that lessen child care issues and reduce career interruptions while remote work does not solve the occupational licensure problem there is also a recent push for states to enter compact agreements to recognize other state occupational licenses the department of labor has a website where military spouses can see which states are in licensure compacts a bridge spanning the decades long pay gap for military spouses is purely hypothetical but there is finally hope will military spouses who prioritize service before self one day be able to find meaningful career opportunities that meet their education and qualifications only time will tell read more at themeatandpotatoesoflife com and in lisa s book the meat and potatoes of life my true lit com email meatandpotatoesoflife gmail com

risk the life of the mother through hemorrhaging so that has to be treated and the treatment is to take action to the end of pregnancy the intent of course is not to take the life of the child but to save the mother s life and an unintended result is that the child will die said dr pojman pojman says his organization did not recommend that the texas legislature include exceptions in the case of rape or incest we have to recognize that the terrible violent act of aggression of a rapist against a woman is an absolutely hideous act it s a bodily violation of that woman but the question is if in rare cases that that act results in the pregnancy of the woman what s the best thing for all parties involved and of course we re talking about the mother and the unborn child we do not think a compassionate society should advocate the death of the unborn child because of the terrible act of the father of the child that child is also an innocent victim just as the woman said pojman kelly hart the senior director of public affairs at planned parenthood of greater texas says sb 8 is unique in that the state of texas has decided to give up its enforcement authority and allow anyone including non texas residents to file a private lawsuit against anyone they believe helped a woman get an abortion we re not just talking about the doctors who provide the abortions we re talking about a counselor who gave a woman the phone number to an abortion health center we re talking about a friend who drove a person to get the abortion we re talking about another friend who loaned some money for that person to be able to afford the procedure hart told verify this is unique and dangerous basically allowing citizens who you know in most cases won t really know the medical history of the person and the people involved interfering with private medical decisions in this way sb 8 is currently facing opposition from licensed attorneys and licensed physicians in the state of texas prior to gov abbott s signage of the bill on may 19 both groups wrote open letters to the texas house of representatives to voice their concerns the bill which could be deemed unconstitutional due to the supreme court s roe v wade ruling in 1973 that legalized abortion in the u s is set to go into effect on sept 1 unless it is blocked by a lower court although roe v wade is the law of the land according to the guttmacher institute 18 states have passed laws in an attempt to ban abortion at or before 20 weeks those states include alabama arkansas arizona georgia idaho iowa kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and utah however most of the bans are not in effect because they have either been blocked by a court or are expected to be blocked in court on may 17 the supreme court announced that it will hear a case on mississippi s ban on nearly all abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy abortion rights advocates have voiced concern that the high court could soon decide to weaken abortion rights nationwide the supreme court has changed over the past four years the concern now is that the court is going to undermine or even overturn abortion rights and then bans like texas s six week abortion ban could go into effect said elizabeth nash the principal policy associate state issues at the guttmacher institute we re expecting a legal challenge to it very soon but should the supreme court weaken abortion rights then that s where people start to be concerned about whether or not this ban could go into effect we re worried that the new conservative majority on the supreme court might be willing to revisit roe v wade but there s almost 50 years of supreme court jurisprudence that backs up the constitutional right to abortion and we hope that the court will do its duty and follow that precedent and uphold the fundamental right and the constitutional right to accessing abortion said tigner meanwhile pojman says pro life advocates are hoping the supreme court will take a fresh look at the case and possibly allow states more latitude so they can better protect unborn children who are not yet viable

securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler unveiled an ambitious list of proposed reforms friday including guidelines for woke corporate disclosures and rules to curtail the gamification of wall street as he embarks on his tenure as wall street s top cop the sec s agency rule list released today includes 49 rulings that are in three stages pre mid or final of being looked at by the full commission the lengthy laundry list reflects gensler s publicly stated priorities for regulating both wall street and corporate america perhaps the most interesting but not so surprising given gensler s progressive views is that the rulings are in the form of non traditional disclosures which would be appealing to left wing politicians such as sen elizabeth warren d mass sec chairman calls for new restrictions on executive stock trading plans two such proposed rules involve mandating corporate disclosures on issues such as climate change and corporate board diversity the list also includes a ruling that would possibly curtail what gensler has called the gamification of trading by discount brokers who offer incentives that gensler said he believes entice first time retail investors to essentially gamble their money in the stock market given the frenzy around the so called meme stocks that have been trading wildly this year there is genuine concern from a regulatory standpoint that small investors could lose all of their money this could happen if the shares of stocks such as gamestop and amc both of which have risen more than 1000 this year alone start to reflect more normal valuations ticker security last change change amc amc entertainment 2 84 0 14 4 54 gme gamestop corp 10 86 0 16 1 45 the agenda also addresses possible improprieties done by short sellers who make money when stocks fall some investors believe short sellers improperly manipulate shares of companies lower in order to make a profit sec s gary gensler eyes crypto in order to pass a ruling the full five member sec must have a majority approval with gensler as the deciding vote given his progressive leanings many of the proposed rulings including diversity and environmental changes could get approved along party lines an sec spokesman had no immediate comment the climate change and diversity disclosures will likely receive pushback from key senate republicans such as sen pat toomey of pennsylvania the soon to retire toomey believes it s outside of the sec s purview to demand that companies support issues that are political in nature and aren t directly beneficial to shareholders the securities laws are not the appropriate vehicle to regulate the climate nor to correct racial injustice nor to intimidate companies regarding political spending toomey said during gensler s confirmation hearing in march toomey serves on the senate s banking committee which provides oversight of the sec the diversity proposal which the website calls the corporate board diversity ruling involves the commission proposing a new rule that would enhance registrant disclosures about the diversity of board members and nominees the climate change proposal is comprised of making rule amendments in order to ramp up companies disclosures regarding their climate change related risks the gamification proposal calls for companies to consider behavioral prompts predictive analytics and differential marketing click here to read more on fox business platforms specifically robinhood the user friendly trading platform loved by millennials is known for its slick design and easy to use features that entice customers into spending money on stock trading the app has been known to offer cash bonuses to first time traders and give away free stocks critics including gensler believe these features encourage investors to trade more which fosters a gambling mentality the gamification ruling is relatively new and still in the early or pre rule stage according to the website we created robinhood in response to the growing wealth divide so millions of people previously left behind could access the u s stock market remarked a spokesman for robinhood the people who have been systemically left out of wealth generation are now revolutionizing the way we invest we celebrate that transformation meanwhile the short sale disclosure proposal would call for the commission to establish rules for further disclosure of short selling information such as the name of the issuer the title class and aggregate amount of the number of short sales of each security some security experts say more disclosure would help eliminate short selling improprieties such as naked short selling where a trader is allowed to keep a short position indefinitely which in many cases goes against sec regulations
since a deadly outbreak of the virus began ravaging png in march border force and defence significantly boosted the number of vessels patrolling the northern torres strait islands of saibai boigu and dauan both agencies decline to outline the exact number of extra assets they have deployed in the area the increased abf and defence presence has brought the number of arrivals down to roughly one a week in recent months when a png boat makes it into australian waters border force s current policy is to intercept the vessel and direct it back but if one of passengers requires urgent medical attention they are allowed onto saibai island to be treated at the health clinic and are then tested for covid 19 a lot of people don t realise how close png is to an australian territory in saibai says border force navigation officer david hurley standing on a tender boat metres from the border between the two countries ever since the covid pandemic it s been pretty busy here we re always monitoring who is coming between saibai and png for hundreds of years the papuans have been allowed to come across and trade and use the australian medical facilities now during covid of course there s none of that allowed and we re spending a lot of time up here enforcing that building a different border the hard headed posture at the border has been central to keeping png nationals out of the northern islands of the torres strait but there have been other moves the department of foreign affairs and trade helped the png government establish a health clinic at mabaduan one of the closest png villages to the torres strait which has meant there is less of a reason to cross the border before the clinic was established png nationals in border villages had to travel up to two hours by boat to a hospital on the png island of daru australian border force abf regional commander of northern command colin drysdale on a fast response boat patrolling off thursday island credit kate geraghty colin drysdale commander of northern command at border force says there had been a lot of messages going out to the treaty villages that anybody seeking medical treatment should go to the mabaduan clinic if png nationals enter waters it has to be for an urgent medical reason for treatment he says there has been a lot of messages going out to the treaty villages about the dangers of covid reinforcing the fact that the borders are closed dfat along with the png government has also made rolling out vaccines in the area of png known as the south fly district a priority however it is believed less than half of frontline staff have been vaccinated in this area and the png government is still some way from vaccinating the whole population vaccine hesitancy australia has its own issues with vaccines on its side in the torres strait vaccine hesitancy is increasingly an issue when png was hit by its covid 19 outbreak in march queensland health moved quickly and 95 per cent of the northern islands were vaccinated with astrazeneca but the rollout was paused in april after australian health authorities advised the pfizer vaccine should be given to australians under 50 because of the remote possibility that astrazeneca caused blood clots the rollout then recommenced on may 17 but only about 65 per cent of residents in the northern islands lined up for their second jab queensland health has finished the two week rollout in the northern islands but authorities have not ruled out coming back norah tabuai a 37 year old teacher on saibai who received her vaccine last week says everyone needs to get vaccinated to be on the safe side norah tabuai receives her second astrazeneca covid 19 vaccination on saibai island from a queensland health nurse credit kate geraghty i don t want to get covid and suffer from that we are near to png it s a five minute drive in a dinghy over to there there s a huge risk of getting covid here the message out to the community is that it is important to get your vaccine you ll be safe further south in the main administrative hub of thursday island there is enough pfizer for the entire eligible adult population but just over 70 per cent of residents have received their first dose and only about 20 per cent have had their second stanley cook a 66 year old who looks after the community garden on thursday island says he has not yet received his vaccine and there is a lot of hesitancy about doing so on the torres strait islands a lot of people haven t got it he says stanley cook in his garden on the shoreline on thursday island credit kate geraghty somebody talks on the tv and says you get a blood clot or something like that so that s why they re a bit scared now that s torres strait they re always scared from anything they re scared from the government they re scared from the police they re scared from the needle everything dr tony brown executive director of torres and cape hospital and health service says he is concerned there is a sense of complacency in the area because they haven t yet had a case of covid 19 that s why i have been making it widely known that covid 19 will come at some stage he says eventually the virus will get across the border from papua new guinea or it will come up from the south because our borders will be open eventually loading and we really haven t got the capacity to come back and provide many more rollouts it s expensive it s absorbing a lot of our staff who have been diverted from other clinical duties it s a big deal for us brown says the negative energy that came out of the state and federal government on the blood clot issue with astrazeneca did have huge impact he says it is important to communicate with the public in a culturally sensitive way and to continually drive home the message that the vaccines were safe people had to alert the population of the risks but i think people don t understand risks particularly well especially when you re aboriginal and torres strait islander people who feel as though they ve had lots of reasons to be suspicious with how they re dealt with by society and the fact that we haven t tried this vaccine on that population particularly so they re not appreciating being the early adopters so to speak loading but we ve seen all over the world how covid once it gets to a critical point overwhelms systems and i can t imagine that papua new guinea is going to be any different in fact we know that port moresby has got to that point probably already we expect that the population at some stage will be overwhelmed and nothing s going to stop the huge migration of people coming down so that s what we fear that the system will be overwhelmed in papua new guinea and you ll have png nationals coming over for health reasons in the torres strait and they ll have covid joe rosta the director of the pharmacy on thursday island where the pfizer vaccines are kept in a special freezer at minus 60 degrees celsius says he believes the population is slowly starting to come around but the problem is the logistical nightmare in going back and doing the rollout again there s a lot of staff involved in trying to deliver this it s not as simple as some people might think just put up a clinic and people will just turn up rosta says we have to have a lot of community consultation prior to the clinic to ensure we do get a good turnout we need to speak to the public and really allay their fears that it s not a big conspiracy that the vaccine is actually going to be good for them rather than be detrimental to their health that s always a big battle no matter where you are joe rosta the director of pharmacy for torres and cape hospital and health service stands near the freezer at the thursday island hospital that contains the pfizer covid 19 vaccinations credit kate geraghty even though we haven t had covid up here for mine it s only a matter of time before we do get some cases we ve got papua new guinea just across the border which has got huge numbers there s more and more tourists coming up here now and it only takes one to have visited a place that has got covid picks it up and then coming through here china on the doorstep just before christmas last year concern swept through the torres strait islands after the png government signed a memorandum of understanding with a chinese company to build a 132 million fishing facility on the island of daru just across the border chinese fishing fleets have devastated local fish stocks in the offshore zones of many other countries in the indo pacific some chinese fishers are trained to assist the people s liberation army with fishing boats previously helping china s navy seize the philippines territory in the disputed south china sea loading the png government has since gone quiet on the matter and senior figures in the australian government believe the facility proposed by the chinese company fujian zhonghong fishery limited will never materialise fraser nai a former member of the torres strait island regional council says the fisheries between the torres strait and png are shared and there are quotas for each country for example the tropical rock lobster migrates through torres strait and comes in and out of the coast of png what happens on that side can really impact the resources on the other side for the next season he says if you ve got a big chinese company coming in that can really impact the resources that are shared on a bigger geopolitical scale australia is not that far from china the fact is our alliance is with the united states of america and we re forever joined at the hip with that so we re affected whatever goes on that way between those geopolitical plays we re directly in the middle a question of forces in the northern islands there are divergent views on whether the massive presence of border force and defence vessels should remain when the pandemic ends some clans on these islands are of mixed png blood and have loved ones across the border they haven t seen for more than a year others say they would like the treaty to be more tightly regulated so that border crossings don t return to pre covid levels i think it needs to because the face of the region is changing nai says fraser nai says the border force and defence may need a stronger presence even after covid 19 has waned credit kate

supreme court justice louis brandeis famously called states laboratories of democracy by which he meant that american local governments were free to undertake policy initiatives that might help determine what ideas work and what don t the biden administration s american rescue plan will likely be the biggest funder of local government experimentation in the nine decades since brandeis coined that phrase far from an actual rescue for local governments suddenly flush with cash the hundreds of billions of dollars that washington is sending around america have unleashed a flood of ambitious ideas meant to transform communities through vague speculative and untested programs that local governments are often ill suited to carry out many of these initiatives are just versions of decades old programs with a new spin but the same questionable incentives at best the result will be billions of wasted dollars though we shouldn t discount the government s ability to make things much worse in any event this can t be what brandeis had in mind to understand where states and cities are headed it s helpful to think about how biden s plan evolved when the economic lockdowns were imposed in the spring of 2020 local governments witnessed unprecedented collapses in tax collections they began pleading with the trump administration for aid to bolster their shrinking budgets washington responded by sending billions of targeted dollars to help with pandemic related costs including money for hospitals schools transit systems child care and disaster relief the biggest part of the stimulus was aid to individuals and businesses via enhanced unemployment benefits and business loans what local governments didn t get however was unrestricted aid for their budgets many mayors and governors spent the ensuing months complaining about their treatment from the trump administration and lobbying for budget assistance trump balked at sending them money directly though in december 2020 he signed a new 900 billion stimulus package extending federal benefits to individuals by then tax collections in many places were already bouncing back killing any further talk of money to bolster spending by cities and states as a presidential candidate joe biden sided with local governments in their budget pleas one of his first legislative accomplishments on assuming office was the 1 9 trillion rescue plan signed into law in march which included some 350 billion for states cities and other types of municipalities by then stories about the significant rebound in local tax collections were so common that the biden administration changed how it defined its rescue plan white house officials admitted that the enormous chunk of money was meant to be a stimulus to ensure that the painfully slow economic rebound that took place during barack obama s presidency didn t occur again though the obama administration had passed a nearly 800 billion stimulus package of its own in 2009 it also raised taxes on high income earners small businesses investors and health care companies and significantly expanded business regulations all of which stifled growth with a similar agenda in mind for his presidency biden decided to go even bigger with stimulus the result might not be so stimulating the trump administration s enhanced unemployment benefits extended by biden s rescue plan until september have proved so generous that many businesses and economists blame them for suppressing employment growth as workers opt to collect benefits instead of getting back to work the biden administration has now given state governments the go ahead to use stimulus funds to lure workers back with bonuses even as the rescue plan pays them not to work connecticut is offering the long term unemployed 1 000 if they get a job but is still paying generous jobless benefits in california the biden stimulus combined with the bullish stock market has helped produce a 75 billion budget surplus surely the biggest surplus any state has ever experienced governor gavin newsom is spending 12 billion of it in direct payments to state residents on top of the payments provided to them by the relief bills in march and december 2020 even as the state struggles to get residents back to work even local native american governments are getting in on the splurge the cherokee nation which received 1 8 billion from the biden plan is sending 2 000 to nearly 400 000 of its members so far this free money has mostly produced more cash in the bank not economic stimulus last year even amid double digit unemployment americans savings rate increased to 17 percent of income up from 7 percent in 2019 some cities are looking to use federal money to help fund the latest progressive idea for the poor unrestricted annual payments to low income households touted as universal basic income the idea is to provide these households with a regular stipend that acts as a safety net milton friedman once proposed something similar to replace welfare checks and the government social services bureaucracy that accompanies anti poverty programs today cities including chicago and philadelphia are eyeing ubi payments not to replace the rest of the welfare state but simply to add to it based on a pilot program in stockton california that gives residents 500 a month chicago would spend 30 million to give monthly incomes to 5 000 low income families as a form of disaster relief on top of the generous individual benefits the trump administration had served up some programs sound still more ambitious but lack details detroit plans to use stimulus dollars to create a 400 million fund with goals that include eliminating intergenerational poverty the federal government has spent trillions of dollars over the last 50 years on just such a goal to no avail do detroit officials know something everyone else does not it seems not they plan to ask community residents how to spend the money the idea is reminiscent of when president richard nixon took billions of poverty program dollars and sent them to local activist groups based on the notion that they knew best what their communities needed that money did many things but reducing poverty was not one of them local officials who once spoke of needing this money to keep delivering basic services during the pandemic now foresee the biden dollars funding transformational programs in a zoom call last month hosted by the u s conference of mayors city officials spoke of building community centers or offering incentives to lure businesses like supermarkets into low income neighborhoods that need them yet these are precisely the kinds of projects that federal block grant programs and empowerment zones have funded for decades to attract investment into underdeveloped neighborhoods collectively such programs have rarely accomplished the overarching goals of dramatically improving neighborhoods but the biden rescue law provides a new funding source albeit a temporary one for more of the same with so much money floating around anything qualifies as stimulus connecticut wants to spend 15 million in biden money to send kids for free to museums aquariums and zoos during the summer the state also proposes using stimulus funds to provide safe fun and healthy spaces for teenagers though what this would entail is not clear it can seem almost passé to complain about wasted federal money when republicans and democrats alike seem to have dismissed the idea that deficits and debt matter the trump administration hardly filled with fiscal hawks unleashed a torrent of spending with the enhanced unemployment benefits and business loans that states and the federal government were clearly ill equipped to manage the result one report after another of massive fraud in both efforts now democrats have devised a great society style blowout that is unlikely to deliver much more of a long term payoff than lyndon johnson s original programs produced the great society did more than just waste money outcomes among the poor including employment and social mobility declined during that period as incentives to work declined the biden money may produce similar results consider for example subsidized housing california among other states is using the cash to make massive investments in government bankrolled residential construction to offset housing shortages the real problem though is that places like california have created so many barriers and added costs to building that the private housing market hasn t been able to keep up with demand at affordable prices even government backed affordable housing costs on average a whopping 750 000 per unit in california at those prices the biden money will produce much less housing than it should and when the cash is spent california will still have a housing shortage and a market even more dominated by government financed homes because the state didn t address the causes of the problem spreading federal government largesse around is easier than making painful reforms but far less productive it s not a new lesson but we re about to relearn it photo

springfield the latest draft of an energy regulatory overhaul bill that has been in negotiations for months was unveiled late thursday ahead of lawmakers planned return to the capitol to vote on it next week while the bill as it stands provides 694 million in subsidies to nuclear energy giant exelon and requires that coal fired power plants in the state must close by 2035 and natural gas plants must close by 2045 working groups of lawmakers stakeholders and the governor s office continued to meet friday to negotiate the omnibus bill the governor s office distributed an outline of the bill along with a draft of an 866 page amendment to members of the working group late thursday one of the major points of negotiation at this point is what to do with municipal coal fired power plants the prairie state energy campus in marissa is a 1 600 megawatt coal fired power plant that provides power to several municipal utilities in illinois and other states it is largely financed through municipal bonds from those communities including naperville batavia winnetka and others in all the facility cost about 5 billion and the bonds are due to be paid back through at least 2035 also highlighted are the measures in the bill that pertain to the prairie state energy campus which remains subject to the declining caps on greenhouse gases the governor s office wrote in a memo to working group stakeholders an exemption for the nation s seventh largest polluter remains unacceptable to the governor as well as the nearly 50 legislators that have indicated they will not support a bill that does so the governor s proposal received pushback in the senate as the may 31 scheduled end of session passed with senate president don harmon citing concerns about municipal coal plant closures from members of his democratic caucus as a reason for slowing the bill down harmon s office had drafted a bill separate from the governor s this week which a spokesperson said was drafted to drive discussion through the weekend working group sessions rep ann williams d chicago who was the sponsor of the clean energy jobs act bill which has been a major part of working group negotiations said in a phone call friday the group is in the process of reconciling some portions of the two draft energy bills including the coal fired power plant measures she was one of the lawmakers who signed onto a letter urging the governor not to exempt prairie state from closure and she noted the municipalities saddled with bond debt for the facility will have to repay that no matter what happens with the legislation shuttering the plant would allow the municipalities to procure cleaner and possibly cheaper energy she said but lawmakers from springfield and the metro east area which includes the prairie state plant held a news conference last week strongly opposing closure of the prairie state campus and springfield s city water light and power municipally owned coal fired power plant they urged an exemption for the two plants a coalition of more than 20 labor unions also sent a letter to the governor thursday requesting the plants be exempted from closure by 2035 as well combined these two plants employ more than 1 100 workers and support an additional 1 000 skilled union tradesmen and women in good high paying jobs the union leaders wrote in the letter if legislation is enacted to close these plants before the end of their useful lives there will be devastating consequences thousands of employees will lose their jobs stifling economic activity in areas of the state where jobs can often be hard to come by but the governor s bill in the form introduced thursday night would still include the prairie state campus for closure by 2035 although it would also contribute 2 million annually in ratepayer funds for decommissioning costs it would also create a new task force to investigate carbon capture and sequestration and debt financing options for prairie state and affected municipalities the bill does not include a price on carbon emissions which had been in a previous version which means most of the measures in the bill are ratepayer funded instead it authorizes the governor to create a commission on market based carbon pricing solutions the bill would also create state subsidies for three new nuclear plants making it so five of exelon s six illinois plants are receiving subsidies braidwood byron and dresden plants would receive 694 million combined in total over five years plants in clinton and the quad cities received a 10 year subsidy of over 2 3 billion total under the 2016 future energy jobs act according to the governor s office s analysis the average residential ratepayer would pay about 80 cents per month extra for the subsidies the average residential customer would be asked to pay about 1 22 extra per month to pay for an added investment in renewables such as wind and solar power that would aid the state s effort to achieve 40 percent renewable energy by 2030 ratepayers would pay an estimated added 86 cents per bill for an expanded low income weatherization program the proposal would also require the illinois commerce commission to investigate how and if utility giant commonwealth edison used ratepayer funds in connection with the company s conduct as outlined in a deferred prosecution agreement last year in which the company admitted to bribery charges the company allegedly gave no work jobs to close associates of house speaker michael madigan who has not been charged it would require that ratepayer funds which were used in connection with conduct outlined in the court document to be returned to ratepayers the bill would also end automatic formula rate increases which allow utilities to raise rates by essentially bypassing regulators the bill would restore a process of requiring approval before an increase or requiring performance based ratemaking according to the governor s office it also requires an independent audit of the electric grid and expenditures since 2012 the bill also does not change the way energy capacity is procured in illinois as it would have in previous versions the bill also sets goals of putting 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 including by offering 4 000 rebates for the purchase of electric vehicles as well as rebates or grants that fund up to 80 of the

on may 25 2021 the u s department of justice doj unsealed an indictment charging two austrian citizens peter weinzierl weinzierl and alexander waldstein waldstein for their roles in a scheme to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the u s financial system on behalf of the brazilian construction conglomerate odebrecht s a odebrecht the indictment alleges that weinzierl and waldstein helped odebrecht funnel money to offshore accounts to pay bribes to government officials in brazil panama and mexico the announcement was timed to coincide with the arrest of weinzierl in the united kingdom however waldstein remains at large this enforcement action is notable for a number of reasons 1 doj has used u s money laundering statutes to charge weinzierl and waldstein with bribery related misconduct because both individuals likely fall outside of the ambit of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 2 it heralds a widely anticipated uptick in anti corruption and anti money laundering enforcement demanded by the biden administration 3 it highlights continued focus on latin america and brazil in particular as a target of anti corruption and anti money laundering enforcement and 4 weinzierl s arrest by the uk authorities at the request of their u s counterparts underlines ongoing close cooperation between the two jurisdictions edny recently unsealed the weinzierl waldstein indictment the eastern district of new york edny indictment charges weinzierl and waldstein former bank executives and austrian citizens with several money laundering offenses weinzierl was the ceo of a private bank in austria for which waldstein served as an officer both men were also directors at a second bank based in antigua and barbuda the indictment alleges that between 2006 and 2016 the two individuals laundered more than 170 million held in new york bank accounts by odebrecht acting in tandem with odebrecht and other co conspirators weinzierl and waldstein used the austrian bank to funnel the money to odebrecht s offshore accounts in antigua odebrecht utilized that money to pay bribes to government officials in brazil panama and mexico in order to obtain and retain business this indictment represents the latest criminal charges following the december 2016 global settlement with odebrecht and its subsidiary braskem in the 2016 plea agreements the two companies admitted to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to foreign government officials since 2001 odebrecht and braskem pleaded guilty to violating the fcpa and agreed to pay around 3 5 billion in penalties to u s brazilian and swiss authorities although these fines were subsequently reduced due to odebrecht s financial difficulties use of aml statutes to target foreign corruption the prosecution of weinzierl and waldstein serves as a reminder that the doj will use all prosecutorial tools in its toolbox to enforce overseas anti corruption efforts even where the underlying misconduct is beyond the fcpa s reach prosecutors in the eastern district of new york and the doj fraud section used the money laundering statutes 18 u s c 1956 and 1957 to charge weinzierl and waldstein with foreign bribery misconduct according to the indictment defendants were foreign bank executives and they facilitated the flow of funds to offshore bank accounts for odebrecht to use to pay bribes to government officials in panama mexico and brazil the doj prosecutors chose not to pursue fcpa charges seemingly because weinzierl and waldstein are beyond the scope of the statute s class of defendants as foreign bank executives neither weinzierl nor waldstein are individuals covered by the fcpa i e u s citizens officers directors employees or agents of a u s company or individuals who commit misconduct while in the united states therefore doj charged defendants with money laundering offenses for what is principally conspiring to commit foreign bribery in violation of the fcpa biden administration continues a recent trend and prioritizes anti corruption enforcement edny unsealed the weinzierl and waldstein indictment as the biden administration fleshes out its anti corruption agenda the anti money laundering act of 2020 strengthens the government s authority to police financial markets by enacting a broad set of requirements for covered federal agencies and financial institutions moreover a june 3 2021 white house memo titled establishing the fight against corruption as a core united states national security interest calls on numerous government agencies and offices to review and develop strategies to bolster anti corruption efforts in the united states and abroad the president s all hands on deck initiative that requires cross agency cooperation is not entirely new but it reinforces doj s efforts to counter corruption and create a level playing field for companies competing for business abroad as the biden administration settles in one thing is clear doj is sharpening its teeth and looking to target individuals and companies engaged in foreign bribery and will use all available legislation to bring corporates and individuals to account continued focus on brazil latam brazil and latin america continues to be a key focus of the u s uk and other international enforcement authorities in pursuing individuals and corporates for corruption offenses on june 7 2021 the u s attorney general merrick b garland announced an initiative targeting corruption and human trafficking in guatemala el salvador and honduras the first half of 2021 has also seen enforcement activity relating to bribery schemes involving the state oil companies of ecuador and venezuela the weinzierl waldstein indictment is yet another example of international enforcement actions stemming from the car wash investigation lava jato the original brazilian investigation into bribery of petrobras officials dates back to march 2014 and has resulted in prison sentences for around 300 individuals and billions of dollars in fines and financial settlements with companies involved odebrecht signed leniency agreements with the u s brazilian and swiss authorities in december 2016 and concluded its three and a half year doj mandated monitorship in november 2020 the arrest and indictment of weinzierl shows that related enforcement actions against corporates and individuals are live and ongoing as we highlighted in november 2020 in our update on another car wash related enforcement action the truly global scope of the misconduct and investigation combined with the sheer volume of information obtained through cooperating witnesses means that international enforcement will likely continue for several more years as is aptly demonstrated by this case the u s authorities have a close and collaborative relationship with their uk counterparts and regularly request legal assistance through both formal and informal channels
bank of nova scotia pays a great dividend and has strong growth potential in its international operations is this the right time to buy the stock bank of nova scotia tsx bns nyse bns reported strong results for the most recent quarter investors who missed the rally in the share price in recent months want to know if this is a good time to buy bank of nova scotia stock earnings bank of nova scotia generated fiscal q2 2021 adjusted net earnings of 2 47 billion and earnings per share of 1 90 up 81 and 83 respectively from the same period last year return on equity was 14 9 compared to 8 2 bank of nova scotia finished the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio of 12 3 this is well above the minimum requirements and indicates the bank is sitting on excess capital that it built up to ride out the pandemic the canadian banking division had a strong quarter compared to fiscal q2 2020 adjusted net income was 931 million up 94 international banking net income rose by 247 million or 143 to 420 million in the quarter on a year over year basis bank of nova scotia has a large presence in the pacific alliance countries of mexico peru chile and colombia latin america was hit hard by the pandemic and it will take some time for the countries to rebound that said rising oil and copper prices will speed up the recovery in these economies and bank of nova scotia should benefit longer term the pacific alliance market of more than 230 million people offers attractive growth potential banking penetration remains low and an expanding middle class should drive demand for loans and investment products investors could see the bank use some of its extra cash to make additional strategic acquisitions in the region dividends bank of nova scotia has a strong track record of dividend growth the government forced all the canadian banks to put dividend increases on hold during the pandemic now that the economy is starting to recover and the banks have weathered the storm in better shape than expected bank of nova scotia and its peers should get the green light to raise dividends again later this year or in early 2022 given the size of the excess capital and the strong profitability of the bank investors should see a wave of generous dividend increases from bank of nova scotia when distribution hikes restart investors who buy the stock at the current price near 81 per share can pick up a 4 4 dividend yield risks government aid programs will end this year this could trigger an increase in loan and mortgage defaults from businesses and homeowners who managed to pay their bills with the help of the pandemic assistance but have not seen their income levels rebound due to lost revenue or extended unemployment bank of nova scotia can absorb the hit but there might be a few weak quarters once the economy is forced to stand on its own feet over the medium term interest rates are also a concern high inflation could force the bank of canada and the federal reserve to hike interest rates sooner than expected pushing up rates on variable rate mortgages the bond market could tank on the expectation or announcement of higher interest rates and that would drive up the rates charged on fixed rate mortgages homeowners who see a large jump in rates when the need to renew the mortgage could be forced to sell if enough people find themselves in this situation the housing market could go through a meaningful correction bank of nova scotia finished fiscal q2 2021 with 257 billion in mortgages on the books should you buy the stock bank of nova scotia isn t a cheap stock right now but the bank is a good buy and hold pick for dividend investors you get a great dividend yield and the next few distribution hikes will likely be generous given the size of the company s cash hoard if you like the stock i would take a half position now and add to the holding on pullbacks

on the terms anticipated or at all ethylene marine export terminal the construction of the marine export terminal was completed in december 2020 the company made a final contribution of 4 0 million to the export terminal joint venture during the first quarter of 2021 taking the total contributions to 146 5 million for our 50 share of the capital cost of the marine export terminal the company s associated five year terminal credit facility is now fully drawn at 69 0 million following a drawdown for the final 4 0 million contribution and an additional 14 0 million drawn for general corporate purposes during february and march 2021 operation of the 16 mile pipeline carrying ethylene from caverns at mont belvieu texas to the marine export terminal suspended service due to operational issues impacting terminal volumes for those months those issues were remedied at the end of march and the pipeline has resumed service shipping trends increased lpg and petrochemical gases exports including ethylene led to an increase in our fleet utilization and earnings early in the first quarter of 2021 with january 2021 utilization reaching pre pandemic levels of 96 in line with the same period last year however the extraordinary texas freeze which affected large parts of north america during february shut down 80 of all u s ethylene production almost 100 of the ethylene producing plants in texas and louisiana were forced to abruptly cease operation as they were not designed for a subzero climate and lacked winterization contingencies as the underlying domestic demand for ethylene derivatives was largely unaffected pricing for u s produced ethylene spiked increasing from 733 mt in january 2021 to a peak of 1 270 mt in march 2021 which resulted in a negative price differential relative to the rest of the world february and march 2021 saw u s inventories of ethylene fully drawn and the little production that was still being produced going directly to domestic downstream processing resulting in the terminal export volumes going from a near maximum capacity in january 2021 to a low in february and march 2021 which in turn had a negative impact on our ethylene fleet utilization our fleet utilization reduced to mid 80 for the two remaining months of the first quarter resulting in an overall utilization of 88 2 for the first quarter of 2021 u s ethane pricing was not materially impacted by the winter freeze and it continued to be one of the most competitive feedstocks for the production of ethylene globally while u s ethylene prices soared during the first quarter of 2021 they have now reduced from their peak opening up arbitrage with both europe and asia although it has taken a number of months longer than initially anticipated we expect june 2021 export volumes to be close to those of the january 2021 and we anticipate exports for the remainder of the year to be at nameplate capacity of one million tons per annum the normalization of u s ethylene prices and consequently ethylene exports are adding to the positive sentiment going forward the newly commissioned repauno lpg export terminal in new jersey on the u s east coast exported its first

march 31 2020 this decrease was primarily due to an increase in operating revenues of approximately 3 3 million attributable to an increase in average monthly time charter equivalent rates which increased to an average of approximately 667 830 per vessel per calendar month 21 956 per day for the three months ended march 31 2021 compared to an average of approximately 634 350 per vessel per calendar month 20 855 per day for the three months ended march 31 2020 a decrease in operating revenues of approximately 1 5 million attributable to a decrease in vessel available days of 82 days or 2 4 for the three months ended march 31 2021 compared to the three months to march 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in the number of dry dockings undertaken during the three months ended march 31 2021 compared to the three months ended march 31 2020 as well as the effects of 2020 being a leap year and a decrease in operating revenues of approximately 0 6 million attributable to a decrease in fleet utilization which was 88 2 for the three months ended march 31 2021 compared to 89 0 for the three months ended march 31 2020 a decrease in operating revenues of approximately 1 9 million

following table presents selected operating data for the three months ended march 31 2020 and 2021 which we believe are useful in understanding the basis for movement in our operating revenues non gaap financial measure time charter equivalent time charter equivalent tce rate is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel tce is not calculated in accordance with u s gaap for all charters we calculate tce by dividing total operating revenues excluding collaborative arrangements less any voyage expenses excluding collaborative arrangements by the number of operating days for the relevant period tce rates exclude the effects of the collaborative arrangements as operating days and fleet utilization on which tce rates are based are calculated for our owned vessels and not the average of all pool vessels under a time charter the charterer pays substantially all of the vessel voyage related expenses whereas for voyage charters also known as spot market charters we pay all voyage expenses tce rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period to period changes in a company s performance despite changes in the mix of charter types i e spot charters time charters and contracts of affreightment under which the vessels may be employed between the periods we include average daily tce rate as we believe it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with net operating revenues because it assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating their financial performance our calculation of tce rate may not be comparable to that reported by other companies reconciliation of operating revenues to tce rate the following table represents a

eweek content and product recommendations are editorially independent we may make money when you click on links to our partners learn more intel evo as a program was and is inspired in that it has broad applicability to the need to better assure an apple like experience assured by intel amd has responded with a similar program currently focused on gaming computers called amd advantage which uses a broader blend of vendors to accomplish a similar goal amd has reported that these co branded systems are selling out at best buy showcasing the success of this effort which will likely expand to other models and additional markets these efforts have parallels with mercedes s very successful amg program where a unit that focuses on performance parts co brands a car and assures that vehicle can perform to its limits i ve owned one amg car and it was impressively fast and on the track it was competitive with cars explicitly built for track use and not street legal but the amg i had was a great daily driver as well that s the promise of both amd advantage and intel evo in terms of providing the best experience however amd advantage is even more similar to amg because it focuses nearly exclusively on gaming performance in laptops initially which could also be used successfully for work let s talk about where these co branded co branding history the first co branded pc i carried and still have someplace was the asus amd powered ferrari laptop back in 2004 yes my peers made fun of me when i brought it to a meeting until they heard the startup sound a ferrari engine revving it was cool looking it sounded beautiful and it was a pretty decent gaming laptop for its time but its battery life stunk it was on the heavy side and the power brick was arguably the heavies i ever carried back then performance and energy efficiency were mutually exclusive but it still is one of the few laptops i look back at today fondly this co branding concept is most common in cars as i mentioned above with the most mature effort being the mercedes amg offering and the most recent being the unplugged performance tesla which hasn t yet merged with telsa initially amg started like unplugged performance a separate entity that would take a stock oem car and turn it into a rebranded monster pcs have had several co branding efforts only one of which i was involved with and that was the hummer hardened laptop from itronix which sold reasonably well until the gm discontinued the hummer like the ferrari and the less known intel based lamborgini laptop these car branded laptops were somewhat co configured with their car brands still they never really rose to the potential that amd advantage and intel evo s extreme tuning are now showcasing co branding evolution these latest co branding efforts partially target apple which vertically integrates their products and provides a similar though less focused value proposition they also go where apple refuses to go in terms of co branding apple will not co brand and may not have to given the power of their brand to differentiate but apple has defunded brand advertising which means that its value is likely slowly depreciating making them more vulnerable to targeted efforts like microsoft surface and intel evo as apple moves into the car market while other carmakers embrace tech companies like amd blackberry intel nvidia and qualcomm there are additional co branding opportunities that go both ways and products that more tightly integrate with the increasingly intelligent cars that carry similar components while this may happen with smartphones and focused tablets first and my bypass pcs altogether we will increasingly see a level of care personal tech integration we ve never seen before and indeed as we move from smartphones and pcs to wearable cloud connected products the motivation to use fashion brands to differentiate those wearable offerings will increase resulting in some unique partnerships and cross brand mergers unless some of these companies are proactive much of this will likely follow apple s move to create integrated offerings that force the use of apple products in apple cars consistent with apple s long term lock in strategy wrapping up amd s new amd advantage strategy seems to be working very well and follows intel s so far successful evo effort but i expect this is only the beginning of a co branding trend that will expand out of technology suppliers these efforts will evolve into automotive gaming advocates and fashion markets to better attract an increasingly focused group of buyers who will pay more for a product more uniquely conjured for their individual needs we appear to be approaching a co branded wave that could do exciting things to markets and that will gain a lot more focus this pivot will be particularly pronounced after apple launches its cars and pc oem companies diversity efforts to penetrate the executive ranks with more women we may even see products co branded with major blockbuster movie brands for instance i think a captain america shield or iron man laptop might be interesting were they relatively exclusive and timed with a movie release and oh the hummer is coming back and it s connected maybe a hummer smartphone or laptop would again be exciting and profitable accessories we ll see but i expect that we will have a lot more exciting co branding and a ton more exciting pc designs by the end of the decade i can hardly wait
texas gov greg abbott signed a heartbeat bill into law in may barring abortions in the state as early as six weeks it went into effect on sept 1 update the supreme court voted 5 4 to deny an emergency appeal from abortion providers and reproductive rights groups to block the texas heartbeat act or senate bill 8 sb 8 the bill which went into effect on sept 1 bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected chief justice john roberts dissented along with the high court s three liberal justices justice sonia sotomayor justice elena kagan and justice stephen g breyer each of the four dissenting justices wrote separate statements expressing their disagreement with the majority previous update on sept 1 the texas heartbeat act also known as senate bill 8 sb 8 went into effect the bill bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected sb 8 differs from previous abortion bills passed in texas because the state s top attorney won t enforce it the public will the bill states this law will be exclusively enforced through private civil action several reproductive rights groups including the aclu and planned parenthood filed an emergency request with the u s supreme court asking it to block sb 8 on aug 30 kvue reports the filing comes after the fifth circuit court of appeals denied the plaintiffs request on aug 29 to block the law the supreme court has yet to act on an emergency appeal to put the law on hold previous report on may 19 texas governor greg abbott signed into law the texas heartbeat act also known as senate bill 8 sb 8 which bars abortions in the state as early as six weeks or after a fetal heartbeat has been detected in an email verify viewer cassie said she has recently been reading conflicting reports on whether or not the bill allows abortions in the case of rape or incest or if the mother s life is in danger the question does the new texas heartbeat bill senate bill 8 allow abortions in the case of rape incest or if the mother s life is in danger the sources the answer no the new texas heartbeat bill senate bill 8 does not allow abortions in the case of rape or incest but makes an exception if the mother s life is in danger what we found while senate bill 8 sb 8 does not mention allowing abortions in the case of rape or incest sec 171 205 does make an exception for medical emergency according to the bill a physician who performs or induces an abortion under medical emergency shall make written notations in the pregnant woman s medical record of the physician s belief that a medical emergency necessitated the abortion the physician must also make note of the pregnant woman s medical condition and maintain a copy of the notations made in the physician s practice records the new bill sb 8 does not allow an exception to the law for rape or incest and so if you are somebody who has been sexually assaulted or have been raped and you ve gotten pregnant as a result of that you will not be able to get an abortion after six weeks gestation in texas under this law drucilla tigner policy and advocacy strategist at the aclu of texas told verify there is an exception for what is called in the bill medical emergency which is kind of left up to the doctor to make that determination dr joe pojman executive director of texas alliance for life told verify that the pro life organization he founded in 1988 was adamant that there must be an exception included in sb 8 to allow a physician to terminate a pregnancy if the mother s life is in danger we have to have those exceptions for the life of the mother fortunately those cases are very rare with modern science but it could happen in the case of an ectopic in other words tubal pregnancy when the unborn child is developing not in the uterus of the mother but in a fallopian tube and if left unattended that fallopian tube could rupture the child will certainly die and it could risk the life of the mother through hemorrhaging so that has to be treated and the treatment is to take action to the end of pregnancy the intent of course is not to take the life of the child but to save the mother s life and an unintended result is that the child will die said dr pojman pojman says his organization did not recommend that the texas legislature include exceptions in the case of rape or incest we have to recognize that the terrible violent act of aggression of a rapist against a woman is an absolutely hideous act it s a bodily violation of that woman but the question is if in rare cases that that act results in the pregnancy of the woman what s the best thing for all parties involved and of course we re talking about the mother and the unborn child we do not think a compassionate society should advocate the death of the unborn child because of the terrible act of the father of the child that child is also an innocent victim just as the woman said pojman kelly hart the senior director of public affairs at planned parenthood of greater texas says sb 8 is unique in that the state of texas has decided to give up its enforcement authority and allow anyone including non texas residents to file a private lawsuit against anyone they believe helped a woman get an abortion we re not just talking about the doctors who provide the abortions we re talking about a counselor who gave a woman the phone number to an abortion health center we re talking about a friend who drove a person to get the abortion we re talking about another friend who loaned some money for that person to be able to afford the procedure hart told verify this is unique and dangerous basically allowing citizens who you know in most cases won t really know the medical history of the person and the people involved interfering with private medical decisions in this way sb 8 is currently facing opposition from licensed attorneys and licensed physicians in the state of texas prior to gov abbott s signage of the bill on may 19 both groups wrote open letters to the texas house of representatives to voice their concerns the bill which could be deemed unconstitutional due to the supreme court s roe v wade ruling in 1973 that legalized abortion in the u s is set to go into effect on sept 1 unless it is blocked by a lower court although roe v wade is the law of the land according to the guttmacher institute 18 states have passed laws in an attempt to ban abortion at or before 20 weeks those states include alabama arkansas arizona georgia idaho iowa kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and utah however most of the bans are not in effect because they have either been blocked by a court or are expected to be blocked in court on may 17 the supreme court announced that it will hear a case on mississippi s ban on nearly all abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy abortion rights advocates have voiced concern that the high court could soon decide to weaken abortion rights nationwide the supreme court has changed over the past four years the concern now is that the court is going to undermine or even overturn abortion rights and then bans like texas s six week abortion ban could go into effect said elizabeth nash the principal policy associate state issues at the guttmacher institute we re expecting a legal challenge to it very soon but should the supreme court weaken abortion rights then that s where people start to be concerned about whether or not this ban could go into effect we re worried that the new conservative majority on the supreme court might be willing to revisit roe v wade but there s almost 50 years of supreme court jurisprudence that backs up the constitutional right to abortion and we hope that the court will do its duty and follow that precedent and uphold the fundamental right and the constitutional right to accessing abortion said tigner meanwhile pojman says pro life advocates are hoping the supreme court will take a fresh look at the case and possibly allow states more latitude so they can better protect unborn children who are not yet viable

islamabad the woo the voter budget for the fiscal year 2021 22 reflects government s frustration with the international monetary fund mandated harsh economic policies and its desperation to give people something to feel good about the economy in last two years of its term before the next general elections the government changing gears to growth was first indicated when prime minister imran khan replaced dr hafeez shaikh with shaukat tarin as his finance team leader just weeks after the former had renegotiated the revival of the suspended 6bn imf programme the second indication came when mr tarin told the imf that the government was not prepared to hike taxes or electricity prices as agreed by his predecessor for the revival of the fund programme for the pti government luckily the covid 19 pandemic which devastated many economies during the last one and a half years didn t harm pakistan much even though the economy contracted by nearly 0 5pc during last year it recovered rather quickly from the impact of the pandemic and is poised to post a decent gdp growth of 3 9pc this fiscal providing a momentum for future growth the unprecedented growth of around 25pc in remittances sent by pakistanis working abroad the flow of cheap multilateral dollars to support the country fight the pandemic and the drop in imports owing to the contracting domestic demand have also provided the government enough room to tell the imf to back off at least for now more importantly the government feels that america s planned pullout from the neighbouring afghanistan has enhanced its leverage on washington not only to end the one of its longest wars but also in case pakistan agrees to provide air and land corridor to the us to launch urgent speedy strikes there if and when required while it is not clear as to what kind of concessions pakistan can get in return officials appear confident that the country s enhanced leverage would at least get the required relaxation from the imf and probably more funding to support government s growth agenda read the economy is growing but for whom coming back to the measures announced in the budget to boost growth mr tarin has announced unprecedented tax and other incentives for the businesses and the stock market at the same time he has promised to put cash in the pockets of the poor low middle income people through enhanced cash transfers and interest free loans the new budget is indeed a pro growth document that will create positive sentiments in the economy but risks remain says an analyst working for a financial institution the biggest challenge for the government in the implementation of its budget comes from the revenue side how will it attain its tax revenue target how will it fund its spending if the targeted revenues are not collected how does it plan to document the economy to expand the tax base is it really a priority for the government at all what plan does it have to restructure loss making state owned enterprises these are some of the questions that the budget does not answer he contends samir ahmed the chief executive officer ceo of knightsbridge capital group argues that the budget 2021 22 has nothing earth shattering in it and that is how it should be the economy already has a fair amount of momentum right now this is good considering we re coming off a two year stabilisation programme and one year of the covid 19 slowdown globally according to him with the country and rest of the world slowly returning to normal it is likely that this momentum will be intensified and decent gdp growth seen in the next year and the year after right now the government would be best advised to not do any harm and keep from taking major steps to stimulate the economy he says though some good small tax measures like reduction or removal of withholding taxes and turnover taxes are needed these are all good measures that will generate more economic activity and create ease of doing business rather than anything transformational published in dawn june 12th 2021
have we lost the ability from a bipartisan standpoint to look at things after they happen and learn any lessons whether it s the violence of january 6th or the war in afghanistan or the pandemic everyone is always posturing all the time pausing for perspective is not on the agenda former kansas senator presidential candidate world war ii vet bob dole recently wrote an op ed in the wall street journal about the nature of the never ending political campaign and why elected leaders don t want to give in on policy dole points out that in the past the boiling over of campaign rhetoric was followed by a long cooling off period candidates would say evil things about their opponent during the election then stop saying evil things once the election was over now the demonization never ends and there s no opportunity for anyone to get together to talk about anything in the op ed dole shared the story of democrat senator from south dakota george mcgovern at the funeral of pat nixon a reporter asked the 1972 presidential candidate why he had attended and mcgovern simply responded you can t campaign forever the memory of that conversation stuck with dole inspiring him to write about the need for political differences to be set aside for the sake of the common good so here we are on the tail end of a pandemic facing economic and societal uncertainty and the question persists are we capable of taking stock of our most recent actions judgments and decisions are we capable of considering whether we ve properly dealt with all of these crises to that end dole says it s time for the forever campaign to end so let s stop for a moment to consider a new crisis that s unfolded one that demands our attention listen to a new episode of the armstrong getty select cuts podcast for the details

when the big one hits will californians be ready for essential services to be out and to recover from the damage it s been three decades since two disastrous earthquakes shook california into looking more seriously at its seismic vulnerabilities in 1989 northern california was rocked by the loma prieta quake five years later the northridge quake hit southern california there is no question california has made some significant improvements on seismic safety since then the state moved to retrofit many freeway bridges and overpasses to better withstand violent shaking a number of seismically resilient hospitals have risen across california replacing ones that officials feared could collapse during a major temblor universities and other institutions have embarked on retrofitting efforts after decades of stalling some cities including los angeles and san francisco are demanding property owners strengthen apartments and other weak buildings advertisement but vulnerabilities remain and in ways the public does not always consider here are some points that seismic experts believe california needs to address from the pages of the times sewage systems could be unusable after an earthquake meaning californians would have to dispose of human waste in buckets or backyards daniel sulzberg for the times 1 vital utilities fail a huge earthquake in southern california would cause massive damage including some that would make recovery difficult advertisement officials have warned that the region could see major interruptions in power gas and other vital services due to quake damage one of the most ominous is the looming threat on the edge of southern california s sprawling metropolis the cajon pass it s a narrow mountain pass where the san andreas fault california s longest and one of its most dangerous intersects with combustible natural gas and petroleum pipelines electrical transmission lines train tracks and interstate 15 north of san bernardino a huge earthquake on the san andreas could move one side of the fault as much as 30 feet from the other such an earthquake would rupture flammable pipelines and lead to a catastrophic explosion so powerful it leaves behind a crater and if utilities aren t able to shut off the flow of petroleum or natural gas firefighters could be helpless to keep a raging wildfire from spreading across the san gabriel and san bernardino mountains just as the rest of southern california staggers from the worst earthquake it has seen in more than 150 years advertisement in recent years there has been a campaign to do something one way to reduce the risk of catastrophe at the cajon pass would be to put shutoff valves on both sides of the san andreas fault on petroleum and natural gas pipelines if the pipelines are automatically turned off during the earthquake it could prevent huge amounts of fuel from being ignited if the pipelines break studies have shown that burst water pipes could leave parts of southern california without running water for six months some experts point out that it s impractical to retrofit all of southern california s water pipes with earthquake resistant flexible versions in our lifetime but even some retrofitting would help in certain situations sewer lines could be unusable and people would have to dig holes or use buckets to contain human waste soft story buildings such as dingbat apartments need retrofitting to make them safer daniel sulzberg for the times advertisement 2 buildings collapse there are several types of buildings experts say are at greatest risk of collapse or major damage they include brittle concrete towers ubiquitous in business districts such as downtown hollywood beverly hills and the wilshire and ventura boulevard corridors wood apartment buildings with soft first stories which usually house carports like the one that collapsed in northridge in 1994 killing 16 people and steel skyscrapers potentially a u s geological survey simulation of a magnitude 7 8 earthquake in southern california said 50 brittle concrete buildings housing 7 500 people could completely or partially collapse and that it was plausible that five high rise steel buildings of a type known to be seismically vulnerable holding 5 000 people could completely collapse advertisement california here s what would happen if a huge quake hit los angeles disruptions from a major quake would be serious and long lasting here s what could happen in southern california if a large earthquake struck on the san andreas fault some cities have taken significant steps to make those buildings safer by requiring costly retrofitting aimed at protecting those inside and preserving the housing supply but many others have ignored the seismic threat and that has created an uneven landscape that in the coming years will leave some cities significantly better prepared to withstand a big quake los angeles and san francisco have been aggressively requiring retrofits of apartments and concrete buildings and there is a success story they can point to from the past los angeles was one of the first cities in california to require retrofitting of unreinforced brick buildings of about 8 000 buildings almost all have been retrofitted or demolished since a 1981 law in some cases los angeles officials had to go to court and threaten to label a building as unsafe barring anyone from being inside it advertisement no one died from brick building damage in the 1994 northridge earthquake an earthquake can turn the bricks in a chimney into projectiles daniel sulzberg for the times 3 foundations and chimneys older single family homes by and large are considered safer than bigger brittle concrete unreinforced masonry and soft story apartment buildings but there are some risks and solutions that experts have urged homeowners to consider brick chimneys are one they account for a common form of damage during larger california quakes advertisement when chimneys collapse bricks can become deadly projectiles at least 15 000 brick chimneys were damaged in los angeles during the 1994 northridge earthquake in napa in 2014 about half of residential buildings damaged were due to brick chimneys newsletter get earthquake ready in six weeks from building a kit to buying insurance our unshaken newsletter course will help you prepare enter email address sign me up you may occasionally receive promotional content from the los angeles times many california cities prohibit putting unreinforced brick chimneys in new homes others including los angeles have imposed stringent requirements that discourage homeowners from using brick advertisement older brick chimneys generally those built before 1980 are too stiff and brittle to withstand major shaking the mortar holding them together can be ground down across california older brick chimneys are generally not required to be reinforced and few have been strengthened or replaced minimal retrofitting options for a single family house usually cost less than 5 000 to keep bricks from falling through the roof during an earthquake one option is to add layers of plywood on the roof around the chimney another is to remove the upper part of the chimney which can twist and turn during shaking and replace it with metal a third option is to add a diagonal steel brace to the chimney advertisement even with those improvements the chimney still could collapse a more extensive retrofit which could cost tens of thousands of dollars involves removing the chimney or rebuilding it if the homeowner doesn t need the chimney to be functional the retrofitting could be as simple as placing a steel tube down the structure and filling it with concrete there are an estimated 1 2 million california homes with a deficiency that can render them unlivable after strong shaking it involves houses built before 1980 but especially before 1940 that are a few steps off the ground and have a crawl space between the living space and the ground the house sits on advertisement the problem is the homes haven t been properly braced and bolted to the foundation walls and wood beams that keep the house off the ground aren t fastened tightly to the ground and the lack of grip can cause the home to be shoved off the foundation as if the shaking has broken the building s knees and a rug has been pulled from underneath the home the basic fix involves bolting or anchoring the house to the foundation and adding plywood around the flimsy crawl space in southern california the typical cost for a bolt only retrofit is about 3 000 to 3 500 the median cost for a house that also needs plywood is 3 900 california your guide to retrofitting your home for earthquakes southern california s housing stock and propensity for earthquakes mean homeowners here need to pay special attention to foundations chimneys and more here s your guide to retrofitting this type of home is quite common throughout areas of california at high risk for significant shaking in the magnitude 6 earthquake that hit napa in 2014 retrofitted houses rode out the quake fine but some that were not strengthened were so damaged that residents were forced out of their homes advertisement though a retrofit can cost thousands of dollars repairing a broken house after an earthquake can cost hundreds of thousands the retrofit takes about two or three days requires a local government permit and can be performed by a contractor or a knowledgeable do it yourselfer a directory of contractors who have taken a free online federal emergency management agency training course on seismic retrofits of homes is on the state s website officials recommend homeowners obtain at least three bids before choosing a contractor advertisement research has shown that natural disasters take a toll on mental health daniel sulzberg for the times 4 mental health toll when a big earthquake strikes the public s attention immediately goes to the physically injured the dead or collapsed buildings but something else also starts the toll on mental health traumatic stress rises in the aftermath of a disaster researchers say one study examining survivors of 10 disasters found that one third had a post disaster diagnosis with post traumatic stress disorder being the most prevalent 20 followed by major depression 16 and alcohol use disorder 9 advertisement worsening mental health has been documented in a number of recent disasters including the aftermath of northridge and the magnitude 6 2 earthquake in new zealand in 2011 deteriorating mental health can sometimes be obscured by the phases of a disaster immediately after a disaster researchers have documented that there can be a community emotional high as people enter into a heroic rescue mode followed by a honeymoon period where a community bonds and there is unrealistic hope that everything can return to normal quickly but then there can be a long phase downward and it can be accompanied by stress exhaustion and fatigue experts say it s important that officials recognize the looming public mental health crisis before a disaster strikes after the feb 22 2011 christchurch earthquake some say mental health services fell short and people suffered others say they got good care and in subsequent years public health officials embarked on an innovative public mental health campaign called all right that sought to improve the community s mental health a tactic that came back to prominence after shootings at mosques led to the deaths of 51 people new zealand s worst mass killing in its modern history advertisement the pandemic taught us that product shortages remember empty shelves where paper products should have been are possible in a crisis daniel sulzberg for the times 5 supplies as the pandemic demonstrated our just in time economy is vulnerable to disruptions and shortages of supplies that can suddenly come under heavy demand whether it be paper masks or toilet paper residents are urged to stock up on key supplies ample water a gallon a day per person and per pet food medications spare eyeglasses warm clothes and blankets a stockpile of food water and medicine should last at least three days but ideally for at least two weeks advertisement you may also want to consider having a shovel or bucket handy an extensive outage of water or sewage service could result in people needing to dispose of human waste in their backyard if they have one the widespread and lengthy power outages in texas in february sparked by intense winter storms show just how critical it is to be prepared with supplies food supplies dwindled as power outages lasted far longer than most people expected the economic effects of an earthquake will touch households businesses and governments daniel sulzberg for the times advertisement 6 a vulnerable economy households businesses and local governments should come up with plans on how they ll deal with a disaster when it comes do people have enough savings to ride out a few months of economic instability do homeowners and renters have earthquake insurance which will help pay for hotel stays if your home is uninhabitable can local state or federal governments be ready to hand out stimulus checks to keep businesses running and people paid as new zealand did when christchurch was hit with an earthquake in 2011 and are local officials ready to make tough but speedy decisions on how their post quake city will look advertisement california how to talk to your kids about earthquakes you don t want to scare your kids but you do need them to be prepared for what to do before during and after the shaking of a major or even minor earthquake 7 communications out there hasn t been a major quake in california since cellphones smartphones and wifi became ubiquitous when the destructive northridge quake hit in 1994 landlines still ruled and the internet wasn t yet a central part of people s lives cell service can be crucial to the ongoing function of a society during and after a crisis widespread outages of cellphone networks after hurricanes or major storms have been a consistent problem in the united states interfering with recovery efforts in puerto rico after hurricane maria in 2017 residents roamed roads searching for signal cellphone towers on the east coast were disrupted after superstorm sandy in 2012 in japan it is required that cellphones have a 48 hour backup power supply said seismologist lucy jones author of the big ones how natural disasters have shaped us and what we can do about them advertisement there was some discussion as to whether such a standard should be required in los angeles to prepare for earthquakes but it became clear several years ago that neighborhood groups would oppose having diesel powered generators at wireless tower sites which would need to be tested monthly california lucy jones says this is the most important thing you can do to prepare for a quake people are much more important than kits people will help each other when the power is out or they are thirsty and people will help a community rebuild and keep southern california a place we all want to live after a major quake a prolonged power outage and lack of cell service can cause major problems for recovery the hardest hit areas in japan after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami ran through the 48 hours of backup supply the power wasn t coming back soon and that s when people gave up and started leaving the area in 2015 los angeles became the first city in the nation to approve seismic standards for new cellphone towers part of an effort to strengthen communications infrastructure in preparation for the next big quake advertisement the los angeles plan requires new freestanding cellphone towers to be built to the same seismic standards as public safety facilities cellphone towers are conventionally built only strong enough to not collapse and kill people during a major earthquake they re traditionally not required to be strong enough to continue working 8 the inside of your home the inside of homes can offer many hazards that can become potentially deadly projectiles in an earthquake like an unstrapped bookshelf or clothes dresser or an unsecured tv or microwave fixes before the shaking begins can be easy and cheap a trip to the hardware store or online can offer people tools to strap bookcases to walls and mount tvs

the spate of shareholder actions against biotech companies relating to covid 19 treatments shows no signs of stopping and now derivative lawsuits are following the initial wave of securities class actions for example late last week a shareholder of cytodyn inc brought a derivative action against certain officers and directors of the company cytodyn is a biotechnology company that has focused on the development and commercialization for a drug called leronlimab what was promoted as a potential therapy for hiv according to the complaint in 2020 cytodyn began promoting leronlimab as a treatment for covid 19 causing its stock price to rise but when it came out that marketing leronlimab as a covid 19 treatment was not a commercially viable development for the company the complaint alleges cytodyn s shares dropped significantly specifically the complaint alleges a cytodyn partner advisor and shareholder who is not named in the complaint participated in an interview in which he stated that cytodyn would be moving forward with the federal government program aimed at fast tracking virus treatments known as operation warp speed after his comments the stock rose precipitously just six days later however the wall street journal reported that the company was not being considered for operation warp speed and following the publication of the article the complaint alleges that cytodyn stock dropped over 17 despite this revelation the complaint alleges that the company continued to promote leronlimab as a covid 19 treatment re inflating the stock however after nearly 12 months of promotion cytodyn disclosed that its covid 19 studies had produced non statistically significant results the release of the test results again caused the stock to plummet the plaintiff also claims that while promoting leronlimab s covid 19 treatment capabilities company executives began selling millions of shares of cytodyn stock and made over 25 million in total proceeds the up and down nature of cytodyn s stock price over the course of the pandemic led to two securities class actions in this derivative complaint the plaintiff alleges defending these suits will cause the company to expend significant amounts of money the complaint was brought in the federal court in the western district of washington where cytodyn is headquartered as previously noted in this space however companies incorporated in delaware have recently begun adopting bylaws requiring shareholder derivative suits to be filed in delaware chancery court like those complaints the cytodyn complaint contains claims for breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment while also containing a federal count for alleged violations of sections 10 b and 20 a of the exchange act it remains to be seen whether cytodyn maintains a similar forum selection provision but check back here for additional updates as the case moves forward
lawmakers gave final approval this week to a bill directing maine s state government and pension fund to stop investing in fossil fuel companies as part of the global divestment movement in response to climate change but the sell off of stocks or other investments in fossil fuels wouldn t take place immediately and may never happen entirely because of a key clause that still gives broad latitude to the managers of maine s nearly 17 billion pension fund any plan that we come up with has to put the financial interests of our members first said sandy matheson executive director of the maine public employees retirement system thousands of institutions and governments around the world have committed to divesting an estimated 14 trillion from oil coal natural gas and other fossil fuel companies while colleges and universities have been among the highest profile divestment cases in the u s including maine s unity college the nation s first to announce a divestment plan nearly a decade ago several larger cities as well as new york state s 226 billion pension fund have pledged to move away from fossil fuels if the maine bill becomes law maine will be the first state where divestment is ordered by the state legislature the measure received final approval in the democratic controlled maine senate on thursday on an 18 15 vote one week after the house voted 80 57 largely along party lines to approve the measure gov janet mills a democrat has yet to signal her position on the bill but has made addressing climate change a top priority of her administration advertisement divestment advocates hailed the bill s passage as a landmark moment that helps put maine at the forefront at least among state governments of an international campaign that they say has solid ethical and financial footing youth climate activists environmental groups and state retirees led the fight for the bill in maine as the gulf of maine keeps heating so does the pressure on the fossil fuel industry divesting sends a truly powerful message and to have augusta join in adds real weight bill mckibben an author early advocate for divestment and c0 founder of the group 350 org said in a statement after the house vote this action is a gift to the planet and also to the pensioners of the pine tree state freeing them from the money losing investments in gas and oil that are also undercutting the landscape into which they will someday retire the bill l d 99 would require both maine s state treasurer and the board of the state pension fund known as mainepers to divest from fossil fuels by january 2026 that process would include selling off any current holdings and not investing in specific types of companies that either hold fossil fuel reserves operate coal fired power plants are involved in extraction or operate infrastructure used for fossil fuels treasurer henry beck said the state s cash pool investments are already fully compliant but that roughly 3 percent of 70 million in trust funds managed by his office are in energy companies beck who supported the bill called it a bold law that is consistent with the state s climate goals according to analysis provided to lawmakers roughly 1 2 billion or 7 7 percent of the 16 5 billion managed by mainepers is invested in fossil fuel related companies including oil and gas companies as well as utilities as of dec 31 2020 that is down from 9 2 percent a year earlier at mainepers which pays out roughly 90 million in benefits monthly to retired public employees and teachers but a legislative committee made a key change in response to concerns raised by mainepers that the original version could have forced the organization to violate the maine constitution specifically the amended bill will require divestment in accordance with sound investment criteria and consistent with fiduciary obligations advertisement in essence that fiduciary obligations phrase means mainepers cannot be forced to divest if it will hurt the pension fund s finances matheson the mainepers executive director said that language addition means the bill is now consistent with the constitution but a specific plan on how divestment would take place if the bill becomes law has yet to be developed what it means is our primary fiduciary duty under the maine constitution is to act in the best financial interest of the members so all of our decisions have to be in the best financial interests of the members matheson said on friday so we can t wholesale divest when that would create loss for the fund cassie cain youth engagement coordinator with maine climate action now and 350 maine said maine s bill could provide a template for similar discussions underway in california new jersey massachusetts colorado and other states cain acknowledged that the language change introduces some gray area in implementation of the bill her organization and others however will continue engaging with mainepers officials on the issue and will urge retirees and public employees who support divestment to keep pressure on their pension fund managers if this is the price that has to be paid having a bit more of an implementation time that s ok because this is still a very good precedent cain said one of the many factors that mainepers and other pension funds consider in investments is financial risk and fossil fuel companies have their share of risk these days as government leaders corporations and consumers commit to reducing planet warming emissions advertisement according to a recent analysis by carbontracker a think tank that analyzes the effects of the energy transition on capital markets global investors lost 123 billion in share value in fossil fuel companies between 2012 and 2020 while those fossil fuel companies significantly underperformed the stock market as a whole during that period shares for renewable or cleantech companies gained 77 billion and outperformed the market maine is establishing itself as a leader in climate action rep margaret o neil the saco democrat who was the lead sponsor of the bill told her house colleagues last week investments in fossil fuels pose a substantial risk to our retirees and compromise our efforts to position maine as a leader in the fight against climate change one recent incident underscores how that volatility can affect mainepers the private equity firm arclight partners llc lost hundreds of millions of dollars that it invested in an oil refinery in the u s virgin islands that had financial troubles reuters reported mainepers had invested 150 million in an arclight fund that lost more than a quarter of its value reuters said matheson said that investments are changing dramatically and those changes include a transition from fossil fuels toward renewable energy the investment opportunities of tomorrow are in green renewable alternative energies matheson said and that s where i see our portfolio going naturally without forcing it to do so advertisement opponents of l d 99 who were largely but not exclusively on the republican side of the aisle warned against the legislature meddling in mainepers financial decisions it is not up to us to direct a pension fund how to do what their specialty is and their specialty is investing said rep bruce bickford r auburn that is what they do we don t do that as a body it s not our role it s not our role either to pick winners and losers in the business community other opponents including representatives of the american petroleum institute also pointed out that some of the world s largest oil and gas companies are making major investments in renewable energy in recognition of the global transition away from fossil fuels instead of withdrawing all investment in such companies opponents argued mainepers and other investors could have a bigger impact by using their influence as shareholders to pressure companies to continue down the renewable energy path the bill is now headed to the governor for consideration mills can either sign the bill into law allow it to become law without her signature or veto it overriding a veto would require two thirds votes in both chambers of the legislature an outcome that appears unlikely given the votes on the bill send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

since a deadly outbreak of the virus began ravaging png in march border force and defence significantly boosted the number of vessels patrolling the northern torres strait islands of saibai boigu and dauan both agencies decline to outline the exact number of extra assets they have deployed in the area the increased abf and defence presence has brought the number of arrivals down to roughly one a week in recent months when a png boat makes it into australian waters border force s current policy is to intercept the vessel and direct it back but if one of passengers requires urgent medical attention they are allowed onto saibai island to be treated at the health clinic and are then tested for covid 19 a lot of people don t realise how close png is to an australian territory in saibai says border force navigation officer david hurley standing on a tender boat metres from the border between the two countries ever since the covid pandemic it s been pretty busy here we re always monitoring who is coming between saibai and png for hundreds of years the papuans have been allowed to come across and trade and use the australian medical facilities now during covid of course there s none of that allowed and we re spending a lot of time up here enforcing that building a different border the hard headed posture at the border has been central to keeping png nationals out of the northern islands of the torres strait but there have been other moves the department of foreign affairs and trade helped the png government establish a health clinic at mabaduan one of the closest png villages to the torres strait which has meant there is less of a reason to cross the border before the clinic was established png nationals in border villages had to travel up to two hours by boat to a hospital on the png island of daru australian border force abf regional commander of northern command colin drysdale on a fast response boat patrolling off thursday island credit kate geraghty colin drysdale commander of northern command at border force says there had been a lot of messages going out to the treaty villages that anybody seeking medical treatment should go to the mabaduan clinic if png nationals enter waters it has to be for an urgent medical reason for treatment he says there has been a lot of messages going out to the treaty villages about the dangers of covid reinforcing the fact that the borders are closed dfat along with the png government has also made rolling out vaccines in the area of png known as the south fly district a priority however it is believed less than half of frontline staff have been vaccinated in this area and the png government is still some way from vaccinating the whole population vaccine hesitancy australia has its own issues with vaccines on its side in the torres strait vaccine hesitancy is increasingly an issue when png was hit by its covid 19 outbreak in march queensland health moved quickly and 95 per cent of the northern islands were vaccinated with astrazeneca but the rollout was paused in april after australian health authorities advised the pfizer vaccine should be given to australians under 50 because of the remote possibility that astrazeneca caused blood clots the rollout then recommenced on may 17 but only about 65 per cent of residents in the northern islands lined up for their second jab queensland health has finished the two week rollout in the northern islands but authorities have not ruled out coming back norah tabuai a 37 year old teacher on saibai who received her vaccine last week says everyone needs to get vaccinated to be on the safe side norah tabuai receives her second astrazeneca covid 19 vaccination on saibai island from a queensland health nurse credit kate geraghty i don t want to get covid and suffer from that we are near to png it s a five minute drive in a dinghy over to there there s a huge risk of getting covid here the message out to the community is that it is important to get your vaccine you ll be safe further south in the main administrative hub of thursday island there is enough pfizer for the entire eligible adult population but just over 70 per cent of residents have received their first dose and only about 20 per cent have had their second stanley cook a 66 year old who looks after the community garden on thursday island says he has not yet received his vaccine and there is a lot of hesitancy about doing so on the torres strait islands a lot of people haven t got it he says stanley cook in his garden on the shoreline on thursday island credit kate geraghty somebody talks on the tv and says you get a blood clot or something like that so that s why they re a bit scared now that s torres strait they re always scared from anything they re scared from the government they re scared from the police they re scared from the needle everything dr tony brown executive director of torres and cape hospital and health service says he is concerned there is a sense of complacency in the area because they haven t yet had a case of covid 19 that s why i have been making it widely known that covid 19 will come at some stage he says eventually the virus will get across the border from papua new guinea or it will come up from the south because our borders will be open eventually loading and we really haven t got the capacity to come back and provide many more rollouts it s expensive it s absorbing a lot of our staff who have been diverted from other clinical duties it s a big deal for us brown says the negative energy that came out of the state and federal government on the blood clot issue with astrazeneca did have huge impact he says it is important to communicate with the public in a culturally sensitive way and to continually drive home the message that the vaccines were safe people had to alert the population of the risks but i think people don t understand risks particularly well especially when you re aboriginal and torres strait islander people who feel as though they ve had lots of reasons to be suspicious with how they re dealt with by society and the fact that we haven t tried this vaccine on that population particularly so they re not appreciating being the early adopters so to speak loading but we ve seen all over the world how covid once it gets to a critical point overwhelms systems and i can t imagine that papua new guinea is going to be any different in fact we know that port moresby has got to that point probably already we expect that the population at some stage will be overwhelmed and nothing s going to stop the huge migration of people coming down so that s what we fear that the system will be overwhelmed in papua new guinea and you ll have png nationals coming over for health reasons in the torres strait and they ll have covid joe rosta the director of the pharmacy on thursday island where the pfizer vaccines are kept in a special freezer at minus 60 degrees celsius says he believes the population is slowly starting to come around but the problem is the logistical nightmare in going back and doing the rollout again there s a lot of staff involved in trying to deliver this it s not as simple as some people might think just put up a clinic and people will just turn up rosta says we have to have a lot of community consultation prior to the clinic to ensure we do get a good turnout we need to speak to the public and really allay their fears that it s not a big conspiracy that the vaccine is actually going to be good for them rather than be detrimental to their health that s always a big battle no matter where you are joe rosta the director of pharmacy for torres and cape hospital and health service stands near the freezer at the thursday island hospital that contains the pfizer covid 19 vaccinations credit kate geraghty even though we haven t had covid up here for mine it s only a matter of time before we do get some cases we ve got papua new guinea just across the border which has got huge numbers there s more and more tourists coming up here now and it only takes one to have visited a place that has got covid picks it up and then coming through here china on the doorstep just before christmas last year concern swept through the torres strait islands after the png government signed a memorandum of understanding with a chinese company to build a 132 million fishing facility on the island of daru just across the border chinese fishing fleets have devastated local fish stocks in the offshore zones of many other countries in the indo pacific some chinese fishers are trained to assist the people s liberation army with fishing boats previously helping china s navy seize the philippines territory in the disputed south china sea loading the png government has since gone quiet on the matter and senior figures in the australian government believe the facility proposed by the chinese company fujian zhonghong fishery limited will never materialise fraser nai a former member of the torres strait island regional council says the fisheries between the torres strait and png are shared and there are quotas for each country for example the tropical rock lobster migrates through torres strait and comes in and out of the coast of png what happens on that side can really impact the resources on the other side for the next season he says if you ve got a big chinese company coming in that can really impact the resources that are shared on a bigger geopolitical scale australia is not that far from china the fact is our alliance is with the united states of america and we re forever joined at the hip with that so we re affected whatever goes on that way between those geopolitical plays we re directly in the middle a question of forces in the northern islands there are divergent views on whether the massive presence of border force and defence vessels should remain when the pandemic ends some clans on these islands are of mixed png blood and have loved ones across the border they haven t seen for more than a year others say they would like the treaty to be more tightly regulated so that border crossings don t return to pre covid

business combination in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination the sponsor or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete a business combination we would repay such loaned amounts in the event that a business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment up to 2 000 000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1 50 per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants we do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business however if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking in depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination moreover we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations assets or liabilities which would be considered off balance sheet arrangements as of march 31 2021 we do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships

our liquidation the underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of 0 35 per unit or 14 490 000 in the aggregate the deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement critical accounting policies the preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the periods reported actual results could materially differ from those estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies warrant liability we account for the warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering in accordance with the guidance contained in asc 815 under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities accordingly we classify the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the warrants to fair value at each reporting period this liability is subject to re measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations the fair value of the warrants was estimated using a binomial lattice model 16 common stock subject to possible redemption we account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic 480 distinguishing liabilities from equity common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value conditionally redeemable common stock including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control is classified as temporary equity at all other times common stock is classified as stockholders equity our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events accordingly common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity outside of the stockholders equity section of our condensed balance sheets net income loss per common share we apply the two class method in calculating earnings per share net income loss per common share basic and diluted for class a common stock subject to possible redemption is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the trust account net of applicable taxes if any by the weighted average number of shares of class a common stock subject to possible redemption outstanding for the period net income loss per common share basic and diluted for and non redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing net loss less income attributable to class a common stock subject to possible redemption by the weighted average number of shares of non redeemable common stock outstanding for the period presented recent accounting standards management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements

since a deadly outbreak of the virus began ravaging png in march border force and defence significantly boosted the number of vessels patrolling the northern torres strait islands of saibai boigu and dauan both agencies decline to outline the exact number of extra assets they have deployed in the area the increased abf and defence presence has brought the number of arrivals down to roughly one a week in recent months when a png boat makes it into australian waters border force s current policy is to intercept the vessel and direct it back but if one of passengers requires urgent medical attention they are allowed onto saibai island to be treated at the health clinic and are then tested for covid 19 a lot of people don t realise how close png is to an australian territory in saibai says border force navigation officer david hurley standing on a tender boat metres from the border between the two countries ever since the covid pandemic it s been pretty busy here we re always monitoring who is coming between saibai and png for hundreds of years the papuans have been allowed to come across and trade and use the australian medical facilities now during covid of course there s none of that allowed and we re spending a lot of time up here enforcing that building a different border the hard headed posture at the border has been central to keeping png nationals out of the northern islands of the torres strait but there have been other moves the department of foreign affairs and trade helped the png government establish a health clinic at mabaduan one of the closest png villages to the torres strait which has meant there is less of a reason to cross the border before the clinic was established png nationals in border villages had to travel up to two hours by boat to a hospital on the png island of daru australian border force abf regional commander of northern command colin drysdale on a fast response boat patrolling off thursday island credit kate geraghty colin drysdale commander of northern command at border force says there had been a lot of messages going out to the treaty villages that anybody seeking medical treatment should go to the mabaduan clinic if png nationals enter waters it has to be for an urgent medical reason for treatment he says there has been a lot of messages going out to the treaty villages about the dangers of covid reinforcing the fact that the borders are closed dfat along with the png government has also made rolling out vaccines in the area of png known as the south fly district a priority however it is believed less than half of frontline staff have been vaccinated in this area and the png government is still some way from vaccinating the whole population vaccine hesitancy australia has its own issues with vaccines on its side in the torres strait vaccine hesitancy is increasingly an issue when png was hit by its covid 19 outbreak in march queensland health moved quickly and 95 per cent of the northern islands were vaccinated with astrazeneca but the rollout was paused in april after australian health authorities advised the pfizer vaccine should be given to australians under 50 because of the remote possibility that astrazeneca caused blood clots the rollout then recommenced on may 17 but only about 65 per cent of residents in the northern islands lined up for their second jab queensland health has finished the two week rollout in the northern islands but authorities have not ruled out coming back norah tabuai a 37 year old teacher on saibai who received her vaccine last week says everyone needs to get vaccinated to be on the safe side norah tabuai receives her second astrazeneca covid 19 vaccination on saibai island from a queensland health nurse credit kate geraghty i don t want to get covid and suffer from that we are near to png it s a five minute drive in a dinghy over to there there s a huge risk of getting covid here the message out to the community is that it is important to get your vaccine you ll be safe further south in the main administrative hub of thursday island there is enough pfizer for the entire eligible adult population but just over 70 per cent of residents have received their first dose and only about 20 per cent have had their second stanley cook a 66 year old who looks after the community garden on thursday island says he has not yet received his vaccine and there is a lot of hesitancy about doing so on the torres strait islands a lot of people haven t got it he says stanley cook in his garden on the shoreline on thursday island credit kate geraghty somebody talks on the tv and says you get a blood clot or something like that so that s why they re a bit scared now that s torres strait they re always scared from anything they re scared from the government they re scared from the police they re scared from the needle everything dr tony brown executive director of torres and cape hospital and health service says he is concerned there is a sense of complacency in the area because they haven t yet had a case of covid 19 that s why i have been making it widely known that covid 19 will come at some stage he says eventually the virus will get across the border from papua new guinea or it will come up from the south because our borders will be open eventually loading and we really haven t got the capacity to come back and provide many more rollouts it s expensive it s absorbing a lot of our staff who have been diverted from other clinical duties it s a big deal for us brown says the negative energy that came out of the state and federal government on the blood clot issue with astrazeneca did have huge impact he says it is important to communicate with the public in a culturally sensitive way and to continually drive home the message that the vaccines were safe people had to alert the population of the risks but i think people don t understand risks particularly well especially when you re aboriginal and torres strait islander people who feel as though they ve had lots of reasons to be suspicious with how they re dealt with by society and the fact that we haven t tried this vaccine on that population particularly so they re not appreciating being the early adopters so to speak loading but we ve seen all over the world how covid once it gets to a critical point overwhelms systems and i can t imagine that papua new guinea is going to be any different in fact we know that port moresby has got to that point probably already we expect that the population at some stage will be overwhelmed and nothing s going to stop the huge migration of people coming down so that s what we fear that the system will be overwhelmed in papua new guinea and you ll have png nationals coming over for health reasons in the torres strait and they ll have covid joe rosta the director of the pharmacy on thursday island where the pfizer vaccines are kept in a special freezer at minus 60 degrees celsius says he believes the population is slowly starting to come around but the problem is the logistical nightmare in going back and doing the rollout again there s a lot of staff involved in trying to deliver this it s not as simple as some people might think just put up a clinic and people will just turn up rosta says we have to have a lot of community consultation prior to the clinic to ensure we do get a good turnout we need to speak to the public and really allay their fears that it s not a big conspiracy that the vaccine is actually going to be good for them rather than be detrimental to their health that s always a big battle no matter where you are joe rosta the director of pharmacy for torres and cape hospital and health service stands near the freezer at the thursday island hospital that contains the pfizer covid 19 vaccinations credit kate geraghty even though we haven t had covid up here for mine it s only a matter of time before we do get some cases we ve got papua new guinea just across the border which has got huge numbers there s more and more tourists coming up here now and it only takes one to have visited a place that has got covid picks it up and then coming through here china on the doorstep just before christmas last year concern swept through the torres strait islands after the png government signed a memorandum of understanding with a chinese company to build a 132 million fishing facility on the island of daru just across the border chinese fishing fleets have devastated local fish stocks in the offshore zones of many other countries in the indo pacific some chinese fishers are trained to assist the people s liberation army with fishing boats previously helping china s navy seize the philippines territory in the disputed south china sea loading the png government has since gone quiet on the matter and senior figures in the australian government believe the facility proposed by the chinese company fujian zhonghong fishery limited will never materialise fraser nai a former member of the torres strait island regional council says the fisheries between the torres strait and png are shared and there are quotas for each country for example the tropical rock lobster migrates through torres strait and comes in and out of the coast of png what happens on that side can really impact the resources on the other side for the next season he says if you ve got a big chinese company coming in that can really impact the resources that are shared on a bigger geopolitical scale australia is not that far from china the fact is our alliance is with the united states of america and we re forever joined at the hip with that so we re affected whatever goes on that way between those geopolitical plays we re directly in the middle a question of forces in the northern islands there are divergent views on whether the massive presence of border force and defence vessels should remain when the pandemic ends some clans on these islands are of mixed png blood and have loved ones across the border they haven t seen for more than a year others say they would like the treaty to be more tightly regulated so that border crossings don t return to pre covid levels i think it needs to because the face of the region is changing nai says fraser nai says the border force and defence may need a stronger presence even after covid 19 has waned credit kate geraghty

youghal ireland well yesterday we got the news if we have 100 000 in cash today at the present rate of inflation it will be worth only 95 000 by this time next year keep it up for 14 years and half your money will be wiped out barron s has the details on a year over year basis consumer prices increased 5 in may well above the prior month s 4 2 rate and the 4 6 expected print core cpi was up 3 8 from a year earlier up from a 3 pace in april and above the 3 4 rate economists predicted those are the fastest rates of consumer price inflation since june 2008 and june 1992 respectively but those are just numbers not even true numbers after the feds finish torturing them with their hedonic and seasonal adjustments they ll be ready to say anything so let s just try to figure out what is really going on not just numbers this week we ve been exploring inflation we noted that it is not just a matter of numbers or price increases prices are information they are meant to put their hand on the bible and swear to tell us the truth about what things are worth and what they cost but when the feds inflate the currency they suborn the witness yet despite the arm twisting bribery and tomfoolery the numbers are beginning to move forward durables were up more than 10 in may 2021 compared to may 2020 nondurables rose 7 4 services not including energy gained 2 9 and energy itself rose 28 5 and now say federal reserve governors don t listen to them they don t know what they re talking about they re just passing through things will be back to normal soon ulterior motive back to normal for the fed means something entirely different than what it means for us for them normal is a fantasy world in which they can inflate all they want but the price increases stay on wall street that is how normal has worked for the last 20 years the fed added 7 trillion to the nation s monetary footing the dow more than tripled of course there was nothing normal about it the fed was simply inflating the wealth of the top 10 of the population while deflating relatively the wealth of everyone else and therein we have our motive to make a long story short inflation is more like a handgun than a murder more a means to an end neither accidental nor unexpected than an end in itself you ll recall our definition of government it s how the elite control other people in order to protect and enhance their own power wealth and status in other words government is always and everywhere a scam in which the many are ripped off for the benefit of the few everything else is just detail screwy and absurd and by the beginning of the 21st century the coast was clear the old gold standard was long forgotten alan greenspan a shrewd opportunist had long since replaced paul volcker at the fed and the few remaining conservatives in congress who might have insisted on balanced budgets and honest monetary policy were disappearing the fed went to work over the next 20 years it inflated the money supply its balance sheet some 10 times that s 10 times more than it had added to the system in the previous 209 years and in the 12 months from march 2020 with a republican in the white house until january the fed added money at a 75 annual rate in the last full fiscal year the federal government spent 3 1 trillion more than it raised in taxes is it any wonder that meme stocks go wild that stimmy checks keep the zombies moving that tesla tsla is going to the moooon and jeff bezos is blasting into space it s screwy and absurd but it s not all goofy fun elite heist a high price is not the same as a false price and a fraud is not the same as an error over the last 20 years the elite who control the federal government and the federal reserve used inflation like thieves use handguns to shift wealth from other people to themselves they inflated the elite sectors wall street government education medical care big business while earnings and household wealth for most people slumped wages in manufacturing where they make things actually went down here s a little item that is making its way around the twittersphere since 1978 ceo compensation rose over 1 000 and only 11 9 for average workers for many years we ve been mostly alone in noticing a lonely kook loquendo solo pro se neither conservatives nor liberals democrats nor republicans believed it the money will trickle down said republicans it will stimulate the economy and help the poor said the democrats besides if we can get control in the next elections they each told voters everything will be put right inflation scam continues and the grift continued under george w bush the fed s key interest rate was dropped 500 basis points in the recession 9 11 hysteria of 2001 causing the housing bubble of 2005 2007 next the quantitative easing program under barack obama took it up a notch putting 3 6 trillion of new money into wall street then along came the maga man with even bigger deficits more spending and an

almost 5 000 kilometres long the paraná is one of the longest lowland rivers in the world yet it has less and less water prompting uncertainty among experts as to the causes of a phenomenon that hampers many of the river s biological and commercial functions lower rainfall in the region has impacted the river s flow which has dropped to less than half of historical averages this affects its navigability and concerns agribusiness since a large part of grain crop harvests from argentina southern brazil and paraguay are exported via the ports of santa fe the low water level considered the most severe in 50 years cost exporters us 244 million in 2020 as vessels were unable to operate or load normally according to the rosario stock exchange this has meant argentine exporters are failing to capitalise as much as they could on high global prices for agricultural commodities there is no certainty as to whether this water scarcity is temporary or marks the beginning of a new cycle of low water as was witnessed last century nor is there unanimity about the causes although experts have variously pointed to deforestation damming in southern brazil and climate change to complicate the situation further the reduced river flow coincides with the end of a concession for dredging and signalling processes necessary for its navigability belgian company jan de nul had the concession for 25 years and will now compete to retain it new river or historical cycle the paraná is much more than its main channel it is a river system with a vast network of secondary channels valleys and floodplains that are modified by the pulses of floods and low flows typical of this ecosystem it is a giant whose extensive basin covers 2 6 million square kilometres as much as the surface area of continental argentina said carlos ramonell a geologist specialising in the evolution of the fluvial landscape at the universidad nacional del litoral its characteristic brown colour is due to the sediment it carries from the rivers of northwestern argentina such as the bermejo in addition to transporting these solids an impressive 17 000 cubic metres of water flow per second mainly via the upper reaches of the basin located in brazil and also the paraguay river it was this flow of rainwater from the upper paraná and the paraguay that ceased in the southern hemisphere s spring of 2019 due to unusually low rainfall ramonell explained however the expert said that records for the 20th century show significant variation while between 1930 and 1970 there was a period of markedly lower flow from 1970 to 2000 they remained high climate change ramonell says generates more doubt than certainty about the reasons for the reduced levels it is an exaggeration to link this drop to anthropogenic climate change i think that this could displace other issues that do have a superlative impact on the river system such as deforestation canalisation and dams he added however juan borus a researcher at the national water institute says that the causes are of a clearly climatic order the rainfall pattern began to alter in mid 2019 and periods of scarce precipitation have become more frequent ever since he said the end of the drought and low water is not yet in sight it is likely that the la niña will return later and we know that this does not favour the production of near normal rainfall in our region let alone that the rainfall will be significant enough to produce a noticeable recovery borus says low water low trade the lower flow of water in the paraná affects navigation makes port manoeuvres more difficult and reduces the loading capacity of large ships translating into higher costs gustavo idígoras president of the argentine oilseed industry chamber ciara said he was very concerned about the low water level adding it has negative effects on navigability which causes delays ships get stuck and there are stoppages idígoras said some 4 500 large ships enter and leave the paraná every year taking out most of argentina s agricultural production the low flow puts the flow of exports at risk he said the energy and other sectors are also affected seventy percent of the compressed natural gas imported by argentina comes through the waterway the automotive and steel industries also rely on it ciara is aware that a new climate scenario could affect how it does business we see that there are cycles of drought returning with great force in south america this is going to affect the region and works have to meet these needs while protecting environmental aspects we stress the need for more in depth and detailed studies idígoras said alfredo sesé an analyst at the rosario stock exchange said that the low flows make it necessary to be more careful when loading generating logistical cost overruns that are difficult to quantify the low flows also affect land locked south american countries paraguay and bolivia for whom the paraná is the main channel for commercial river transit commercial navigation is at its most intense during the harvest peak s of the southern hemisphere s autumn ships and barges require the greatest possible depths as well as a generous channel width for safe navigation fluvial highway amid these challenges argentina is discussing a new concession for the management of the waterway the commercial name given to the paraná of its total length from the source in brazil to its mouth in the rio de la plata 3 500 kilometres of the paraná s river are managed waterways the concession covers a 1 300 kilometre stretch this part consists of a port hub made up of some 25 terminals owned by large multinationals that moved some 82 million tonnes of grain crops flour and oils in 2019 making it the most important agro exporting port node in the world according to estimates by the rosario stock exchange bcr for sesé the waterway plays a fundamental role in argentina s grain trade since 80 percent of grain crops by products and oil shipments travel along the waters of the paraná paraguay and bolivia also bring their production down to the major ports on barges the concession for the dredging and maintenance of the waterway interests five large groups among them china s shanghai dredging company aside from current concessionaire jan de nul the others are belgium s dredging international and the dutch boskalis and van oord covid 19 the death of argentina s transport minister mario meoni and political disagreements over whether the waterway should be operated by a public or private company have led to argentina extending the current concession until the end of july however there is no certainty over when and how the new tender will be launched according to idígoras it won t happen until april next year new investments should ensure the deepening of some sections to allow larger vessels to enter and leave with full loads the depth with normal water is 34 feet and the depth in critical passages is 36 feet it is projected to reach 42 feet deep in specific areas sesé said for idigoras having a deeper waterway with greater safety depth more roads and better signalling will allow them to face the current climatic challenges that he believes are here to stay this article originally appeared on the diálogo chino website it is reproduced with permission from the publishers for more visit
