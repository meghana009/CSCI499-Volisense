on the investor relations portion of our website in our earnings release slide presentation and financial supplement i would now like to turn the call over to mark and robin for their prepared remarks mark pearson thank you isil and good morning everyone thank you for joining our call today our first quarter results highlight the resiliency of our broad range of retirement asset management and advice businesses against the backdrop of turbulent financial markets inflationary pressures and rising interest rates eqt continues to post positive net inflows and strong free cash flow generation on slide 3 i will provide a high level overview of the results before handing over to robert for a detailed look at the quarter equitable holdings generated 548 million in non gaap operating earnings or 1 36 per share up 1 year over year reflecting a 4 increase in assets under management as a reminder we reinsured nearly 1 3 of our legacy block to venerable last june and our earnings still increased year over year even though the first quarter of 2021 reflected earnings from those reinsured policies adjusting for onetime items in the quarter principally excess death claims relating to the ongoing pandemic non gaap operating earnings were 1 53 per share up 13 year over year on a comparable per share basis we added 12 billion in net flows in the quarter with positive net flows in both retirement and asset management and this was our highest quarter of retirement net flows since our ipo with our diverse businesses we remain well positioned to advise and address the growing demand to protect the financial future of americans who are confronting greater economic uncertainty ab had another exceptional quarter 7 straight quarters of positive net flows realizing a 1 year over year fee rate increase enabled ab to post an adjusted margin of 31 5 an impressive showing by seth and his team with the dramatic style shift we have seen in recent quarters it is encouraging to see 75 of our value products outperforming their benchmarks in the quarter and versus morningstar peers 81 of our equity assets outperformed over the 5 year period our capital management strategy remains the same to apply fair market values to our balance sheet invest in our market leading businesses pay a competitive dividend and return excess capital to shareholders through stock buybacks cash generated is on track for 1 6 billion in 2022 up approximately 30 since our ipo in 2018 based on today s market capitalization we are generating a free cash flow yield of approximately 12 furthermore we ve shown through the covid period an ability to generate free cash flows across a variety of economic scenarios we also have an update to the ldti accounting changes in february we gave guidance that at 2021 year end market levels the adjustment to book value would be within our 2 billion aoci balance with no impact to our cash flows at first quarter end interest rate levels our ldti book value adjustment was neutral and as of the end of april we would in fact estimate a positive ldti transition impact that is book value would increase this reflects that actual interest rates have risen in the quarter and are higher than the 2 25 long term assumption we ve been using in our gaap reserves equitable continues to create long term value for all stakeholders our long term guidance of 8 to 10 eps cagr is supported by growth in our leading retirement asset management and affiliated distribution businesses this diverse range of businesses is unique to eqh in addition we have productivity initiatives and incremental general account income through shifting the investment portfolio to higher quality longer duration and more illiquid investments in the quarter we expanded our private asset origination capabilities with alliancebernstein reaching agreement to acquire carval investors which will add expertise in distressed credit renewable energy specialty finance and transportation combined with carval ab will now have an approximate 50 billion private markets platform and will be well placed to meet the growing demand for alternative investment strategies i m also pleased to report that msci has recognized our progress in our sustainability efforts and upgraded our rating from bbb to a turning to slide 4 our retirement asset management and affiliated distribution businesses differentiate eqh and drive our strategy to pivot to capital light products which accounted for more than 85 of premiums in the quarter the acquisition of carval is a good example of synergies between our 2 operating companies equitable financial has committed 10 billion from its general account towards ab s private markets platform of this 750 million will be allocated across carval strategies improving risk adjusted returns and strengthening our efforts to grow higher multiple higher margin businesses we are benefiting from our early moves in the secure income market ab closed a 10 billion custom target date fund and resulted in our group retirement business receiving a 530 million allocation this is a perfect example of how we participate in the full value chain by having both asset management and retirement businesses we are proud to be an early innovator delivering in plan guaranteed income solutions ab has been offering secure income solutions for 10 years now obviously we are meeting an important social need providing participants with personalized target date funds during their working years and a guaranteed income stream in their retirement years through ab and equitable synergies and our partnership with blackrock we are well positioned to grow as lifetime income gains traction post the secure act which allows sponsors the ability to incorporate annuities into their 401 k turning to our businesses our retirement business continues to be our most significant contributor amounting to 80 of earnings and approximately 2 3 of free cash flow generated in a year following the venerable transaction in the second quarter of last year which unlocked 1 2 billion of value account values today stand at 152 billion as a result of this reinsurance and a decade long derisking program coupled with a change in sales mix and expected legacy outflows our retirement business today has less than 18 of account value in legacy va products we had a strong quarter in both individual and group retirement with new sales up 35 over the prior year s first quarter and positive net inflows with new capital light sales more than offsetting our expected legacy outflows our rila product structured capital strategies continue to be the market leader in its category and we saw our strongest month of sales on record in march in protection solutions we continue to see demand for our life products first year premiums are up 23 year over year and total gross premiums are up nearly 36 over the same period to 1 billion this quarter has seen net excess mortality on our in force of 61 million on a post tax basis and is within our covid guidance of a 30 million to 60 million operating earnings impact per 100 000 u s deaths while still preliminary early indications of our realized excess mortality in the month of april remain within our guidance despite turbulent markets ab continues its standout performance record active equities grew for the ninth quarter in a row and municipals grew for the seventh both bucking industry wide outflow trend offsetting these results was taxable fixed income we saw higher outflows in the face of the worst quarterly fixed income returns in 40 years overall annualized organic aum growth was up 6 year over year and the average fee rate grew 1 investment performance remains strong and as of quarter end 69 of u s assets and 63 of luxembourg assets were rated 4 and 5 stars by morningstar ab s 200 plus private wealth managers with a focus on high net worth clients delivered 2 billion in net inflows in the quarter end and is responsible for 117 billion or 16 of ab s total aum equitable advisors continue to show positive momentum in broker dealer investment products with gross sales of 3 billion in the quarter strong net flows and favorable markets over the last year have continued to drive aua growth closing the quarter at 79 billion up 13 year over year as we continue to see our affiliated distribution becoming a more significant component of the equitable holdings story we continue to see an increasing focus on holistic life planning through our 4 300 strong advisor force as of the quarter end we have over 1 500 advisors who have completed the initial phase of our holistic life planning training program we also recently launched a coaching certification program in partnership with columbia university and expect strong advisor engagement in this program positioning us for increased demand for holistic life planning on page 5 we show the growth in earnings and cash flow generation since our ipo throughout this period with record low and volatile interest rates a global pandemic and now rising inflation our fair value economic management policy has protected earnings cash flows and enabled consistent capital return to shareholders we have grown our earnings over 30 from 1 9 billion at the time of the ipo to approximately 2 5 billion today cash generated by our businesses is on track for 1 6 billion in 2022 also up 30 since our ipo in 2018 and based on quarter end market cap we are generating a free cash flow yield of 12 importantly we expect to generate this cash flow absent the earnings from the legacy block we reinsured venerable last year which monetized 1 2 billion of value leading to an additional 500 million of capital return last year with the remainder to be returned over time we ve also increased our nonregulated cash flow to approximately 50 of the total thereby increasing our financial flexibility while we recognize that markets are impacted by macroeconomics and we are not immune from equity and credit markets we focus on long term value the condition of our balance sheet is not dependent on interest rates protecting the promises we make to our clients and the certainty of our cash flows further our business is positioned to benefit from rising equity markets and higher new money yields as credit spreads widen these turbulent markets remind consumers of the value of guarantees that only firms like equitable can manufacture and paired with our growing financial planning orientation and the rise in interest rates enabling stronger retirement guarantees we remain optimistic about the vigor of our commercial businesses and our ability to generate fair value profits we continue to believe that the ability to generate cash flows is the best way to value equitable holdings and indeed our industry i will now turn the call to robin for further details on our results robin robin raju thanks mark before highlighting results for the quarter i would like to spend a moment discussing our estimated ldti transition adjustment on slide 6 last quarter we disclosed our estimated book value adjustment would be within our aoci balance at year end which was approximately 2 billion as mark mentioned interest rates increased significantly in the quarter with the 10 year up 80 basis points and the forward curve increasing from 2 5 to nearly 3 as of quarter end as a result the benefit of increasing our near industry low 2 25 gaap interest rate assumption to the forward curve minimizes the impact of fair valuing our gmib sop reserves under ldti leading to a neutral ldti book value adjustment as of quarter end i m also pleased to report that as of april month end market conditions our estimated ldti book value adjustment is positive our positive book value adjustment highlights an important aspect that ldti is trying to resolve today companies have discretion and can choose the interest rate they incorporate into their reserves if the assumption is higher than the forward curve the assumption reflects a bet that interest rates will increase above and beyond current market expectations companies with higher interest rate assumptions hold less reserves which in turn may put shareholder cash flows at risk equitable believe in a fair value approach means we can appropriately reserve and deliver capital returns without making bets on interest rates the forward curve represents the market view of interest rates and currently assumes the fed will continue to increase interest rates approximately 7 more times over the next 2 years within our economic model we manage our in force and hedging program based on the forward curve as we believe managing to actual market rates is more appropriate than making our own assumptions on future interest rate levels we remain well positioned for the upcoming ldti transition in 2023 and expect our gaap balance sheet to be more stable due to better alignment between our gaap reserves and our fair value economic reserves as a result shareholders should expect to see consistently positive net income reflecting a more economic match between our assets and liabilities turning to slide 7 i will review our consolidated results for the first quarter before providing more detail on segment results and our capital management program adjusting for notable items in the period non gaap operating earnings were 615 million this quarter or 1 53 per share up 13 year over year on a per share basis we called out 67 million of notable items in the quarter primarily attributable to elevated mortality and dac updates to our in force which were partially offset by higher alternative income adjusting for notables our increase in earnings year over year was primarily driven by higher fee income on higher average aum turning to gaap results we reported net income of 573 million this quarter and our hedge program performed as expected with a hedge effectiveness of approximately 95 aum increased to 856 billion over prior year quarter supported by favorable equity markets and continued positive net flows reflecting the strength of our retirement and asset management businesses our general account is benefiting from increasing rates and widening credit spreads with new money yields approximately 50 basis points higher than assets rolling off the portfolio as of quarter end this creates a natural tailwind for our business and should benefit our rebalancing program we expect to reach our yield enhancement target earlier than anticipated with 180 million of our 180 million 2023 run rate target already achieved we ve also continued to make progress on our expense initiatives realizing 35 million of our 85 million net target looking ahead we expect to realize meaningful savings over the next 2 years as we optimize our real estate footprint and reap the benefits from an agile workforce moving to the business segments i will begin with individual retirement on slide 8 as a reminder the venerable transaction closed in june of last year unlocking 1 2 billion in value while reducing over 2 3 of our legacy va risk resulting in an adjustment of 180 million to operating earnings per annum adjusted for notable items operating earnings were 307 million for the quarter lower year over year primarily due to the impact associated with the venerable transaction we continue to see strong demand for our individual retirement all weather products with protected equity guaranteed income and tax efficient investment offerings resonating with clients during a period of volatility and rising interest rates we reported positive net flows in the quarter as we continue to benefit from our product suite and differentiated distribution with 655 million of inflows in our capital light product offering partially offset by the runoff of our legacy va business in the quarter we also maintained our 1 position in the protected equity rila market reporting 2 billion in structured capital strategy sales up 10 from prior year and record sales in the month of march total individual retirement first year premiums were 2 8 billion a 17 increase year over year we continue to see rational pricing in the rila market and our continued success is the testament to our distribution model which pairs our 4 300 affiliated advisors with targeted third party selling partnerships importantly our strong new business activity is focused on creating value not only volume we build and price our products to maximize the value of new business which measures the present value of risk adjusted cash flows as interest rates have increased in the quarter our value of new business continues to be at record levels which will improve future shareholder returns over time turning to group retirement on slide 9 we reported operating earnings less notable items of 149 million up 7 versus the prior year quarter driven by lower expenses and higher fee revenues positive net flows of 523 million in the quarter were primarily driven by inflows from ab s lifetime income strategies this is another proof point of the synergies between our subsidiaries ab s lifetime income provides a significant distribution channel for our retirement business providing access to large 401 k plans which is a market our retirement business did not serve today furthermore given our unique business model eqh benefits from margins on both retirement and asset management manufacturing our tax exempt market is driven by our industry leading affiliated distribution in the quarter we reported positive net inflows with first year premiums up 7 year over year which returned to pre pandemic levels outpacing first quarter 2019 sales our continued leadership in the k 12 educator s market is a testament to our 1 100 dedicated equitable advisors specializing in the retirement needs of over 800 000 educators we serve now turning to alliancebernstein on slide 10 operating earnings were 136 million up 12 year over year primarily driven by an increase in base fees on higher average aum and performance fees in the quarter while interest rates moved significantly higher in the quarter we maintained strong fixed income performance with 64 of fixed income assets outperforming over the 1 year period and stronger long term performance with 72 and 71 of fixed income assets outperforming over the 3 and 5 year periods respectively equity performance remained strong relative to peers with 68 of equity assets outperforming on a 1 year basis and 81 of outperformance over 5 years the strong investment outperformance is leading to strong flows across their retail institutional and private wealth channels total gross sales of 41 billion were up 23 year over year including 21 billion in retail sales which is the fifth consecutive quarter of retail sales over 20 billion our institutional channel reported 14 billion in gross sales including a 9 6 billion retirement mandate supporting record net inflows of 10 billion and the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth the private wealth channel which represents approximately 1 3 of ab s fee based revenues reported gross sales of 6 billion up 12 year over year with 2 billion of net inflows and 7 annualized organic growth year over year total assets under management at the end of the quarter were 735 billion up 5 from the prior year quarter attributable to positive net inflows for the last 12 months including 11 billion this quarter and favorable markets importantly over this period annualized organic aum growth of 6 was supplemented by a 1 fee rate growth moving to protection solutions on slide 11 we reported operating earnings less notable items of 96 million up over prior year primarily driven by higher net investment income and higher fee revenue and higher account value gross written premiums were 1 billion in the quarter up 36 over prior year quarter as we continue to make strides shifting towards less interest sensitive accumulation vul products with first year premiums up 65 year over year we were saddened to see over 150 000 u s deaths in the first quarter it s hard to believe that we ve been at this pandemic for over 2 years now with so many lives impacted across the world equitable s life products serve an important need during these difficult times and we will continue to be there for our clients in their times of need through the end of march excess covid mortality was 61 million which were made within our guidance of 30 million to 60 million operating earnings per 100 000 u s deaths we maintain our current covid guidance but expect better mortality with the u s debt estimate in the second quarter decreasing significantly and are encouraged by preliminary death claims we are seeing in april we remain confident in our 75 million quarterly earnings guidance going forward but do expect some potential volatility due to mortality turning to slide 12 our fair value management of the business continues to support our capital management program we have made significant progress towards our 2022 capital management targets to date returned 461 million to shareholders including 279 million of first quarter repurchases and an additional 112 million of 2022 share repurchases that were accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2021 to further support our capital return we intend to increase our quarterly dividend to 0 20 per share at 0 02 per share increase we have consistently increased our dividend since our ipo up 50 demonstrating the financial strength of our balance sheet and business model we also continue to deliver on our 50 to 60 payout ratio and as mentioned earlier shareholders continue to benefit from our diverse businesses who have retirement asset management and affiliated distribution which resulted in our expected 1 6 billion of annual cash flow generation up from 1 2 billion at our ipo we closed the quarter with 1 5 billion of cash at the holdco which aligns with our capital management strategy of maximizing financial flexibility to support consistent capital return in various market cycles lastly we continue to make progress on the redundant reserves associated with reg 213 we expect to announce mitigated actions for the remaining redunded reserves in the second half of 2022 i ll now pass it back to mark mark pearson thank you robin before we turn to your questions i would like to reiterate some highlights from the quarter first our business model benefits from our complementary asset management and retirement businesses with strong net inflows in the quarter and an increasing contribution from our affiliated distribution second our fair value economic approach which is the result of management action over the last decade is more toward today than it has ever been protecting our balance sheet and preparing us well for alignment to ldti with no impact on our hedging program or cash flows and lastly our unique business model pairing asset management and retirement continues to drive long term accretive growth to our shareholders going forward we remain committed to acting as a force for good to bridge profits and purpose as we execute against our investment and expense initiatives to deliver on our 8 to 10 eps growth with that i d like to open the line for your questions question and answer session operator our first question comes from ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger i guess i ll ask probably the obvious one first robin is there can you expand at all on the potential actions that you would take in the second half of the year to mitigate the reg 213 impact robin raju ryan thanks for the question as we ve mentioned in the past we continue to work in parallel to address the remaining redundant reserves to reg 213 we ve taken action last year to address 50 of it the remaining actions will be resolved either through external or internal reinsurance and we ve continued to make progress in the first quarter and we re confident that our ability to mitigate it in the second half of the year ryan krueger okay got it and then can you give any more color on i know you don t give the rbc ratio quarterly can you give any more color on the performance on a statutory basis given the volatile market environment mark pearson sure as you mentioned we don t disclose quarterly and we haven t completed our control process but what i could tell you is just a reminder that we do have 2 hedging programs in place that work well during these volatile times the first one helps us fully hedge the economic risk associated with the liabilities on the guarantees that s where we hedge fully equity and interest rates to the forward curve and the second one is where we have the statutory hedge program designed to protect cte98 both performed well and exceeded the 95 efficiencies and these programs gives us comfort in the 1 6 billion guidance that we ve given to the market today on the 2022 cash flow generation and allows us to continue to invest in the strong new business profitability that we have coming out of our insurance and asset management companies operator our next question comes from tom gallagher tom gallagher my first question is from slide 5 it looks like 100 million of your 1 6 billion of cash flows is expected to come from your distribution business can you comment on whether or not that s some capital release there or is that actually a normalized free cash flow result from that business that you would expect to sustain mark pearson sure tom that s right of the 1 6 billion you could expect approximately 100 million coming from the distribution business that is normal cash flow generation we d expect on a run rate business from the business and we expect that to continue to grow as our affiliated distribution continues to sell profitable products and help advise our clients during these volatile times tom gallagher got you and then and robin just on the 2 billion impact from reg 213 is that should we think about that as being sort of permanently locked in or is that a sliding scale that might change and in particular just given how weak the markets have been lately would that 2 billion number potentially change if we were to mark that to market robin raju sure so just for context for everyone the 2 billion of redundant reserves of which we addressed 1 billion already through the actions we took in 2021 the remaining 1 billion would have some market movement tom but i think it s still a good number because we look at it in relation to cte98 and that s the number we anticipate in mitigating in the second half of the year tom gallagher okay and if i could just slip one more in on the reg 213 initiative on freeing up that extra 1 billion of capital should we assume that that s kind of where you re going to stop here with strategic actions or would you be looking to do more including the legacy va block or other things from a risk transfer standpoint robin raju sure all deals that we look at need to be accretive on an economic basis that s how we look at if a deal is good or not and when we should do a deal we do like the position we are right now with our retirement business only 18 of the aum is in that legacy va business with about 3 billion runoff on an annual basis over time if we can accelerate that again being economically accretive we d certainly take a look operator our next question comes from andrew kligerman with credit suisse andrew kligerman robin maybe on the individual retirement segment you had 307 million of earnings ex notables and the number seems often obviously the equity markets are playing a big role in that but barring the decline in equity markets now just assuming it didn t happen could you give us a sense of where a run rate might be on that earnings number i know you ve got some expense savings to come i know there s some seasonality but i d like to kind of if you could get a sense of where to kind of base that individual retirement going forward robin raju sure difficult for me to ignore equity markets during this time as you can imagine andrew but i ll try the best the 307 million keep in mind that excludes venerable venerable unlocks 1 2 billion of value reduced the risk of that segment by 2 3 but adjusted earnings by 180 million per annum on a run rate perspective you should expect seasonality for the fees charged on benefits the benefit fees are charged annually and q2 and q3 are generally the highest quarters when those fees are charged based on historical sales more importantly the risk profile and the cash generation on the 106 billion of aum in the retirement business remains strong and as you can see the new business returns are at record levels and so we re really excited about the trajectory of that business andrew kligerman and with that robin the seasonality i mean should i be thinking about it in the magnitude of a few tens of millions in seasonality or something much smaller any kind of framing there robin raju yes that s probably about as much detail that i would provide at this time especially given the equity market volatility that we see as it is something that i can t ignore but the seasonality q2 q3 expect to be higher that s probably what i can provide at this time andrew kligerman got it okay and then just a second question would be on group retirement and that lifetime income flow that appears to have been more than 500 million into through alliancebernstein relationship what s the pipeline like for that and could we see more of these 0 5 billion type inflows mark pearson andrew it s mark thanks for the question yes i think as robin said in the script this is a perfect example of the benefits we have from our business model if you like getting margins from the full value chain there having both retirement and also asset management you should expect that this type of business is lumpy and when it comes it will be large and one thing i d like to say on there is ab has been working in this area for 10 years now way before the secure act so it s something ab and equitable have a deserved market reputation for and it s something we re excited about in the future but it will be lumpy that s for sure operator our next question comes from nicole della cava with morgan stanley nigel dally it s nigel dally i think that may be for me i just wanted to follow up on reg 213 when the solution is in place would that be a catalyst for you to be more aggressive on capital management our excess capital on balance sheet is still very high or are we in a market environment where you prefer to hold on to a higher capital buffer at this point robin raju sure reg 213 the way we see it doesn t necessarily dictate how we distribute cash flows it s based on our internal economic model which continues to remain strong at healthy levels overall the cash flow that we ve generated within the business is 1 6 billion in 2022 that s up from the 1 2 billion or 30 since ipo after taking into account the venerable transaction so we feel really good about the cash flow generation of the business we ll continue with our 50 to 60 payout and we ve proven that since ipo that we continue to pay out regardless of market cycles nigel dally great and just another one on cash flow the acquisition at ab does that change your expectation as to how much cash you would likely be getting from that this year robin raju it does not one let me just talk about the acquisition first we are excited to bring on carval investors the acquisition scheduled to close early in q3 it helps bring alliancebernstein s platform up to 50 billion for private markets makes it meaningful on top of that equitable in the general account will support with 750 million of investment so it s a win win because the general account will benefit from better risk adjusted return for policyholders and then ab will go out and raise third party money with this new platform as well so it supports us building a higher multiple business at ab over the short term from an eqh perspective the business the deal is neutral from an accretion perspective so no impact on cash flows but over the long term we re excited about the prospects that that franchise brings to ab operator our next question comes from suneet kamath with jefferies suneet kamath so i wanted to go back to the cash flows and the 6 from the affiliated distribution that you addressed earlier so if that s the cash flow numbers is there a way that we can think about the earnings that that business generates or is there some sort of disconnect between the cash flows and the earnings that that business produces robin raju look we re excited to talk to you today about that business number one it s been a growing platform for us 79 billion of aua 3 billion of gross sales and today we can give you guidance that we expect 100 million of cash flow generation it is a fee based oriented business that don t expect much differentiation between that business and the underlying cash flow generation nick anything you want to add on that from an investment perspective nick lane yes i would just clarify through equitable advisors we sell insurance products as well as investment fee based products we see the growth in the investment fee base as supporting the overall growth of managing the portfolio but creating a due revenue in cash flow stream going forward suneet kamath okay and then i guess in terms of the cash generation the 1 6 billion i think that s just a touch higher than what you said last quarter which i believe was 1 5 billion obviously it s going up despite the fact that markets are lower so just maybe want to understand what s going on there is this the lack of a market impact is that really because the statutory component of that is driven off of last year s results or what explains kind of the resilience and increase in that number despite the weaker markets robin raju yes suneet i think over the long term i think the way we look at it is the mix of the business that we shifted to be more capital light the legacy va transaction or reducing the risk oriented business gives us confidence in the cash flow generation of 1 6 billion up 30 from ipo as you mentioned and will continue to drive cash flows that s our focus drive free cash flows for shareholders for best use operator our next question comes from tracy benguigui with barclays tracy benguigui in your prepared remarks you mentioned that your free cash flow yield is 12 but given where your market cap is today that would imply 1 3 billion of free cash flow but you actually read your guide to 1 6 billion from your prior 1 5 billion so i m just wondering what i m missing robin raju i think if you looked at the free cash flow yield at 12 the number in the script is as of quarter end we thought that that was probably the best number to give so we took a spot as of quarter end yes you re right at 1 6 billion and volatile markets the free cash flow yield is higher today making equitable a more attractive proposition for investors tracy benguigui got it and also just back to reg 213 since reviewing your disclosures it looks like under your permitted practice you received a 1 5 billion hedge credit due to dfs recognition in your hedge effectiveness and that amount is reflected in your special surplus funds so i guess my question is does your recent hedge effectiveness change that hedge credit robin raju no impact tracy what that was if you recall when we first announced reg 213 we received a permitted practice from the dfs which allowed us to defer the 2 billion in total redundant reserves we ve taken 50 of that action and we expect to resolve this in the second half of the year tracy benguigui okay so that s more static that offset robin raju that s yes that s part of the deferral that we had in the 2 billion hedge effectiveness yes it has no impact on yes the hedge tracy just maybe hedge effectiveness that we quote to the market that s how we perform economically versus our economic target in limiting the volatility of it it s not related to reg 213 which is an economic reserve tracy benguigui okay and then on your distributable earnings and you mentioned 50 coming from nonregulated sources should i think about your 865 million of ordinary dividend capacity from equitable financial in 2022 that you may fully draw that down as last year you had no capacity robin raju that s correct the dividend formula allows us to upstream dividends and we plan to do so in the within the second quarter to support the 1 6 billion operator our next question comes from mark hughes with truist mark hughes on the scs product you described a lot of strength in march how much of that was just volatility in equity markets rising interest rates is that momentum continued into 2q is this a good product for this kind of market backdrop unidentified company representative yes this is a product that was built for this time upside potential with downside protection to create more resilient portfolios as a pioneer in the industry of creating this product in this segment over 10 years ago we continue to benefit both through our affiliated distribution and our third party networks structurally we view the pie is continuing to grow based on the demographic shifts of baby boomers looking for protected equity stories amplified by the current market conditions as robin highlighted we continue to manage this on an economic basis for sustainable profitability and remain confident going forward that we will be able to help americans create more resilient portfolios during this period of dislocation mark hughes and then on the reg 213 robin you talked about external or internal reinsurance any cost numbers associated with that i assume it s contemplated in the 8 to 10 eps guidance robin raju that s right mark anything that we take would be minimal but it is everything we speak about is compensated in our 8 to 10 eps guidance and we ll look to resolve in the most economically accretive option that we have here in the second half operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect
as if nothing had changed while everything shifted state demographer elizabeth garner was back may 5 at the silverthorne pavilion where northwest colorado council of governments hosted the first in person regional economic summit in three years what sounded like far off warnings in 2019 are now upon us jon stavney my big takeaway colorado is losing its mojo it s economic mojo and that other mojo the one that fills preschool classrooms fifty percent of counties in the u s shrank in population last decade compared to the previous census decade and 43 of 64 colorado counties are in absolute decline in producing under 18 year old persons weld county in northeast colorado accounts for 43 of those only summit county in our region has a net increase in producing the next generation the peak of the last wave of childbirths in the u s was 2007 we ve been underproducing since of the absolute growth of births in the state 2 3 are people of color garner challenged us with the question are we adequately preparing and welcoming that population into our workforce this decline impacts schools higher education the workforce and eventually every community covid 19 has not produced a baby boom even if there is a time soon that we can honestly call post covid considerable uncertainty economic social political make a 1950s like boom unlikely to turn that around support local journalism donate a robust trend in migration due to colorado s blistering economy quality of life and other factors countered and masked that long trend of declining births in previous decades international migration is down 70 and domestic migration into colorado is down 35 according to garner we ve been a magnet and a place of opportunity for those at the beginning of their work years in the past that too has shifted garner says over the next decade expect a slowdown in net migration of young adults colorado s secret weapon jobs affordability quality of life and intangibles that we ve relied upon for decades to fuel rapid population growth through the 1990s and 2000s well that secret sauce doesn t taste quite the same today as the baby boomers age out and we block the flow of international migration for political not economic reasons every state across the country is competing for a shrinking population of young people garner sees state colleges across the country out competing colorado for younger in migrants that we ve relied upon the largest growth demographic in colorado is over 65 years old how is this happening when nwccog s own mountain migration report shows the rapid influx of newcomers and part timers bringing in their wealth for now most newcomers remain non residents under the demographic radar they are also a generation older the shift of mid career remote workers and part timers to the high country has benefits as well as deleterious effects on the opportunities for younger workers staying or coming into the high country as the report showed mountain migrants are much better positioned than in migrating young folks to compete for higher rents and for shrinking housing stock garner s data also shows that colorado is far behind in keeping up in the production of housing units garner has been persistent over the years reminding those who would listen that a job is a person with a place to live and you can t have one without the other two garner wryly notes there s been a debate over time do we really like people there are drawbacks for sure it wasn t all that long ago for some of us that the state demography office was under fire for inflated projections of population growth across much of colorado garner repeatedly corrects media reporting growth as exponential the growth pressure was real for a while it was never exponential for instance the town of eagle grew 15 each year for a decade from 1998 to 2008 while i was on the board in most places the prospect of doubling or tripling of small town populations resulted in a lot of local resistance that seems to have continued even as other dynamics have changed one cannot vote to exclude people or choose their demographic one can only oppose the development projects that would house newcomers notably those of less means even when units are approved the construction industry has never really recovered from 2008 to a degree that could build them in the 1990s colorado had a solid formula a very attractive place to live echoes of the rocky mountain way one of the most competitive and best funded state university systems a balanced political landscape lots of tech research and military jobs as well as entrepreneurs flocking to remain in the state lots of developable land around a metro area that was investing heavily in amenities such as major sport stadiums and redevelopment smaller towns waking up to what made them compelling community based resorts not bent on impressing stockholders and a construction industry that had the workers and capacity to nearly keep up with housing demand today colorado has fallen from the top 10 in growth to the top 20 that s pretty much the middle folks each of those factors have slowed or been reversed for various reasons not the least of which is the ability to approve development and build homes that would allow a younger generation to stay and attract talent garner points out that we also need to be realistic about producing not just jobs but jobs that pay the bills what does it take to attract a young adult a house she replies or the potential to own a home well we know how that is going these days jon stavney is the executive director of northwest colorado council of governments he is also a past county commissioner as well as having served as trustee mayor and manager of the town of eagle through his career

new york with prices in many advanced economies surging central banks are being roundly criticised for falling behind the curve on inflation but they did not government policies and geopolitics constrained central bankers from normalising their monetary policies until inflation was already upon them chinese and russian supply chain disruptions collided with the synthetic demand created by the us department of the treasury mailing free money to american consumers there is now very little room for monetary tightening without stalling the economy which is already faltering under tightening financial conditions but make no mistake the window to tighten monetary policy was missed because of decisions made by political leaders it is they who bear responsibility for fixing the problem keeping in mind that the longer term economic environment is still defined by the three ds rising debt demographic ageing and disruptive labour and demand displacing technologies in these conditions persistent disinflation is more dangerous than episodic inflation in retrospect it is clear that the us federal reserve and other central banks were forced by political leadership to defer policy normalisation a prerequisite for responding effectively to the next crisis while the economy was strong in 2018 when the pandemic hit former president donald trump s administration and congress panicked directing the treasury to borrow trillions of dollars to finance economic impact payments to stimulate consumer demand then in 2021 joe biden s newly installed administration essentially repeated the process the newly issued short term treasuries were bought by the fed which more than doubled its balance sheet over the past two years increasing its holdings from 4 trillion to 9 trillion nine times higher than its mid 2008 level of less than 1 trillion the consequences were predictable as the nobel laureate economist milton friedman famously argued inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output more money chasing the same output of goods and services means higher prices ordinarily the fed could raise rates cooling excess demand long enough for supply to catch up but this time the intersection of geopolitics and pandemic recovery dynamics yielded both surging demand and delayed supply fortunately with consumers having spent their stimulus checks the latest data suggest that inflation is peaking and it should decline further as private businesses repair product supply chains without waiting for government but now that the market has finally been conditioned for rate hikes the more immediate danger is an over tightening of financial conditions inflation might soon be forgotten as central banks pursue quantitative tightening qt selling down the holdings that they have amassed after 15 years of bond buying for its part the fed is targeting a 1 trillion or 11 per cent reduction in its treasury holdings over the coming year the problem is that when the fed sells treasuries it effectively drains liquidity from markets at prices that private markets set regardless of policy rates hence ten year treasury rates already jumped from 1 9 per cent to 2 7 per cent in the past month and the fed has only just begun the first of its three most modest asset sales 47 5 billion per month between june and august of this year in the meantime a lot could go wrong from a fiscal perspective consider that 24 trillion of us sovereign debt is publicly held with an average maturity of about five years that means an increase of two percentage points in interest rates over the next five years would add nearly 500 billion to the federal government s current debt servicing burden of 352 billion the current 3 trillion federal budget deficit thus would increase by nearly 20 per cent more than offsetting savings from the end of covid economic impact payments to be sure the incremental cost of the first 1 trillion of treasuries the fed sells might be manageable but consider the interest rate and budgetary implications of the fed selling off another 3 trillion to return to 2020 levels let alone another 7 trillion to return to 2009 levels talk about crowding out non discretionary spending interest payments on federal debt might well become the largest single item of national expenditure though the costs of social security health care and national defence are also set to rise substantially in the coming year absent politically untenable tax increases us fiscal deficits and total debt are poised to rise to new highs meanwhile the junk bond market has mushroomed to more than 3 trillion outstanding and is heavily skewed towards lower quality issuers as those issues mature we should expect to see a significant number of zombie companies that must restructure because they cannot refinance at higher rates but this is assuming that any material tightening happens at all the economy appears to be heading towards recession before policy rate increases have reached a full percentage point and before qt has even started us gdp growth is foundering and the employment situation is considerably less rosy than it looks the low headline unemployment rate of 3 6 per cent does not account for the fact that only 62 2 per cent of eligible employees are even looking for jobs the available jobs seem to be ones that nobody wants moreover as artificial intelligence and other software technologies become more advanced they will increasingly displace both unskilled manual laborers and skilled service professionals wall steet bankers traders investors and lawyers everywhere might soon find their jobs at risk they should consider themselves lucky enough still to be employed even if that means going back to the office navigating these crosswinds and rough seas will require many waves to break gently it would certainly help if policymakers stopped looking for the fastest and easiest way out and instead resolved to act strategically on national and global economic and political goals daniel j arbess is ceo of xerion investments copyright

berkeley as of friday may 6 the bond market expected us consumer price inflation to average 2 5 per cent between five and ten years from now that is the rate of inflation needed to equalize returns on inflation indexed and non indexed us treasury securities and given that cpi inflation has been running higher than the rate associated with the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures i count that 2 5 per cenbt five year five year forward rate as hitting the us federal reserve s 2 per cent price deflator inflation target what then would it take to get the economy back to the fed s targeted inflation rate since the five year breakeven rate at the close of may 6 was 3 22 per cent the implicit expectation is that inflation will run a cumulative total of 3 6 percentage points above the fed s target over the next five years if it does not cause the economy s inflation anchor to vanish a deviation of that size would be an exceedingly small price to pay for the rapid recovery from the pandemic induced recession if the recovery delivers the structural economic transformation that we need the higher inflation that we have experienced will have been well worth it accordingly it seems to me that the fed should be taking a victory lap it has done precisely what it is supposed to do by enabling america s sticky price sticky wage sticky debt economy to return rapidly not just to full employment but to the right version of full employment the one that has workers working in sectors making products for which there is real fundamental demand after a shock and it has done so without disrupting confidence in the monetary system and its stability so why does the very sharp kenneth rogoff of harvard university argue that things are way out of control if you have been diverted from your desired trajectory and you then find yourself on a path where you can expect to return to it i would think the only way to describe the situation is as a case of being in control rogoff makes clear that there is a lot of uncertainty and that he is not going to say i know exactly what needs to be done but his observation that inflation is way out of control makes sense only to the extent that he is willing to declare the bond market and its implicit expectations to be wrong only then could the expected evolution of fed policy lead to inflation significantly higher than 3 22 per cent over the next five years and to average inflation significantly above 2 5 per cent five 10 years hence sure that could happen the economy is a surprising place and our models and forecasts are ultimately just poorly informed guesses the fed might have to change course substantially it might have to send the us economy into a substantial recession with significantly higher than expected interest rates to return inflation to its target over the five to ten year medium run for rogoff s own implied forecast to come to pass workers and bosses would have to reach wage bargains that assume inflation well above 3 2 per cent for the next five years and well above 2 5 per cent for the five years after that moreover those inflationary wage bargains would have to be locked in place through contracts and institutional arrangements that would make it hard to revise them downward should they turn out to have exaggerated actual inflation for workers and bosses to do that they would have to be pretty confident that bond traders are irrationally panglossian that they are inflation doves despite the evidence to the contrary is there any reason to think that bond traders are irrational panglossian inflation doves are there any reasons to think that workers and bosses now believe that bond traders are irrational panglossian inflation doves i see none in our modern economy an outbreak of inflation is a peculiar expectations driven process it requires a vicious circle in which expectations of high inflation drive actions that then validate those expectations with higher wages leading to higher consumer prices that in turn lead to demands for higher wages ad infinitum for this to happen the expectation of high inflation has to come from somewhere and as of now it is not in evidence yes additional adverse supply shocks could lie in our future the covid 19 virus still has the potential to mutate and confront us with dangerous disruptive new strains further disruptions could emanate from a widening of russian president vladimir putin s war on ukraine or from an economically catastrophic interaction of new virus variants and china s zero covid policy these kinds of developments could push inflation out of control but the fact that such risks exist does not mean we should live as if they have already come to pass and thus ignore the world as it currently is j bradford delong a former deputy assistant us treasury secretary is professor of economics at the university of california berkeley and a research associate at the national bureau of

for a long time netflix insisted it would never interrupt its programming with commercials that was part of the service s appeal the movies were uncut and the tv shows came without breaks the better to binge things for hours upon hours but that was before netflix faced serious competition in the streaming video space mostly from services that do offer cheaper subscriptions for programming that is occasionally broken up by ads netflix also lost 200 000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and it s said it expects to lose 2 million more this quarter which has sent their stock tumbling and so perhaps not surprisingly they are now looking to create a ad supported netflix tier and to do it quickly according to a netflix memo to employees reported by the new york times netflix plans to introduce its cheaper tier with commercial interruptions by the end of the year the move will presumably boost subscriptions and the ads will generate revenue as well there was a period not that long ago when a netflix subscription was one of the best deals in entertainment for a couple bucks a month you got access to an enormous and varied library of movies and shows all available instantly but in the last few years netflix s library has shrunk and a lot of their more recent originals are just not on par with the content they lost plus their subscription prices have continued to rise their standard plan now costs a whopping 15 49 a month that s still cheaper than most cable packages but when you factor in how often you use the service and how many families feel the need to supplement it with other services like hulu or disney or hbo max you start to see why they might have lost a few subscribers recently a cheaper tier with some ads will likely attract some lapsed customers back and if you don t want the ads you can continue to pay more to watch without them but beware according to the times netflix is also planning to crack down on password sharing by the end of the year as well so if you re freeloading off your parents netflix account those days might be numbered netflix s most popular english language tv shows ever these are the most popular tv shows ever on netflix in english based on hours viewed in their first 28 days on streaming
the pay gap between chief executives and rank and file employees widened sharply again during 2021 for most of the 29 publicly traded corporations based in the triad or with a major operational presence in the region three corporations paid at least 1 000 in total compensation to the chief executive for every 1 paid to their median employee only one corporation did that in 2020 an element of the dodd frank federal regulatory act that went into effect in 2017 requires corporations to put a number and a dollar to dollar ratio to the annual total compensation gap between ceos and their median employee salary median is defined as the middle value in a list of numbers median employee compensation factors in regular pay overtime bonuses incentives allowances and paid time off the three corporations with at least a 1 000 to 1 ratio were amazon andrew jassy with a 6 474 to 1 ratio or 212 7 million compared with 32 855 in compensation it was the first amazon report with jassy as chief executive kontoor brands inc scott baxter with a 1 936 to 1 ratio or 9 98 million compared with 5 102 baxter s pay ratio was 1 278 to 1 in fiscal 2020 hanesbrands inc stephen bratspies with a 1 564 to 1 ratio or 11 8 million compared with 7 855 bratspies pay ratio was 699 to 1 in fiscal 2020 in his first but not full year in the post krispy kreme inc was not far off with an 867 to 1 pay ratio or 23 6 million compared with 27 278 between chief executive mike tattersfield and the median employee it was krispy kreme s first proxy report since re emerging as a publicly traded company in july kontoor also has the largest gap when it comes to measuring chief executives annual base salary to annual median employee compensation at 210 85 to 1 followed by hanesbrands at 155 91 to 1 as foreign based corporations british american tobacco plc and gildan activewear inc are not required to participate global impact what was the main common denominator for amazon kontoor hanesbrands and krispy kreme their median employee salary was affected greatly by having a substantial global workforce where annual wages are much lower than in the u s using kontoor as an example the greensboro jeans manufacturer said in its 2021 proxy report to shareholders that as of dec 31 just 20 of its 14 070 full time workers or 2 898 were in the u s approximately 70 of our workforce is located in latin america and mexico 20 is located in the u s and 10 is located in the asia pacific countries and europe middle east and africa regions kontoor said for fiscal 2021 we selected the same median employee as fiscal 2020 a full time mexico based production operator whose fiscal 2021 annual total compensation was 5 102 meanwhile hanesbrands said in its 2021 proxy that 12 of its 59 000 employees or 7 080 as of dec 31 were in the u s over 83 of our workforce 49 000 employees is employed in our large scale supply chain facilities located primarily in central america the caribbean basin and asia hanesbrands said hanesbrands identified its global median employee as a dry cleaning operator located in a supply chain facility in the dominican republic our various compensation programs include the payment of market based wages and the provision of competitive employee benefits according to the proxy the programs vary from region to region and among our various consolidated subsidiaries in each region from country to country krispy kreme told shareholders that as a multi national organization we have employees operating in several countries to provide context for this disclosure it is important to understand the scope of our operations the compensation elements and pay levels of our employees can vary dramatically from country to country based on market trends cost of living and cost of labor these factors along with fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the median employee compensation and the resulting ratio growing gap altogether the number of corporations with a major triad presence and at least a 100 to 1 ceo pay ratio gap jumped from 15 to 21 when comparing 2020 and 2021 proxies as has been the case in recent ceo pay ratio reports the stock market has played the biggest role in boosting ceo total compensation many corporations have made stock and stock options awards a primary if not the largest financial factor in ceo compensation in recent years the strategy has been more directly tying ceo compensation to overall company financial performance particularly share price another major factor many chief executives have benefited immensely from company share repurchase programs which typically make the remaining outstanding shares more valuable those factors showed up more when reviewing the ceo pay ratios in the financial services manufacturing logistics health care and retail sectors for example of the 29 corporate chief executives in the analysis wells fargo co s charlie scharf had the highest base salary for 2021 at 2 5 million as well as total compensation at 21 36 million when compared with a median wells fargo employee compensation of 73 528 scharf s ceo pay ratio was 290 to 1 for total compensation and 33 98 to 1 for base salary meanwhile chief executive adam schechter of laboratory corp of america holdings had a ceo pay ratio of 357 to 1 for total compensation 20 55 million compared with 57 614 and 22 17 to 1 for base salary at 1 28 million for schechter truist financial corp listed a combination of both kelly king who retired as chief executive on sept 12 and his successor william rogers jr truist reported the chief executives were paid 14 6 million in total compensation for a 153 to 1 ceo pay ratio compared with median employee compensation of 95 659 the base salary of 1 2 million yielded a 12 54 to 1 ratio by comparison the lowest ceo pay ratio involved jeffrey haley with american national bancshares inc at 16 to 1 based on his total compensation of 1 002 million and median employee compensation of 64 201 pay ratio background since 1994 the annual salary bonus and incentives stock awards and other compensation of top 5 executives from publicly traded companies have been disclosed by requirement of federal regulators the dodd frank act requires corporations to adjust how they determine who their median employee is every three years a schedule that means that change will show up in the 2021 ceo pay ratio calculations the ratio is easy to understand and has served to increase interest in the issue said michael walden an economics professor at n c state university many companies substantially increased ceo compensation during the pandemic the specifics of ceo pay depend on a broad range of factors many of which change over time ultimately the tenure of a ceo will depend on performance as evaluated by the company s board of directors and major investors walden said opposition remains some pro business groups such as the u s chamber of commerce and national retail federation fought efforts to disclose the ceo pay ratio the retail trade group calls the ratio a flawed measure that unfairly singles out industries like retail that have high percentages of part time seasonal and entry level employees failing to adjust for the large number of part time and seasonal workers inflates retail s ratios by an estimated 31 over typical employers the federation recommends comparing median earnings that factor out part time workers the chamber has referred to the reporting requirement of the ceo pay ratio as an example of an unnecessary financial burden for corporations the chamber said global companies shouldn t be overly criticized because they source lower cost production offshore the strategy has led to lower prices for u s consumers on many imported products the left leaning institute for policy studies determined that of the 50 publicly traded u s corporations with the widest pay ratio gaps in 2018 the typical employee would have to work at least 1 000 years to earn what their ceo made in just one the institute said it supports the ceo pay strategy of u s sen bernie sanders i vt sanders favored tax penalties ranging from 0 5 percentage points on pay ratios over 100 to 1 to 5 percentage points on ratios above 500 to 1 sanders submitted senate resolution 794 titled tax excessive ceo pay act on march 17 2021 that includes those penalties there has been no committee action on the bill sanders was quoted recently by bloomberg during congressional hearing as saying that it has always been true of course that ceos make more than their employees but what has been going on in recent years is totally absurd the institute for policy studies said in a september 2019 report that s p 500 corporations as a whole would have owed as much as 17 2 billion more in 2018 federal taxes if they were subject to those tax penalties tax penalties on extreme ceo worker pay gaps would encourage large corporations to narrow their divides by lifting up the bottom and or bringing down the top of their wage scales such reforms would also give a boost to small businesses and employee owned firms and cooperatives that spread their resources more equitably than most large corporate enterprises does not work the annual ceo pay ratio disclosures may cause some buzz for a few days but overall the strategy does not work said zagros madjd sadjadi an economics professor at winston salem state university investors do not seem to care about the ratio what they care about are results and with the stock market reaching new heights the ratio of ceo to worker pay is reaching record levels for those corporations who closely tie stock awards to executive compensation ceo compensation even though it looms large in terms of the average worker still tends to be very small in terms of a firm s realized profits madjd sadjadi said although federal regulators require corporations to declare the value annually executives typically are required to wait a specified amount of time often one to three years to receive those shares or exercise the options other analysts and economists say the ceo pay ratio tends to get mixed reactions among shareholders the whole purpose of compensation disclosures is to allow shareholders to make an informed judgment regarding the say for pay decisions that are also enabled by dodd frank said tony plath a retired finance professor at unc charlotte so far anyway it looks to me like most shareholders except large institutional shareholders and the shareholder advisory services are basically ignoring this information or at least they re not expressing much criticism of ceo compensation rates these days plath said there s just too much other immediate and pressing stuff going on for most middle class american families plath said plath cited influences such as rising inflation rising market interest rates on credit cards and mortgages a nationwide housing crisis that s left most rapidly growing communities without an adequate supply of middle class housing the threat of food and agricultural product shortages looming for the months ahead and the growing likelihood that we re about to enter a recessionary period across the national economy when you re worried about paying for groceries and finding baby formula for your youngest kids after all just who has the time or the mental energy to worry about how much some overpaid ceo at some distant corporation made last year plath said bowman gray iv a local independent stockbroker said he recalls just one ceo compensation controversy involving general electric that resulted in enough pushback to prompt changes to lower compensation the last statistic i read reflected that ceo pay since 1978 has risen 940 while the average worker has only realized a 12 increase gray said for the most part shareholders will go along with whatever is suggested by the boards as long as the stock performance has been reasonable gray said ceo pay ratio and other financial disclosures would be far more effective if employees and shareholders were given the same rights and expected to vote on board seats and ceo pay packages i believe that this not only would reign in some exorbitant pay packages but would improve employee morale this is a breeding ground for resentment and transient employees who at this low level of compensation many times cannot afford the very services products that their employers provide or make gray said that with minimum wage in n c stuck at the federal 7 25 level and basic living expenses require 18 an hour for full time employees it s no wonder so many companies cannot find employees if corporate america truly values its employees it will step up by giving them a voice in company governance and start paying a living wage

bola a akinterinwa nigeria has by force of necessity become the terra cognita of all manners of illegality but which political governors consciously try to legalise in different climes and yet the people not only consciously acquiesce to the situation but joyfully complain about non development and national disunity and true enough political governance is largely predicated on dishonesty in which the gospel of godliness and goodness is preached to the people but the preachers and governing authorities do exactly the contrary look at these two examples first is the allegation of southern hostility towards their northern brothers on the matter of open grazing northern politicians consciously opted for delivery of economized truths they are vehemently against southern governors who reportedly opposed open grazing the untold aspect of the truths is the silence of the use of force by the fulani herders to acquire titled land of the legitimate owners it is the silence over the possession of unlawful ak 47 guns while herding it is also the silence over kidnapping maiming killing and mistreatment of local people more disturbingly it is the silence over the destruction of farm products and forceful claim of right to operate in any part of nigeria in the wrong belief that fulani own the whole of any land in nigeria it is on this basis that the ordinary people who have been living harmoniously with northerners began to develop unnecessary animosity vis à vis one another without any jot of doubt president muhammadu buhari pmb is on record to have vainly tried to use different ways to acquire land particularly by manu militari for the fulani herdsmen in the southern parts of nigeria various arguments ranging from legality of colonial cattle routes and climatic changes to the 1978 land use act and ownership of land by government have been raised they forget that such lands are held in trust by state governors for their people the question is why the forceful acquisition of land for the fulani herders why is the federal government having particular interest in private business of cattle herding many explications there are especially the twin allegations of islamic and fulanisation agenda more important is dishonesty and legality of illegalities that has come to characterize political governance in nigeria explained differently government and people of nigeria do know that an act or an action is illegal but rather than seek to remove the illegality they prefer to panel beat it the panel beating most unfortunately does not always last long it only creates recidivist tensions that deepen agitations for separation manifestations of legality of illegalities the foundation of political governance under nigeria s fourth republic is the 1999 constitution as amended and it is most unfortunately believed by many to be very fraudulent the fraud is derived from the preambular provision that we the people of the federal republic of nigeria have firmly resolved to unite questions have therefore been asked as to who are the people of nigeria that firmly and solemnly resolved to live in unity and harmony as one indivisible and indissoluble sovereign nation under god pmb is very happy with this provision that makes nigeria indivisible and indissoluble good enough but the foundation of the provision is fraudulent the 1999 constitution is not a resultant from the people s will the people of nigeria have been complaining about this and have called for the writing of a new constitution because the 1999 constitution is military in character and origin it is also manu militari in delivery rather than allow for negotiated new constitution the political stakeholders simply preferred amending reviewing and modifying controversial sections of the constitution what is more disturbing is that when it is convenient the constitution is referred to as the ground norm that cannot be derogated any law that is made and runs into conflict with it is frapped with nullity and yet it is fraudulent in origin the continuous use of the constitution is believed to translate into acquiescence by the people and conferment of legitimacy on the constitution when chief afe babalola suggested that the political lull in the country can lead to national disintegration and that there is the need to prevent the imminent disaster he suggested the establishment of an interim government for about six months in the hope that there would be room to sort out existing political grievances the argument of non provision for such interim government in the constitution was raised but the same constitution is the root cause for the various agitations for separation the constitution is fraudulent but it is still used to govern how do we then explain the contradiction is it the military that came up with the 1999 constitution that can rightly say that nigeria is indivisible or indissoluble arguably general yakubu gowon adopted a war doctrine in 1967 to keep nigeria one is a task that must be done additionally he asked nigerians not to sit on the fence but to join the defence comparatively speaking the approach of pmb is completely different in that he wants to enforce national unity without carrying the people along and most unfortunately he always acts contrarily to what has the potential to enhance national unity unbelievable but true pmb preaches the principle of federal character but acts contrarily to it pmb is on record to be the most nepotistic president nigeria has ever had he does not care about any complaints about nepotism mainly because of this argument of legality of illegality in other words it is lawful for him to appoint whoever he desires to appoint there is no problem with legality here but when in his position as the minister of petroleum and as the president of nigeria how do we explain the fact that the 20 topmost officials of the nnpc are people of his ethnic stock how do we also explain his submission that he only works with people he knows if pmb is openly and unnecessarily northernizing the public service with his people people cannot but begin to complain this is illegality of the worst order pmb s governance creates unnecessary tension amongst peoples in the country there is currently a north south dichotomy in political governance at the level of religion there is serious misunderstanding between muslims and christians muslims have generally been attacking christians in the north but there are also very fantastic very godly muslim who have saved and assisted christians in trouble there was the case for example of imam abdullahi abubakar in plateau state who kept about three hundred christians in his own personal house and in the mosque when there was a terrorist herdsmen invasion of nghar village gashish district in the barkin ladi local government on june 24 2018 imagine the good quality of this type of muslim imagine his nigerian personality imagine his altruism and patriotism imagine the goodness of his character why will anyone want to fight any muslim or any northerner bearing in mind this story of a northern muslim saving the lives of other compatriots pmb really did well by asking governor lalong to bring alhaji abdullahi abubakar aged 83 to abuja for presidential handshake and national honour in fact the international appreciation of alhaji abubakar s good gesture prompted the award of the 2019 international religious freedom award to him in the united states admittedly perhaps this may be one isolated case however there is no disputing the fact that there are many others living harmoniously and peacefully with other nigerian peoples but many are the cases of religion driven brutalities in fact nigeria under pmb is playing host to religious fanaticism with islamic adherents taking the lead religion extremism has now become a major threat to national security but it is being carelessly left to the religious leaders to handle even though the 1999 constitution as amended provides for secularity or no state religion the federal government has completely ignored this constitutional provision by sponsoring people to mecca and jerusalem thus political governance is always visibly in the breach as it is today religion has the great potential to disintegrate nigeria voluntarily or otherwise it is not simply because of the fears arising from the prescriptions of muammar gaddafi who said that there would not be peace in nigeria until the country is divided into muslim north and christian south but particularly because of the recent manifestations between and among nigerians young and old who are faced with the challenges and who apparently and ridiculously often condone religious hatred in 2016 a 74 year old christian bridget abgahime was beaten to death by a muslim mob because she allegedly blasphemed in front of her shop in sokoto which was said to be under sharia law and which sanctions any blasphemy with death 2021 witnessed the killing of other people by a muslim mob in the darazo district in bauchi state while a teacher suffered the same fate when his secondary school students beat him to death allegedly for not respecting the quran again the example of deborah samuel a christian and 200 level home economics student of the shehu shagari college of education in sokoto state is very heart breaking she was killed brutally based on allegation of blasphemy when she was being burnt to death the killers were reported to be shouting allahu akbar she was first beaten to death and then her corpse was burnt to ashes this is an unacceptable gruesome murder if the offence is blasphemy who has responsibility to sanction the offence is it any muslim who discovers a breach that should kill when there is an allegation of blasphemy is there no process of confirmation before jungle killing when is an act of blasphemy considered committed is it every muslim faithful that has the competence to determine when blasphemy is committed if yes where is the role of the sharia court must the killing be jungle like why should any muslim faithful take laws into his or her hand whatever is the case a growing christian muslim animosity cannot but emerge if this situation is not objectively brought under control it is already gradually becoming an issue in nigeria muammar gaddafi may after all be right by suggesting that nigeria cannot have peace unless the country is partitioned into muslim north and christian south in the event of such a partition and to ensure sustainability of peaceful coexistence there should not be any good reason for a non muslim to go and live in the north and similarly no good reason for non christians to go and settle in the christian south there should be a clear distinction between christians and muslims as their cultures are perceived to be very conflicting in the southern parts of nigeria many older men have both christian and muslim wives who happily co habit and celebrate christian and muslim holidays together why is religion a reason for killing one another how do muslims understand chapter 109 and its six paragraphs in this regard why is whatever comment made by someone a pretext for jungle killing the current situational reality of nigeria does not present nigeria in good light internationally the foreign policy implications without iota of doubt in my mind the international perception of political governance in nigeria cannot be good nigeria is no longer simply a country of fantastic corruption but a country of fantastic lawlessness and insecurity and most disturbingly of impunity crimes are regularly committed and regularly too government sympathize with the relations of the victims while promising to arrest the culprits beyond presentation of condolences and meaningless promises to deal with the criminals nigerians are often kept in the dark this cannot but be a herculean task for nigeria s plenipotentiaries in projecting a good image in their host countries one serious way of deterring inhuman and gruesome killings either by armed bandits boko haramists or religious fanatics in nigeria is to always ensure the apprehension of the killers and ensuring that they too are killed in the same way they had killed other compatriots criminals in nigeria are very hardened and they are even presented as foreigners if foreigners engage in brutal killings in nigeria they should be found and given a reciprocal brutal killing although there are international campaigns against death penalty in global governance the campaigns do have logical limitations because of their inability to provide punishment for the initial aggressors and murders if murderers do not respect international law or the human rights of their victims why should anyone be asking for human rights protection for criminals laws providing for reciprocal brutal capital punishment for gruesome murders should be a welcome development in nigeria so that the larger community can learn and appreciate the need to protect the sanctity of any human life which the international community takes very seriously nigeria must not become a land for any type of religious extremism and impression must not be given that any individual any group or cabal has a monopoly of knowledge or violence it is by promoting mutual respect and tolerance that an indivisible and indissoluble vibrant and self reliant nigeria can be built and that more significantly a nigerian nation can be feasible and that a new foreign policy perception can begin to emerge another foreign policy issue is the legality of illegality of political actions in nigeria there is the current controversy over the timing of resignation from office of public officials seeking to contest in the 2023 elections and the timing of when such resignation takes effect as regards resignation from office there is conflict between the provision of the 1999 constitution and that of the electoral act 2022 while section 84 12 of the electoral law of 2022 says no political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purposes of the nomination of candidates for any election section 84 13 adds that where a political party fails to comply with the provision of this act in the conduct of its primaries its candidate for the election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue the main implication here is that resignation from public office is a desideratum to be eligible to contest for elective positions or to vote during party primaries in this case again what is the timing for such resignation at the level of the 1999 constitution as amended it is required that public and civil servants have 30 days notice to give going by the combined effect of sections 66 1 f 107 1 f 137 1 g and 182 1 g of the 1999 constitution that make a nonsense of the candidacy of a person employed in the civil or public service of the federation or of any state and has not resigned withdrawn or retired from the employment at least thirty days before the date of the election thecable ng as per section 318 1 of the 1999 constitution political appointees are not public servants who must give a notice of resignation of at least thirty days to be eligible to contest going by the principle of unius personae vel rei est exclusion alterius that is the express mention of one person or thing is the exclusion of another or the inclusion of one is the exclusion of another in this regard the mere fact that the 1999 constitution has clearly defined who public servants are means that political appointees are excluded and therefore not public servants ibid in terms of direct implications for any cabinet member to refuse to resign his or her appointment either in non compliance with the directive of pmb or in non compliance with the electoral act 2022 section 84 12 cannot but be at best illegal what is noteworthy here is that the appeal court has said that section 84 12 of the 2022 electoral law is unconstitutional because it violates the rights of some people it has also set aside the judgment of the high court in umuahia the abia state capital which on march 18 2022 ordered the attorney general of the federation to delete section 84 12 because it violates the constitution the appeal court in setting the judgment aside said the high court had no jurisdiction to hear the case because nduka edede the plaintiff and a member of the action alliance aa does not have the locus standi required to have gone to file a case in the court to begin with concerning when a resignation takes effect femi falana san a human rights activist and chair of the alliance on surviving covid 19 and beyond ascab noted on friday may 13 2022 that after the farewell meeting with pmb it is illegal for mr abubakar malami san minister of justice and attorney general of the federation to have withdrawn their letters of resignation because section 306 2 of the constitution says the resignation of any person from any office established by this constitution shall take effect when the writing signifying the resignation is received by the authority or person to whom it is addressed or by any person authorized by that authority or person to receive it the point of emphasis here is that the moment pmb has received letters of resignation and has not only thanked mr abubakar malami and dr chris ngige for their services to the country but has also commended them for seeking to contest and complying with his directive that all cabinet members seeking to contest in the 2023 elections must resign before or on may 16 2022 femi falana has rightly posited that the resignation of the former ministers has taken effect they cannot return to the cabinet either on their own volition or on the directives of the president the resignation of the ministers is not a cabinet reshuffle it is akin to the removal of the former ministers by the president explained differently we can talk about legality of the judgment of the high court in umuahia that section 84 12 of the 2022 electoral act conflicts with the 1999 constitution submission of letters of resignation to pmb is also legal but the withdrawal of the same letters of resignation after their official acknowledgement is an expression of illegality the foreign policy implications of which do taint nigeria s international image in the same vein while pmb s ultimatum to cabinet members to resign not later than may 16 2022 may be consistent with his right as president to hire and fire it is politically incorrect for any cabinet member to have declared non preparedness to resign in the first place then decide to resign and finally opting to withdraw their resignation do nigerian politicians particularly cabinet members think deeply before acting why is the governance of nigeria like that of a banana republic how is nigeria perceived regarding party disregard for zoning policy which was adopted to ensure equity fairness and justice can there be free and fair elections in 2023 time will tell but without first removing the attitude of legitimizing illegality in the governance of nigeria that there will still be a nigeria playing host to any 2023 election is at best a dream

by jenna zucker steve gorman and moira warburton buffalo n y reuters an 18 year old white gunman shot 10 people to death and wounded three on saturday at a grocery store in a black neighborhood of upstate new york before surrendering after what authorities called an act of racially motivated violent extremism authorities said the suspect who was armed with an assault style rifle and appeared to have acted alone drove to buffalo from his home several hours away to launch the afternoon attack that he broadcast in real time on social media platform twitch a live video service owned by amazon com nasdaq eleven of the 13 people struck by gunfire were black officials said the two others were white the racial breakdown of the dead was not made clear court papers named the suspect as payton gendron of conklin a town of about 5 000 people in new york s southern tier region near the pennsylvania border he was arraigned hours after the shooting in state court on first degree murder charges which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole said erie county district attorney john flynn new york has no capital punishment flynn said the judge also ordered gendron to remain in custody without bail and to undergo a forensic examination gendron was scheduled to return to court on may 19 surrendered to police authorities said the teenager reported by local media to have been a student at the state university of new york s broome community college near binghamton had come close to taking his own life before he was arrested when confronted by officers at the store the suspect held a gun to his own neck but they talked him into dropping the weapon and surrendering buffalo police commissioner joseph gramaglia told a news briefing gramaglia said the gunman shot and killed three people in the parking lot of the tops friendly markets outlet before exchanging fire with a retired police officer working as a security guard for the store but the suspect was protected by his body armor the guard was one of the 10 people shot to death the nine others all being customers three other employees of the store part of a regional chain were wounded but are expected to survive authorities said shonnell harris a manager at tops told the buffalo news she thought she heard as many as 70 gunshots and that she fell several times as she ran through the store to a rear exit he looked like he was in the army she told the newspaper describing the camouflage clad assailant retired firefighter katherine crofton who lives nearby said she witnessed the start of the bloodshed from her porch i saw him shoot this woman crofton told the paper she was just going into the store and then he shot another woman she was putting groceries into her car i got down because i did not know if he was going to shoot me pure evil stephen belongia the fbi special agent in charge of the bureau s buffalo field office said the attack would be investigated both as a hate crime and as an act of racially motivated violent extremism under federal law this person was pure evil erie county sheriff john garcia said at a news conference his voice quaking with emotion it was a straight up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community u s president biden decried the shooting as abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation in a statement issued late saturday hate must have no safe harbor we must do everything in our power to end hate fueled domestic terrorism new york governor kathy hochul told a late evening news conference she was dismayed that the killer managed to live stream his attack on social media which she blamed for hosting a feeding frenzy of violent extremist ideology the fact that that can even be posted on a platform is absolutely shocking hochul said these outlets must be more vigilant in monitoring social media content twitch said in a statement that it removed the livestream less than two minutes after it started and was working to ensure no other accounts re posted the content hochul said it should have been taken down within a second screenshots of the broadcast were posted on social media including some that appeared to show the shooter holding a gun and standing over a body in the grocery store a document circulating online that appeared to have been written by the killer sketched out a to do list for the attack including cleaning the gun and testing the livestream in addition a 180 page manifesto outlining the great replacement theory the idea that white people are being replaced by minorities in the united states and other countries also circulated online reportedly authored by gendron a spokesperson for flynn s office declined to comment on the documents the fbi could not immediately be reached for comment the governor also said she would introduce a previously planned comprehensive gun control package on tuesday to address further loopholes that exist in our state laws hochul said the firearm used in the killings was legally purchased but had been illegally modified with a high capacity magazine which she said could easily have been purchased legally in pennsylvania the buffalo shooting follows a pattern of other racially motivated mass murders in recent years including a pittsburgh synagogue attack that left 11 congregants dead in october 2018 and the atlanta spa shootings in march 2021 in which a white man killed eight people targeting asians saturday s shooting spree was also reminiscent of the attack on a mosque in christchurch new zealand in 2019 when the killer live streamed the murders on facebook nasdaq buffalo mayor bryon brown called for unity on what he called a day of great pain for our community many of us have been in and out of this supermarket many times he told reporters we cannot let this hateful person divide our community or our country
gabe kaminsky on may 14 2022 democratic connecticut sen richard blumenthal recently disclosed that an investment fund managed by his wife s family bought between 1 million and 2 million in tech company stocks including shares in intel blumenthal s disclosure came three weeks before a senate hearing where intel s ceo backed legislation handing billions in subsidies to the semiconductor industry five days after the hearing blumenthal voted in favor of the america competes act which grants 52 billion in subsidies to the semiconductor industry democratic connecticut sen richard blumenthal disclosed in early march that an investment fund managed by his wife s family purchased between 250 000 and 500 000 worth of intel stock a little over three weeks later he voted for legislation handing billions in subsidies tosemiconductor manufacturers that could benefit intel the senator s actions seem to indicate a conflict of interest congressional watchdogs told the daily caller news foundation blumenthal s financial interests appear intertwined with companies he oversees they said this is another example why there is strong public support for restricting stock purchases by senators and house members said tom fitton president of judicial watch and by the way disclosing conflicts doesn t erase them on march 3 blumenthal who sits on the senate commerce committee disclosed to the senate ethics committee that an investment fund controlled by his wife s family bought between 1 million and 2 million in tech company stocks shares valued at between 250 000 and 500 000 of google parent company alphabet amazon microsoft and intel were purchased in january according to the disclosure blumenthal s fund bought the intel shares roughly two months before its ceo patrick gelsinger joined other tech executives on capitol hill to testify in favor of legislation that would pump billions of dollars into domestic semiconductor manufacturing intel is one of the world s largest semiconductor producers and operates manufacturing and r d facilities across the u s as such intel stands to benefit from the america competes act which would provide 52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research already several states are granting generous subsidies to chip makers including intel ohio recently announced more than 2 billion in incentives to intel to build two factories in licking county the columbus dispatch reported intel is investing 20 billion into the ohio facilities at the hearing gelsinger mentioned how foreign governments have granted intel and other companies subsidies to manufacture semiconductors and he urged senators to bolster critical technology that will break great ground i want to go bigger and faster gelsinger said at the hearing calling lawmakers to pass the legislation five days later the america competes act passed the senate in a 68 to 28 vote blumenthal voted in favor of it blumenthal is one of the wealthiest members of congress he has claimed to not own individual stocks even though watchdog experts say there is no distinction between his family or himself owning the shares since he must disclose the holdings anyway blumenthal has faced scrutiny for his past stock dealings the blumenthal family fund bought and sold shares of robinhood the stock trading platform on behalf of the senator and his wife in 2021 the senator disclosed the trades after the reporting deadline which violates federal law around the same time blumenthal was calling for investigations into robinhood for temporarily shutting down consumer trading of gamestop after what happened last week with gamestop trading investigation by consumer protectors congress seems necessary then legislative reform richard blumenthal senblumenthal february 1 2021 anytime a senator is buying and selling stocks in companies that they oversee especially at the committee level it raises red flags kendra arnold executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust fact told thedcnf where a senator s personal financial interests create even the perception that he cannot act impartially then a conflict of interest exists in february fact filed a complaint against blumenthal for failing to disclose the robinhood stock trades in a timely manner however it does not appear the senate ethics committee ever officially investigated the matter both not timely disclosing stock trades and trading stock in companies that overlap with a senator s official duties should raise serious concerns for the american people said arnold craig holman a government affairs lobbyist for the progressive group public citizen told thedcnf it is extremely alarming that members of congress and their spouses continue to trade stocks given their access to confidential information that comes through congressional briefings members spouses and dependent children must be prohibited altogether from trading on the stock market to avoid the actuality or the appearance of congressional insider trading said holman the senate ethics committee did not respond to a request for comment blumenthal s office did respond to thedcnf but did not answer a question about why some experts see the blumenthal family s stock buy ahead of the march vote as problematic senator blumenthal believes america needs to break china s grip on the semiconductor market and establish an american made supply chain for chips spokeswoman maria mcelwain said in an email tech companies including intel have lent a hand to blumenthal s political ambitions intel contributed 2 500 to the senator s leadership pac in 2020 according to federal election commission records amazon gave 5 000 to blumenthal s 2016 campaign since 2016 microsoft has given blumenthal s leadership pac and campaign 16 000 senate majority leader chuck schumer and other top democrats have pushed for hundreds of billions to go toward semiconductor research and development the house approved the america competes act in february both chambers must now reconcile the differences between their respective versions of the bill before its final passage in may president joe biden urged congress to pass the damn bill the white house has called the bill bipartisan despite the fact it passed largely along party lines getting just one republican vote house minority leader kevin mccarthy referred to the house bill as the america concedes act senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said it will not pass without democrats making major concessions and changes

quick notes coal shortage in india beyond supply and demand status coal stock shortage and the consequent power outages are dominating energy headlines in india the widely cited cause is that logistical issues are holding up the transport of coal to power plants whilst demand for power is growing with the summer heat on 25 april 2022 coal stocks in 155 non pithead thermal power plants were said to be 26 percent of their normative level while 18 pithead power plants accounting for about 39 gigawatt gw generation capacity had adequate stocks news reports quoting coal india limited cil said that an adequate amount of coal was available at washeries sheds and sidings and power generators can transport coal by road as railway rakes are not available another report quoting the secretary of the ministry of coal moc said that the cause of the crissis in the power sector was not the supply of coal but a sudden fall in power generation in many plants logistics in september october 2021 there was a similar coal crisis and media reports suggested almost the same causes revival of demand following the lifting of pandemic related restrictions coal inventories going below critical levels in many thermal power plants problems in availability of rakes to transport of coal by rail and challenges in transporting coal during monsoon rains the question that comes to mind is why these relatively straightforward managerial and administrative issues were not resolved in the last six months rake availability and transport are managerial and administrative issues that can be sorted out by the government especially because both cil and the railways are publicly owned cil is contractually obliged to deliver coal at the stockyard of thermal power generators and the excuse that rakes are inadequate is not sufficient to breach contractual obligations even if thermal power plants transport coal by road as demanded by cil power generators will not be able to pass on the additional cost to consumers immediately through an increase in tariff financially stressed discoms distribution companies would prefer outages to spot purchase of expensive power from power exchanges some measures to address frequent coal stock shortages have been announced recently in april 2022 the ministry of power mop allowed private power generating stations to secure coal supplies for up to three years instead of current norm of one year to address the crisis in the power sector the duration of independent power producers ipps to bid for coal was reduced to 37 days from 67 days and duration of supply was increased from one year to three years demand the observation that demand for power is growing needs to be looked at carefully in march 2021 the electrical energy requirement was 121 205 twh terawatt hour energy supplied was 120 635 twh and the deficit was 0 5 percent the peak demand in march 2021 was 186 389 gw and the peak met was 185 892 gw recording a deficit of 0 3 percent in march 2022 the energy requirement was 125 039 twh and the energy supplied was 124 272 twh with a deficit of 0 6 percent in march 2022 the peak demand was 200 727 gw and the peak met was 199 288 gw recording a deficit of 0 7 percent in march 2019 before the pandemic the energy requirement was 108 665 twh and the demand met was 108 196 twh recording a deficit of 0 4 percent the peak demand was 169 454 gw and the peak met was 168 75 gw compared to the pre pandemic month of march 2019 demand for electrical energy in march 2022 has increased by over 15 percent and peak demand has increased by over 18 percent though this is a substantial increase indications of substantial growth in energy demand were clear in 2021 another key observation is that peak demand has increased substantially this is a commercial challenge for power generators as it will require investment in capacity that is used only during relatively short durations of peak demand global headwinds on 24 april 2022 roughly 8430 mw megawatt of thermal power generation capacity reported coal shortage as the reason for shut down or forced maintenance thermal plants of about 22 057 mw capacity reported technical reasons for shut down whilst thermal plants of capacity 4834 mw reported scheduled maintenance work as reason for going out of operation this included nuclear power plants of total capacity 1220 mw thermal plants of capacity 5585 mw cited lack of power purchase agreements ppas as the reason for not being operational and thermal plants of capacity 2110 mw reported reserve shut down rsd as scheduled generation fell below the technical minimum thermal power generators holding 4 percent of total power generation capacity reported coal shortage as the reason for going offline whilst over 10 percent cited technical reasons out of these many were designed for using imported coal it is likely that these generators chose to go offline rather than use imported coal for which the price increase was substantial during the september 2021 coal crisis the price of seaborne coal increased by over 950 percent compared to the price in september 2020 and the price of asian lng liquefied natural gas increased by over 420 percent driven by growth in demand for coal and lng in europe in india the price of high quality imported coal increased 100 percent to inr14 600 tonne most of the imported coal based power plants either went offline or started using higher quality domestic coal the result was a similar coal stock crisis in september 2021 in 2022 the revival of demand for energy followed by the crisis in ukraine has pushed up imported thermal coal prices to over us 100 tonne this is a challenge for thermal power generators in india that depend on imported coal it is very likely that these generators are choosing to go offline rather than use expensive imported coal what is clear is that the increase in the share of imported coal for power generation is exposing india to global headwinds of coal prices this is affecting the marginal demand for domestic coal which is driving the coal coal crisis in india ironically the government is suggesting the use of imported coal most probably the key cause of the coal crisis in india as the solution to the crisis the more sustainable option is to allow electricity tariff to reflect the cost of fuel the right price signal can increase supply and decrease demand for coal more efficiently than administrative interventions source central electricity authority monthly news commentary oil india diversifies crude oil import

countries and quickly expanding renewable energy the european commission said it was ready to lead negotiations pooling demand and seeking gas ahead of next winter following a similar model to how the bloc bought covid 19 vaccines the us exporters have shipped record volumes of lng to europe for three consecutive months as prices have jumped to more than 10 times higher than a year ago europe is

consumer price index year over year percentage universal value advisors it was another volatile week in the financial markets while there were up days like friday may 13 the trend continues to be down the table shows the weekly movements in the major indexes and the downdrafts from their nearby peaks note that the nasdaq and russell 2000 are deep in bear market territory down more than 20 from their peaks and that both the s p 500 and the djia are in correction down more than 10 weekly index movements universal value advisors blame it on the fed we are now likely to see major up days in the markets when the economic news is ugly on friday the ugly data was the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index see chart below now sitting near the lows of the 2008 great recession one would think that markets should fall when the data is ugly but today bad economic news implies that the recession is closing in and that means the fed will not be able to execute its publicly announced interest rate plans i e its forward guidance because of the fed s poor track record in guiding the economy to a soft landing once it starts a rate hiking cycle three soft landings in 14 tightening cycles i e 11 recessions the worse the incoming data the more likely it will be that the fed modifies the level of its terminal interest rate consumer sentiment universal value advisors along these lines on thursday powell was finally confirmed by the senate as fed chair and what do you know he began to play it straight with the american public saying that he thought that the process of crushing inflation would include some pain this is the first indication of what we think will be his changing view of the economy as the year progresses cpi mom universal value advisors the inflation fixation it is constantly in the headlines on news broadcasts and generally the go to topic of the media inflation the media is fixated on it especially the y y change in the consumer price index cpi the data came out on wednesday may 11 and we saw what we expected that april s inflation on a y y basis had declined from its 8 5 level in march but because it only fell to 8 3 when wall street expected 8 1 the inflation narrative was reinforced and lives on there wasn t any mention that we could find of the rapid fall in the monthly change in the cpi see chart above cpi mom note that the m m inflation rate fell from a 1 2 pct point change in march to a 0 3 pct point change in april note too that we haven t seen that small of a monthly change since last august and before that december 2020 here is a thought experiment what would the y y change in the cpi be in december 2022 if the change in the cpi were to stay steady at 0 3 pct points per month the chart at the top of this blog shows that number the highest dotted line 5 5 and what the rate of inflation would be at 0 2 pct points per month 4 7 and 0 1 pct points 3 9 if we do some surgery and strip out food airline and new car prices april s cpi was flat and if rents are excluded it was down 0 1 while this is little comfort to household budgets we are seeing the first positive signs that inflation is beginning to wane it is a similar story for the producer price index ppi an index of the cost of business inputs while up 0 5 in april like the cpi we haven t seen prices rise this slowly since last september and before that december 2020 so despite the media rants and the ongoing inflation narrative both cpi and ppi were tame relative to those of the recent past and they were in keeping with the view that we expressed in past blogs that the inflation numbers would be falling as the year progressed referring to the chart at the top of this blog at a minimum we expect the upper of the three dashed lines on the chart december y y inflation at 5 5 but wouldn t be at all surprised if we saw the lower one december y y inflation at 3 9 us labor costs 2019 2021 black rock incoming data the incoming data continue to bolster our view of a weakening economy in past blogs we ve noted that real inflation adjusted weekly take home pay is negative on a y y basis 4 the chart above from blackrock shows that u s labor costs have been falling so it isn t any wonder that corporate profits reached another all time high corporate profits universal value advisors some commentators have expressed the view that businesses have been price gouging i e raising prices faster than costs after all if inflation is on everyone s mind then price increases are expected we don t think many of those prices will stick once consumers cut back the narrative on wall street is that consumers won t cut back because uncle sam sent free money for the last couple of years and that money is available to buoy consumption percent change of total consumer credit universal value advisors well it was but no longer the savings rate has now plunged below its pre pandemic level to 6 6 so all that free money looks to have been spent and then in march and april consumption was bolstered by record breaking increases in consumer credit read credit card debt see chart above that can t continue as credit limits are approached in addition an oft used source of consumer funding especially for big ticket items has been home refinance this was especially true as home prices rose while the fed held down interest rates but with the rise in rates that source too has disappeared see chart there doesn t appear to be many other places where consumers can easily access credit thus we believe a significant slowdown in consumption will soon show up in the data mba us refinances total applications universal value advisors final thoughts last week we talked about how markets misinterpreted the employment report completely ignoring the household survey 353k relying instead on a payroll survey 428k that added 160k for small businesses birth death model when all the surveys say that small businesses are cutting back and the largest payroll purveyor in america adp counted 120k fewer employees in their small business sector this week the narrative emphasized inflation despite both cpi and ppi march looks to have been the peak and that going forward just a repeat of april for the remainder of the year will significantly reduce that malady the real driving force in the financial markets is the fed markets rise and fall based on what

the animals are judged on their fleece and frame cadence rarden 15 felt nervous as she stepped up to the edge of a competition ring at the denver stock show complex on a recent friday in her hand she held a leash that kept one of her family s 5 foot tall alpacas in line the grayish brown animal named aladar quietly followed alongside the two were up against other gray alpacas when a judge motioned for rarden to move forward she led him in a circle before stopping in a line of four other animals and their handlers he has a really great presence about him the judge said to her before poking and prodding his frame looking for any imperfections he s nice and level and we ve got a good uniformity of fleece the judge backed away and took one last look at the group before pointing to rarden and aladar and handing them a small blue ribbon the duo won first place in the division for gray males during the great western alpaca show the region s largest annual competition for the specialty livestock i m so relieved and really happy for him rarden said as she walked out of the ring with a smile on her face like the judge said he s a complete package rarden was one of about 500 breeders who competed in the show the first regular event of its kind since the start of the covid 19 pandemic in it alpacas are sorted into separate divisions by gender age species and color of fleece winners go head to head in championship rounds later in the day the stakes are high for many breeders top prize winning animals earn thousands of dollars more and it helps them stand out in this small but competitive industry while the show carried weight it was mostly a chance for farmers to show off their best animals and network among the state s sizable community i love the people and the atmosphere is just amazing said rarden whose family owns an alpaca farm in livermore just north of fort collins seeing the quality of the alpacas is also really cool a bumpy road for some the show has been around since the mid 90 s when alpaca farming first took off across the united states back then thousands of investors poured their money into the animals hoping their fleece would gain traction in the country s textile industry colorado s arid climate mimicked that of the animals native habitat of the andes mountains in south america which made the state an ideal place to raise them at their peak in the early 2000s a single alpaca sold for over 26 000 but the hype was mostly speculative due to comparatively low consumer demand and a lack of fleece processing capacity multiple studies show the supply demand imbalance caused the alpaca bubble to burst sometime around 2005 prices have come down since then and the number of farmers in the business has dwindled but there s still money in it said sharon loner a retired breeder who now volunteers as a scorekeeper at gwas a lot of people were in it for the wrong reasons loner said now more breeders are in it for the fiber and breeding programs alpaca fleece is mostly used as a specialty textile product small clothing producers are the biggest buyers making hats scarves gloves and other high cost accessory items high quality fleece on huacas the more common subspecies of alpaca can go for around 200 per pound like other industries impacted by the pandemic consumer demand dropped sharply during 2020 and most of 2021 said rebecca vin a breeder from washington who traveled to denver for this year s gwas show we don t even count covid vin said now it s back up again it s really easy to sell animals and fleece again which is really nice today there are roughly 10 000 alpacas in colorado according to the latest data from the colorado department of agriculture census of the species conducted in 2017 that number is extremely small compared to other livestock such as cattle which are in the millions it hasn t died out like we ve seen with other specialty livestock said loner the retired breeder and by that i m talking about maybe the emus and the ostriches you know they were going gangbusters three years ago and now not so much but these guys are hanging in there many farmers are retirees or hobbyists the animals are relatively docile and lower maintenance which makes them easier to care for than other livestock loner said they have this calming effect and i think that s what draws a lot of people to raising them she said older folks can handle these guys judging comes down to fleece and frame at gwas alpacas are split into two main competitions halter shows and walking fleece judges are often breeders themselves they go through a certification process with various industry groups in walking fleece animals are judged solely on their coats quality is determined by the uniformity of their micron strands and even color across their body halter shows take a more holistic view of the animals fleece is a factor in judging but so are teeth legs head size and feet all four feet need to be firmly on the ground loner said they can have weak ankles which is a defect as breeders lead their animals into the ring judges observe how each alpaca walks and behaves that s half the process then they get their hands on them looking at the shoulder stomach hips and more they re also spreading the fleece and looking for abnormalities in color loner said in a solid class say a pure white if there s a spot like a black spot you get dinged for that lack of uniformity of color ribbons are given for first second and third place in each division judges often give brief remarks to spectators following each round then those winners go head to head for a championship a champion in the making rarden was the youngest of this year s finalists i have a few friends that are in the business too from their parents but there s not a lot of younger people doing it she said rarden has done it her whole life though she hopes to take over her family s farm one day and grow the business so alpaca fleece is used as much as sheep s wool her grandma sharon milligan who also showed alpacas at gwas agreed with her energy that she has i m pushing her that way she said believe me rarden and aladar were against five other alpacas in the championship round the judge went animal to animal before handing a big blue banner with gold tassels to the teen and her animal congratulating the pair rarden shook hands with the competitors before leaving the ring she said never gets tired of working with the alpacas they re just so sweet and they re just so cute and it s just something that draws you to them and they re just amazing things to have she said aladar was rewarded with a fresh bale of hay to chew and rest until it was time to head back home to read more stories from colorado public radio visit www

the impending economic meltdown followed by climate catastrophes will augment the challenge of human insecurity in pakistan the year 2022 will witness unprecedented water energy and food crises which will jeopardise the livelihood of millions of people in the country since the inception of pakistan human security has never been prioritised by those at the helm of affairs instead their focus is on maintaining their power privileges and perks and protecting their comfort zones resultantly there is a risk of major environmental economic and political crises in the country which is threatening the country s very survival the whopping trade gap of 50 billion mounting debt of 150 billion meagre foreign exchange reserves of around 10 billion held by the state bank of pakistan surge in the prices of essential commodities along with severe water shortages mean that the country has already crossed the red lines of human insecurity the growing challenge of human insecurity is also visible in terms of a surge in corruption nepotism bad governance intolerance extremism violence and radicalisation of youth human security relates to a better quality of life by providing access to clean and safe drinking water a pollution free environment access to better education affordable and functional public transport health nutrition hygienic food and employment opportunities based on merit pakistan s poor ranking on the human development index 144th shows that in the 75 years of its existence all the regimes have failed to ensure human security human insecurity deepens in an environment where there is no accountability and an absence of adherence to the rule of law several post colonial countries and emerging economies of africa asia and latin america present successful models of human security upon close examination of these models it becomes clear that dynamic leadership strong work ethic mobilisation of youth in the process of human development women empowerment and focus on good governance have helped transform impoverished and backward societies into modern developed and peaceful ones despite being involved in a war with the us for nearly 10 years vietnam now has exports worth 336 billion and foreign exchange reserves of 110 billion with an economic growth rate of 7 bangladesh began from the scratch after separating from pakistan in 1971 and is now excelling with 45 billion worth of exports and foreign exchange reserves of 44 billion the uae gained independence from britain in 1971 and can now match any developed country with its exports of 306 billion and foreign exchange reserves of 129 billion most of these countries were way behind pakistan in various economic indicators however over the years they have achieved significant development and improved human security if pakistan fails to control problems related to the economy environment and depletion of resources it may plunge into a crisis like in sri lanka and other failing and failed states there is no shortcut or a quick fix to deal with the predicament of human insecurity but one can figure out three paths to save the 220 million people of pakistan from endless torture anguish and suffering first a professional approach must be taken along with adequate funding to deal with an impending environmental catastrophe in the form of the melting of glaciers rising temperatures and epidemic outbreaks controlling pollution by reducing gas emissions from factories industries vehicles and air conditioners along with reforestation can go a long way in saving pakistan from an environmental disaster the increase in human insecurity can also be linked to the absence of the rule of law and a lack of implementation of existing rules and regulations thus there should be strict implementation of government laws and legislation pakistan s institutions and people must adopt a zero tolerance policy toward extremism intolerance violence and terrorism second human insecurity cannot be mitigated unless those who are at the helm of affairs leave their comfort zones and experience the plight of common people historically pakistan s elites have demonstrated an indifferent attitude toward the economic and political issues of the country resultantly the country has remained mired in socio economic problems even though prime minister shehbaz sharif rightly warned that if political polarisation is not curbed pakistan may face a similar fate as syria and libya the government has failed to resolve political conflicts instead of strategising and presenting practical solutions to overcome the economic issues the lawmakers were more interested in debating and passing a resolution against the former prime minister for one of his recent speeches perhaps the government should shift focus on the falling foreign exchange reserves the crash of the stock market huge trade gap of around 50 billion sharp depreciation of the rupee vis à vis the dollar and escalation in the prices of essential commodities including food fuel and electricity unfortunately however prime minister shehbaz led a delegation to london to meet pml n patron nawaz sharif at the expense of taxpayers money this is a highly irresponsible act and demonstrates that the government is more concerned about maintaining its power and securing its image than ensuring the welfare of the people third difficult but bold steps need to be taken by state institutions to prevent political chaos disorder and violence by banning public meetings protest marches demonstrations and strikes as these acts have caused colossal loss to the pakistani economy it is imperative to shift focus on enforcing work ethics based on responsibility time management and accountability otherwise pakistan will god forbid become a failed state published in the express tribune may 15th 2022 like opinion editorial on facebook follow etoped on twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces
news flash rabbi jonathan cahn asked me to inform townhall readers about his prophetic movie the harbingers of things to come then across the nation theaters sold out for the may 12 premiere hence a may 19 show was added buy a ticket here advertisement author s note readers can find all previous volumes of this series here the first 56 volumes are compiled into the book bible study for those who don t read the bible thanks for joining our study for weeks now readers have noticed a news flash about rabbi jonathan cahn s documentary the harbingers of things to come note that i have promoted his movie with no compensation but believe that rabbi cahn s prophetic biblically based messages and god s dire warnings about our national future are calamitous and valid to help us learn raise awareness positively react and respond to the movie s message rabbi cahn created a study guide based on the hebrew bible old testament verses featured in the film and relevant to god s warnings today we will examine three of those passages but first if you are unfamiliar with the harbinger rabbi cahn s first new york times 1 best selling book published in 2011 it is essential to know that the book was classified as fiction however the harbinger is based on real world events surrounding the attacks of sept 11 2001 and the numerous jaw dropping connections to that date historically politically and biblically then in the movie rabbi cahn brilliantly connects america s destiny to god s biblical warnings and prophecies during the last days of the kingdom of israel before the neo assyrian empire conquered it in the eighth century b c moreover similar to ancient israel america has fallen away from god thus the harbingers are real world signs that god s judgment has begun ultimately the rabbi s message is a 911 call for america to repent and return to god advertisement recommended our first passage from the movie study guide is recorded in deuteronomy the fifth of the five books of moses also known as the torah they will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down they will besiege all the cities throughout the land the lord your god is giving you deuteronomy 28 52 a continuing theme of rabbi cahn s is the impending potential destruction of america since god has lifted his hedge of protection after we have dislodged him from our national foundation that matters because our declaration of independence states that america is founded on a principle that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness our national rights are derived from god not from a king which at the time was a revolutionary concept and for that concept our newly birthed nation fought and won independence from great britain then the world s strongest military power notable too is the last sentence of the declaration and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor our founders asked for relied on and received god s protection while rabbi cahn s movie recounts all the reasons why god has withdrawn his hedge of protection advertisement the next study guide passage is from jeremiah thus you shall say to him thus says the lord i am going to break down what i have built and pluck up what i have planted that is the whole land jeremiah 45 4 the study guide interprets jeremiah s verse with a harsh warning america s economic power and prosperity come from god but if the nation turns against its foundation then that power and prosperity will crumble it is chilling to requote that interpretation when at this moment inflation is spiraling out of control supply chain shortages are commonplace and the stock market is tanking our last study guide verse highlighted at the movie s end is a profound and familiar passage from 2 chronicles profound because of the severe prolonged drought covering 44 4 of the united states including puerto rico and of course the catastrophic pandemic continues that has killed a million americans in this passage god restates his power and offers a solution when i shut up the heavens so that there is no rain or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and i will forgive their sin and will heal their land 2 chronicles 7 13 14 finally i asked rabbi jonathan cahn to address townhall readers about the meaning of his movie he responded advertisement i believe the lord opened the door for the message to go forth as a movie because the time is late for america when i first wrote the harbinger i knew the mystery wasn t finished only beginning unfortunately america is following the ancient template of national judgment recorded in scripture we re following the footsteps of ancient israel in its last days before destruction we are no longer moving away from god we re racing away we re seeing events occur that we could hardly have imagined happening in american culture just a few years ago the mystery has not stopped and the stage of the mystery we are currently in is even more dangerous there is a purpose the harbingers of things to come came out at this moment to reveal the ancient biblical mystery behind what is now taking place in america show what it is all leading to and what god has called us to do in light of it overall the movie is a vessel to bring revelation to sound the alarm to those who know god and to those who don t and to give the only hope america has to be saved the feedback we ve received across the country from the may 12 opening night was that people were blown away in many theaters audiences broke out into applause and spontaneous prayer for revival on behalf of townhall readers i thank rabbi cahn for his message and must see movie advertisement myra kahn adams is a conservative political and religious writer with numerous national credits her book bible

at any rate this shows that we are still quite far from this transaction happening for real social media companies have long tried to rein in the bogus accounts littering their platforms bombarding users with unsolicited commercial messages content or requests beyond financially motivated spams and scams fake accounts can boost follower counts giving the impression of false popularity or be deployed in disinformation campaigns musk s tweet suggested concern that twitter which has long battled complaints about its bots has more fake accounts than it discloses he highlighted a news story citing a recent estimate from the company that fewer than 5 per cent of twitter s users are fake and spam accounts the figure has also appeared in each quarterly earnings filing going back to 2014 although twitter cautions it is an only an estimate and could be higher it has also been disputed by some researchers one study from 2017 put the total between 9 per cent and 15 per cent twitter has carried out occasional purges of spam accounts and invested in systems to catch and eradicate others but it has also dismissed researchers estimates and suggested the concern is overblown advertisement for musk who has more than 92 million followers on the platform and is regularly targeted by cryptocurrency scammers the issue has been a bugbear if i had a dogecoin for every crypto scam i saw we d have 100 billion dogecoin musk said last month he has said that one of his priorities for the platform would be to defeat the spam bots or die trying brian wieser global president of business intelligence at groupm says generally we should be sceptical of user numbers because estimation has to be made and there is no sufficient authentication of whether you have to be human he notes twitter has been more encouraging of the use of aliases compared with meta owned facebook which tries to link profiles to users real world identities but it does seem disingenuous to suddenly suggest this is a new thing he adds a cheaper deal while the bot dilemma is not new one thing has changed since musk first floated his offer tech stocks are sliding since the tesla chief executive made an offer to buy twitter on april 14 the nasdaq has dropped almost 18 per cent the social media platform s share price is down but has outperformed the tech index predominantly thanks to musk s offer advertisement nathan anderson the founder of short seller hindenburg research said last week the tech stock rout gave musk leverage to re cut the deal to buy twitter at a lower valuation in our view musk holds all the cards here he said the board quickly agreed to the deal when conditions were vastly more favourable and we think they d make the right decision again when faced with the present reality lvmh got jeweller tiffany to lower its sale price during the pandemic bloomberg while few know musk s real motives for casting doubt on the deal several analysts think it is possible he will try to get more favourable terms the us44 billion price tag is huge and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform says susannah streeter a tech analyst at hargreaves lansdown brent thill a tech analysis at jefferies agrees we believe elon musk is putting the deal on hold to negotiate a lower price advertisement once a deal is agreed however it is very hard to get a board to accept a lower offer delaware courts which rule on most corporate cases have rarely allowed this to happen unless agreed by both parties twitter s board would risk being sued if it agreed to a lower price without serious justification musk could use what is known as a material adverse change clause to force twitter to come to the negotiating table and accept a lower offer the bar for such a clause however is pretty high many buyers tried to use them during the pandemic to lower the price of deals agreed before the covid 19 pandemic wreaked havoc on valuations few succeed one company that did was lvmh which got jeweller tiffany to lower its sale price during the pandemic as part of its strategy the french luxury group threatened to walk away from the transaction claiming tiffany had made changes during the pandemic that breached its contractual agreement some think musk could be trying something similar sometimes acquirers might use new problems as a basis for renegotiating the deal price even if contractually musk is not entitled to do that a board might think it s easier to renegotiate than litigate over it says ann lipton associate professor in business law and entrepreneurship at tulane university is musk looking for a way out advertisement another possibility is that musk is simply looking to walk away whether he could do so easily will probably be a matter for the courts to decide twitter agreed a termination fee that could technically allow musk to abandon his takeover for us1 billion however the social media company can also sue to force him to complete the transaction much will depend on the circumstances daniel rubin a mergers and acquisitions attorney at dechert a us corporate law firm said musk could not just walk away by paying the us1 billion termination fee but he could find a way to force twitter to take cash and move on he can always engineer the conditions that will leave twitter with no meaningful choice but to terminate and allow him to walk away with a fee that caps his liability even for wilfully breaching it s essentially a walk right with a couple of steps in between rubin says musk has secured the financing for the deal but is trying to reduce his us6 5 billion margin loan by inviting wealthy and institutional investors to back his bid with equity he recently raised

this slideshow requires javascript what is your name and your current occupation ron brewer director what are some of the crazier jobs you had before getting into animation â i was a drug runner or should i say a delivery boy and stock clerk in a class 1 drug vault for a completely legitimate pharmaceutical warehouse we supplied all the pharmacies and hospitals in the san diego area i was involved in two armed robberies there the first was a gang from la that wore halloween masks they had shotguns and ar15s we were made to lie on the floor and then locked in the vault the second time was a gang from east la i was chased down the street by a guy with a handgun there was no where to run to we were tied up with duct tape curious that i would find the nerves needed to get through these trials to be a good tension test to be a good prerequisite to my animation career cartoons is war what are some of your favorite projects you re proud to have been a part of â i would have to say the pink panthers i was a part of i directed 28 shorts for pink panther and pals at rubicon studios la one of which won four 2011 kidscreen awards including best series best series viewers choice and viewers choice for best music â david ricard and best directing â me kerry valentine produced ceci aranovich did the design ryan green and i did boards rob sanders the sfx have a look the entire crew for the whole series was just awesome the pink panthers are pure cartoons because of the absence of dialogue such a challenge to get the message across stay true to the originals and hopefully be funny you can find them on youtube or itunes â then i got to direct â œa very pink christmasâ a pink panther special in the classic style itâ s the best thing i ve done to date kerry valentine producing ceci aranovich design david ricard music rob sanders sfx a story that really came together thanks to so many talented people who i am very proud to have worked with if youâ re a pink panther fan or could just use a smile go see it here â i had the pleasure of traveling to the philippines to meet the animation crew incredible the small army one of these things takes to complete this show was also for rubicon studios la manila and amman unfortunately not many people saw it when it aired last year 2011 no publicity you my insider friends know how that can go but it really is a good little show and maybe it will pick up speed as the christmasâ s roll by look out rudolph i loved watching saturday morning cartoons like the rest of you did when i was a kid i had this idea to makeanimated rock videos so i talked my brother into playing the guitar so i could do his videos i made a light disk and camera stand and then i made some pretty horrible little animations but the ideas remained and the passion remains and i am not done yet that which brought me here still drives me where are you from and how did you get into the animation business â i grew up in san diego my dad was a bigwig architect there i graduated a computer course on basic computer competency really both pc and mac the internet had just begun plus i learned a pliable skill â book keeping from there i answered an ad for â œcomputer artistâ and got the job it was the folks coloring the old black and white movies and everything else they could get their hands on some of you may remember everyone hated us but the cool thing was they had an animation department barry sandrew was doing the software down there and came up with a program that could storyboard and animate you could only put 24 frames on a huge floppy disk and when you hit save you could go get a coffee have a sandwich walk your dogâ it took a while but it was pretty much the forerunner to what toon boom products look like today so crazy i have come full circle with electronic animation software i bugged the hell out of them until they gave me my first jobs in animation including directing the animation for a season of â œthe attack of the killer tomatoesâ for fox and also foreign production supervisor in mexico on another show â œduckmanâ season four storyboard revisionist was my first â œhollywoodâ gig and now i canâ t wait to see whatâ s next i would like to break into feature length film what s a typical day like for you with regards to your job long crazy days are the norm our lives get sort of put on hold as we work some long hours most of the time itâ s worth it what part of your job do you like best why i like building and telling the story the best writing and boarding thatâ s the reason i like directing i also like the collaboration between other creative types there are so many aspects to the different arts that go into it and differences that other artists bring to it i mean that in the most positive way putting together something that really works always makes my loin tingle what part of your job do you like least why â this is without a doubt the best job in the world until you slap a deadline on it right limitations kill all the fun i suppose itâ s a necessary evil though isnâ t it what kind of technology do you work with on a daily basis i use storyboard pro the most because boarding is the biggest chunk of the pie the blueprint but i also use pencil and paper which has been around for a while look it up i have a cintiq i use photoshop for noting or approving work fixes i also use sketchbook pro for ideas its closer to a pencil final cut pro for editing timing final draft for writing i also designed from scratch and maintain my own website so i use dreamweaver for that iâ m ok at flash as well plus miscellaneous others what is the most difficult part for you about being in the business just the sheer amount of time it all takes its never fast enough and its never finished just done and if you really care about what youâ re making like i do then you put in the hours in your travels have you had any brushes with animation greatness i would have to say hell yes if youâ re in the business you know there are a lot of famous folks walking around and the caliber of people one gets to work with on a daily basis means that after a while â œawesomeâ is just expected itâ s only when something falls below the normal bar that we discuss sometimes itâ s impossible to name them all because there are so many areas of the art but i think if you help others teach explain and pass on you are one of the great ones describe a tough situation you had in life after a long illness my mom passed away from pancreatic cancer she died in my arms it was the most horrifying and the most beautiful experience of my life any side projects you re working on or hobbies you d like to share details of yes i have some interest in an animated feature i am writing and i am always looking for the next opportunity any unusual talents or hobbiesâ likeâ tying a cherry stem with your tongueâ orâ metallurgy well to anybody who is not in the business writing a screenplay is an unusual hobby but i like to travel and get outdoors is there any advice you can give for an aspiring animation student or artist trying to break into the business probably the same as others would say watch listen learn but most importantly ask questions find out why people do things i think i survive not because i m the most awesome artist around or the most incredible board artist around because there are so many people better than me at any one thing but i survive because i can see the big picture and understand why i do things the way i do i may not be the best artist but i know what to draw and why find out why things work and you will find the keys to the kingdom i think magic kingdom is copyrighted or something but you get the idea
strange times call for strange measures in the world created by the pandemic business owners have to struggle with a host of issues tangled supply chains strained manpower pools shortages of pretty much everything this is as true in the liquor industry as it is anywhere else and just like anyone else liquor store owners are thinking outside the box the short supply of some liquor has led to the emergence of software robots or bots that order cases of hard to get tipples finding and ordering them immediately while they are a solution to a problem for some stores others see their use as unfair but in the long run will this software assistance matter tangled chains in mississippi liquor stores are required to order their stock from alcohol beverage control which is a division of the department of revenue the heart of the operation is a warehouse in gluckstadt that is more than 200 000 square feet and contains over a mile and a half of conveyor belts according to abc deputy director chip jones store owners use a web portal to place orders as soon as a truck unloads those cases of booze appear on the state s web site and are available to order jones said if a truck comes in with crown royal the cases are offloaded and processed and put into inventory jones said any permittee can see it and place an order at that point getting that case of crown to a store used to be a matter of a few days jones said before covid you were looking at one to two days to get an order he said if they placed an order before about 11 a m that morning it went out on the truck that night and they would get it the next day the pandemic brought that delivery time to a screeching halt pretty much literally james ervin owns mike s liquor store on highway 45 north his frustration at trying to fill his shelves is palpable during covid it was taking up to four weeks to fill an order ervin said i had a liquor representative tell me that at one point the state was 200 000 cases behind on orders i ve ordered stuff i wanted to have for christmas and got it four months later that delay has shrunk according to jason sims who owns the jug in east columbus we re still looking at about a two week delay in delivery sims said that s still a drastic change from what it was before the pandemic ervin agreed the situation had changed since the nadir of the pandemic but was still much slower than it used to be the order i m getting tomorrow was placed two weeks ago he said the supply chain isn t as bad as it was but it s still bad the delays are driven by several intersecting problems jones said the first is the early pandemic spike in demand which feeds into the resulting tangles in the supply chain demand just shot up tremendously some months as much as 40 percent he said our normal growth rate was around 5 percent annually over the past two years it s been more like 20 percent while demand is not stable jones said it is still elevated over pre pandemic figures then there were the other delays caused by shipping and shortages there was a glass shortage at one point jones said distilleries may have the juice but they didn t have the bottles there was a strike at heaven hill distillery for two months when ports in california have a backlog of ships then we re waiting on that product it s all kinds of things outside of mississippi that affect what happens here as that backlog began to work itself out abc faced a new challenge finding workers warehouse workers left applications dried up jones said abc s warehouse was only staffed at about 70 percent we would ship about 65 000 cases a week before covid he said it was usually higher at the front and back ends of the week there was a lull in the middle where we could catch up on paperwork cleaning things like that now we re shipping at full capacity every night and it s a stress on the workforce and on the equipment that stress manifests in high turnover he said we re at 90 percent staffing now probably but about 10 percent of those you can t count on to stick around he said the turnover rate is just ridiculous so you spend a lot of time training and interviewing and it doesn t leave a lot of time to deal with other problems for want of a hennessy all of these fits and starts in the supply chain and the abc warehouse leave store owners in the lurch especially when it comes to something that s already hard to get take hennessy for example the cognac came up in practically every discussion the dispatch had reporting this story as something that was in high demand but hard for either abc or store owners to grab demand has always exceeded supply jones said as soon as it comes in it sells out stores that usually ordered two or three cases went to ordering 20 30 at a time jones said to try to ease the demand among the state s 700 plus stores abc put a cap on the number of cases a store could order during a certain time period this didn t sit well with some store owners who already felt that they weren t getting their fair share so they turned to technology as a force multiplier the idea was that a bot could monitor the stock at abc s warehouse and as soon as something hard to find like hennessy came available the bot could place an order nearly instantaneously one liquor store owner who uses such a bot agreed to speak to the dispatch on condition of anonymity what it does is it searches for a specific product they said if it s in there it tells me it s in stock and how many cases right now the bot doesn t order for me but i m fixing to program it to do that too they said they turned to bots after getting frustrated at their inability to get certain products including hennessy you can sit online and see a thousand cases of hennessy show up they said the state won t let you order but 10 cases at a time by the time i see that it s in and jump on the computer and put in my order those thousand cases may already be gone i couldn t get the products i needed because i was having to search and order manually they said they suspected rival stores of using bots and called abc to complain the guy at abc told me to get my own program they said so i said ok thank you they hired a student at east mississippi community college who was in a technical program to create the bot thirteen pages of code was all it took someone who s computer savvy could write one themselves they said other liquor store owners who don t use bots feel the practice is unfair none of the anti bot store owners the dispatch contacted would talk on the record for this story but all of them said they were increasingly at a disadvantage when it came to getting in demand or rarer products they also questioned how hundreds of cases of hennessy or whatever else could disappear in minutes how did everybody know it was going to be there and then it s gone all in under a minute one wondered jones who works on the warehouse not enforcement end of abc said that bots are not illegal we ve talked to the legal department and enforcement and the position is that there s nothing illegal about it he said it s not that much different than stores that already hire a college student to sit in front of a computer all day and check just like a bot would do the only thing that could cause an issue is if bots eat up a ton of bandwidth that would slow the whole system down light at the end of the tunnel all of this the bots the backlogs the queues of orders may soon be irrelevant due to a bill passed in the most recent session that both privatizes operations at the warehouse and allows a new warehouse to be built inbound and outbound operations will be outsourced to a third party company he said the big thing there is that workers will not be tied to the state personnel board as far as wages so there will be more flexibility to answer the market and what the expectation for wages is the warehouse also typically operates on a four day work week and private ownership could expand those hours to better meet needs the majority of the liquor store owners who spoke to the dispatch said they thought that would clear up many of the problems that drove store owners to bots in the first place we re expecting a pretty drastic change going forward sims said brian jones is the local government reporter for columbus and lowndes county
australians face giving up red meat under a net zero by 2050 climate change target as much of the developed world questions if the goal is too ambitious that s the grim warning from queensland senator and former economist matt canavan and baeconomics managing director brian fisher if the country proceeds with that environmental ambition despite australia s carbon emissions representing a miniscule 1 4 per cent of the global total both prime minister scott morrison and labor leader anthony albanese have committed to either eliminating or offsetting carbon emissions by 2050 despite much of europe walking away from the same target in the face of rising energy costs after heavily relying on russian gas australians could be making big sacrifices for nothing in a bid to curb sea level rises as other major economies shirk their responsibility to alleviate global warming and keep temperature rises to 1 5c above pre industrial levels australians face giving up red meat under a net zero by 2050 climate change target as much of the developed world questions if the goal is too ambitious pictured is a stock image senator canavan a nationals backbencher who is based in the beef cattle city of rockhampton said that under net zero by 2050 meat would become a luxury item i don t think people would vote to have red meat banned he told daily mail australia welcome to your net zero world where you ll only be able to have a steak chips and salad once every three weeks or so if you re going down to your local rsl there just won t be red meat on the menu food prices would also surge beyond already high inflation levels as agricultural fertilisers were phased out i don t think they d vote to have their food prices skyrocket if modern fertilisers were banned but they come from natural gas senator canavan said what happens to our food supply senator canavan who is often a lone voice opposing net zero on the government backbench said those calling for more ambitious action on climate change often lived in wealthy electorates senator matt canavan pictured left with wife andrea a nationals backbencher who is based in the beef cattle city of rockhampton said that under net zero by 2050 meat would become a luxury item this is the hypocrisy here the inner city people are championing net zero policies they ll be fine they ll just pay the extra prices for the eye fillet he said steak prices in melbourne restaurants will be 100 and people will pay it it s those that continue on with a high consumer lifestyle and probably create more emissions than the average person through flying and travelling who want everybody else to suffer so many of the loud australians are based in inner city electorates and they tend to have a bigger megaphone climate change independents are polling strongly in inner city harbour view liberal party seats in sydney including wentworth in the eastern suburbs and north sydney and the wealthy inner melbourne electorates of kooyong and goldstein dr fisher said both major parties had failed to explain the cost of achieving the net zero target in less than three decades if you spend enough money on it you can probably do it but it s really not that far away 2050 he told daily mail australia the transformation we re talking about to get to net zero is absolutely huge basically what you ve got to do is you ve got to turn around the australian economy which has been dependent on fossil fuels forever basically baeconomics managing director dr brian fisher said a net zero by 2050 target would also mean banning methane gases from cows unless carbon sequestration technology was developed to store those carbon emissions underground dr fisher said a net zero by 2050 target would also mean banning methane gases from cows unless carbon sequestration technology was developed to store those carbon emissions underground if you look at methane that means you ve got to deal with burping livestock he said that s actually probably going to turn out to be pretty hard i don t think the world s population is going to turn vegetation overnight frankly i just don t think that s realistic so that means to get rid of those emissions then you have to offset them somewhere while australia is one of the world s larger greenhouse gas emitters per capita the 494million tonnes it produced in 2021 is only a fraction of china s 11 9billion tonnes international energy agency figures show china produced fewer emissions for every resident compared with australia but it was still responsible for a third of the world s carbon emissions last year as its carbon pollution increased in 2020 and 2021 following a strong economic rebound from the pandemic senator canavan a former productivity commission economist argued the net zero by 2050 goal was effectively dead because the likes of germany and italy were reviving coal fired power stations to be less reliant on natural gas from dictator vladimir putin s russia food prices would also surge beyond already high inflation levels as agricultural fertilisers were phased out pictured is a sydney woolworths supermarket the united states which also has a net zero by 2050 target is battling even higher inflation than australia that doesn t mean to me we should do nothing but it definitely means we shouldn t go anything unless other countries are doing it too senator canavan said there s pretty much no one going towards net zero right now because europe s having to fight putin america s trying to control its inflationary pressures about the only country in the world that s moving towards net zero is afghanistan and they re not doing it because they re installing a lot of renewable energy dr fisher said europe s dependence on russian gas made achieving a net zero climate change target extremely difficult this has to have some impact on the speed with which we make progress towards net zero he said whether the targets are dead that s probably an overstatement but there s certainly going to be some modification in terms of various countries in europe s ambition senator canavan a former resources minister said adopting a net zero target in less than three decades would also make it harder for australia and other democracies to defend itself against a more aggressive china it s about trying to find a correct balance between reducing our carbon emissions and maintaining an industrial economy that can defend our nation defend our democracy and i don t think we re getting that balance quite right in the west right now he said the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change is calling for net zero by 2050 or a 45 per cent emissions cut by 2030 to keep temperature rises to 1 5c above pre industrial levels the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change is calling for net zero by 2050 or a 45 per cent emissions cut by 2030 to keep temperature rises to 1 5c above pre industrial levels pictured is an open cut mine in the new south wales hunter valley the kind of action we d need to keep to that just won t happen in an environment where china and russia and india are not fully co operating with the rest of the world senator canavan said both labor and the coalition have ruled out introducing a carbon price after former liberal leader tony abbott won the 2013 election in a landslide by campaigning to scrap alp prime minister julia gillard s hated carbon tax dr fisher said companies would be unlikely to phase out the use of fossil fuels like petrol and coal unless a carbon price of 200 to 300 a tonne was imposed a level more than 10 times the short lived 23 carbon tax that existed in 2012 and 2013 that would also mean passing on the cost on to consumers which in turn would mean incredibly high inflation when you start to mitigate those things you re going to add costs there is no escape from that dr fisher said when you start to inject those sorts of costs into the economy effectively everywhere because the economy is dependent on energy it s dependent on fertiliser it s dependent on agriculture where methane is a major greenhouse gas climate change independents are polling strongly in inner city harbour view liberal party seats in sydney including wentworth candidate allegra spender pictured in the eastern suburbs and north sydney and the wealthy inner melbourne electorates of kooyong and goldstein former labor prime minister kevin rudd in early 2010 abandoned plans for an emissions trading scheme with a floating price on carbon after the greens voted against it in the senate with the coalition but his successor ms gillard imposed a carbon tax with a fixed price after labor lost its majority at the august 2010 election forcing it to rely on the greens and regional independents to form a minority government political calculations about the cost of living could potentially see a future government abandon a net zero by 2050 target ahead of an election if you re going to hit net zero it s costly regardless of what politicians tell you and as a consequence of that there s going to be a whole lot of political juggling to mitigate some of those cost pressures on certain parts of society dr fisher said senator canavan said despite the political slogans very few people would be prepared to make sacrifices to achieve net zero emissions even in wealthy cosmopolitan postcodes both prime minister scott morrison and labor leader anthony albanese have committed to either eliminating or offsetting carbon emissions by 2050 despite much of europe walking away from the same target in the face of rising energy costs after heavily relying on russian gas pictured is a solar farm near canberra the actual number of people that truly understand this or advocate this in such a radical way is quite small i don t think there s a large scale support there in the community even in inner city electorates for this type of radical action he said then there is the issue of mining rare earth minerals like lithium used for electric car batteries along with nickel cobalt and copper there s a real question about whether those resources actually even exist and that hasn t been addressed dr fisher said australia s share of global carbon emissions from domestic use stood at just 1 4 per cent in 2017 a report by the german based climate analytics group showed the science says australia can t change the temperature of the globe on its own senator canavan said but with a population of 25 7million australia which still relies heavily on coal for electricity generation has some of the world s highest per capita carbon emissions uk climate think tank ember noted australia had the world s highest emissions from burning coal for electricity based on population noting they were at levels five times the global average ahead of china and india australia s 494milllion tonnes of carbon emissions in the year to march 2021 was one 24th that of china

i have a modest proposal for those vehemently opposed to abortion thanks to the recent supreme court leak we now know the days of roe v wade are numbered those devoted to protecting the lives of the unborn will soon find themselves at a loss for what to do with their time and energy what about the rights of the unconceived think of all those restless souls wandering around heaven waiting for welcoming wombs while so many american women of childbearing age are selfishly forgoing motherhood in favor of careers and then there are those young mothers who are limiting the size of their families in pursuit of creature comforts they could live without the biblical injunction to be fruitful and multiply i realize is not normative for everyone in our pluralistic society but the fact remains that the american birthrate today is only half of what it was in 1950 down from 24 percent per 1 000 people to 12 percent the vitality and social security of our nation are at stake most readers are no doubt familiar with margaret atwood s novel the handmaid s tale 2005 it posits an apocalyptic future in which a theocratic government has reduced fertile young women to enslaved breeding stock i am frankly concerned that reactionary patriarchal currents are swirling around us at present and that some in our society would view atwood s vision as more aspirational than dystopian we can head off these people by mobilizing a new right to conception movement the members could take their cue from the former one child policy in china neighbors there would actually pressure a woman carrying a second child to get an abortion that was all wrong of course but would it be so bad to harass and hound our women to do their civic duty by having as many babies as they are capable of having the church i grew up in the church that forbids artificial methods of birth control would surely support this the only sticking point might be the church s longstanding insistence that procreation take place only within marriage but the no meat on fridays rule was rescinded and intentionally violating that rule was held to be a mortal sin no word on whether those damned for this reason were granted a general amnesty or pardon the current pope can be reasoned with but i digress i do understand that this new right to conception movement could occasion some economic hardship among single women and married women with limited means i therefore propose that the government pay a significant stipend for every confirmed pregnancy as for those unable to care for and raise a child a system of government run camps or dormitories could be set up to house such women and to arrange adoptions and to really ensure the success of the movement we could also take a cue from texas and adapt their method of anti abortion enforcement we could deputize women with children to sue young women with no legitimate excuse for remaining childless i hasten to add that what i am proposing is not a matter of enlightened self interest mrs palm is beyond childbearing age were we younger we would be happy to do our part so with apologies to jonathan swift i hereby submit my proposal for your consideration
how can you reduce the price of new homes you can start by reducing the cost of building them or at least that s part of the premise behind a 13 member task force the legislature approved in march to try to address indiana s affordable housing shortage a problem exacerbated last year by a double digit nationwide rise in home prices as supply chain snafus labor woes and inflation continue house bill 1306 aims to increase the supply of affordable houses primarily by rethinking local regulations that builders and critics say force construction costs higher you see this ebb and flow of these crises that you go through said republican rep doug miller of elkhart the legislation s author but at the end of the day the consistent thing in there through everything is how did the government platforms that builders developers realtors habitat for humanity all these different entities operate within how did they impact development the agenda could include a close look at local architectural rules such as requiring brick siding and impact fees that often add thousands to construction costs said miller who has worked in house building and property management more than 45 years the potential boon to developers is unwelcome news however for the municipalities that use those architectural requirements to guide development and boost income in the face of state imposed property tax limits and deductions the push and pull between communities and developers can be challenging said fishers mayor scott fadness a republican but he said it works it allows a community to make its own policy decisions with the market forces that they feel i think any kind of arbitrary state preemption of that process is probably not the appropriate way to address any particular issue hoosiers experienced a 17 6 jump in home values from march 2021 to march 2022 according to the zillow home value index but the inspiration for the new housing task force according to miller comes from farther afield maine where zillow data says home values have soared 21 since march 2021 there democratic house speaker ryan fecteau led the creation of a commission meant to expand the housing supply through an examination of zoning and land use restrictions in the resulting report released in december the 15 member body recommended ditching single family zoning restrictions statewide allowing accessory dwelling units by right no need for a special permit to add a garage apartment barring municipal residential construction caps and otherwise encouraging density but on its path through maine s legislative chambers the legislation seeking to implement those recommendations was caught between democrats seeking to push denser development in the midst of a severe housing shortage and republicans who considered it overreach maine s democratic controlled legislature passed a watered down version in late april without the ban on growth caps or a state board that would ve been able to overrule the rejection of local affordable housing projects in indiana miller s legislation to create the task force initially passed out of the republican dominated house in january 71 19 splitting democrats but it flew through the gop controlled senate in march on a unanimous vote by its second turn in the house legislators approved an amended version 88 2 move the needle the task force has plenty of work ahead with its own report due in december that miller hopes will include concrete recommendations for the 2023 legislative session we need to be focused so that we can get some thoughts put forward for legislation he said listening to both committee hearings and then seeing how really almost unanimously this legislation passed out of the house and senate i think the general assembly s in concurrence with that we realize we ve got to generate some ideas on how to kind of move the needle the task force will include appointees by republican house speaker todd huston democratic minority leader greg taylor republican senate president rodric bray and democratic minority leader phil giaquinta miller said he has asked to serve lt gov suzanne crouch will appoint one member from her office which houses the indiana housing and community development authority she ll also appoint representatives put forward by a swath of eight influential interest groups including the indiana builders association the indiana association of realtors the indiana apartment association the indiana manufactured housing association the indiana bankers association habitat for humanity indiana accelerate indiana municipalities and the hoosier housing needs coalition most are entities that kind of are with consumers buyers or renters or whoever from start to finish miller said like the powerful builders association others are niche like habitat for humanity a not for profit that uses volunteers to build single family houses for low income applicants or the manufactured housing association which covers the structures commonly known as mobile homes accelerate indiana municipalities meanwhile advocates for local units of government and the housing needs coalition represents residents but in addition to bringing together members of both political parties the task force will also join groups that have previously been on opposite sides of locally aimed housing legislation and that still see little common ground who knows best both miller s task force and its maine counterpart were told to research and recommend ways to increase the stock of affordable housing yet while maine s recommendations centered on fitting more people in limited space the indiana task force will focus on lowering the cost of building houses miller and builders association president paul schwinghammer said they d want to review aesthetic or architectural requirements permitting and impact fees and interlocal coordination on zoning laws i ve seen instances where a county or local unit says we don t want white vinyl siding homes in our community we want them to look a certain way and just as an individual and actually as a builder i find that kind of offensive miller said developers who invest the time and the resources to do their market studies to decide their price points and decide the group of buyers that they want to serve i think they should be the ultimate fallback for the design elements for how the community s laid out he added the effort recalls miller s house bill 1114 in the 2021 session which sought to ban municipalities from regulating residential design elements like exterior building color and material roof style and material and more it got a committee hearing miller chairs the house committee on government and regulatory reform but never crossed over to the senate and while it had support from the builders association local government advocates like accelerate indiana municipalities were firmly against it that split persists communities like some in hamilton county are well known for specifications on brick over vinyl garage door placement room type and number square footage uniqueness and more schwinghammer said those regulations can add 8 000 to 15 000 to the cost of a new house based on looks not giving the homeowner any more features that they can necessarily enjoy every time you add 1 000 to the cost of the house you are pushing about 3 200 households out of the market in indiana said schwinghammer who is also owner and president of anderson based hallmark homes but for local government and its supporters the control matters task force member organization accelerate indiana municipalities is unlikely to support measures that to any degree preempt any local decision making said government affairs director jenna knepper we all have our own visions and goals said noblesville community development director sarah reed when you take away the ability for us to build our standards and regulations around ensuring those goals happen then we lose the ability to make the community what we want it to be and what people were elected to carry forward for constituents fishers fadness similarly defended the architectural requirements set out in his city s lengthy unified development code i would challenge you to think about this from the perspective of a resident who s already invested their life savings in their home he said when we present a new project they re going to want to see a housing product that s at the same standard if not greater to protect the interests of their home in the community that they want to live in budgeting for development aesthetics aren t everything this debate also is about revenue sources for local government indiana s property tax caps took full effect in 2010 limiting residential taxes to 1 of a home s assessed value a 2020 report from ball state university found that in the 10 years following 26 of 28 municipalities saw revenue reductions leading most to cut public services more expensive houses potentially with brick or other high priced features can notch higher assessed values that s one motivation for a recent resort style housing push from the city of noblesville which currently hosts the majority of hamilton county homes in the 100 000 to 350 000 range according to reed the city also has 62 of the county s federally subsidized housing units despite making up just 20 of the county population we are focusing on getting higher end housing on our tax rolls reed said to catch up with neighboring municipalities reed s deputy mayor level position includes the city s economic development planning and housing efforts when we re trying to attract a new company and we re looking at where do the ceos live we don t necessarily want to lose them to chatham hills in westfield reed added we want them to stay in noblesville fadness also acknowledged a motivation to drive assessed value but pushed back on the role of specific materials i don t think we sit here most days and say well if we just added another layer of brick on this house we re going to gain more tax revenue fadness said i believe it has more to do with creating a vision of a community that you want fadness and reed highlighted the high cost of land in high demand communities like fishers and noblesville both said there s no specific appraised value at which a house generates enough property tax revenue to cover its share of municipal expenditures on schools roads libraries etc that s because factors like density distance from the city core proximity to a school or park and revenue from other new arrivals vary greatly they said fees rules local governments acknowledged however a more direct role for impact fees municipalities typically impose them to offset the strain of new development on infrastructure fees are typically in the low thousands but they can get pricier the town of pendleton for example created a road impact fee last july that would add nearly 9 000 to the cost of a new single family house the opportunity to charge an impact fee says yes we re excited to have you be a part of our community but you re going to have to pay your way when it comes to infrastructure fadness said that s just a public policy public financial strategy that i think is appropriate if you don t want to put undue financial burden on current residents builders want to scrap the fees even as municipalities around indiana update and add to them schwinghammer also is concerned about trying to comply with so many municipalities development requirements we re following potentially dozens of different kinds of sets of rules if you will interpretations of how indiana code is to be enforced said schwinghammer whose company operates in about 80 of indiana s 92 counties he advocated for a state level position to make more standard interpretations of indiana code to avoid long and costly disputes with building inspectors indiana s two year warranty requirement on new houses also adds costs he said he argued that ditching it or other regulations wouldn t harm safety the builders association led the years long charge against mandatory fire sprinklers on the basis that they weren t cost effective to install or maintain strained slow rural water systems and didn t protect people as well as smoke detectors a law prohibiting the mandate passed in 2018 the saying that i like is that smoke detectors save lives and fire sprinklers save property schwinghammer said according to the national fire protection association however fire sprinklers can rapidly extinguish flames or at minimum significantly reduce heat and prevent formation of toxic smoke but since they run through a dozen or more gallons of water a minute they need to be on a water system with enough capacity who s served miller s task force has some ground to cover but would consumers get relief from any measures that result from it schwinghammer said to expect savings at least in new construction with most custom builders that i know and work with because we have to compete against each other we re going to sell houses competitively at a fair market profit margin he said nobody s out there making 40 50 profit margins the answer is less clear for hoosiers buying existing houses or renting or for those who can barely afford to do either indiana s most severe housing shortage according to the national low income housing coalition is for very low income residents i think there is a general perception that indiana is an affordable place to live said prosperity indiana policy director andrew bradley the organization staffs the hoosier housing needs coalition but really once you get down to the bottom 30 or so of the income bracket there really are very few places that are both affordable and available of those 200 000 households a quarter of indiana s families nearly 75 hand over more than half their monthly incomes to stay housed according to the national low income housing coalition but even market rate solutions like miller s task force could help in certain places you may have households that could afford more that are in a smaller unit they re kind of taking up inventory when they could afford something larger if we increased availability and unclogged the pipeline bradley said though he cautioned that wouldn t be a comprehensive solution legislators also have pushed miller on options for impoverished hoosiers he expressed interest in creating a second task force focused on non market rate strategies to target the housing supply for very low income residents the initial market rate version could serve as a less politically vulnerable subsidy less proof of concept i want to put anybody that wants to own a home i don t care what your income level is anything i want to try and help get you in a home miller said because that s the key to generational wealth at any level i m just interested in having those discussions

at the beginning of may the british web3 community celebrated an important legal precedent the high court of justice in london the closest analog to the united states supreme court has ruled that nonfungible tokens nft represent private property there is a caveat though in the court s ruling this private property status does not extend to the actual underlying content that nft represents cointelegraph reached out to legal experts to understand what this decision could possibly change in the british legal landscape the theft of boss beauties in february 2022 lavinia d osbourne founder of women in blockchain talks wrote on twitter that two digital works had been stolen from the boss beauties a 10 000 nft collection of empowered women that was created by gen z change makers and featured at the new york stock exchange the tokens came with a number of utility points such as access to exclusive events free books and licensing fees osbourne claimed that the pieces stolen from her metamask wallet later emerged on the opensea market she traced down the nfts with the help of the security and intelligence firm mitmark the matter was brought to court in march and on april 29 the art newspaper reported on the ruling of the united kingdom s high court in which the judges have recognized nfts as property protected by law in addition the court issued an injunction to freeze the assets on the accounts of ozone networks the host of opensea and compelled opensea to disclose information about the two account holders in possession of the stolen nfts shortly afterward opensea halted the sale of these nfts boss beauties number 680 and 691 as the identities of the wallet holders remain uncertain the injunction was granted against persons unknown in its comment on the decision stevenson law firm called a freezing injunction quite a draconian i e old fashioned and harsh remedy describing it as a nuclear weapon of law following the court order osbourne victoriously proclaimed women in blockchain talks was founded to open up the opportunities blockchain offers to anyone regardless of age gender nationality or background this case will hopefully be instrumental in making the blockchain space a safer one encouraging more people to interact with exciting and meaningful assets like nfts the token and the asset racheal muldoon the counsel on the case highlighted the utmost significance of the ruling which she said removes any uncertainty that nfts are property in and of themselves distinct from the thing they represent under the law of england and wales but it is exactly the aforementioned detail that made other experts skeptical of the groundbreaking importance of the court s decision while the nfts are already enjoying the status of property in their treatment by the u s internal revenue service the proclaimed difference between the token and the underlying asset does little to fill the current legislative vacuum in the u k and united states so if you have a token you have a token but not necessarily any rights in anything else as juliet moringiello professor at widener university commonwealth law schoo noted to artnet news as assistant director of the institute of art and law emily gould reminded in her opinion piece on the case u k courts decisions regulatory developments and governmental studies over the past few years have been increasingly consonant in categorizing crypto assets as property she specifically pointed to 2019 s aa v persons unknown and the legal statement on cryptoassets and smart contracts report presented by the uk jurisdiction taskforce of the lawtech delivery panel in the same year what s next the underlying property or asset that the nft represents be that artwork or any other copyrightable material are still governed in the u k by the same copyright laws as in the united states tom graham u k based ceo and co founder of web3 company metaphysic ai explained to cointelegraph this decision doesn t help clarify that distinction but for graham the ruling still set an interesting precedent as the court had issued an injunctive order to opensea this is significant in terms of courts stepping in and providing injunctive relief where nfts have been stolen he added it is now unambiguous that nfts are governed by the same property laws in the u k that govern all other property it sets a great precedent for people investing in nfts that the court system at least in the u k will protect their property rights speaking to cointelegraph anna trinh chief compliance officer of digital finance firm aquanow noted that the ruling is not revolutionary but not without executive importance establishing legal precedent that affirms what most already believed to be the case may give nft platforms more comfort in demanding to freeze malevolent actors accounts trinh said i don t think nfts being recognized as private or personal property is much of a surprise you can buy sell or trade nfts which essentially points to them being personal property on first principles it would have been more shocking had the court held that nfts were not personal property trinh doesn t see the existing legal protections for the underlying assets as problematic these are governed by the contract s content at the time of purchase so contractual law and intellectual property law would come into play depending on the nature of the asset in trinh s opinion there are more urgent legal issues that regulators could pay attention to such as creators rights
a children s charity which offers real afro hair in its wigs for young cancer sufferers has revealed they ve only had three orders in the past year the little princess trust lpt had been researching afro textured wigs for many years but were told over and over again the hair was too fine and delicate and can be brittle and break on a wig however last year the organisation began offering heritage afro wigs after partnering with london s oldest surviving wig maker raouls wigmakers which found the perfect weave to make the afro hair stronger ceo phil brace has now revealed the organisation has only provided three of their heritage wigs with many still choosing the traditional afro wigs they had always been offering where straight hair is styled into tight curls he told femail the more afro

month she was finally able to do so the little princess trust lpt began offering real afro hair in its wigs last year but since the launch last year the charity have only provided three what are the causes of hair loss it is perfectly normal for people to lose small amounts of hair as it replenishes itself and on average people can shed between 50 and 100 hairs per day however if people start to lose entire patches of hair or large amounts of it it can be more distressing and potentially a sign of something serious pattern baldness is a common cause of hair loss as people grow older at least half of men over the age of 50 will lose some of their hair just through the ageing process according to the british association of dermatologists women may lose their hair as they grow older too other more concerning causes of hair loss include stress cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy weight loss or an iron deficiency most hair loss is temporary however and can be expected to grow back specific medical conditions which cause the hair to fall out include alopecia a disorder of the immune system an underactive or overactive thyroid the skin condition lichen planus or hodgkin s lymphoma a type of cancer people should visit their doctor if their hair starts to fall out in lumps falls out suddenly if their scalp itches or burns and if hair loss is causing them severe stress advertisement the most important is their treatment and we all know that chemotherapy and radiotherapy kills the cells on the head and then there s hair loss wigs are not a vanity for these youngsters these wigs gives the individual identify and confidence and often helps them fight the condition it s an important service we ve always provided textured afro wigs but we re very aware that heritage is important to many people so we ve been trying to develop a real afro wig for many years but we were told that afro hair was too delicate to be used in our wigs we ve always prioritised inclusivity and wanted to give people a choice but you need intention to find a heritage wig he said the organisation were told over and over again the hair was too fine and delicate and can be brittle and break on a wig but thanks to a collaborative venture london s oldest surviving wig maker since 1899 raouls wigmakers found the perfect weave to make the afro hair stronger their short wig is hand knotted while longer ones are made using a mixture of wefts and knotting in the lace at the top of the wig cap phil added here at lpt we are famous for our base it s like a swimming cap and they re the heart of our wig process so to find a weave for afro hair on one of our caps was difficult we d been dipping in and out of the venture for many years but most of our wigs were made in the far east and there just wasn t the detail for afro hair in their factories eventually caroline shaw who runs raoul in paddington teamed up with lpt and over a 12 month period her team tweaked the traditional weaving method to accommodate afro hair on lpt wig base she recently told es magazine the wefting technique which we use is not a new technique from the world of wig making but we have adapted and used it for natural unprocessed afro hair to create a robust structure which enables longevity the hand tied method is used around the crown and the sides of the wig giving a natural overall finish this minimises the damage which can occur because of the tension created within the wig making process shaw added that the development will now pave the way for other popular black hairstyles and improves the future of wig making afro textured hair had previously been ignored in wig making because the hair couldn t withstand the processing needed to mass produce wigs but a new weave and knot system has made it possible among those to donate to the organisation was poppy lee burrowes 11 from aberdare south wales who had been desperate to donate her gorgeous afro hair to lpt since she was five years old poppy first heard about the little princess trust wig service six years ago when her friends were donating their hair but at the time she couldn t donate because they weren t accepting afro hair i just wanted to be generous and help she said and finally earlier this year she chopped off her gorgeous hair and donated it to lpt phil said in the last 12 months we ve provided just three of our heritage afro wigs while our original afro style wigs were still being ordered he said if people don t know about it they won t ask about it we need more awareness that these real afro wigs are now available ceo phil brace has now revealed the organisation has only provided three of their heritage wigs with many still choosing the traditional afro wigs they had always been offering where straight hair is styled into tight curls for alopecia sufferer olivia donaldson 11 from leeds she decided on a traditional afro wig from lpt last year when she decided she wanted to wear a wig after her started falling out however these days she has found strength in her condition and has decided to go wig free phil explained lpt s bank of afro hair now needs to grow and accommodate all textures colour and styles while more people need to know of the availability the commitment and work that has gone on has shown just what is possible when groups of people get together and bring different skills to find a solution he said but now their stock of afro hair needs to grow he added and eventually we ll hopefully be able to offer the same with the new heritage afro wig too meanwhile phil added that these days more and more youngsters are embracing baldness will smith s wife hollywood actress jada pinkett smith has alopecia and phil said will smith s wife has decided to go bald and many are embracing that these days it wouldn t have happened ten years ago but there s a definite shift
los angeles may 15 rapper snoop dogg has gone viral after suggesting he may have to buy twitter now after tesla ceo elon musk s 44 billion takeover was put on pause the rapper whose real name is calvin cordozar broadus jr took his shot at becoming the next twitter owner jokingly tweeting about how he s going to replace the board of directors with jimmy from my corner fish fry tommy chung and tha guy with the ponytail pete najarian on cnbc reports dailymail co uk snoop also said he d immediately give everyone a blue checkmark even tha bots with 10 letters in their name that hit you in dms and just say hello nah f k those bots the 50 year old singer said his first line of business would be putting free internet on planes referencing one of musk s other business ventures starlink which jsx airline announced on april 21 it would be utilising to get internet on their planes in the next year the commodity would come free of charge which got the singer thinking 29 dollars for 1 hour is bulls t if snoop dogg was seriously about buying the social platform the singer s offer would fall much lower than the musk s as the the american song contest co host is only estimated to be worth about 150million compared to musk s 240billion musk 50 threw his multi billion deal into chaos on friday when he announced he was temporarily putting it on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam fake accounts do indeed represent less than five per cent of users he linked a report from may 2 stating twitter s calculation that bots were only a small percentage of the site s users musk had said that one of his priorities would be to remove spam bots from twitter once his takeover of the company was complete it is not clear what the legal effect of his tweet was and some analysts were baffled that he announced the move on twitter rather than a regulatory filing the tesla ceo did insist that he is still committed to the acquisition of the company but seems like the billionaire may have some public competition with the singer who tweeted wake n bake just hours before jokingly announcing his business preposition musk s surprise tweets early friday sent twitter stock plunging in the pre market as analysts speculated that musk is trying to negotiate a lower price for the deal or pull out completely citing a week old regulatory filing from twitter musk claimed that he wanted to pause the deal to verify that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5 per cent of the company s 229 million users during the first quarter backpedaling a few hours later musk tweeted that he was still committed to the acquisition if he walked away from the deal musk would likely be on the hook for a 1 billion termination fee though twitter s board agreed to the purchase last month it still has not been approved by shareholders and was not expected to close for at least several months shares of the social media company fell as much as 25 per cent in pre market trading this morning continuing a massive downward trend since his takeover bid was accepted by twitter s board on april 25 twitter s share price has been sinking following the april 25 announcement that twitter s board had agreed to his buyout when stocks closed at 51 70 the stock closed at 45 08 on thursday and plunged in pre market trading friday following musk s tweet dropping as much as 13 percent twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment meanwhile tesla shares against which musk has secured 6 25 billion in funding for the acquisition were up about 5 per cent early friday
as the old maxim goes sometimes the bigger they are the harder they fall bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surged during the pandemic turning many amateur investors into millionaires on paper at least bitcoin for example hit an all time of nearly 68 000 in november today it s trading at less than half that amount as part of an intense sell off that has accelerated in recent weeks it s been even worse for an area of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins in particular one called terrausd that has tumbled hard here s a look at what s going on so why are cryptocurrencies down so much put simply cryptocurrencies got caught up in the maelstrom affecting broader markets stocks bonds and other assets have tumbled in recent weeks as investors fear the federal reserve will need to raise interest rates aggressively to fight inflation raising the prospect of a recession the falls in broader markets have affected cryptocurrencies with bitcoin down more than 20 in the past two weeks the selloff has been worse for some of the newer cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which started as a joke and then took off in part thanks to the support of billionaire elon musk it s a stark reversal

crypto com wasn t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation yes but it hasn t turned out to be one at least so far bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most popular of them all proponents of bitcoin had long touted the digital currency as an inflation hedge in part because there is a finite amount of it but bitcoin has tumbled hard along with stocks if bitcoin was seen as a true hedge against inflation it should be rallying given that inflation is at its highest in decades a lot of people thought it would be an inflation hedge but there s really very little data to prove that says randy frederick a managing director at charles schwab who covers cryptocurrencies most recently it has not moved up as the market has moved down had it been an inflation hedge it might have done that in fact bitcoin is reacting just like any other riskier asset such as stocks still the argument of bitcoin as an inflation hedge is not quite dead either experts say bitcoin may be the oldest of the cryptocurrencies but it has only been around for just over a decade that means analysts don t have a lot of historical data frederick for instance says we ll know a lot more about how bitcoin behaves through more market cycles marco bello getty images getty images a sign that reads bitcoin is going to the moon is seen during the bitcoin 2022 conference at miami beach convention center in miami on april 8 the expression has become popular among some bitcoin enthusiasts what about stablecoins cryptocurrencies have spawned offshoots and led to more sophisticated or as some regulators see them dangerous assets stablecoins such as tether or usd coin are a type of crypto that are gaining in popularity most stablecoins are meant to be backed by real assets that means that for every dollar worth of a stablecoin the exchange or the seller would need to set aside the equivalent in a real fiat currency such as the dollar or the equivalent amount in an easy to trade security such as government bonds that s what is supposed to make them more stable if the buyer of the stablecoin wanted to cash out of that virtual currency it should be easy since the exchange is supposed to have the money at hand similar to how bank customers expect to be able to withdraw their money at any time but regulators have long questioned whether exchanges really do keep those hard assets aside in an account moreover stablecoins have created their own offshoots one of them terrausd has run into big trouble in recent days terrausd is known as an algorithmic stablecoin because it relies on financial engineering to maintain the 1 to 1 peg between the stablecoin and the backup assets terrausd is even pegged to another cryptocurrency called luna the stablecoin cratered to 14 cents as of friday well below the 1 it should theoretically be fetching pat tschosik a senior portfolio strategist with ned davis research says terrausd s troubles could be part of a potential winnowing of cryptocurrencies it s still really young he says of crypto you know this is still a developing area there is going to be speculation there is going to be booms and busts along the way and this is all still new spencer platt getty images getty images traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse on may 12 2022 in new york city stocks and other markets have tumbled in recent weeks over economic fears so where do we go from here more broadly the outlook for cryptocurrencies will likely continue to be tied to broader market sentiment but the falls in cryptocurrencies and the collapsing value of terrausd stand to alarm policymakers such as treasury secretary janet yellen and securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler that may lead to more regulation of cryptocurrencies in general sustained falls in cryptocurrencies could also raise doubts about the future of the virtual money more broadly just when there had been signs that it was trying to mature with more and more professional investors starting to trade them last month fidelity the largest provider of retirement plans announced it would allow employers to offer bitcoin in 401 k plans although the department of labor has cautioned employers against doing that still cryptocurrencies also have a lot of fanatical followers who are used to steep selloffs and reversals and many of them believe that this is a short term decline tschosik from ned davis research for example is long term bullish on bitcoin he says we still see the acceptance of it continuing to expand he points to

by john revill bern reuters switzerland s fabled neutral status is about to face its biggest test in decades with the defence ministry tilting closer to western military powers in response to russia s invasion of ukraine the defence ministry is drawing up a report on security options that include joint military exercises with nato countries and backfilling munitions paelvi pulli head of security policy at the swiss defence ministry told reuters the details of the policy options under discussion in the government have not been previously reported ultimately there could be changes in the way neutrality is interpreted pulli said in an interview last week on a trip to washington this week defence minister viola amherd said switzerland should work more closely with the u s led military alliance but not join it swiss media reported neutrality which kept switzerland out of both world wars during the 20th century was not an objective in itself but was intended to increase swiss security pulli said other options include high level and regular meetings between swiss and nato commanders and politicians she said moving so much closer to the alliance would mark a departure from the carefully nurtured tradition of not taking sides that its supporters say helped switzerland prosper peacefully and maintain a special role as intermediary including during the west s standoff with the soviet union the idea of full membership of nato has been discussed but whereas sweden and finland countries that also have a history of neutrality are on the verge of joining pulli said the report was unlikely to recommend switzerland take that step the report is due to be completed by the end of september when it will go to the swiss cabinet for consideration it will be submitted to parliament for discussion and serve as a basis for possible decisions on the future direction of swiss security policy the report itself will not be submitted to a vote the defence ministry will also contribute to a broader study being prepared by the foreign ministry that project will look at the adoption of sanctions weapons munitions exports and the relationship with nato from a neutrality perspective the foreign ministry said ukraine revives swiss neutrality debate switzerland nation has not fought in an international war since 1815 when it adopted neutrality at the congress of vienna which ended the french revolutionary wars the 1907 hague convention establishes switzerland will not take part in international armed conflicts favour warring parties with troops or armaments or make its territory available to the warring sides neutrality included in the constitution does allow switzerland the right to self defence and scope on how to interpret the political aspects of the concept not covered by the legal definition it was last updated in the early 1990s after the collapse of the soviet union to allow a foreign policy based on cooperation with other countries in areas like humanitarian aid and disaster relief the ukraine conflict has revived the debate now centered on the government s decisions to impose sanctions on russia but to stop short of allowing the re export of swiss made ammunition to ukraine there is a lot of uneasiness that switzerland cannot contribute more to help ukraine pulli said backfilling where switzerland supplies munitions to other countries to replace those sent to ukraine is another potential measure pulli said in a shift from the government s policy until now although direct supply is likely a step too far president ignazio cassis has ruled out arms deliveries to third countries in support of ukraine but possibly showing a more expansive view of the issue he has also said that neutrality is not a dogma and that failure to respond with sanctions would have played into the hands of the aggressor growing support for nato switzerland already has some ties to nato while last year it decided to buy lockheed martin nyse f 35a fighters which are being purchased or already used by some nato members switzerland cannot join any alliance because of neutrality but we can work together and the systems we are buying are a good basis for that defence minister amherd told broadcaster srf the measures under consideration would be a significant move closer for a country that did not join the united nations until 2002 and produces many of its own weapons vladimir khokhlov spokesman for the russian embassy in bern said such measures would amount to a radical change of policy for switzerland moscow would not be able to ignore an eventual renunciation of neutrality which would have consequences khokhlov said he did not provide further details the swiss military favours greater cooperation with nato as a way to strengthen national defence while public opinion has undergone a sea change since the ukraine invasion more than half of respondents 56 supported increased ties with nato a recent poll found well above the 37 average in recent years support for actually joining the treaty remains a minority view but has grown significantly the april poll by sotomo showed 33 of swiss people supported joining the alliance higher than the 21 long term view in a separate study by eth university in zurich clearly the russian invasion of ukraine has changed a lot of minds this is seen an attack on our western democratic values said michael hermann of sotomo thierry burkart leader of the right of centre liberal democratic party part of the governing coalition described a seismic shift in how people feel about neutrality neutrality has to be flexible he told reuters before ukraine some people thought there would never be another conventional war in europe he said adding that some had advocated for disbanding the army the ukraine conflict shows we cannot be complacent burkart said he supported higher military spending and a closer relationship with nato but not full membership however peter keller general secretary of the far right swiss people s party svp told reuters a closer relationship with nato was incompatible with neutrality the svp is also part of the governing coalition and is the biggest party in the swiss lower house of parliament there is no reason to change this successful foreign policy maxim it has brought peace and prosperity to the people keller said the defence

tokyo despite decades of promises that women would have the chance to shine in japan s corporate and political worlds the country lags behind other industrialised nations in gender equality japan s financial services watchdog is introducing a new regulation designed to encourage companies to employ more women in senior management positions although women are divided on whether the change will have an impact on the nation s male dominated business world the financial services agency will require firms listed on the stock exchange to reveal the ratio of women in senior positions within their organisations in their annual securities report the new regulation will affect around 4 000 companies and is expected to become mandatory in reports from april next year the start of the financial year the plan also requires companies to disclose average pay by gender and the ratio of male employees who take child care leave with the intention of providing investors with a better picture of how companies are performing on gender equality metrics shrinking working population aware of deepening structural imbalances in the population and the need to get more women into the workplace successive japanese governments since the turn of the century have passed legislation designed to assist women to stay in employment after having a family and to climb the corporate ladder in 2014 then prime minister shinzo abe went as far as to say that his administration was going to make japanese women shine in the workplace in the political world and broader society that ambition however has failed to materialise according to the most recent statistics released by the switzerland based world economic forum japan ranked 120 out of 156 nations in the world for overall gender gap and an only narrowly better 117 in economic participation and opportunity japan ranked significantly lower than other g 7 nations the country also fell short of its own targets in 2003 the government announced that it wanted to see 30 of all management positions filled by women by the year 2020 official statistics released in 2021 however revealed that just 13 2 of managers were female well below the average of 30 40 seen in european and north american companies the agency s regulations are a very positive thing we believe especially when keidanren is making similar requests of its member companies said tsumie yamaguchi an executive of the tokyo based pressure group women in a new world network yamaguchi said she had been encouraged when previous prime ministers announced targets for women in both the workplace and japan s political world but was subsequently disappointed at the lack of progress and for that she blamed the men of japan s traditionally male dominated society the number of men in politics and business in japan is much larger than women and those men have a strong desire to keep their positions she told dw participants call for gender equality during a rally on international women s day in tokyo on march 8 2022 reuters photo a traditional place in society historically japanese men were told by their parents and society that their responsibilities lay outside the family but women were taught that they had to stay home and care for the household she said even today that kind of attitude exists in many people s minds chisato kitanaka an associate professor of sociology at hiroshima university agreed that the financial services agency s new regulation was a positive development albeit long overdue japan lags behind other developed countries badly and even today it is rare to find a woman who is a department or division head at a corporation she said old attitudes and stereotypes still linger in too many workplaces said kitanaka who specialises in workplace issues lots of companies do not hire as many women as men even when they have the same qualifications and then they are slow to promote them a major part of the problem is that while legislation was enacted as far back as 1986 to guarantee employment equality between the genders the law is toothless because it contains no sanctions on any companies that fail to abide by the rules she pointed out the only punishment for firms that ignore the law is publication of their name a measure designed to shame companies into compliance to date kitanaka said two companies have been named for breaking the 1986 law optimism or pessimism and she is not optimistic that meaningful change is on the horizon for japanese women it is difficult to change laws but it is even harder to change attitudes she said it is easy for men in the business and political worlds here to do nothing instead of doing the right thing women in a new world network s yamaguchi however is more positive about the future i am positive because more and more young women today have all the skills and abilities that they need to do well in business environments plus they are bringing other attributes to the workplace she said adding that many are more efficient for example than men and i think that senior managers are beginning to recognise that more companies will slowly realise that having women in leadership positions is a benefit to their organisation and i see young women graduating from universities today as being more positive about their futures

singapore may 15 bloomberg india s move to restrict wheat exports is set to reverberate through global agricultural markets exposing just how tight global supplies are after the war in ukraine and threatening to drive up food prices even more the government said in a notification dated may 13 it will suspend overseas sales to manage its food security this drew criticism from the agriculture ministers of the group of seven nations who said that such measures make the world s crisis worse the surprising thing is that india isn t even a prominent exporter on the world stage the fact that it could have such a major impact underscores the bleak prospect for global wheat supplies war has crippled ukraine s exports and now droughts floods and heat waves threaten crops in most major producers if this ban occurred in a normal year the impact would be minimal but the loss of ukraine volumes exacerbate the issues said andrew whitelaw a grains analyst at melbourne based thomas elder markets india s decision to halt wheat exports came as a record breaking heat wave parched the crop during a crucial period spurring estimates of slumping yields the output risk created a dilemma for india which has tried to fill the gap as the shortfall in ukraine s exports push buyers toward alternative origins india prioritized the domestic market even as the move risks tarnishing its international image as a reliable supplier prime minister narendra modi faces frustration on home soil about surging inflation an issue that brought down the previous government and paved the way for his ascension to power india will approve exports to countries that require wheat for food security needs and based on the requests of their governments it will also allow shipments for which irrevocable letters of credit have already been issued indian wheat usually goes to bangladesh sri lanka the united arab emirates and indonesia directing the wheat exports through government channels would not only ensure fulfilling the genuine needs of our neighbours and food deficit countries but also control inflationary expectations india s food ministry said in a statement it added that the country has adequate food stocks traders are frustrated by the policy a day before the export halt was announced the government said it was sending trade delegations to countries in africa asia and the middle east to explore the possibility of boosting wheat exports the food ministry had also said it saw no need to control exports as bloomberg news reported that authorities were considering the move a lot of exporters and actual users worldwide have commitments of purchase of indian wheat which should be honored said vijay iyengar chairman and managing director of singapore based agrocorp international which trades about 12 million tons of grain annually the ban could spark frenzied trading when agricultural markets reopen on monday benchmark wheat prices in chicago jumped 6 2 in the latest week while paris wheat futures surged to an all time high on concern that extreme weather is pressuring the global harvest india s ban will add to supply risks bloomberg
washington president joe biden is expected to sign in the coming days a 40 billion security assistance package that will supercharge the flow of missiles rockets artillery and drones to a war torn ukraine but what remains unclear is washington s ability to keep track of the powerful weapons as they enter one of the largest trafficking hubs in europe ukraine s illicit arms market has ballooned since russia s initial invasion in 2014 this fact comes amid urgent pleas from president volodymyr zelenskyy to provide artillery needed to counter russian forces in the country s east and south the ukrainian leader s appeals are credited with uniting house lawmakers behind the latest funding request in a bipartisan 368 to 57 vote on tuesday but the unprecedented influx of arms has prompted fears that some equipment could fall into the hands of western adversaries or reemerge in faraway conflicts for decades to come it s just impossible to keep track of not only where they re all going and who is using them but how they are being used said rachel stohl an arms control expert and vice president at the stimson center a state department spokesman said the united states has conducted thorough vetting of the ukrainian units it supplies while forcing kyiv to sign agreements that do not allow the retransfer of equipment to third parties without prior u s government authorization but the means of enforcing such contracts are relatively weak washington has its own mixed history of compliance as recently as last month in mid april the united states boosted its involvement in the ukraine conflict by announcing that it would transfer a fleet of mi 17 helicopters to ukraine that it originally purchased from russia about a decade ago the initial sale of the aircraft required the united states to sign a contract promising not to transfer the helicopters to any third country without the approval of the russian federation according to a copy of the certificate posted on the website of russia s federal service on military technical cooperation russia has denounced the transfer saying it grossly violates the foundations of international law arms experts say russia s aggression in ukraine more than justifies u s support but the violation of weapons contracts chips away at the foundations of counter proliferation efforts breaking of those end use agreements is a serious threat to the underlying but weak capacity for countries to control how weapons are used said jeff abramson an expert on conventional arms transfers at the arms control association a pentagon spokesman dismissed the criticisms calling russian charges a distraction and the transfer permissible under u s law and consistent with our national security priorities russia s claims are a disingenuous attempt to distract attention from russia s unprovoked invasion and its history of aggressive actions against ukraine since 2014 said marine corps lt colonel anton t semelroth the job of ensuring u s weapons are used for their intended purpose a joint responsibility of the departments of state and defense is made all the more difficult by the sheer volume of arms making their way to ukraine the emergency spending bill awaiting approval in the senate will cement ukraine s status as the world s single largest recipient of u s security assistance receiving more in 2022 than the united states ever provided to afghanistan iraq or israel in a single year it will add to the stocks of weapons the u s already committed to ukraine including 1 400 stinger antiaircraft systems 5 500 antitank missiles 700 switchblade drones 90 long range howitzer artillery systems 7 000 small arms 50 000 000 rounds of ammunition and numerous other mines explosives and laser guided rocket systems shoulder fired stinger missiles capable of downing commercial airliners are just one of the weapon systems experts worry could slip into the possession of terrorist groups seeking to carry out mass casualty events the biden administration s funding request includes 8 7 billion to replenish u s stores of weapons shipped to ukraine 6 billion to train and equip ukrainian forces and 3 9 billion for u s forces deployed throughout europe in response to the security crisis that s been set off by the war other nato countries have transferred billions of dollars in arms and military equipment since the start of hostilities the assistance exceeds the peak year of u s military assistance to afghan security forces during that 20 year war said william hartung an arms control expert at the quincy institute think tank in that case the u s had a major presence in country that created at least the possibility of tracking where weapons were ending up by comparison the u s government is flying blind in terms of monitoring weapons supplied to civilian militias and the military in ukraine weeks after russia s latest invasion of ukraine on feb 24 a group of interagency officials in the biden administration met with outside arms control experts to discuss the risk of small arms proliferation in the conflict according to stohl who attended one of the meetings u s officials offered assurances about vetting ukrainian security forces and addressing reports of unauthorized transfer but scant details on how the vetting or monitoring happens it does not inspire much confidence said stohl it is unclear what risk mitigation or monitoring steps the u s and other countries have taken or what guarantees they have obtained to ensure the protection of civilians through these very large transfers said annie shiel a senior adviser at the center for civilians in conflict some of the recommended steps include establishing a special investigator as the u s government did in afghanistan ensuring any weapons transfers contain strong tracking procedures adding human rights obligations in the terms of sale and including specifics about what units can be authorized to receive such transfers there are additional concerns among watchdog groups about arms proliferation stemming from moscow amid reports it has enlisted mercenaries from libya syria and chechnya as well as the wagner group a russian contractor during a televised meeting of russia s security council in march defense minister sergei shoigu said 16 000 volunteers in the middle east stood ready to fight alongside russian backed forces in eastern ukraine in response russian president vladimir putin offered his approval saying we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone at the same meeting shoigu proposed handing over captured u s javelin and stinger missiles to pro russian separatists in the donbas region please do this putin told shoigu the introduction of foreign fighters to a conflict runs the risks of weapons returning to those individuals countries of origin when the fighting in ukraine ends there are conflicting reports about the presence of foreign fighters there however and it s unclear precisely how many have in fact traveled to ukraine some of the weapons being provided in the conflict in ukraine are likely to be found years and possibly decades later said abramson congressional leaders should be asking these questions in classified briefings if needed and the public should be better informed
source mnangagwa edict will cripple zse the standard by mthandazo nyoni researchers at inter horizon securities ih have projected reduced activity on the zimbabwe stock exchange zse as speculators exit the market following tough trading measures laid down by the government facing headwinds ranging from a battered currency to steep surges in inflation the government announced unprecedented radical monetary policy shifts on may 7 banning bank lending and tightening the screws from stocks trading to supermarkets government also suspended third party country payments on foreign obligations in a bid to foster market discipline within the foreign payment system among some of the measures however in its analysis of these new measures ih anticipated a bloodbath on the stock market capital gains tax was reviewed from a flat rate of 20 to 40 for shares held for a period less than 270 days on this backdrop we are likely going to experience reduced activity on the zimbabwe stock exchange the researchers said we anticipate net selling on the bourse as there are high chances speculators and arbitrageurs will start exiting the market we are of the view that investors will return to valuation fundamentals as bad money leaves the market ih however said even though the stock market will see less activity from speculators and arbitrageurs a portion of genuine retail investors may also be swept away the market will revert to traditional pension funds asset managers and conventional investors there may be significant short term selling for those who need to turn back to cash and crystallise returns to cushion against what seems to be a proposed 40 haircut on gains it said traditional investors will likely become more sober on current valuations leading to a potential price correction daily liquidity is likely to drop as the market reverts to a more normalised modus operandi however there is still elevated inflation and limited asset classes outside equities to protect value so we believe at the right levels aggregate demand will return to equities the researchers said in the short term there will be fragile stability within the exchange rate domain as demand for forex decreases a lack of affordable debt from banks may decrease demand for forex that was required for purchase of capital goods during economic expansion slowing economic activity will necessitate additional measures perhaps in the form of expansionary policy this could then be interpreted as an unstable policy environment it said ih also said existence of multiple formal exchangerates gives rise to arbitrage opportunities suggesting sustained dispersion between the auction interbank and parallel rates inflation will be a constant threat driven by global increments in tariffs and pricing in energy they said with the government having suspended lending by banks in its quest to control money supply ih said net interest income was likely going to face some headwinds based on 2021 banking industry financial statements banks had reverted to the core business of lending after periods of subdued activity within the business line due to currency and inflation challenges depending on the length of this lending suspension there might be chances of unregulated lending sprouting the researchers said we are also concerned production might be affected as genuine borrowers are adversely impacted by this measure which is targeting speculative borrowers and arbitrageurs the researchers said the measures will negatively impact companies using leverage to fund working capital cycles sadly there will be adverse consequences within the private sector there is only precedence we find for this kind of policy intervention being ethiopia in 2021 they observed a clear preference by businesses to use the zimbabwe dollar leverage to fund expansion or working capital and hold the united states dollar cash or cash denominated assets to grow or preserve the balance sheet the new measures may compel business to liquidate those united states dollar holdings to fund zimbabwe dollar working capital requirements a potential boon to the interbank market which may work towards supporting the domestic currency the researchers said we assume this is informing part of the thought process within the government with lending being suspended broad money growth should wane this may have a direct impact on the parallel market

this is an excerpt from minority report a weekly newsletter on federal politics if you haven t subscribed yet you can do that by clicking here providing space for good healthy political debate on a national stage seems particularly important right now but we ve seen how easily attempts to do so can go astray as evidenced this week by a gimmicky conservative leadership debate and as explained at length in a new report by the federal leaders debate commission the debate commission created as an independent federal body by the liberal government in 2018 was born out of concern that the traditional nationally broadcast election debates of years past were no longer guaranteed in 2015 stephen harper had upended the traditional system by going around the consortium of broadcast networks including the cbc to participate in debates staged by other institutions given that harper was the incumbent the other party leaders felt compelled to follow him the result might have been more variety but harper s gambit demonstrated how the debate calendar could be shaped by political interests without the involvement of the major networks viewership also suffered with the commission taking the lead for the 2019 election the main english language debate was given to a consortium of the major television networks including the cbc and watched by 14 2 million canadians by comparison the most watched debate in 2015 which was staged by maclean s where this writer was employed at the time was viewed by 4 3 million people during last year s campaign viewership was down to 10 3 million which might reflect a general lack of interest in last fall s election the commission speculated in the post mortem report it released this week but the bigger concern was how last year s debates were conducted liberal leader justin trudeau left and then conservative leader andrew scheer take part in the the federal leaders french language debate in gatineau que on thursday oct 10 2019 adrian wyld the canadian press too many journalists not enough debate there is widespread agreement that the 2021 debates did not deliver as well as they should have on informing voters about parties policies the commission s report acknowledged stakeholders we consulted and analysis that was published criticised the format as being cluttered restrictive and not allowing enough time for leaders to express themselves or to engage in meaningful exchanges the consensus was that there were too many journalists on stage moreover the line of questioning from the moderator and journalists limited the ability of leaders to expound on their positions the commission doesn t just relay the bad reviews it also quantifies the harried feeling of the 2021 debates in the span of two hours the commission found there were 45 questions put to the party leaders in 2021 by comparison just eight questions were posed during the debate in 2008 watch conservative leadership candidates spar in first and only official english debate fallout from the conservative leadership debate at issue duration 16 20 the at issue panellists share their takeaways from this week s conservative leadership debate and what it all means for the race ahead plus the panel discusses whether candidates were able to reach canadians inside and outside of the party journalists naturally want to hold political leaders to account and demand clarity and honesty those are valuable impulses and the campaign s biggest stage offers a tempting moment to pursue those things in recent years media outlets have also put increased emphasis on fact checking and calling out lies and misinformation and that might only add to the urge to tightly control the debate stage but the unique value of a nationally televised leaders debate is the debate part most leaders already participate in regular news conferences with reporters during a campaign any number of reports can be written or broadcast to clarify the facts or call out untruths a televised debate on the other hand is the only opportunity to see and hear the leaders speak at length in a forum where they can directly be tested by and against each other simple is better after taking stock of the 2021 debates the commission concludes that the format needs to be simplified and that a single moderator would be preferable to the involvement of multiple journalists to ensure a better debate during the next election the commission recommends that it be given the authority to approve the format and select a moderator in 2019 and 2021 such decisions were left to the media partners who staged the debates this might all seem a bit arcane and there is some risk of overstating the hallowed importance of televised debates they are often treated more like entertainment than the discussions of public policy that they are supposed to be two hours is never going to be enough anyway to cover everything that should be considered when deciding the future direction of the country but david johnston the former governor general who leads the commission isn t wrong when he emphasises in the foreword to last week s report that televised debates could be an important part of a healthy democracy in an age of disinformation fragmentation of audiences and polarisation of public opinion leaders debates produce an authentic record of party positions that citizens can trust and come back to repeatedly wrote johnston who himself moderated federal debates in 1979 and 1984 done well leaders debates are a public trust that in turn can help build trust conversely the republican party s recent decision to pull out of the united states presidential debate commission seems like one more piece of evidence that american democracy is coming apart in the compartmentalised and personalised era of social media the communal exercise of a good credible and nationally televised debate likely has real value and for the purposes of staging a good and useful debate we might benefit from fewer props and interveners and more room for conversation between the people who would lead the country at this pivotal time watch fallout from the conservative leadership debate
these passive income powerhouses with yields ranging from 4 4 to 11 9 can generate some serious wealth for patient investors there are a lot of ways to make money on wall street but few have proved more fruitful over the long run than buying dividend stocks back in 2013 j p morgan asset management unveiled a report examining the performance of dividend stocks to non payers over a four decade

bulk of its revenue encouraging consumers to purchase online should provide a nice sales boost there s also walgreens partnership with and majority investment in villagemd the duo have opened over 100 co located clinics thus far with a goal of reaching 1 000 clinics in more than 30 u s markets by 2027 the differentiating factor with these clinics is that they re physician staffed being able to handle more than just a sniffle should encourage repeat visits and bolster consumer engagement with the walgreens brand antero midstream 9 16 yield a second high yield dividend stock with the ability to turn 300 000 into a cool 1 million by 2030 is energy middleman antero midstream am 1 80 antero is yielding 9 16 at the time of this writing which means its passive income alone when reinvested can double your money by 2030 for some folks the thought of putting their money to work in oil and gas stocks is enough to make them cringe let s not forget that crude oil demand fell off a cliff 25 months ago during the initial stage of the pandemic ultimately oil futures briefly traded as low as negative 40 a barrel as you can imagine companies involved in oil and natural gas drilling were clobbered by this historic demand drawdown however midstream companies like antero were in far better shape midstream businesses operate the infrastructure that helps move transport and sometimes refine oil natural gas and natural gas liquids in antero midstream s case it provides gathering compression processing and water delivery for parent company antero resources ar 2 65 the latter is one of the largest producers of natural gas in the united states there are three factors that make antero such a rock solid investment over the next eight years first there s the structuring of antero midstream s contracts with its parent company midstream providers typically rely on volume based or fixed fee contracts to ensure a highly predictable level of operating cash flow each year this means that even if the price of natural gas whipsaws antero midstream will have clarity on its annual operating cash flow secondly antero resources is stepping up drilling on antero midstream s acreage although the latter did reduce its quarterly distribution by 27 in 2021 again still yielding 9 16 this move was made so additional capital can be allocated for future infrastructure projects management expects 400 million in added incremental free cash flow by the midpoint of the decade and third a big rebound in the price of natural gas coupled with antero resources desire to boost production has allowed antero midstream to improve its balance sheet after ending 2020 with a leverage ratio of 3 1 the company anticipates this leverage ratio dipping below 1 by the end of the year agnc investment corp 11 86 yield the third and final high yield income stock that can allow patient investors to turn 300 000 into 1 million by 2030 is mortgage real estate investment trust reit agnc investment corp agnc 1 93 agnc has averaged a double digit yield in 12 of the past 13 years reinvesting these payouts at an 11 86 yield would net more than a 150 return from the initial investment by the end of 2030 although the securities agnc buys can be a bit complicated the company s operating model is pretty easy to understand mortgage reits are typically looking to borrow money at low short term rates then use this capital to acquire higher yielding long term assets such a mortgage backed securities mbs the bigger the difference known as net interest margin between the average yield on owned assets minus the average borrowing rate often the more profitable the mortgage reit over the past couple of months things couldn t have gone any worse for mortgage reits historically high inflation has encouraged the fed to get aggressive with interest rates which means short term borrowing costs are rising at the same time the interest rate yield curve flattened the yield curve describes the difference between short and long term u s treasury bond yields when the yield curve flattens net interest margin and book values for mortgage reits usually decline however when things look their bleakest is historically when it s the best time to buy into the mortgage reit industry for instance even though rising interest rates are weighing on the industry in the short term higher rates should also increase the yields on the mbss that agnc is purchasing over time this is a recipe for net interest margin expansion another really important piece of the puzzle is the makeup of agnc s investment portfolio the company ended march with a 68 6 billion investment portfolio 97 5 of which were agency assets an agency security is backed by the federal government in the event of default while investing in these safe securities does lower the yield agnc receives on the mbss it buys it also allows the company to deploy leverage in order to increase its profits over the next eight years there s a good chance agnc s book value will increase and its share price will follow when coupled with its mammoth monthly dividend there exists a recipe for substantial wealth creation

commentary president joe biden s proposal for a 20 percent minimum tax on billionaires is largely class warfare by the liberals signaling to their loyal constituents that they intend to erode the wealth of successful americans while pretending to target the super rich under biden s billionaire minimum income tax plan households with more than 100 million in wealth would be required to report their household wealth to the irs on an annual basis according to a white house statement in march the billionaire minimum income tax will require america s wealthiest households to pay as they go just like everyone else the billionaire minimum income tax will ensure that the very wealthiest americans pay a tax rate of at least 20 percent on their full income including unrealized appreciation this minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters the tax will apply only to the top one one hundredth of one percent 0 01 of american households those worth over 100 million over half of the revenue will come from households worth more than 1 billion i thought biden s plan was to target billionaires while 100 million is certainly a lot of money it s a far reach from the tens of billions of dollars held by america s super rich it s well noted that the wealthiest people in the united states those worth 50 billion or more don t pay their share of taxes this is one of the more serious issues today within u s taxation the super rich often make staggering incomes 1 billion per year from investments or through equity shares from companies they founded or inherited however few take such payouts as income additionally many wealthy families receive incomes from trusts and other vehicles or defer income into investments such as loaning money to business holdings so as to not be taxed it isn t as easy as tracking income to find ways to tax the wealthy income doesn t always reflect the true value of net worth or the true value of aggregate wealth by the way what s wealthy in america to be in the top 1 percent you need about 4 million in assets as far as income goes according to smartasset s analysis of irs and bureau of labor statistics bls data a u s family needs to make 597 815 annually to be considered a member of the top 1 percent nationwide that number fluctuates by state to be considered in the top 0 01 percent in america you need a new worth of about 25 million however can you honestly say that people making 597 815 per year or people worth 25 million are part of the problem when a moderately wealthy person sets aside millions in a trust for future heirs they re not dodging taxes when a multibillionare sets aside billions in an offshore trust while continuing to own billions in assets assets that continue to generate billions in profits they re most likely dodging a very large tax bill the latter should be rectified but you can t do it by targeting successful citizens americans who generate wealth from earned income pay the lion s share of taxes from the middle class to top income earners and even families with generational wealth these individuals are generally overtaxed this past march the editors of the national review in the article biden s latest tax folly wrote that the top 1 percent make about 20 percent of all income but pay 40 percent of the federal income tax their income tax burden is twice their share of income the dishonest rhetoric about millionaires and billionaires paying a lower tax rate than middle class americans intentionally conflates different kinds of income the article states the very wealthy pay a higher income tax rate on their salaries than do those with lower incomes and they pay the same tax rate on investment income as lower earning workers do the difference is that very high income earners usually make more of their money from investments than they do from salaries already contributing 20 percent of all income and paying 40 percent of the federal income tax is an incredible burden but clearly certain politicians want to tax more the 16th amendment which was ratified in 1913 and ultimately empowers congress to collect income tax from income not capital states the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration in 2019 when sen elizabeth warren d mass proposed a wealth tax little did she know that less than 0 1 percent of tax units in the united states would actually qualify for what she was talking about hyperbole aside the reality is that only a fraction of wealth is taxable the rest is capital that s utilized in different ways from common income let s tax unrealized capital gains what are unrealized capital gains here s an example let s say you bought your house 10 years ago for 500 000 it s now valued at 3 million you have no intention of selling under biden and warren you would be taxed on those gains despite not yet realizing them the same goes for stocks and bonds or gold or potentially valuable automobiles baseball cards and artwork a for sale sign is seen in front of a home in arlington va on nov 19 2020 saul loeb afp via getty images taxing unrealized capital gains is not the answer if you disagree take a look at today s public equity values compared to public equity values 60 days ago meanwhile the government tax coffers are doing very well more than 450 billion in individual taxes was collected this year more than twice the amount of last year any wealth tax from the biden administration would be a message to democrats to use such powers to create a net worth tax i wouldn t be surprised if liberals then attempted to raise the estate tax rate if the united states wants to be effective in its taxation it needs to target the very wealthiest the 0 0001 percent in reality biden s plan will target the mass affluent by targeting average to above average incomes not the incomes of the super rich the administration is indirectly targeting dual income middle class households upper middle class households suburban millionaires and small business owners in other words biden is targeting the very fabric that holds america together

stream mysterious glides beneath green as a dream and deep as death oh damn i know it and i know how the may fields all golden show and when the day is young and sweet gild gloriously the bare feet that run to bathe from the old vicarage grantchester by rupert brooke 1887 1915 he died while serving in the royal navy in world war i and is one of the most famous war poets of that conflict the

york city lawyer and mentor to donald trump the drive to newport from providence via fall river has some dramatic stretches the spindle city rises up with its beautiful old stone mill buildings

heiress wife martha sunny von bulow which led to two sensational trials in the 80 s and the movie reversal of fortune a sort of dark comedy and the late tobacco heiress doris duke s apparent murder of an assistant eduardo tirella in 1966 some newporters connected to the city s upper crust who knew these characters and those around them still talk about these cases as i discovered last week at a lunch in the city by the sea xxx those maple tree keys all over the ground at this time of year remind me of how we used to stick them on our noses when we were kids a silly spring ritual the keys sprout promiscuously xxx view larger there s the rich aroma of salt marshes and mud flats fried clams balsam up north maple syrup wet leaves in the fall and at this time of year lilacs freshly cut wet grass mixed with gasoline fumes and fresh asphalt poured into potholes xxx on a beautiful day a couple of weeks ago my younger daughter and i were strolling in the cobble hill section of brooklyn and she showed me a shop called boisson that sold nonalcoholic versions of hard liquor tasting of gin whiskey etc i wonder how many people buy real booze for the taste rather than for effect xxx last week there were a couple of sunsets with vivid multicolored clouds that almost seemed to have theological implications menacing or comforting depending on your mood but gorgeous in any case and free view larger inflation has been surging in america to levels not seen since the first reagan administration but it has been jumping pretty much everywhere the year to year gain in march was 8 8 percent for the 38 member nations which include the u s of the organization of economic cooperation and development compared to 8 3 percent year to year in april for the u s a slight cooling from march s 8 5 percent the chief culprits the continuing general demand snap back from the covid caused depression and more recently the surge in commodities prices most notably oil and food some of it related to putin s blood soaked invasion of ukraine extreme and irrational covid suppression efforts in china are also increasingly to blame by worsening already serious international supply chain problems in america last year s 1 9 trillion american rescue plan meant to stave off recession as covid continued to rage added what turned out to be unnecessary stimulus which boosted inflation but looking at the rest of the world which most americans don t do i wonder how much impact it really had hit this link now the fed is trying to tamp down the inflationary surge by raising interest rates but given the intrinsically global nature of inflation that will be very difficult indeed demand for oil and gas continues high and putin s war is devastating much of the grain crop of ukraine one of the world s biggest grain exporters thus raising those prices there s anecdotal evidence in the u s that some prices may come down soon in some regions higher mortgage rates are lessening demand for housing and at least a few folks are driving less because of high gasoline prices by the way adjusted for inflation the real cost of a gallon of gasoline in july 2008 was 5 37 in today s dollars compared to around 4 50 now can the fed substantially cool inflation without causing a recession probably not given the world situation in any case of course the expectation of inflation leads to more buying now which intensifies inflation the fed may need a sledgehammer to kill that expectation meanwhile some states want to cut sales taxes always a popular move and it s an election year but that would tend to raise consumer demand and thus inflation consumers for months have been in a buying frenzy much of it on credit even as they complain about rising prices hereabouts there s the politically alluring plan to immediately get rid of the last of rhode island s car tax but better to use money from the car tax to improve mass transit expand the number of electric charging stations and other actions to reduce fossil fuel use and otherwise improve the environment and the state s long term economic competitiveness xxx in other vehicular news it s nice to see newly paved streets in parts of providence whose many potholes have enriched car repair shops and crews have even seeded some of the grass strips that had to be torn up at the corners for road work including creating more curb cuts some of these roads had resembled those in the back country of african countries in the rainy season thank you but will utilities and the city better coordinate road repair maintenance schedules too often we see the spectacle of roads being torn up patched and then torn up and patched again a few months later for a different utility issue be it electricity natural gas or water waste and disruption in western europe they schedule road repairs far better than here xxx democrats are over emphasizing abortion rights in this year s election campaign yes most americans within limits mostly involving the stage of the pregnancy in which the procedure occurs support abortion rights as protected in roe v wade but i suspect that more voters are more interested in economic issues particularly inflation which the gop qanon will blame on biden although presidents can do little about inflation the democrats make abortion the central issue of their campaign at their peril view larger there are some good signs on the energy front which will affect the energy situation consider that the demand for electricity from the new england power grid on may 1 fell to a record low as solar panels and a sunny day provided 4 000 megawatts of power and operators of the california grid reported a new record on april 30 of meeting 99 87 percent of demand with renewable energy beating the previous records of 97 6 percent in early april and 96 4 percent in late march obviously these brief events are episodic though they point toward bigger progress ahead we ll be addicted to fossil fuel for a long time to come but anything that reduces its burning is much appreciated as the world cooks and killer dictators such as putin use oil and gas revenues to pursue their power obsessions please don t close any more nuclear power plants but wait there s more in the form of renewable natural gas national grid explains renewable natural gas rng is produced from the decomposition of organic matter before it releases greenhouse gases and green hydrogen is generated by renewable energy or from low carbon power hydrogen can be blended with renewable natural gas up to 20 percent by volume run through existing gas networks and be used in customer appliances without significant upgrades to infrastructure or equipment the organic matter used to produce rng comes from such sources as municipal solid waste landfills digesters at water resource wastewater treatment plants livestock farms food production facilities and organic waste management operations consider places like rhode island s mountainous central landfill as an increasingly important source of electricity never again again the return to power in the philippines of the outstandingly corrupt marcos family in the form of ferdinand marcos jr commonly called bongbong childhood nickname marcos has some lessons bongbong was elected by an official landslide albeit amidst numerous complaints about fraud to his father s old job it s a reminder of how little electorates including in america review history it also shows the power of social media to promote crooks via disinformation and heavy duty whitewashing of history bongbong s campaign saying it sought national unity has done that brilliantly a senator from 2010 to 2016 he s the second child and only son of former president dictator and kleptocrat ferdinand marcos sr 1917 1989 and ex first lady imelda romualdez marcos born 1929 bongbong s father ruled from 1965 to 1986 when a popular uprising forced the sometimes brutal tyrant from power joining him in exile was imelda probably best known as the fetishist whose 3 000 pairs of shoes were paid for by the citizens of that poor nation of course most filipino voters don t directly remember the abuses of the marcos regime during which the family stole as much as 10 billion from their compatriots and some people suffer from nostalgia some of it prenatal for a strong leader and resentment that subsequent leaders have been unable to create a more equitable society in that country where many people live in poverty and there s a strong tradition of political and business corruption further schools have avoided teaching what happened when marcos sr ruled and as in many nations there s a strong tradition of dynastic rule in the philippines filipinos including many who voted for marcos jr will be sorry they fell for the latest marcos cons and frustrated when bongbong s regime becomes very difficult to remove by democratic means but then corrupt dictatorship has usually been the default form of government view larger with the covid accelerated move toward total remote work for some and hybrid employment for others only coming into an office say a couple of days a week i wonder how many fewer people

when i was elected to serve on the las vegas city council in 2019 my top priority was making ward 1 an even better place to live over the past two years i ve been proud to work hand in hand with my neighbors to improve transportation infrastructure and especially housing but if ward 1 and the rest of las vegas are to remain an attractive place to live and a competitive thriving part of our state we need to find ways to ensure more people have affordable safe places to call home those who know me are aware of my raisetheroof commitment to expand the stock of affordable housing in las vegas over the years the cost to rent an apartment here has gone up 20 leading to the city having one of the highest eviction rates in the nation as i ve written previously the current level of allowed density for buildings is untenable an estimated 300 000 people are expected to move here in the coming years and we are already well below where we need to be in terms of providing comfortable affordable places to live for essential workers teachers police officers and the health care professionals who make the medical district a cornerstone of our community but we re making progress thanks to partners like nevada hand we re in the process of adding 480 units for low income families and seniors many of whom have been deeply affected by rising costs in rent but we can t afford to stop there we should continue building housing like this but also consider other obstacles that keep quality housing out of reach for so many of our neighbors we should ask what we can do so that short term rentals for tourists don t disrupt established neighborhoods and negatively affect the people who live here we should take the steps we need to ensure that our unhoused residents are able to get the shelter and support they need to get back on their feet and rebuild their lives we need to consider how to make housing affordable beyond just density and volume one possibility that s already in use in las vegas and across the country is low cost security deposit insurance most rentals require a large upfront cash deposit often doubling the initial move in cost instead security deposit insurance eliminates that initial financial burden allowing renters to pay a small monthly premium to protect their landlord against damages and unpaid rent getting people housed more quickly today security deposit insurance is available in nearly 20 000 units in las vegas we have an opportunity to enhance this measure in nevada and lower the cost of moving into a new home during years of rising rent by ensuring that renters landlords policymakers and nonprofits are more aware of this option las vegas is my home ward 1 is my community right in the heart of vegas is where my husband and i decided to raise our two children but here we ve failed to address our housing challenges for too long and it s time for us as a community to act brian knudsen is a member of the las vegas city council for ward 1 and is a member of the national league of cities large cities council and the 2022 community and economic development federal advocacy committee back to top

jj rosen special to nashville tennessean usa today network newsrooms in tennessee a couple of weeks ago the berkshire hathaway annual shareholder s meeting was held in person for the first time in three years this meeting which has come to be known as the woodstock of capitalism takes place in nebraska where investors from all over the world show up to listen to the oracle of omaha warren buffett and his sidekick charlie munger spend six hours answering shareholders questions it was a full house with an energetic crowd of nearly 20 000 packing the arena although i am a very very minor shareholder i decided it would be a worthwhile learning experience to make the pilgrimage out west to see what the fuss was all about i figured with buffett being 91 years old and munger being 98 it could be now or never if i wanted to experience what many serious investors and businesspeople view as essential education when i asked my wife if she d like to join me she gently patted me on the on the back and said no thanks that sounds pretty dull when i landed in omaha on a cold and rainy friday evening i could sort of see her point although i was excited i could understand why not everyone would deem traveling nebraska to watch two elderly men talk about stocks and bonds as a recipe for fun entering the arena saturday morning i was all in i was one of the many investor geeks who showed up with pen and paper in hand ready to write down any pearls of wisdom that buffett and munger might offer up i d considered wearing my one suit and bringing an old school briefcase to get into character for some very serious learning but as soon as the meeting began i realized that despite the serious topics the tone that warren and charlie used to discuss them was anything but there were jokes and gags from the beginning to end of the meeting like the opening video featuring bill murray as a security guard refusing to allow buffett to enter when he forgot his credentials or this gem from 98 year old charlie munger when asked about his future with the company all i want to know is where i m going to die so i ll never go there they were using one of the most underrated skills in business that is humor to communicate with their fellow berkshire owners somehow these two legendary businesspeople were able to impart their deep knowledge of macroeconomics p e ratios and company financials in a way that was funny my wife had been wrong finally the comedic duo buffett and munger made what most people consider boring topics both interesting and fun humor and business typically don t mix but as i listened throughout the day i was reminded that they really should as warren and charlie showed a dose of fun in the work world keeps people more engaged but it s deeper than that according to jennifer aaker and naomi bagdonas who teach humor serious business at stanford s graduate school of business the benefits that humor brings to traditional business settings are critical for companies to be successful they teach students how humor builds bonds defuses tension boosts innovation and bolsters resilience through hard times they cite scientific research to prove their points but for anyone who s ever laughed it doesn t take a scientific study to know that humor is healthy however by its very nature humor can be subjective and using it at work is not without risk what s funny to one person can be upsetting to another experts agree that when it comes to using humor in the workplace it helps to follow some basic guidelines it should be about levity not about making fun of someone else especially for those in leadership roles self deprecating humor is effective because it shows co workers that it s ok to have weaknesses it should be politically correct buffett notes that he never ever jokes about religion politics or anything else controversial at work and finally it should be genuine and unforced it s funnier and more inclusive when it s sincere cubicles suits briefcases and lots of meetings mean business can sometimes be dull i learned that a dose of humor can radically change that so have you heard the one about the stockbroker entrepreneur and businessperson who walked into a bar jj rosen is the founder of atiba a nashville custom software development and it support company visit www atiba com or www atibanetworkservices com for more info

the man authorities say opened fire in a buffalo grocery store saturday killing 10 appears to have left behind a white supremacist document centered on the idea of a plot to replace the white population with immigrants this far right conspiracy theory known as the great replacement theory has inspired a lot of recent violence including the 2019 christchurch mosque shootings in new zealand where the shooter warned of white genocide he later pleaded guilty to 51 murders 40 attempted murders and engaging in a terrorist act some of the torch bearing unite the right demonstrators including ku klux klan members and neo nazis who terrorized charlottesville in 2017 were also motivated by the theory which warns that an increase in the non white population fueled by immigration will destroy white and western civilization advertisement the buffalo gunman identified by authorities as payton gendron an 18 year old white man is believed to have posted online a 180 page document arguing that white americans were in danger of being replaced by people of color but while the great replacement theory has inspired horrific violence in the past five years it s a lot older than that more than 70 years ago a u s senator published a book warning of the same destruction of white civilization theodore g bilbo a democrat had twice been governor of mississippi before he served in the u s senate from 1935 to 1947 when the growing intolerance among many whites toward public racism and anti semitism led to his fall according to an account in the journal of mississippi history an equal opportunity racist he addressed some of his letters with slurs against italians and jews depending on the recipient but the bulk of his loathing and fear was reserved for black americans as spelled out in his 1947 book take your choice separation or mongrelization advertisement a showboater and self promoter he began the book with this modest preface for nine years i have read studied and analyzed practically all the records and everything written throughout the entire world on the subject of race relations covering a period of close on to thirty thousand years bilbo saw an existential threat in the growing ranks of american born descendants of enslaved africans his solution ship them back the great civilizations of the ages have been produce by the caucasian race he wrote when black people moved in he wrote mighty societies such as ancient egypt were destroyed and mongrel races were created the mongrel not only lacks the ability to create a civilization but he cannot maintain a culture that he finds around him he wrote a white america or a mongrel america you must take your choice advertisement bilbo proclaimed in his book and in addresses to followers that he was convinced beyond every reasonable doubt that our race is in jeopardy it was a fact he said in one campaign speech using racial slurs that at the present rate of interbreeding and miscegenation and intermarriage between the and the whites that in nine generations which is only 300 years there ll be no whites there ll be no blacks in this country we ll all be yellow or brown he added he rebutted experts who disputed any scientific basis for racism of franz boas often called the father of american anthropology he wrote for some reason which has never been publicized this german jew a newly arrived immigrant wanted to destroy the racial stock which had carved this mighty nation out of a wilderness bilbo recommended deportation for another academic a naturalized italian immigrant who suggested intermarriage could dissolve the color line though he claimed no hatred or prejudice against any human being in the preface to his book he went on to say that he would rather see his race and his civilization blotted out with the atomic bomb than to see it slowly but surely destroyed in the maelstrom of miscegenation interbreeding intermarriage and mongrelization share this article share but the times were changing even in mississippi black veterans returning from fighting in world war ii didn t take well to efforts to bar them from voting in the united states and the allies fight against adolf hitler and antisemitism had led many americans to turn their critical gaze to discrimination at home as robert l fleegler noted in the journal of mississippi history most criticism of bilbo in the press had come from liberal publications but as bilbo started campaigning for reelection in june 1946 the conservative and influential saturday evening post published a cover story under the headline bilbo america s worst demagogue runs again the story called bilbo america s most notorious merchant of hatred advertisement the politician nicknamed the man was fighting to retain his senate seat he told supporters that the negro council in chicago sent a telegram to harry truman the president saying to send the army down to mississippi and to see to it that these 100 000 are gonna vote using a racist slur he also urged every red blooded white man to use any means to keep the away from the polls and if you don t know what that means you are just plain dumb he fought fiercely against his critics hurling anti jewish and anti black slurs at detractors in the press he won the democratic primary that july and ran unopposed in the general election but growing opposition to his race baiting demagoguery continued to build bilbo s admission in august 1946 on meet the press that he was a member of the ku klux klan probably didn t help there were calls to oust bilbo including from veterans groups and the committee of catholics for human rights which called bilbo s conduct a chilling deterrent to the world wide belief that america is the symbol of democracy and human rights they were joined by politicians including new york s democratic senators and a state senator whose son was killed in world war ii who said i hate and despise those bigots like bilbo in march 1946 republican conservative leader sen robert taft of ohio called bilbo a disgrace to the senate advertisement on sept 19 1946 an interracial group of mississippians filed a complaint with the u s senate committee to investigate campaign expenditures asking that bilbo be removed from office the committee heard from more than 100 witnesses two thirds of them black who outlined local election practices that systematically restricted black registration and voting according to a senate history witnesses told of being turned away threatened with pistols beaten and arrested a slim majority of the committee found in favor of bilbo however and blamed some of bilbo s anti black campaign on concerns about outside agitators including the national media but bilbo s opponents had another card to play a second investigation by the senate war investigating subcommittee heard testimony on charges that bilbo had helped construction firms win government contracts and had accepted gifts in return that included a cadillac a swimming pool and the excavation of a lake to create an island for his home according to a senate summary advertisement during the investigation questions also arose about whether bilbo was pocketing money in return for allowing a drug addict access to morphine bilbo had obtained consent from the federal bureau of narcotics to allow a mississippi doctor to prescribe the drug the drug recipient told an internal revenue service special agent that he paid bilbo 1 000 for the favor according to the new york times in january 1947 with republicans in control of the senate a fight ensued over whether bilbo would be allowed to take his seat with southern democrats threatening to stop the senate from organizing if he were barred then fate intervened senate minority leader alben barkley d ky announced that bilbo would return to mississippi for oral cancer surgery he died on aug 21 1947 without retaking his senate seat advertisement bilbo s career built on racism and anti immigrant bigotry had ended but the bigotry lingers on a version of this story ran on nov 15 2021 under the headline long before charlottesville great replacement theory found its champion in a racist senator

that are homeless and helping those in need 3 how would you combat the high costs of housing in chula vista and what would be your plan to boost affordable housing advertisement my plan to increase

think the city has done anything on keeping the communities that exist within the homeless communities together i don t think we talk about our homeless residents in that strength based fashion advertisement one thing i have committed to early on is creating a mayor s task force i m intent on having either currently homeless individuals or formerly homeless individuals be part of those conversations q how would you combat the high costs of housing in chula vista and what would be your plan to boost affordable housing i think we need to build housing in places that have the infrastructure around it to support that housing such as in transit oriented areas we need to be able to make sure we have affordable units that are actually designated through the inclusionary

any other department to do that i would be looking to work with outside nonprofits to be able to assist our efforts q how would you combat the high costs of housing in chula vista and what would be your plan to boost affordable housing my biggest concern is the missing middle class we need to provide more affordable ownership for working class folk i grew up in chula vista and was raised by a single mother who worked at the rohr aircraft factory we scrimped and saved but we were able to buy our own house i believe that working class people like i was and my mother was should be able to have affordable ownership in the city of chula vista an example that i supported was we were able to make a deal with lennar a housing provider to provide 172 homeownership opportunities we need to continue to increase the supply of ownership opportunities advertisement rudy ramirez rudy ramirez rudy ramirez age 61 residence southwest chula vista political affiliation democrat advertisement q if

enforce the laws against public camping i want to attack the petty crime that goes along with homelessness and bring services and facilities to address the issue q how satisfied are you with the city s handling of homelessness what would you add or do differently throughout your term advertisement i m not at all satisfied i think the city government has been negligent in addressing homelessness i would repair relationships with many of the nonprofits that could provide services to the homeless population i would work with the superior court judge in charge of the local judicial district and

how would you combat the high costs of housing in chula vista and what would be your plan to boost affordable housing we have a housing crisis and it needs to be addressed it s not going to go away the key is going to be working with your existing communities and building the trust that you need in order to provide additional housing and affordable housing there are ways to protect single family

president biden likes to tout his role as sheriff joe in the obama administration where he helped distribute and monitor billions in recovery aid in response to the great recession but another key part of the cleanup from the 2008 financial crisis was tighter regulation of wall street banks in that area mr biden is in danger of not getting his own sheriffs in place at the top of the list is the need to fill the role of the federal reserve vice chair of supervision this post has been vacant since oct 13 2021 if midterm elections go the way polling currently predicts mr biden will have an even tougher time getting much done with a gop led house and possibly senate too so this is likely mr biden s last window to get his picks in place in top bank cop positions it s inexplicable how slowly the white house and senate democrats have moved to fill these roles follow this author editorial board s opinions follow financial regulators aren t household names but they can have a massive impact on everything from bitcoin to bank mergers to market stability they have wide discretion to make regulations largely without any additional input from congress the trump administration used regulatory channels to severely curb immigration democrats could make a similarly large impact on financial regulation but they have been slow to nominate and confirm key appointments advertisement it was well known since mr biden s first day in office that the fed s banking supervision position would be open in october 2021 yet the white house waited until january 2022 to nominate sarah bloom raskin for the role she was unable to garner enough democratic votes for confirmation and was forced to withdraw on april 15 six months after the position became vacant mr biden nominated former treasury official michael barr for the fed role his confirmation hearing has been scheduled for thursday senate democrats need to move swiftly after that to confirm him mr barr was instrumental in implementing the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act during president barack obama s first term he is widely seen as a moderate democrat and is well known in the financial industry he was an acolyte of robert rubin when he was treasury secretary during the clinton administration while some on the left are concerned that mr barr would be more lenient on the banks than they would like it s clear he is qualified for the role in a less polarized world he would garner republican votes too the comptroller of the currency post also remains open after mr biden s nominee saule omarova was forced to withdraw in december after a rocky confirmation hearing and there s no confirmed chair of the federal deposit insurance corporation at both the occ and fdic there are acting heads which while not ideal at least allows mr biden to have some sway over the agencies but the fed needs to have a confirmed person for the role

caracas venezuela ap venezuela s government is seeking private investors to pump funds into vital but crippled state run companies decades after seizing them in the name of socialism the government on monday intends to offer 5 10 percent stakes in companies ranging from telephone and internet service providers to a petrochemical producer in another country those industries might be attractive targets for investors but questions remain as to who would be willing or able to take a minority position in the venezuelan companies that have suffered from years of neglect and mismanagement adding to the mystery is lack of details provided by the government about the sale including what price it is seeking for shares in the companies and on what stock market they might be listed some are speculating the move could be a first step toward returning the companies to private hands we need capital for the development of all public companies maduro said during a televised event wednesday we need technology we need new markets and we are going to move forward it s a marked departure from maduro s predecessor the late president hugo chávez who nationalized many companies in his bid to transform the south american country into a socialist state among the companies maduro mentioned are cantv and its subsidiary movilnet petrochemical producer petroquimica de venezuela and a conglomerate focused in the mining sector interest however may be limited to investors with ties to the government or those with an appetite for risk the country is still under economic sanctions imposed by the u s and other countries that prevent investors from being able to funnel money to venezuela s state owned companies and the percentages maduro announced would not give private investors decision making powers to undertake much needed changes within the corporations at the turn of the century chávez carried out a series of takeovers in the electricity telecommunications natural gas and oil sectors but the government made minimum investments in some of these companies which have left them providing substandard services days long power outages are common across the country millions of households either do not have access to water or the service is intermittent internet and phone services are deficient government supporters and opponents alike complain about poor basic services across the country even if an election is not approaching but economists point out that venezuela s government needs to improve some of those services even if it is slightly ahead of the 2024 presidential election we are no doubt seeing a paradigm shift that is largely forced by the circumstances but also largely fueled by political survival said luis prato senior economist with the firm torino capital since june 2014 with this significant drop in oil prices the maduro administration began to see a drop in oil revenues then we went through a period from 2014 to 2019 of price controls of a more intervening state but as the state lost the ability to generate wealth and growth prato said it began to make room for participation of the private sector venezuela is still under a protracted social economic and humanitarian crisis credited to plummeting oil prices economic sanctions and two decades of mismanagement by socialist governments but the government has taken steps to relieve some of the economic pressures including by giving up its long and complicated efforts to restrict transactions in u s dollars in favor of the local bolivar whose value has been obliterated by inflation some shares of cantv have long traded on the stock exchange of caracas the country s oldest exchange maduro during this week s announcement said the state owned companies would be listed in the country s various stock exchanges without specifying but by friday gustavo pulido president of the stock exchange of caracas had not received any information of the planned stock sales he said the process to register the other companies and eventually list them is lengthy and requires the disclosure of financial documents it takes as long as you want to take to make the placement successful i couldn t tell you a certain time pulido said adding that an offering on the stock exchange of caracas could not be structured by monday the government established its own exchange in 2010 a government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment from the associated press regarding the exchanges it intends to use prato said the government is likely to use its own exchange or a separate digital system for now but that it would have limited results henkel garcia director of the caracas based firm econometrica said the companies require significant investments to improve the quality of their services which were much better before they were nationalized but he warned that the country lacks a mechanism to oversee the accounting and financial reporting procedures of the companies making it impossible to guarantee the private investment in the state companies would be appropriately spent that missing component he said creates an scenario similar to post soviet reforms in which a large number of state owned companies were privatized if this really is the beginning of the total sale or the total handing over of these companies which for me is a probable scenario one would have to ask to whom they would be handed over because we have episodes like the russian one in which these companies that once belonged to the state ended up in the hands of people who were close to the government henkel said so it is a complex phenomenon that one could say opens the door to something positive but with the institutional weakness that we have and with the lack of credible referees well it might not end in the best way a view of an out of service national telephone company of venezuela cantv phone booth in caracas venezuela friday may 13 2022 a number of venezuelan state owned
