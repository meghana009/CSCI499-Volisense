chinese ride hailing giant didi chuxing has taken investors on a roller coaster ride since it became a target of an unprecedented clampdown by beijing just days after its debut on the new york stock exchange the company went public on june 30 raising 4 4 billion from global investors in one of the largest u s share offerings of the past decade which valued the company at around 70 billion within just 48 hours after its debut however the chinese communist regime went after didi ordering a cybersecurity review of the company didi s shares have dropped more than 40 percent since its initial public offering ipo which priced the shares at 14 and the news is only getting worse as beijing is now reportedly weighing serious penalties for the ride hailing company bloomberg on july 22 reported that chinese regulators were considering serious perhaps unprecedented penalties which include a forced delisting or withdrawal of the company s shares from the stock exchange beijing might also impose sanctions on didi that are greater than the record 2 8 billion antitrust fine swallowed by the alibaba group earlier this year the report said citing people familiar with the matter other potential actions against the company are suspension of certain operations or installing a state owned investor u s lawyers are now preparing class action lawsuits over didi s ipo to recover losses suffered by investors the company and its executives are accused of making false and misleading statements and failing to disclose material information about communications with the chinese regulators the wall street journal reported on july 5 that china s cybersecurity watchdog had asked didi weeks before its ipo to postpone the offering and urged it to conduct a thorough self examination of its network security despite the potential penalties the company decided to forge ahead with its ipo the lead underwriters for the company s share sale goldman sachs morgan stanley and jpmorgan chase have also come under fire the bloomberg report revealed that bankers were informed about the discussions with the chinese regulators and their concerns about didi s data practices despite these concerns the executives investors and bankers gave the green light on june 28 to go ahead with the ipo that would fill the company s coffers and enrich all of them the report said didi told its bankers to keep a very low profile during the ipo hence there was no press conference no bell ringing and no celebration during the offering beijing has been vague about its reasons saying didi had illegally collected and used personal data but even before the listing the company had already been on beijing s radar the company along with other tech giants was subject to an investigation as to whether it employed monopolistic behavior or unfair competition practices in other contexts the chinese regime has shown no regard for how personal data are collected or whether a company is a monopoly there may be other reasons for beijing s behavior according to jason ma a china expert in an interview with ntd news ma said the regime doesn t want domestic companies to be listed in overseas stock markets the party doesn t want chinese companies to head to the u s and set off the financial markets there he said it prefers these companies go listed in hong kong stock exchange which is under the party s control didi was founded in beijing in 2012 by former alibaba manager cheng wei dubbed the uber of china the company commands the largest market share in the country the company holds crucial user data according to experts because 80 percent of car bookings in china go through didi it can track most of the population s whereabouts according to ma for example didi data in 2015 revealed that traffic at the ministry of state security was among the busiest at the time reports indicated that the ministry was busy working on two issues investigating stock market malpractice and cracking down on human rights lawyers for the chinese regime this data is a state secret ma said if for some reason this company gives such data to the united states this is indeed a national security concern for the chinese regime li min didi s vice president denied that possibility and called the speculation malicious rumors like most chinese firms listed overseas didi stores its chinese user data on chinese servers and in no way would we hand the data to the united states li wrote in a chinese social media post on july 3 in the first half of this year 34 companies from the mainland and hong kong raised a record 12 4 billion through public offerings in the united states according to dealogic data and wall street s top investment banks earned more than 450 million in fees for assisting these chinese ipos even as the u s congress begins to tighten controls on china based companies listed on u s exchanges these companies continue to seek u s capital dozens more chinese firms are planning to go public in the united states this year beijing s growing crackdown however is expected to make it harder for chinese firms to list on u s exchanges going forward
in this article we take a look at the 25 most dangerous countries in the world you can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 most dangerous countries in the world the world has its fair share of everything some parts of it are peaceful experience low crime and violence while other parts of it are riddled with crime terrorism instability and violence overall north america and europe are relatively the most stable and low crime regions in the world most of it is as a result of very strong and stable political and legal institutions social harmony as well as economic opportunities and welfare speaking of north america in particular canada is 3 times safer than the us according to the world population review on the other hand africa the middle east and latin america are relatively the more volatile regions with various social and political problems there are a number of reasons why some parts of the world are more dangerous than others in some countries crime rate is a structural problem and failure of law and order in others there are dangers for entirely different reasons like civil wars and political instability however in most cases you d find both crime and political instability in the same place according to a un report crime and instability have been shown to be inter linked empirical evidence aside this fact also appeals to common sense political instability weakens law and order and creates opportunities for organized crime individual criminals and gangbangers to commit crimes what reaps the most reward out of instability is organized crime due to its connections in the black market which the politically unstable and sanctioned states as well as their citizens increasingly turn to bosetti et al 2016 3 for instance the civil war in syria that was sparked when the government brutally cracked down on protests in 2011 has led to a huge spike in organized crime as well as disorganized crime and general violence in the country with crimes being committed by government factions rebels as well as opportunistic criminals according to a paper from stability journal prior to the war osac reported a low crime rate in the country but as of 2021 syria has one of the highest crime rates in the world with a score of 67 42 out of 100 according to the world population review report with that said there are plenty of dangerous countries in the world and below we ve outlined the 25 most dangerous countries in the world our methodology we ve concluded that crime and political instability are correlated and together they contribute to general violence and unsafe atmosphere and make a country very dangerous in terms of safety of life and property in our methodology we define a dangerous country as the one which fares low on political stability but high on crime rate for political stability we d be using data from the global economy and for crime rate we d be sourcing data from world population review and in some cases the world bank and the us based overseas security advisory council osac political stability on globaleconomy is measured on a scale of 2 5 to 2 5 with the former representing extreme instability and the latter highest stability crime rate on the other hand is measured on a scale of 0 100 on world population review with 0 representing absence of crime and 100 representing the highest level of crime however as crime rate is an indication of a specific phenomenon while political stability or instability for that matter determines much more including crime as well as general violence so we d be using political stability as the primary metric there are economic and business implications of political instability and high crime rates the most dangerous countries that made our list also experience lower economic growth rates and are among the poorest countries in the world companies like axon enterprise inc nasdaq axon offer law enforcement tools and solutions for these countries these countries are also potential markets for major defense companies like northrop grumman corporation nyse noc and l3harris technologies inc nyse lhx northrop grumman noc and l3harris technologies

an american senator recently expressed some worries about the national debt he might as well have been speaking about nigeria our nation stands at the crossroads of liberty crushing national debt rampant illegal immigration insane business regulations and staggering national unemployment are pushing our nation into unchartered territory the late chief s b falegan one of our leading bankers and economists of the older generation wrote an excellent book on the origins and evolution of our debt nigeria s external debt burden fountain publications 1992 in 1923 24 our british colonial overlords took the first ever loan on behalf of nigeria in the sum of 5 7 million with an interest rate of 2 5 payable over 20 years the loan was officially to finance capital investments in 1936 they borrowed another 4 89 million leading to a total external debt outlay of 9 89 million by 1952 nigeria s total debt stock stood at 6 8 million when the british departed in october 1960 the total debt stock had risen to 17 million during the first republic the tafawa balewa administration embarked upon a modest domestic borrowing programme they also took a loan of 31 million from the paris club with an interest rate of 3 5 payable over 20 years when the military took over in january 1966 the national debt had risen to 317 3 million remarkably during our tragic civil war of 1967 1970 no loans were ever incurred for both the war effort and post bellum rehabilitation and reconstruction thanks to the exceptional prudence and sagacity of chief obafemi awolowo who was the finance minister at the time by 1970 our total national debt stood at 1 5 billion the wanton jamboree only began from the late seventies i have already made reference to the first 1 billion loan that the departing obasanjo military regime incurred in 1979 a loan we did not need and were in fact in a position to give out the successor government of shehu shagari borrowed massively from the bretton woods institutions and the international capital markets ostensibly to finance agricultural development programmes most of them turned out to be white elephants as a young researcher i spent months in the rural countryside evaluating some of those projects i came across jumbo combined harvesters that were rotting away in the tropical sun by the time shagari was overthrown in december 1983 the national debt had ballooned to 17 billion by 1999 it had reached the astronomical figure of 36 billion servicing the interest alone was gulping up about 5 billion annually in 2005 the obasanjo administration negotiated a deal with the paris club paying off a whopping 20 billion in exchange for debt forgiveness of 16 billion whilst acting for the governor of central bank of nigeria at the time the lot fell on me to sign the cheque for the first tranche of 7 billion after signing the cheque i caught fever and had to go on painkillers then as now 7 billion is not a dog s breakfast the paris club settlement freed up the fiscal space needed to embark on an ambitious institutional reform agenda the economy grew by an average of seven per cent from 2004 to 2014 the election of muhammadu buhari in 2015 coincided with yet another global financial crisis global oil prices plummeted precipitously bad luck it seemed had taken over from goodluck one of the first loans the new regime took in 2015 was a world bank ida credit of 1 3 billion ostensibly for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war torn north east it is ironical that while nigeria never borrowed to finance the civil war we were borrowing heavily to wage a police action against boko haram insurgents the regime has gone on a borrowing mania ostensibly for power infrastructure and railway development most of the loans have either been stolen or frittered away an example is the mambila hydro project after incurring billions of dollars in loans the project has yet to see the light of day some of the railway rolling stock are second hand they have started breaking down already our outstanding debt of 87 billion amounts in per head terms to 435 calculated as 87 000 000 000 200 000 000 435 about n222 285 00 every national debt is ultimately a tax on future generations when nations are forced to undertake austerity measures in order to service their debts everybody pays a price in the words of the great american jurist wendell phillips debt is the fatal disease of republics the first thing and the mightiest to undermine governments and corrupt the people the real issue boils down to the capacity to service the debt for us in nigeria the debt is already accelerating towards a dangerous threshold we are a poor country in a situation of rising debt we may find that budgetary resources that could otherwise have gone into building critical infrastructure and developing our human capital are increasingly diverted to servicing debt the external component of the debt exposes us to geopolitical and exchange rate risks when the naira is devalued against a rising dollar we would need to earn more naira just to service our debt increasing debt servicing obligations also tend to reduce the accretion to external reserves this in turn could further depress the exchange rate signalling to foreign actors that we are becoming insolvent the international ratings agencies keep watching like hawks they can lower their ratings at a blink which in turn increases the cost of borrowing from the eurodollar market the late president john magufuli of tanzania was offered a 10 billion loan by the chinese when he saw that in the fine little print they were asking to lease the port of dar es salaam for 99 years he refused declaring that only a madman could accept such terms he decided to concentrate instead on boosting domestic revenue reducing foreign travels and rigorously implementing infrastructure projects the results were outstanding magufuli showed to the world that africa can prosper without dependence on foreign capital at the time of his death in march this year tanzania was enjoying one of the fastest growth rates in the world his accomplishments in infrastructure development were legendary there are crucial lessons for us from where i stand i could never say don t borrow but if we must let it strictly be for infrastructure and other projects with calculated guaranteed returns on investment we should also cut back on the cost of governance while plugging the loopholes that haemorrhage our foreign exchange we must also eliminate grand larceny while revamping our pork barrel leadership traditions we must understand that debt peonage is a form of re colonisation in zambia kenya madagascar ethiopia and djibouti the chinese have collateralised vital national assets against their loans in the words of the poet ezra pound wars in old times were made to get slaves the modern implement of imposing slavery is debt the collective wisdom of the centuries teaches that nations as much as individuals must learn to live within their means as the poet henry wadsworth longfellow declared long ago a debt free man looks the whole world in the face for he owes not any man we must always hold government accountable for how borrowed funds are used the national assembly must also live up to its constitutional mandate as watchdog where public finances are concerned i also worry about the rumoured collateralisation of our niger delta oil fields to the chinese the minister of transportation seemed to have confirmed that we have even mortgaged our sovereignty to the chinese as collateral for their loans on national tv he was quoted as remarking that pledging our sovereignty was not such a big deal such ignorance is dangerous and using borrowed funds to build railways and refineries in niger republic is a millennial folly if not treasonable it is patently injurious to the integrity of government and our dignity and honour as a people the clarion call to leadership in our era is to reinvent nigeria as an enlightened progressive technological industrial state a prosperous democracy we must reinvent government as a servant state that serves the people and not a leviathan that sucks their blood in the words of barack obama change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time we are the ones we ve been waiting for we are the change that we seek copyright

in this article we are going to list the 25 worst states for covid click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 worst states for covid it may seem like a different lifetime but just over a year and a half ago there were no restrictions on meeting the people you love hanging out in crowded places and attending major events such as concerts or sporting events without a second thought fast forward to today and i don t think i need to go into the details of the havoc it has caused with most countries across the world going into depressions or recessions surprisingly while everyone would ve thought that developed countries with their infrastructure and healthcare access would fare a lot better they in fact tended to fare the worst with europe becoming the first epicenter of the virus after china with the epicenter then moving to the most powerful country in the world the united states of america which as of july 2021 is still the country with the highest number of total cases and total deaths in the world even though it seemed like the end was nowhere near in sight and we might have to live for years with this virus wreaking havoc major breakthroughs by pharma companies started to occur just a year ago everyone was fretting about how long it would take for a vaccine to be developed without any guarantee of one even working up stepped pfizer inc nyse pfe and biontech se adr nasdaq bntx which became the first companies to be granted emergency authorization by any country for their development of covid 19 vaccines they were quickly followed by european pharma company astra zeneca and moderna inc nasdaq mrna and now a slew of companies including chinese companies and johnson johnson nyse jnj have come up with approved vaccines the unique thing about the vaccines developed by pfizer inc nyse pfe biontech se adr nasdaq bntx and moderna inc nasdaq mrna is that they use mrna technology which is basically the gist of moderna inc s nasdaq mrna existence this technology means that people not getting the vaccines don t even need to be infected with the virus and this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential of this incredible technology this of course does not mean that vaccination campaigns have progressed flawlessly the vaccine created by johnson johnson nyse jnj saw rare blood clots occurring in women which led to thoughts of pausing their rollout while a newer controversy pertained to the use of fetal tissue in the johnson johnson nyse jnj vaccine which is categorically not true even pfizer inc nyse pfe biontech se adr nasdaq bntx haven t really been free from controversy with the fda set to issue a rare heart inflammation warning for the vaccine as well even though the united states has had a successful vaccination campaign the campaign has not been equal divided on ideological religious and especially political grounds in may 18 000 people died from covid 19 in the u s just 200 of these deaths were of people who were vaccinated proving how incredibly important it is to get vaccinated not just for yourself but for loved ones around you too and while restrictions are easing this doesn t mean that things are completely back to normal which brings us to our list of the 25 worst states for covid with the latest data collected from cdc we have determined the rankings for the worst hit states by covid 19 based on numbers of deaths as number of infections with the former getting higher weightage since it is more indicative of a prevailing crisis so without further ado let s take a look at the states

to implement proper guidelines to prevent the spread of covid 19 from the start for which it has attracted controversy and condemnation if anything it s a surprise to see that the state only placed 25th in our list rather than placing much higher 24 kansas total covid 19 cases per 100 000 10 999 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 177 many of the states in our list our now seeing significant increases in cases thanks to the delta variant which originated in india kansas is no exception and it will be interesting to see how the state recovers from this major setback 23 nevada total covid 19 cases per 100 000 10 976 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 185 nevada has been under the cosh thanks to the delta variant which has spread quickly across the state and has one of the highest infection rates in the country right now 22 pennsylvania total covid 19 cases per 100 000 9 481 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 216 pennsylvania in its vigorous pursuit of vaccinations accidentally

per 100 000 9 836 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 207 new mexico may still be among the worst states for covid but it has handled the situation very well recently with both cases and infections

continuing to increase in what is a concerning trend for a state that has already been devastated by the virus a major reason behind this is the fact that less than 40 have been vaccinated fully which is a lot less than other states 19 michigan total covid 19 cases per 100 000 10 030 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 210 michigan is paying out around 50 000 daily to those who have vaccinated as

tennessee total covid 19 cases per 100 000 12 736 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 184 the recent increase in covid 19 cases in tennessee is alarming with a rise of 250 being seen when compared with

of 25 worst states for covid but it has the possibility to climb the rankings considering the stark upward trend of cases with a recent increase in cases of nearly 40 16 south carolina total covid 19 cases per 100 000 11 643 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 191 compared to the national average south carolina s vaccinated population percentage isn t really very high at under 50 for those who have received at least a single dose which is the major reason why the infection rate is rising 15 connecticut total covid 19 cases per 100 000 9 816 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 232 an emergency declaration made in march 2020 might just be coming to an end with lawmakers set to vote on whether they should continue the declaration the state has recently taken a controversial decision where it

hampering its fight against the pandemic 12 arkansas total covid 19 cases per 100 000 11 779 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 197 you ll notice that a lot of the states in our list of the worst states for covid are facing a lot of vaccine skepticism where some states are either promoting the skepticism while others are trying to fight it arkansas falls in the latter category even though cases are increasing 11 indiana total covid 19 cases per 100 000 11 245 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 206 to understand the situation that indiana is facing you only need to look at the federal court case that students have brought against indiana university over its vaccine mandate when implementing vaccines is the only way to permanently ward off the virus 10 louisiana total covid 19 cases per 100 000 10 488 total covid 19 deaths per 100 000 231 nearly 11 000 people have died due to covid 19 and both cases and hospitalizations are increasing as the state inches towards a total of half a

washington jul 25 efe speaker of the house nancy pelosi on sunday finalized the committee that will investigate the jan 6 assault on the us capitol selecting a republican lawmaker critical of former president donald trump as the final member pelosi announced that she had nominated congressman adam kinzinger as the ninth member of the house committee which on tuesday will hold its first hearing to probe the attack on the capitol staged by radical followers of trump an assault that resulted in five deaths kinzinger brings great patriotism to the committee s mission to find the facts and protect our democracy pelosi said in a statement praising the illinois lawmaker s agreement to serve on the committee kinzinger s selection brings the republican complement on the committee to two lawmakers while the other seven members are all democrats both kinzinger a former military officer who represents the 16th congressional district in illinois and the other conservative on the committee wyoming congresswoman liz cheney have been very critical of trump and are among the 10 gop lawmakers who voted to convict the ex president in his impeachment trial over the capitol assault a proceeding that resulted in his acquittal initially the idea was for the committee to be made up of 13 members eight nominated by pelosi and five selected by republican house minority leader kevin mccarthy although the democrat retained the authority to veto any of his picks last wednesday pelosi rejected two republican lawmakers selected by mccarthy jim banks and jim jordan because both are fervent allies of trump and have spread and strongly endorsed some of the ex president s baseless claims that the november election was stolen thus denying him a second term in response mccarthy withdrew the nominations of the other three republicans he had selected for the committee and who had received pelosi s ok the result is a much less bipartisan committee than originally planned but at least it includes two well known and respected conservative figures something that democrats hope will serve to lend authority to its conclusions it is entirely likely however that the majority of gop legislators who continue to back trump will try to use this imbalance in the committee s makeup to take away any credibility or legitimacy from its conclusions cheney the daughter of former vice president dick cheney who served from 2001 2009 under president george w bush was ousted in may from the post of house republican party conference chair by fellow gop lawmakers specifically because she had refuted trump s unfounded claims of election fraud kinzinger meanwhile on sunday promised in a statement to work diligently and from a serious clear eyed and non partisan point of view to arrive at the truth of what happened on jan 6 a result that many trump supporting republicans seem to want to derail when duty calls i will always answer kinzinger said upon accepting pelosi s appointment going on to promise to hold those responsible for the attack fully accountable scheduled to testify at the tuesday committee hearing are police officers who responded to the capitol assault when hundreds of trump s followers broke into the capitol in a fruitless attempt to prevent congress from certifying joe biden s victory in the november election which trump had claimed had only come about because of massive election fraud five people died and about 140 police officers were attacked during the capitol assault by demonstrators armed with axes baseball bats and hockey stocks among other objects according to us authorities

1008b carnegie library anglesea street cork circa 1900 source kieran mccarthy the life and death of a pioneering philanthropist on 11 august 1919 almost one hundred years ago a good friend of cork s library service passed away in lennox massachusetts usa mr andrew carnegie funder of many irish libraries and cork city library passed away after a brief illness after contracting bronchial pneumonia mr carnegie was born at dunfermline in scotland on 25 november 1835 and emigrated to the united states in 1848 he settled in pittsburgh and was for 13 years in the service of the pennsylvania railroad company he worked for some time as an iron moulder rising stop by step until he controlled great steel rolling mills in that city andrew acquired immense wealth and then came to the conclusion that wealth was simply held in trust for the benefit of the community he conceived the idea that the best way to benefit the community was by educating them and as all could not attend high schools or universities he endowed libraries believing in the concept that the best university was a good library not only did he give funding towards to the foundation of libraries he gave immense sums for education in scotland and america and built and endowed the peace palace at the hague he also founded the carnegie hero fund for the recognition of bravery in saving life when he retired from active participation in business andrew carnegie wrote several volumes including an american four in hand in britain 1883 round the world 1884 triumphant democracy 1885 the gospel of wealth 1901 the empire of business 1902 life of james watt 1905 and problems of today 1908 the announcement of mr carnegie s death on 11 august 1919 was received with feelings of deep regret in cork city and several parts of munster throughout the south of ireland many people were in receipt of the awards made by the carnegie hero fund numerous acts of bravery have been recognised by this fund and gifts in recognition been made andrew carnegie invested though in 660 public libraries across britain and ireland alone at the turn of the twentieth century on 21 october 1903 the foundation stone of the cork carnegie library was laid by andrew carnegie and afterwards on the same day he received the freedom of the city andrew s action in providing the citizens of cork with a sum of 11 000 for the erection of the library at anglesea street and a sum of 1 000 towards the furnishing of the building was greatly appreciated the new library was to replace a public library est 1892 within the school of art on nelson s place the new carnegie library was located on anglesea street next to cork city hall and had a lifespan for only 15 years until 1920 a description in the cork examiner in 1905 describes that the style was elizabethan with an elegant front with a beautiful entrance balcony and tower as added attractive features at the main entrance from anglesea street was a vestibule which opened into a large open hall the floor of which was laid as a terrazzo executed by italian workmen beyond this and in line with the entrance was the lending department furnished in the most up to date manner the central portion of the building was lit mainly from the roof light to the left of the lending library was the newsroom lined along the sides with neatly designed newspaper stands the floor space being occupied by tables for the readers the corresponding area to the left of the lending department was devoted to the reference library a space in the southern side was partitioned off into a storeroom or workplace for the library attendant flanking the entrance on the ground floor were the librarian s offices on the left and the ladies rending room on the right and over these respectively were the librarian s apartments and the juvenile reading room the library was lit by gas and specially designed pendants and brackets were fitted up in the reading rooms for the comfort of patrons the heating and ventilation were on the plenum system the heating chamber being at the northern side of the library adjacent to the municipal buildings the heated air was controlled by means of a fan driven by an electric motor and was taken by underground ducts to the various rooms practically the entire sum of 11 000 which mr carnegie provided for the establishment of the library was absorbed into the work on 12 december 1920 the carnegie free library on anglesea street in cork was destroyed by a fire lit by black and tans as well the adjoining city hall and large sections of the city centre especially st patrick s street the burning of the library left the city without a public library service until 1924 when premises were provided on a temporary basis for a library in tuckey street that service was transferred in 1930 to new premises behind a new hiberno romanesque facade at nos 57 8 grand parade the redevelopment of the library service in the 1920s was due largely to the herculean efforts of the then librarian james wilkinson after the 1920 burning james wilkinson issued an appeal for book donations which yielded an extraordinarily generous response from the national and international community the accession ledgers in which acquisitions to stock were recorded continue to be housed by the central library s local studies department and make for fascinating insight into the history of reading in cork city
singapore july 25 2021 prnewswire cyberdyne tech exchange ctx said today that its digital exchange will soon debut cross border trading of its proprietary carbon neutrality tokens cnts to be backed by the carbon credits of china the world s largest carbon market ctx has signed memoranda of understanding mou with three chinese entities to issue and facilitate the issuance of cnts backed by carbon credits green infrastructure and real estate projects and insurance products packaged as collective investment schemes under singapore s regulatory regime cnts patent pending are digital representations of one ton of carbon credits the latter are tradeable certificates that allow its holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases companies with any unneeded credits may sell them to others that need them or they can pay for green projects elsewhere to offset their own emissions the three chinese entities are cecep green carbon investment and development co a subsidiary of china energy conservation and environmental protection group cecep china jinmao holdings subsidiary jinmao capital and china taiping insurance singapore ctx backed by the us 2 billion asia green fund said its cnts will pave the way for carbon credits to be transferred across international borders this has not been possible due to protracted disagreements among signatories to the paris agreement on article 6 of the landmark pact on climate change article 6 sets out rules for the workings of a global carbon market under the paris agreement countries have pledged to meet their nationally determined contributions ndcs within a timeframe and in a manner they are sovereignly determined the ndcs comprise emission reduction targets policies and measures to mitigate climate change the article 6 dispute has mostly centred on how to avoid the double counting of internationally traded carbon offsets as well as whether to transfer pre 2021 issued credits to the new offset system dr bai bo co founder and executive chairman of ctx said we are excited with the responses we have been getting from prospective issuers since we unveiled ctx two months ago they saw the innovation behind our cnt and how it can involve the international community in helping pollutive industries reduce their emissions in a sustainable manner we were able to engender trust at a time when the crypto market was going through uncertainties because ctx is regulated by the monetary authority of singapore and built on the robust trading and market surveillance technologies of nasdaq dr bai added that ctx s mission is to promote green investing using blockchain and digital twin technologies and it will continue to invest in research and development to that end ctx s carbon neutrality token contains shared carbon information including emission records and tracing carbon offsetting carbon capture storage and reuse citing an example in china dr bo said a green infrastructure owner can participate by getting its carbon voluntary emission reduction ver verified by a 3rd party ngo agency like bureau veritas it then permanently freezes its ver certificates with the country s national carbon registry in singapore where ctx is based a non fungible digital twin of the asset or ver is created and the information embedded on the carbon neutrality token which is then traded through the ctx exchange by international investors with the carbon information tracked in the tokens issuers and investors can have visibility of the carbon footprint or lack thereof of their production activities and investment portfolios this will help them to align their fundraising and investing activities with their commitment to promote sustainable business practices dr bai disclosed that ctx is also in talks with institutions in europe and north america to issue tokens on its exchange chinese backed tokens will initially be dominant because of the size of its carbon credits

guinness book of records ford s latest all electric car the mustang mach e is a guinness world record holder after demonstrating its ultra efficiency between john o groats and land s end awarded for the lowest energy consumption in an electric car independently verified data showed that the ford mustang mach e traveled over 6 5 miles per kilowatt hour kwh of electrical energy with 88kwh of available battery capacity the efficiency achieved reflects well over 500 miles of range adding more than 120 miles to mustang mach e s official 379 mile range and trebling the miles per kwh target set by guinness world records for this new electric vehicle record the record breaking performance on britain s most lengthy journey necessitated stopping for under 45 minutes of charging leaving john o groats on full charge the 840 miles to land s end required only two main charging stops at wigan in north west england and cullompton devon ford s mustang mach e team took on setting a new benchmark miles per gallon for electric vehicles to help banish range anxiety fears easily tackling the uk s most extreme direct distance with short charge stops proves the mustang mach e s viability for all everyday journeys with the highway code recommending a break from driving of at least 15 minutes every two hours the record feat shows that safety conscious drivers pause journeys longer to refresh than charge their vehicles world record team members paul clifton bbc transport correspondent and co drivers fergal mcgrath and kevin booker who already hold petrol and diesel economy records between them said this record is about demonstrating that electric cars are now viable for everyone not just for short urban trips to work or the shops or as a second car but for real world use on long cross country journeys we ve proved that with this car the tipping point has been reached the ford mustang mach e world record team was supported on their overnight journey from the tip of scotland to the western end of cornwall by the aa s current patrols of the year for roadside assistance and recovery ben sheridan and simon blake respectively co driven by vince crane and dave baker official record

as i write this from a france making ever more bold moves toward forced vaccination one can t help but ponder the broader issues of centralized government control regardless of one s take on vaccine or no vaccine focusing on financial rather than viral data the evidence of centralized state control over natural market forces in the stock and bond markets is becoming increasingly incontrovertible we ve written elsewhere about the death of logic and the madness of crowds it should therefore come as little surprise that the death of truth is yet another casualty of the increased central control we are experiencing in global markets debt crisis disguised as a health black swan long before covid reared its highly controversial head from viral source debates baby with bathwater policy reactions censored science as to vaccine efficacy and safety distorted math on infection rates vs death rates and centralized government control by officials acting for your own safety vs constitutional and legal issues of individual choice the global financial system was already in an undeniable as well as unsustainable debt crisis as any one who can fog a mirror and read history in the same breath also knows whenever a debt crisis is obvious what follows is equally obvious an economic crisis then a political crisis and from there a social crisis in short and from ancient rome to 1917 russia or 1789 france to 1933 germany debt matters debt is a very dangerous thing to economies and societies and always climaxes with more centralized control in its wake the problem for the 21st century however is that almost no global policymaker left right or center european asian or american wanted to touch this 280t debt elephant in the room instead they buried their heads for years in the sand and sought re election with promises paid for with alas more debt in this openly embarrassing backdrop long before covid economic orthodoxy had been tossed into a corner as governments around the world took on fatal debt levels like this paid for i e monetized with mouse click fiat money like this but rather than face or confess the sins of a system already on its debt broken knees the financial and political actors responsible for the pre covid debt disaster had a convenient tale to tell a convenient lie that is and almost as if on demand along came the tale of all tales the patsy of all patsies the blame of all blames and the excuse of all excuses covid that is if we thought economic orthodoxy i e living within one s national means valuing valuations or honoring free market price discovery had been tossed into a corner pre covid well the post covid backdrop essentially murdered economic orthodoxy completely today we have global debt rising exponentially as well global central banks printing more fiat currencies parabolically new rules hiding old failures and fuzzy economics covid paved a sad new road to what antoine van agtmael described as fuzzy economics namely a financial panopticon in which governments worldwide have literally gorged themselves on ever more debt in a secular paradigm shift toward greater centralized control over our economic personal social political and foreign policies from vaccines to banking regulations lockdowns to melt ups individuals and markets are now adapting to a new set of desperate rules in the wake of the equally desperate failures of prior financial policies a governmental guarantees of commercial bank loans to this end i have spoken with russell napier at length and written at length on these new rules which involve new sets of governmental centralized control euphemistically described as support including governmental and highly inflationary guarantees of commercial bank loans this massive game changer and open signal of increasing centralized control effectively went unnoticed by the main stream media whatever stream that is b warnings from a fed governor governments doubling down yet even before blunt geniuses like napier clarified this narrative some of the less blunt and far less genius policy makers themselves could no longer hide or deny their own mistakes all of which pointed toward new rules new order and hence new mistakes to come in may of 2015 for example former fed governor larry lindsay was already confessing that the financial arrangements of the state are no longer sustainable and that a new paradigm awaited us he went on to say that it is not a pretty change if we get there and it is a matter of political liberty because a government will not voluntarily let itself go out of business it will use all its powers available to fund itself imagine that the sad fact is that just because governments have immense power this by no means implies immense wisdom character accountability or even math skills the new rules now involve a financial system already heading toward an open confession of wall street socialism and a federal reserve which is now effectively if not entirely financing the u s government centralized government controls deliberate inflation as russell napier a one time staunch deflationist now argues these new rules all point to more inflation ahead which is the ultimate gut punch to an already over controlled and dying middle class i e the real world but for nations drowning in debt deliberate inflation is one way to print away that burden bond markets decoupled from reality meanwhile in this new abnormal of increased centralized control over our lives markets and economies the fed can create money like this in the span of months in order to purchase the vast bulk of otherwise unwanted ious from uncle sam i e treasury bonds such policy of course artificially suppresses treasury yields which go down as central bank supported bond prices go up this explains why yields have sunk to levels which in no way reflect where yields would otherwise be in a free market confronting undeniable as well as rising inflation which the fed still refuses to acknowledge but as for inflation napier once again reminds have we ever seen a country in history persistently running a broad money growth rate at 10 that didn t have inflation at 4 or above the answer is no of course the u s is hardly alone in drinking its own debt kool aide and if you still need more evidence of who is buying the world s major governments bonds it s simply their own central ized banks truth dies as centralized government controls rise in short control has not only distorted markets it has distorted truth and in the same breath distorted any sense of trust in centralized leadership and or credibility which like real bond yields grows more negative by the day we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us as napier has said elsewhere bond yields are decoupled from inflation which is a polite way of saying that bond yields in particular like the bond market in general is an open lie stocks decoupled from reality speaking of decoupling from reality in the wake of the new rules emerging from increasing centralized controls economic social and political the stock market is no less of an open lie than the overtly subsidized bond market after all stocks love a generous central bank one becoming more central to our financial lives with each passing day mouse click and newly printed dollar hard to believe then ask warren buffett s infamous stock market valuation metric which measures total equity market cap as a percentage of gdp as the graph below confirms about the only thing growing under centralized control and its new rules is the mother of all stock bubbles the centralizers in bed with the debt drunk politicos call this promising market growth resulting from accommodation but anyone who tracks markets already knows that debt driven money printed growth is not growth at all it s merely a centralized aberration as well as an open insult to natural market forces more to the point such top heavy and artificial market predominance within u s gdp screams of an open charade and graphs like the buffett indicator above are just one more reason to distrust a centralized system which has now fully devolved from free market to free prevarication pretty words to hide scary math centralizers may be dishonest and openly distortive but like all politically self interested profiles they are masters at putting lipstick on a pig through euphemistic word choice of which quantitative easing stimulus accommodation mmt and recovery are all classic examples but there s more climate change policies wise altruism or just more centralized control as for further examples of the creative use of language to hide truth it may come as a surprise to any of us who care about the planet that the sudden politicized interest in climate change may not be as altruistic or progressive as the politico s would like you to believe in a global backdrop of debt driven desperation and increased centralization leaders thirsty for any way to build credibility would have us admire their green initiative but the real driver behind their plans may be less green than oil colored with all the inflationary forces colliding extreme money supply expansion fiscal deficits governmental guarantees etc the last thing our not so trusted leaders want to confess is that oil prices and oil supply may be signaling an end to cheap oil rather than confess the myriad economic and political shock waves of a peak oil event the powers that be would rather use climate change to justify their suddenly important war against fossil fuels to mask a pivot toward ever more centralized government control of your thinking and your energy consumption earlier in july for example the financial times announced that in order for sustainable finance to work we will need central planning really wonderful more central planning this blunt declaration was made in regard to the eu s new sustainable finance strategy and green bond standard aimed at creating the first climate neutral continent by 2050 sounds noble who wouldn t love climate neutral but why does sustainable finance and climate neutrality require central planning what s likely being deliberately censored from this initiative is that troublesome little notion so in danger today namely allowing free markets to decide which energy sources provide the highest energy return on invested energy eroie needless to say when it comes to bang for your buck the best energy rate of return still comes from those pesky fossil fuels not windmills or nuclear reactors needless to say if free market forces were in actual play participants would use of the cheapest most cost efficient source for energy again fossil fuels making headlines today however are global policymakers from yellen to the iea endeavoring nobly to gut punch interest in fossil fuels the iea has openly stated they want energy groups to stop producing oil and gas by 2050 but again is the motive truly noble is this about the environment the planet s safety or something else cynically and i am a cynic there may be a darker problem beneath the surface of this political shine including the fact that the oil production beneath the surface of that same planet has not moved much at all in the last decade in other words has the world reached peak oil are policy makers deliberately attacking the free market use of energy sources to save the planet or do they secretly believe peak oil namely peak cheap oil is a stark reality against which policy makers must now take extreme action in sum is climate change a politically correct ruse used to mask the much darker reality that peak oil is upon us which would have a drastic impact on debt markets geopolitics think saudi arabia and inflation skyrocketing certainly climate change offers far better political optics than peak oil headlines and all that it would portend should affordable oil become a distant memory more centralization more spending more inflation more need to prepare as i wrote in a book published just weeks before the covid outbreak the financial system was already and openly rigged to fail well before a pandemic became the new pretext for once unthinkable governmental influence i e centralized control over our markets and private lives the evidence of increasing centralization is all around us yet in an increasingly politicized media which effectively parrots rather than questions governmental policy what is entirely absent is increasingly open and public debate as well as math on everything from covid policy to monetary policy regardless of whether you feel governments are centralizing to benefit or control your future the means to that centralized end will demand further spending further debt onboarding and hence further distortion of credit equity real estate and currency markets as for currencies be they paper digitalized cbdc or some hybrid informed investors recognized long ago that they will not be real stores of value and hence the road ahead will certainly favor precious metals as just about everything else precious about free markets and national currencies is behind us needless to say this explains why some of the largest and most recent buyers of gold are the global central banks russia hungary brazil themselves just saying

after an epic pandemic induced crash in 2020 the u s stock market has gone back to winning ways and is enjoying yet another bumper season in the current year the s p 500 is already up 16 0 in the year to date and constantly taking out fresh all time highs few sectors of the market have however done better than the long suffering energy sector after years of underperformance the energy sector has been a standout performer in the current year with the energy select sector spdr etf nysearca xle up 30 0 ytd second only to the 49 8 ytd gain by the retail sector s spdr s p retail etf nysearca xrt the delta variant of covid 19 has cast a dark shadow on the entire market analysts though are saying the latest wave of infections is yet to translate into a decline in spending with most consumer spending metrics such as air traffic dining out and movie box office still in positive territory after a period of heightened volatility due to an opec spat on production levels the energy sector is bouncing back with wall street remaining largely bullish on the mid term outlook the oil sector has lately been hogging the limelight after last year s crash sent oil prices into negative territory however the natural gas sector has been even more impressive with the best known nat gas benchmark the united states natural gas etf lp nysearca ung up 48 6 ytd thanks to an ongoing natural gas rally natural gas futures were trading at 3 95 mmbtu on thursday putting them on track for their fourth straight month of robust gains natural gas has jumped 63 4 from the start of the year and 135 7 from a year ago with prices back to levels they last traded at in december 2018 when gas last traded above 4 looking closely at those numbers you will notice that natural gas stocks have lagged the commodity they track by almost 15 percentage points so far this year and a whopping 95 percentage points over the last 12 months that seeming anomaly can be chalked up to the fact that natural gas equities trade based on the price of longer dated futures while futures with near term maturities tend to fluctuate based on near term dynamics such as the weather stock investors tend to be more concerned about what the market might look like in 18 months or more bearing this in mind here s why many natural gas stocks could actually be undervalued at this point bullish natural gas outlook it s a well known fact that the fossil fuel sector is by far the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas ghg emissions in fact the eia released a damning report that in 2018 carbon dioxide co2 emissions from burning fossil fuels were equal to 75 of total u s anthropogenic ghg emissions and 93 of total u s anthropogenic co2 emissions based on 100 year global warming potential over the past half decade natural gas producers have been re branding and touting the commodity as the perfect energy bridge that will continue to play a major role in our energy mix as the world gradually adopts cleaner energy sources natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less co2 when combusted in a new efficient natural gas power plant compared with emissions from a typical new coal plant unfortunately this narrative has come under major threat over the past few years thanks to rapidly falling costs for renewable energy solar photovoltaics pv has seen the sharpest cost decline of any electricity technology over the last decade with a report by the international renewable energy agency irena saying that between 2010 2019 the cost of solar pv globally dropped by 82 if renewable energy production were to achieve cost parity with natural gas it would lose its last line of defense as an energy bridge because natural gas is still orders of magnitude dirtier than the dirtiest renewable energy sources when accounting for lifecycle emissions luckily for oil and gas bulls and to the chagrin of clean energy buffs the trend of rapidly falling solar costs appears to have come to an abrupt end clean energy funds have been taking a beating after enphase energy inc nasdaq enph a popular holding reported major semiconductor shortages and supply chain issues enph went through one of its biggest one day crashes after dropping nearly 10 a day after reporting better than forecast q1 earnings but issuing downward guidance for q2 due to semiconductor shortages and supply chain issues that have been worse than anticipated a global shortage in semiconductor chips has been wreaking havoc on the tech sector clean energy automotive industry consumer electronics industry and everything in between after

could be a short term risk though following checks with utility scale solar developers including array technologies nasdaq arry ftc solar nasdaq ftci and shoals technologies nasdaq shls cowen analysts have trimmed their earnings estimates for q4 2021 and h1 2022 because the bulk of q2 q3 revenue was booked pre inflation noting inflation on panels and steel has led to 10 increase in project costs leading to 6 9 month pushouts for solar projects analyst jeffrey osborne says that he sees more resilience in residential exposure related the net zero narrative is riddled with holes however cowen says that their checks with utility scale project developers suggest that the long term trends remain incredibly encouraging still there could be other long term secular headwinds that could limit growth for the sector the solar industry is now mostly focused on making panels more powerful as it continues to squeeze as much efficiency as possible out of solar tech however according to xiaojing sun global solar research leader at wood mackenzie ltd the reduction in the cost of module prices has slowed notably in the past two years it is now going to be cost of electricity reductions that provide much of the upside for solar energy this limitation means solar costs are unlikely to drop low enough to outperform their oil and gas rivals even if oil prices weren t soaring higher the hydrogen ally last year the european union set out its new hydrogen strategy as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality for all its industries by 2050 in a big win for the renewable energy sector the eu has outlined an extremely ambitious target to build out at least 40 gigawatts of electrolyzers within its borders by 2030 or 160x the current global capacity of 250mw the eu also plans to support the development of another 40 gigawatts of green hydrogen in nearby countries that can export to the region by the same date the eu aims to have at least 6 gigawatts of clean hydrogen electrolyzers installed by 2024 advertisement good news for natural gas companies although brussels clearly favors green hydrogen produced by renewable energy it has signaled that it will also encourage the development of blue hydrogen that is produced from natural gas paired with carbon capture and storage ccs the eu has said that hydrogen will play a key role in helping decarbonize manufacturing industries and the transport sector the organization says it will support blue hydrogen during a transition phase although natural gas producers would no doubt prefer centralized blue hydrogen they will not be complaining too much since natural gas infrastructure can easily be repurposed to carry hydrogen the latest decision by european policymakers follows years of hard lobbying by more than 30 energy companies including exxonmobil nyse xom eni s p a nyse e shell nyse rds a total nyse tot equinor asa nyse eqnr and other european natural gas companies which have called for a technology neutral strategy arguing that renewables such as wind and solar cannot grow fast enough to power the clean hydrogen sector to meet decarbonization goals the signatories have claimed the green hydrogen industry is currently too small to spark the growth of a large scale european hydrogen economy in the space of just a decade top natural gas stocks given this backdrop we believe that natural gas is likely to continue playing a major role in the u s energy mix as the most dominant fuel in electricity generation for many years john gerdes mkm partners oil and gas analyst has picked

san francisco and suzhou china july 25 2021 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a phase 1 study of ibi321 an anti pd 1 tigit bispecific antibody the objective of this open label multi center phase 1a dose escalation and expansion study is to evaluate the safety tolerability potential optimal dosage and preliminary efficacy of ibi321 in patients with advanced malignant tumors whose cancer progressed on standard of care treatment the trial is being conducted in china as a bispecific antibody ibi321 has the potential to enhance efficacy by synergistically targeting both pd 1 and tigit preclinical studies of ibi321 have shown that the molecule retained the activity of a pd 1 inhibitor and simultaneously suppressed tigit to enhance the anti cancer efficacy professor baohui han chief of respiration department and gcp center of shanghai chest hospital stated although immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown great efficacy in a variety of tumor types we still face challenges of primary and secondary drug resistance meanwhile the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors needs to be further improved therefore the development of the next generation of bispecific antibodies has important clinical value tigit is an important immune checkpoint receptor which plays an important role in tumor immune surveillance we look forward to the clinical research results of ibi321 professor xiangdong cheng secretary of party committee of cancer hospital of the university of chinese academy of sciences zhejiang cancer hospital and chief of zhejiang province upper gastrointestinal tumor diagnosis and treatment technology research center stated the progress of immunotherapy in certain types of colorectal cancer and gastric cancer has not been satisfactory compared with the progress of anti pd 1 monoclonal antibodies in melanoma lung cancer and esophageal cancer and this needs further exploration tigit is highly expressed in gastric cancer and pre clinical experiments have proved that synergistically targeting pd 1 and tigit could significantly repress gastric tumor growth we look forward to the clinical results of ibi321 particularly in gi tumors dr hui zhou senior vice president of clinical development of innovent stated by specifically targeting both pd 1 and tigit this type of bispecific antibody is designed to provide synergistic effects by blocking both the pd 1 pd l1 and tigit cd155 pathways with the goal of improving the anti cancer efficacy currently there is no bispecific antibody that has same target as ibi321 in clinical stage development worldwide preclinical studies of ibi321 have demonstrated that the combination of these two monoclonal antibodies further enhanced the immune activation with improved convenience of administration therefore the development of an anti pd 1 tigit bispecific antibody has the potential to provide patients with more effective and convenient

tony platt is distinguished affiliated scholar at the center for the study of law society university of california berkeley and a member of berkeley s truth justice project he is the author of several books including beyond these walls rethinking crime and punishment in the united states that address issues of race inequality and social justice in american history i am glad to see that structural critiques of racism are finally gaining some traction in university curricula and professional training in the united states it s been a long wait in the fall of 1972 while legal scholars were contemporaneously developing what would become critical race theory i was co teaching a course on radical criminology to some six hundred undergraduates at berkeley our curriculum included sections on crimes of racism as well as crimes of imperialism exploitation sexism and survival students read about the trial of the panther 21 and institutional racism in prisons and watched documentaries on the bombing of hiroshima and the murder of fred hampton i taught another class on criminal justice racism with david du bois w e b du bois stepson who was then editor of the black panther party s newspaper not surprisingly i was not a criminology professor much longer informants in my classes reported to the fbi that i had continually and consistently displayed anti american ideas and that i was one of the first individuals to wear extremely long hair berkeley s chancellor in a confidential memo to a university committee considering my promotion to tenured professor complained that my political activism had contributed to the decline in morale of the local police department and that my scholarship smacked of orthodox marxism of the 1930s moreover he added i do believe some of his colleagues would be somewhat relieved if he weren t around by the mid 1970s the teaching of radical theories of racism was marginalized in most universities in berkeley the university closed down the school of criminology it would take another forty years for advocates of critical race theory to again carve out a niche in academia and again it is under relentless attack there s a lot of noise these days about how it s promoting racial discord and generally wrecking the country sufficiently demonized to have its own acronym crt has replaced affirmative action and political correctness as the right s target in the culture wars it weaponizes diversity says utah senator mike lee and turns college campuses into grievance pageants and loose orwellian mobs opportunistically jumping on the populist bandwagon donald trump accuses crt of indoctrinating america s school children with some of the most toxic and anti american themes ever conceived its ridiculous left wing dogma promotes divisive messages verge on psychological abuse how dangerous is it you may ask it is a program of national suicide replies trump no doubt lee and trump have in mind initiatives recently taken by universities such as uc berkeley s promise to become an anti racist campus that draw upon antiracist frameworks in teaching and research with its progressive reputation for social justice activism berkeley is always an easy target for the right though i ve not yet encountered any multicultural hordes running rampant on my campus for most of its history from its founding in the 1870s through the 1990s long before it took tentative steps to incorporate critical race theory into its curriculum berkeley was a bastion of uncritical race theory the self righteous indignation of leading politicians and literati was resolutely muted when academia nourished scientific racism nobody yelled about disrespect for our ancestors when berkeley s first president daniel coit gilman 1872 1875 praised california s founding fathers for making this wilderness rejoice and blossom like a rose thus erasing thousands of years of indigenous history prior to genocide the biblically inspired catchphrase fiat lux a regional expression of manifest destiny is repetitively embedded in the university s iconography from its inscription on an arch honoring philanthropist phoebe hearst after her death in 1919 to its use as a sign off in the chancellor s messaging today testimony to the staying power of fiat lux is former senator and republican pundit rick santorum s recent claim to young america s foundation that there isn t much native american culture in american culture we birthed a nation from nothing i mean there was nothing here nobody raised the specter of divisiveness when the university appointed john leconte as its third president 1876 1881 and his brother joseph as professor of geology both were unreconstructed racists from a slave owning family in georgia and owners of a weapons factory during the civil war there was only a slim hope joseph le conte argued in 1892 in his capacity as president of the american association for the advancement of science for civilizing the plastic docile imitative negro as for the american indian extermination is unavoidable nobody registered their concern about cancel culture when the university appointed as its ninth president 1919 1923 david prescott barrows whose experience as general superintendent of education in the occupied philippines left him convinced that filipinos had an intrinsic inability for self governance and that the white or european race is above all others the great historical race nobody seemed worried about the dangers of hyphenated americanism when berkeley s most distinguished historian herbert bolton promoted the global significance of spain s colonial ventures commending its frontier genius and efforts to discipline the indian in the rudiments of civilized life his 1922 textbook for children helped to solidify the myth that spain s deadly mission system taught wild indians the christian faith and how to do useful things in the white man s way nor did university officials express any concern about the possibility of quid pro quo when the king of spain made bolton a commander of the royal order of isabella the catholic in 1925 nobody charged two of berkeley s leading academics zoologist samuel holmes and medical scientist herbert evans with un americanism when they joined an organization that publicly praised hitler s regime for forcibly sterilizing 200 000 women during its first three years in power they remained loyal members of the rightwing human betterment foundation from its foundation in 1929 until its dissolution in 1942 nine years after the nazi government enacted the law for the prevention of genetically diseased offspring sterilization law and seven years after the publication of the first american edition of mein kampf there is a good deal of discussion in germany over the curtailment of the increase of poles jews and other elements not in the good graces of the present régime wrote holmes in 1937 two years after the nazis enacted the nuremberg laws what the germans may accomplish and many of their best minds are giving serious thought to the problem remains to be seen holmes put his best mind to work in the united states by lobbying for a quota on mexican immigrants the least assimilable of foreign stocks advocating financial incentives for white female students and faculty wives to procreate and helping to make california the country s leader in forced sterilization you can hear strong echoes of this reactionary angst in great replacement theory that today is a foundational tenet of rightwing ideology the university did more than tolerate holmes fascist inspired ideology it also funded and published his extensive bibliography of eugenics 1924 and his racist screed the negro s struggle for survival in which the author commended the ku klux klan for promoting the health and welfare of survivors of slavery in the south no irony intended to holmes the more primitive race native people had failed to adjust itself to a more highly developed social order and thus disappeared because they remained in large part a sort of foreign element in our population nobody railed about cultural exclusion when phoebe hearst bankrolled archaeological expeditions to egypt peru mexico and california that returned to berkeley with the spoils of mummies funerary artifacts and human remains aptly described by hazel carby as fetishes of conquest during the 20th century university officials welcomed the plunder of thousands of native graves and accumulation of the country s second largest collection of human bones and crania in the name of salvage archaeology nobody decried race based theories when edward gifford the university s expert on anthropometry promoted essentialist quackery about how the living aborigines of california fall into two main groups one low faced the other high faced his research focused on the measurement of racial differences as indicated by the length and breadth of heads noses and ears the degree of slope in forehead the axis of nostrils and the degree to which the fleshy lower margin of the septum is exposed the university rewarded gifford by publishing his research putting him in charge of public education about anthropology promoting him to full professor and naming a room in his honor after his death in 1959 in the 1970s and 1980s while activists all around the country condemned psychologist arthur jensen s arguments about the hereditarian roots of intelligence the university protected his freedom to peddle updated eugenics while it justified closing down the school of criminology on the grounds that we had abandoned our professional mission i don t remember any administrators suggesting that jensen s scholarship represented an attack on american values how much can we boost iq and scholastic achievement asked jensen in his influential 1969 harvard educational review article not much he replied and not worth social investment in trying to do so for the next twenty five years as professor of education at berkeley he stuck to his reactionary views about the fixed genetic nature of intelligence moreover his research boosted the popularity of richard herrnstein and charles murray s neoconservative proposal in the bell curve that it is time for america once again to try living with inequality as life is lived the logic of eugenics that was embedded in the work of the leconte brothers david barrows herbert bolton samuel holmes edward gifford and arthur jensen has had devastating consequences for millions of people poor women disproportionately latina native and african american who were forcibly sterilized mexican immigrants who were restricted from entering the united states on racial grounds families of color who were tracked into segregated housing and substandard education people with physical and intellectual disabilities who were denied a right to full lives and native people who were represented in popular literature and educational texts as biologically destined to extinction the ideas that settler colonialism and capitalism represented a progressive civilization bringing light to the darkness and that social inequality is rooted in biological predisposition shaped public education and everyday commonsense for decades it lives on for example in trump s depiction of american carnage as inherent in crime infested communities of color and in police use of the pseudo diagnosis excited delirium to explain why force is necessary to restrain and kill african american men in the twilight of my career i was invited in 2014 to return as a resident scholar to berkeley the site of my banishment in the 1970s it s good to be back where i started my climb up the academic ladder and to witness the resurrection of efforts to infuse the curriculum with critically informed ideas about race it s the least we can do to make up for generations of what inuit artist david ruben piqtoukun calls an education in forgetting i hope though that the university s anti racism initiatives also keep in mind one of critical race theory s central tenets that racism is systemic and structural that the past bleeds into the present to move forward we need to understand how and why universities such as berkeley hosted and emboldened pro racist initiatives for so long as i recently walked through the berkeley campus past buildings statues and plaques that celebrate an american president who authorized the appropriation of native lands to finance the university of california that dignify

after a fierce week i believe that many people have been fooled by the trend of oil prices with a long shadow the performance of oil prices on july 19 will leave a focus on this year s trend the collapse performance of 6 us dollars per barrel caught many investors by surprise and the performance of turning back and pulling up strongly is also amazing oil prices have left a long shadow on the weekly chart and a weekly volatility of more than 10 is not uncommon in the history of oil prices but a 10 turnback like this is very rare the market corrected quickly after the collapse last monday and recovered all the losses indicating that the price of oil fell emotionally and irrationally last monday so the market quickly corrected its mistakes in the process we saw a rapid escape of 60 000 positions in crude oil last monday and tuesday while there was little significant increase or decrease in funds at the beginning of the rebound until there was a sharp increase of 35000 positions on friday this shows that investors fled from the initial panic to be at a loss in the face of a rapid rebound and did not re enter the market until last friday this performance allows us to see more clearly the psychological fluctuation process of investors risk aversion with the eia weekly report showing that demand in the us market is still strong dispelling concerns about demand the previous week global risk appetite has also risen again us stocks have set new record highs and copper prices have risen sharply out of decline oil prices have also pulled back into a strong state again changes in supply and demand before the july meeting the situation of supply shortage was becoming more and more serious judging from the inventory data the current rising water structure of the crude oil market and the monthly difference the market almost consistently judged that opec would form a new decision to increase production at the july meeting and the increase was generally expected to be between 50 and 1 million barrels per day so oil prices immediately refreshed this year s high after the market heard that opec plans to increase production by 400000 barrels per day but changes followed when the united arab emirates jumped out and advocated that it should meet the requirements of raising its production base otherwise it would not agree to the decision to increase production and the opec meeting fell into a stalemate an incident that plagued the market for two weeks and brought great uncertainty to the crude oil market the crude oil market was cloudy at the beginning of last week the market s attention shifted from tightening supply to being optimistic about the consistency of oil prices to great uncertainty on the supply side suddenly the market found that with the rise of oil prices there was a lot of uncertainty on the supply side in the future it was obvious that opec countries had strong motivation to increase production and differences also arose finally after more than half a month of repeated negotiations finally a new decision to increase production was reached on july 18 and opec agreed to extend the production reduction agreement until the end of 2022 after saudi arabia and the united arab emirates settled the dispute hindering the agreement opec and its allies agreed to gradually add more oil to the market increasing production by 400000 b d per month until its halted production is fully restored opec agreed to a new baseline of 3 5 million b d for crude oil production reduction in the uae an increase of 350000 b d over the existing base 150000 b d each in iraq and kuwait and 50 b d in saudi arabia and russia starting in may 2022 opec s total baseline increase in oil production will be 1 63 million barrels per day judging from the final increase agreement reached by opec the increase is quite restrained and the increase of 400000 b d is already the minimum increase expected by the market but over time the final accumulated supply will also increase by 2 million b d by the end of this year and 3 6 million b d when the existing agreement expires in april next year in fact it is not just opec s resumption of us shale oil production that has begun to attract market attention us crude oil production increased by 300000 b d to 11 4 million b d in july which surprised the market the number of active drilling rigs in the us increased by seven last week to 387 the highest since april 2020 according to baker hughes an energy services company baker hughes expects 50 additional drilling rigs in north america by the end of this year believing that global crude oil growth will continue until 2022 and that the north american crude oil market will show additional growth in the second half of the year shale oil which has insufficient production momentum due to the adjustment of business thinking for a long time in the past is expected to re increase investment schlumberger the world s largest oil service believes that the growth rate of crude oil activity in north america will slow and drilling activity is still likely to grow unexpectedly due to spending by private exploration and production operators in short non opec countries including the united states will resume crude oil production when oil prices are above 75 a barrel from the increase in production on the supply side we can see that although the crude oil market is still likely to be tight in the second half of this year the tight situation between supply and demand in the crude oil market is expected to be alleviated gradually after the peak demand season the increase in supply side production is not unprepared but strong expectations of demand are the main reason for the rise in oil prices as long as demand is strong the current increase in supply will not affect oil prices to remain strong opec believes that there is a shortage of 1 7 million barrels per day in the crude oil market and investment banks continue to raise their global crude oil demand expectations and price expectations however oil prices begin to weaken as the uncertainty brought about by opec begins to weaken at this time the market begins to worry that the rampant delta strain may damage the prospects for the recovery of crude oil demand investment banks such as goldman sachs have begun to expect that a new outbreak caused by the delta strain could reduce crude oil demand by 1 million barrels a day and the market is very worried about weak demand so it will be important for the eia to report on demand last week the latest data show that u s eia crude oil stocks increased by 2 107 million barrels in the week ended july 16 expected to decrease by 4 5 million barrels and the previous value decreased by 7 896 million barrels gasoline stocks decreased by 121000 barrels expected to decrease by 1 05 million barrels and the previous value increased by 1 038 million barrels refined oil stocks decreased by 1 349 million barrels expected to increase by 650000 barrels and the previous value increased by 3 657 million barrels exports decreased by 1 562 million barrels per day to 2 463 million barrels per day crude oil production decreased by 10 million barrels per day to 11 4 million barrels per day imports of 7 097 million barrels per day an increase of 876000 barrels per day over the previous week from the us to asia to europe fuel demand and road traffic remain strong supporting expectations that the economic recovery is not derailed and that global inventories will continue to shrink the latest us crude oil market data show that demand is still strong which dispels market concerns about demand macro and epidemic situation global risk appetite has rebounded rapidly typical of which is the sharp fall in precious metals the strong performance of the recently released macro data can be attributed to the record high of us stocks and the sharp rise in copper the ihs markit euro zone composite purchasing managers index pmi for july climbed to 60 6 from 59 5 the previous month the highest level since july 2000 the index is still above the 50 dividing line and above the 60 0 forecast by survey analysts chris williamson chief business economist at ihs markit said the euro zone is enjoying rapid economic growth in the summer and the relaxation of anti epidemic restrictions in july pushed the economy to grow at its fastest pace in 21 years the service industry is enjoying the freedom brought about by deregulation of epidemic prevention restrictions and increased vaccination rates especially in hospitality travel and tourism demand is advancing rapidly suggesting that this pace will not slow down any time soon the new business index rose to 59 7 from 58 7 one of the highest in the survey s 23 year history the initial pmi of markit manufacturing in the united states recorded 63 1 in july the highest level since the data were recorded while the initial pmi of markit service industry was 59 8 much lower than market expectations williamson chief business economist at ihs markit said the initial pmi figures for july showed that us economic growth slowed for the second month in a row although the slowdown came after unprecedented growth in may after the reopening of the economy growth in the services sector is likely to slow and more importantly both manufacturing and services have achieved strong growth in order to ensure economic recovery the united states and europe will continue to maintain loose monetary conditions european central bank president christine lagarde said last thursday that he would not withdraw emergency support prematurely so as not to undermine the economic recovery while the ecb sent a dovish message the next focus of the market was the fed policy meeting at the last meeting on june 16 fed officials no longer used the phrase that the novel coronavirus epidemic put pressure on the economy but the number of cases has risen sharply since then however many analysts still expect the meeting to further discuss reducing stimulus us treasury secretary yellen has warned that if congress fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling by august 1 the treasury department will not be able to predict how long it will be able to avoid a potential default on its national debt at that time the united states may not be able to pay its government debt in full on time with disastrous consequences ms yellen said the risk of default on government bonds alone could damage the country s fiscal position she cited the decision of international rating agencies to downgrade the us credit rating during the 2011 debt ceiling impasse it is reported that the us treasury has taken extraordinary measures to avoid default but yellen said that the difficulties caused by the novel coronavirus epidemic have limited the efforts of the us treasury earlier the congressional budget office said the us could default on its debt in october or november unless congress raised or suspended the debt ceiling as of 19 00 local time on july 23 according to data released by the brazilian ministry of health there were 108732 more cases than the previous day indonesia had 50 000 new confirmed cases france had a total of 5 95 million confirmed cases and experts warned that the number of new cases could reach 50 000 in a single day at the beginning of august in addition the epidemic is growing almost all over the world and the delta strain is still raging around the world so far the new outbreak has mainly affected unvaccinated people however considering that although the spread of the epidemic has accelerated there has been no significant increase in severity and mortality and it will take time to further assess the lethality of the delta strain as the epidemic continues to spread we will learn more about the impact on people who have already been vaccinated the general consensus is that consumption travel and business activities will only be slightly affected even at the end of last year when a new outbreak broke out in the united states the economic recovery continued so far economists have maintained predictions of a historically strong recovery in the global economy and a key factor in their confidence is that governments are unlikely to impose an anti epidemic blockade again and most consumers will not fundamentally change their spending plans if this view changes the outlook will also become unpredictable taken together the positive factors reached at the opec meeting on july 18 will continue to play a role in the coming period opec led by saudi arabia insists on more restrained production on the supply side to ensure the continuation of supply shortages in the crude oil market this year which means that it is difficult for oil prices to continue to fall unilaterally if market risk appetite continues to pick up oil prices are still more likely to hit 80 a barrel but at the same time we have also seen the power of the delta strain although many people already think that novel coronavirus is moving towards influenza the epidemic will still haunt the market from time to time before it reaches its peak and whether demand can remain strong is also a factor that needs to be paid attention to next we need to clearly recognize that the continued increase in the supply side at the later stage is a deterministic factor which will also continue to narrow the gap with demand and market sentiment may cool down at any time therefore while strongly looking forward to the future oil prices we also need to pay close attention to the impact of relevant variables on oil prices
an american senator recently expressed some worries about the national debt he might as well have been speaking about nigeria our nation stands at the crossroads of liberty crushing national debt rampant illegal immigration insane business regulations and staggering national unemployment are pushing our nation into unchartered territory the late chief s b falegan one of our leading bankers and economists of the older generation wrote an excellent book on the origins and evolution of our debt nigeria s external debt burden fountain publications 1992 in 1923 24 our british colonial overlords took the first ever loan on behalf of nigeria in the sum of 5 7 million with an interest rate of 2 5 payable over 20 years the loan was officially to finance capital investments in 1936 they borrowed another 4 89 million leading to a total external debt outlay of 9 89 million by 1952 nigeria s total debt stock stood at 6 8 million when the british departed in october 1960 the total debt stock had risen to 17 million during the first republic the balewa administration embarked upon a modest domestic borrowing programme they also took a loan of 31 million from the paris club with an interest rate of 3 5 payable over 20 years when the military took over in january 1966 the national debt had risen to 317 3 million remarkably during our tragic civil war of 1967 1970 no loans were ever incurred for both the war effort and post bellum rehabilitation and reconstruction thanks to the exceptional prudence and sagacity of chief obafemi awolowo who was finance minister at the time by 1970 our total national debt stood at 1 5 billion the wanton jamboree only began from the late seventies i have already made reference to the first 1 billion loan that the departing obasanjo military administration incurred in 1979 a loan we did not need and were in fact in a position to give out the successor government of shehu shagari borrowed massively from the bretton woods institutions and the international capital markets ostensibly to finance agricultural development programmes adps most of them turned out to be white elephants as a young researcher i spent months in the rural countryside evaluating some of those projects i came across jumbo combined harvesters that were rotting away in the tropical sun by the time shagari was overthrown in december 1983 the national debt had ballooned to 17 billion by 1999 it had reached the astronomical figure of 36 billion servicing the interest alone was gulping up about 5 billion annually in 2005 the obasanjo administration negotiated a deal with the paris club paying off a whopping 20 billion in exchange for debt forgiveness of 16 billion whilst acting for the governor of cbn at the time the lot fell on me to sign the cheque for the first tranche of 7 billion after signing the cheque i caught fever and had togo on painkillers then as now 7 billion is not a dog s breakfast the paris club settlement freed up the fiscal space needed to embark on an ambitious institutional reform agenda the economy grew by an average of 7 from 2004 to 2014 the election of muhammadu buhari in 2015 coincided with yet another global financial crisis global oil prices plummeted precipitously badluck it seemed had taken over from goodluck one of the first loans the new administration took in 2015 was a world bank ida credit of 1 3 billion ostensibly for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war torn north east it is ironical that while nigeria never borrowed to finance the civil war we were borrowing heavily to wage a police action against boko haram insurgents the administration has gone on a borrowing mania ostensibly for power infrastructures and railway development most of the loans have either been stolen or frittered away an example is the mambila hydro project after incurring billions of dollars in loans the project is yet to see the light of day some of the railway rolling stock are second hand they have started breaking down already our outstanding debt of 87 billion dollars amounts in per head terms to 435 calculated as 87 000 000 000 200 000 000 435 about n222 285 00 every national debt is ultimately a tax on future generations when nations are forced to undertake austerity measures in order to service their debts everybody pays a price in the words of the great american jurist wendell phillips debt is the fatal disease of republics the first thing and the mightiest to undermine governments and corrupt the people the real issue boils down to the capacity to service the debt for us in nigeria the debt is already accelerating towards a dangerous threshold we are a poor country in a situation of rising debt we may find that budgetary resources that could otherwise have gone into building infrastructures and developing our human capital are increasingly diverted to servicing debt the external component of the debt exposes us to geopolitical and exchange rate risks when the naira is devalued against a rising dollar we would need to earn more naira just to service our debt increasing debt servicing obligations also tend to reduce the accretion to external reserves this in turn could further depress the exchange rate signalling to foreign actors that we are becoming insolvent the international ratings agencies keep watching like hawks they can lower their ratings at a blink which in turn increases the cost of borrowing from the eurodollar market the late president john magufuli of tanzania was offered a 10 billion loan by the chinese when he saw that in the fine little print they were asking to lease the port of dar es salaam for 99 years he refused declaring that only a madman could accept such terms he decided to concentrate instead on boosting domestic revenue reducing foreign travels and rigorously implementing infrastructure projects the results were outstanding magufuli showed to the world that africa can prosper without dependence on foreign capital at the time of his death in march this year tanzania was enjoying one of the fastest growth rates in the world his accomplishments in infrastructure development were legendary there are crucial lessons for us from where i stand i could never say don t borrow but if we must let it strictly be for infrastructure and other projects with calculated guaranteed returns on investment we should also cut back on the cost of governance while plugging the loopholes that haemorrhage our foreign exchange we must also eliminate grand larceny while revamping our pork barrel leadership traditions we must understand that debt peonage is a form ofre colonisation in zambia kenya madagascar ethiopia and djibouti the chinese have collateralised vital national assets against their loans in the words of the poet ezra pound wars in old times were made to get slaves the modern implement of imposing slavery is debt the collective wisdom of the centuries teaches that nations as much as individuals must learn to live within their means as the poet henry wadsworth longfellow declared long ago a debt free man looks the whole world in the face for he owes not any man we must always hold government accountable for how borrowed funds are used the national assembly must also live up to its constitutional mandate as watchdog where public finances are concerned i also worry about the rumoured collateralisation of our niger delta oil fields to the chinese the honourable minister of transport seemed to have confirmed that we have even mortgaged our sovereignty to the chinese as collateral for their loans on national tv he was quoted as remarking that pledging our sovereignty was not such a big deal such ignorance is dangerous and using borrowed funds to build railways and refineries in niger republic is a millennial folly if not treasonable it is patently injurious to the integrity of government and our dignity and honour as a people the clarion call to leadership in our era is to reinvent nigeria as an enlightened progressive technological industrial state a prosperous democracy we must reinvent government as a servant state that serves the people and not a leviathan that sucks their blood in the words of barack obama change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time we are the ones we ve been waiting for we are the change that we

investors will usher in the fed s monetary policy decision this week which is the top priority of the market this week marketwatch a well known financial website wrote on saturday that the fed is expected to have a long discussion this week about slowing its monthly bond purchases scaling back bond purchases is crucial to financial markets economists say investors want clear answers to key questions such as when to start scaling back their bond purchases and the pace but they are likely to be disappointed economists say new concerns about global economic growth and the spread of novel coronavirus s delta variant have partly eased inflation concerns and reduced pressure on the fed to talk more frankly about its retrenchment plan we don t expect federal reserve chairman colin powell to signal an imminent reduction in bond purchases matthew luzzetti chief us analyst at deutsche bank deutsche bank said in an interview vince reinhart chief economist at mellon bank mellon agrees i think powell is a little more relaxed than you thought a few weeks ago reinhart said concerns about delta variants are related to reduced concerns about inflation and increased concerns about the global outlook as a result calls for to come up with conclusive evidence that they are slowing down their asset purchases will abate a bit mohamed el erian chief economic adviser to allianz allianz said most of the news the market will hear this week is conditions under which bond purchases are expected to scale back by the end of the year the fed will meet on tuesday and wednesday local time the federal open market committee fomc will announce the interest rate resolution on thursday at 02pur 00 hong kong time and federal reserve chairman colin powell will hold a press conference next thursday at 02pur 30 hong kong time powell had previously said that despite the recent surge in inflation data the fed would keep its policy loose since the outbreak the fed has kept its benchmark interest rate close to zero wachovia currently buys 120 billion a month in bonds including 80 billion in treasuries and 40 billion in mortgage backed securities called m bs in december the fed said it would not slow the pace of asset purchases until it made substantial progress in achieving a healthy labour market and a stable 2 per cent inflation target monetary policy hawks in the fomc have played down this requirement and hope that the fed will start the process as soon as possible however most fomc members headed by powell recently said that there is still a long way to go to make substantial progress in june with the recession over the economy recovering and inflation rising the fed finally began to talk about when to slow down its bond purchases minutes of the fed s june meeting show that fed officials generally believe that it is important to be prepared where appropriate to reduce the pace of asset purchases in response to unexpected economic developments as a matter of prudent planning as a result economists believe that at this week s meeting the fed will develop a plan and review a series of plans to reduce bond purchases such as whether to slow the pace of m bs purchases faster than us treasuries but no decision is expected economists say powell is likely to scale back bond purchases as early as the end of august at the fed s summer meeting in jackson hole wyoming but many others believe it is too early to announce a reduction in bond purchases which will be announced at the fomc meeting on sept 21 22 others believe the fed will wait until its november 2 3 meeting to estimate the response of economic and labor indicators when children return to school in the fall economists generally believe that the fed will not raise its benchmark interest rate until it stops its monthly purchases altogether that should take about eight months said kathy bostjancic chief economist for u s financial markets at the oxford economics of the oxford institute of economics overall the fed s monetary policy will remain loose until the benchmark interest rate is well above zero
we ve briefly watched the savings and loan thrift segment of the u s banking business implode it didn t take long the dominoes began teetering in 1987 and it was all over by 1990 a major segment of the u s banking business had effectively ceased to exist after 175 years of financing housing for americans some 550 thrifts failed and 403 s l execs were convicted of fraud the remaining institutions scrambled to distance themselves from the carnage and stigma of having been in the thrift business institution names were changed to savings bank or simply bank but the thrift charter effectively the license to do business issued by the federal deposit insurers stayed the same and that charter had and still does have one feature that played a part in the coming of the great meltdown in 2008 it allows a thrift to load up on home mortgages the biggest bank failure in u s history washington mutual wamu a thrift occurred in 2008 a result of home loans gone bad the closure of the failed thrifts was by no means the end of the saga at least for the hapless u s taxpayer to dispose of billions of dollars worth of property and real estate loans the government formed the resolution trust corp an entity charged with marketing everything from failed banks to typewriters this federal entity was staffed by a combination of banking regulators and employees of failed institutions the inefficiency of its operation was notorious and the source of some great stories if you find big governmental boondoggling risible there have some very good books written about the rtc but these two examples will probably give an idea of the sausage being made by the outfit in one instance a builder tendered a bid to the rtc on some land for development which was rejected he reworked the presentation and offered less it was accepted who knows why maybe the first rtc analyst had moved on to a new job in banking and the following incident was typical of the rtc marketing acumen the office building of a failed thrift in a resort community even back then a very valuable piece of real estate was put on the market in a matter of days the winning bidder had flipped the property for an embarrassingly healthy profit which went into the pocket of the seller not the u s taxpayers laws were passed among them the bank bribery act and the big dog legislation the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act firrea it was a wide ranging piece of legislation that among other things set down civil money penalties for bankers and laid out strict guidelines for real estate appraisals it was the dodd frank act of the 20th century designed to make certain nothing like the collapse of the s l industry ever ever should happen again as we now know it was no more effective in that role than the treaty of versailles was in preventing world war ii and probably as successful as dodd frank will be in obviating the next banking crisis because you can t legislate away human nature you can t regulate greed and hubris but it didn t matter because the seeds of the financial crisis of 2008 were planted and thriving the secondary mortgage market had been around for a long time the government national mortgage association ginnie mae a u s government enterprise had been packaging va guaranteed loans into securities since 1946 fannie mae which specialized in buying and securitizing fha and va loans and later freddie mac which was formed to make a market for conventional mortgages those not guaranteed by the u s were well on their way to becoming massive conduits of paper backed by this nation s home mortgages beginning in the late 80s private banking operations such as merrill lynch and bear stearns began buying and securitizing single family residential mortgages it was very profitable for the producers and exceptionally attractive to investors for the perception was that there simply was no investment that could compare to these securities in safety and yield this view was underscored by the reputation of fannie and freddie which was so solid that regulators actually permitted insured financial institutions banks thrifts and credit unions to count the stock of the two enterprises as cash on an institution s balance sheet the worldwide appetite for u s mortgage backed securities was ravenous and all hands turned out to satisfy the hunger including fannie and freddie it didn t really take very long for the banking business to drive off the bridge only about 21 years separated the s l debacle from the 2008 crash exactly the same time between the two world wars as in the case of the thrift implosion the cause of the great meltdown was just too much money on the table always the major underlying illness that puts banking on a ventilator and eventually into oblivion but this time the money people and adjunct professionals such as realtors appraisers and loan originators had help borrowers that s right there was so much loot available for the taking that homeowners got into the act and became unindicted co conspirators next the great meltdown proving that we americans can achieve almost anything when we work together don t miss the grand finale pat dalrymple is a western colorado native and has spent more than 50 years in mortgage lending and banking in the roaring fork valley he ll be happy to answer your questions

subsidiary of china energy conservation and environmental protection group cecep china jinmao holdings subsidiary jinmao capital and china taiping insurance singapore ctx backed by the us 2 billion asia green fund said its cnts will pave the way for carbon credits to be transferred across international borders this has not been possible due to protracted disagreements among signatories to the paris agreement on article 6 of the landmark pact on climate change article 6 sets out rules for the workings of a global carbon market under the paris agreement countries have pledged to meet their nationally determined contributions ndcs within a timeframe and in a manner they are sovereignly determined the ndcs comprise emission reduction targets policies and measures to mitigate climate

system dr bai bo co founder and executive chairman of ctx said we are excited with the responses we have been getting from prospective issuers since we unveiled ctx two months ago they saw the innovation behind our cnt and how it can involve the international community in helping pollutive industries reduce their emissions in a sustainable manner we were able to engender trust at a time when the crypto market was going through uncertainties because ctx is regulated by the monetary authority of singapore and built on the robust trading and market surveillance technologies of nasdaq dr bai added that ctx s mission is to promote green investing using blockchain and digital twin technologies and it will continue to invest in research and development to that end ctx s carbon neutrality token contains shared carbon information including emission records and tracing carbon offsetting carbon capture storage and reuse citing an example in china dr bo said a green infrastructure owner can participate by getting its carbon voluntary emission reduction ver verified by a 3rd party ngo agency like bureau veritas it then permanently freezes its ver certificates with the country s national carbon registry in singapore where ctx is based a non fungible digital twin of the asset or ver is created and the information embedded on the carbon neutrality token which is then traded through the ctx exchange by international investors with the carbon information tracked in the tokens issuers and investors can have visibility of the carbon footprint or lack thereof of their production activities and investment portfolios this will help them to align their fundraising and investing activities with their commitment to promote sustainable business practices dr bai disclosed that ctx is also in talks with institutions in europe and north america to issue tokens on its exchange chinese backed tokens will initially be dominant because of the size of its carbon credits

if you want to go to space call the russians chinese or the indians anyone but the us government as it is out of that business or instead call one of the three rocket men who can actually deliver and little rocket man north korea s kim jung un is not one of them three multi multi billionaires two americans and one brit are the current space pioneers jeff bezos founder of amazon and worth well over 100 billion started his blue origin space company in 2000 richard branson knighted by the queen in 2000 for entrepreneurship started his space company virgin galactica an extension of his virgin records airlines and rail four years later and elon musk founder and owner of tesla cars started space x also in 2004 of the three branson was the first in space with unity 22 a rocket launched from a mother ship reaching some 50 miles above earth last week bezos lifts off shortly and may have already travelled 60 miles above the earth in his craft named new shepard for astronaut alan shepard when this column is published presumably musk will follow suit all three have invested at least 100 million as a start up each company has received private equity investment and substantial support from nasa bezos has seeded some 500 million and has pledged to put up a billion dollars a year from his amazon stock each of the rocket men is betting that commercial space travel even for a few minutes will attract sufficient passengers to be successful musk has developed four designs falcon falcon 9 the world s heaviest rocket with the power equal to 18 747 s with payloads of sufficient capacity both for building in space and transporting back whatever raw materials space exploration may find dragon and starship likewise bezos and branson are developing follow on space vehicles while no comparisons exist and clearly these three companies were totally dependent on the prior work done by nasa in their race to the moon it would appear that private capital has been more efficient and less costly than the money spent by the us government on space with the success of these space companies so far perhaps privatising research and development might prove fruitful to date the success of these rocket men raises several questions can these endeavours replace the government in space will these companies be financially viable or as with other fads from the tulip frenzy in the early 17th century to the dot com bust four hundred years later will this turn out to be billionaires whimsies perhaps more importantly if at least one of these companies succeeds does this suggest that government might turn over more responsibilities to the private sector if yes who might be future candidates privatising many aspects of government has been tried including hybrid organisations such as the federal national mortgage association fanniemae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddiemac according to the law fannie was created in 1938 and freddie in 1970 by the us government to help ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funds throughout the country both are shareholder owned companies operating under a federal charter but each has often been criticised for shortcomings similarly a number of penitentiaries have been privatised with very mixed success each of the departments of the government has attempted to privatise certain functions in an effort to reduce costs and improve efficiency the record here has not always been good but with the success of these space companies so far perhaps privatising research and development might prove fruitful operation warp speed produced three vaccines for covid 19 in an extraordinarily short time of less than a year because of the private sector given the revolution in military technologies perhaps privatising the defense advanced research agency darpa might be one such idea government would sell or assign the rights to this new company and provide the r and d funding as well as priority lists for research here the entity could acquire shares in the companies being funded acting as a de facto private equity firm but with the us government being an equal partner if the technologies were successful in essence the government would be rewarded if the companies went public and were in turn acquired by a larger entity or were profitable meaning costs to the taxpayer would be reduced and the entity owning darpa would pay an annual fee for the rights indeed the only likely way to close the huge gap between defence needs and budgets would be to emulate the success of these rocket men in privatising space the writer is a senior advisor at washington dc s atlantic council and a published author

singapore july 25 2021 prnewswire cyberdyne tech exchange ctx said today that its digital exchange will soon debut cross border trading of its proprietary carbon neutrality tokens cnts to be backed by the carbon credits of china the world s largest carbon market ctx has signed memoranda of understanding mou with three chinese entities to issue and facilitate the issuance of cnts backed by carbon credits green infrastructure and real estate projects and insurance products packaged as collective investment schemes under singapore s regulatory regime cnts patent pending are digital representations of one ton of carbon credits the latter are tradeable certificates that allow its holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases companies with any unneeded credits may sell them to others that need them or they can pay for green projects elsewhere to offset their own emissions the three chinese entities are cecep green carbon investment and development co a subsidiary of china energy conservation and environmental protection group cecep china jinmao holdings subsidiary jinmao capital and china taiping insurance singapore ctx backed by the us 2 billion asia green fund said its cnts will pave the way for carbon credits to be transferred across international borders this has not been possible due to protracted disagreements among signatories to the paris agreement on article 6 of the landmark pact on climate change article 6 sets out rules for the workings of a global carbon market under the paris agreement countries have pledged to meet their nationally determined contributions ndcs within a timeframe and in a manner they are sovereignly determined the ndcs comprise emission reduction targets policies and measures to mitigate climate change the article 6 dispute has mostly centred on how to avoid the double counting of internationally traded carbon offsets as well as whether to transfer pre 2021 issued credits to the new offset system dr bai bo co founder and executive chairman of ctx said we are excited with the responses we have been getting from prospective issuers since we unveiled ctx two months ago they saw the innovation behind our cnt and how it can involve the international community in helping pollutive industries reduce their emissions in a sustainable manner we were able to engender trust at a time when the crypto market was going through uncertainties because ctx is regulated by the monetary authority of singapore and built on the robust trading and market surveillance technologies of nasdaq dr bai added that ctx s mission is to promote green investing using blockchain and digital twin technologies and it will continue to invest in research and development to that end ctx s carbon neutrality token contains shared carbon information including emission records and tracing carbon offsetting carbon capture storage and reuse citing an example in china dr bo said a green infrastructure owner can participate by getting its carbon voluntary emission reduction ver verified by a 3rd party ngo agency like bureau veritas it then permanently freezes its ver certificates with the country s national carbon registry in singapore where ctx is based a non fungible digital twin of the asset or ver is created and the information embedded on the carbon neutrality token which is then traded through the ctx exchange by international investors with the carbon information tracked in the tokens issuers and investors can have visibility of the carbon footprint or lack thereof of their production activities and investment portfolios this will help them to align their fundraising and investing activities with their commitment to promote sustainable business practices dr bai disclosed that ctx is also in talks with institutions in europe and north america to issue tokens on its exchange chinese backed tokens will initially be dominant because of the size of its carbon credits

washington a space transportation company trying to go public didn t tell potential investors that its satellite hauling technology failed that it lost contact with a satellite in space and that its russian founder had been deemed a national security risk by the u s government the securities and exchange commission said had the company momentus inc filed for a traditional initial public offering the bankers working on the deal could be liable for any misleading statements to investors but it didn t it is attempting to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company a route that doesn t require bankers to do full due diligence on the business breaking into public markets while spacs are hot it is a route the sec is trying to curb the commission accused momentus and its founder of fraud and its spac partner of negligence for not ferreting out the problems and disclosing them in regulatory filings and investor materials nasa hands spacex contract for first mission to jupiter s moon europa those who stand to earn significant profits from a spac merger may conduct inadequate due diligence and mislead investors sec chairman gary gensler warned in announcing an enforcement action earlier this month that included a settlement order momentus agreed to pay 7 million and the spac stable road acquisition corp srac 0 97 agreed to pay 1 million to settle the sec probe the agency said the resolution didn t require the companies to admit wrongdoing the sec also sued the founder of momentus the russian entrepreneur mikhail kokorich in federal court kokorich denies the sec s allegations that he misled investors and his spac partner and believes his position will be vindicated said his attorney thomas gorman momentus said it is pleased to be closing this chapter and looks forward to going public and providing value to shareholders an attorney for stable road didn t respond to requests for comment the company in a recent regulatory filing said it conducted extensive due diligence on momentus s finances technology and intellectual property in a traditional ipo bankers lawyers and accountants exhaustively research the listing company examining records to verify statements made to investors with a traditional ipo the investment bank is involved and it has to do thorough due diligence said georges ugeux a lecturer at columbia law school and a former executive at the new york stock exchange spacs are supposed to conduct due diligence in mergers he said adding it s not going to be as thorough spacs raise capital list on exchanges and then find merger targets a spac typically has two years to complete an acquisition or it must return the cash to shareholders creating an incentive to get a deal done stable road has until august to complete the merger with momentus the investment bank evercore inc advised momentus on its financial projections and negotiations with stable road evercore s role was akin to the job a bank plays in a merger providing financial advice to a company that is being acquired ugeux said an evercore spokesman declined to comment faa says jeff bezos not an astronaut based on new criteria stable road s founders initially considered cannabis companies when they began hunting for a startup to take public they launched talks with momentus initially valued at 1 8 billion in july 2020 according to

it plans to have spacex rockets carry momentus s smaller transport vehicles into space according to the presentation and regulatory filings lockheed is no longer a customer according to momentus its propulsion technology to carry satellites from rockets and place them into orbit was unproven and a test in 2019 wasn t successful under the company s criteria with the company losing contact with a demonstration satellite which remains in space the sec said a russian soyuz rocket carried the momentus thruster into space according to momentus the company told investors after the demonstration that it had been successful the sec said stable road didn t start its review of momentus until a month before the merger was announced in october 2020 and a consultant hired by stable road to review momentus s technology didn t evaluate the result of the test mission the sec said kokorich who founded the space company in 2017 also misled investors and stable road about his national security

after consulting the defense and state departments because he was not an acceptable recipient of the technology for national security reasons the sec said the sec filing didn t elaborate on the commerce department s decision a month later the committee on foreign investment in the u s a multiagency panel that screens deals for national security risks flagged kokorich s investment in a different space company and later suggested that he divest his stake citing the sophistication of the company s technology and unspecified concerns about him and other investors the lawsuit said u s

to be sure partition itself was the product of a utopic plan enacting enlightenment notions about the rational ordering of society it promised to produce order out of a religiously and linguistically mixed society it promised a homeland to those out of place in nationalist india many who moved did so out of faith in this project out of conviction at times against the wishes of their families most famously jinnah s only daughter did not move indeed the deliberate sacrifice of home and bonds was the price that made the result participation in the creation of a new nation state all the more sacred see oral histories in anam zakaria footprints of partition on pakistan as a utopian ideal see also gyanendra pandey remembering partition the poet credited with launching the pakistan movement muhammad iqbal was shaped by education in germany and britain among his closest friends in lahore from 1932 was muhammad asad the austro hungarian jew who opposed zionism but supported the creation of a muslim state in south asia he had been an advisor to abdul aziz ibn saud in the 1920s one of that world of european spies in arabia i described in my first book like them he collapsed the tasks of reinventing the middle east and himself he would go on to shape pakistan s constitution and head the middle east division of its ministry of foreign affairs my point in invoking asad is to highlight the cosmopolitan intellectual context in which the idea of pakistan took shape however much it was also about the local mission of saving muslims from domination by non muslims enlightenment and romantic notions are dialectically related in this intellectual history i am merely skimming the surface here focusing on the chain of influences and sociological bonds to offer a sense of the global production and payoff of these ideas over time up to our present as we shall see in promising a national homeland for south asia s muslims iqbal s pakistan also tried to move beyond nationalism it was utopic in that ambition too like tagore iqbal denounced the european modernity exposed on the western front the way competitive nationalism produced militarism imperialism and indifference to religion his call for pakistan was intended as a critique of nationalism and an important first step towards a post nationalistic postwar world muslim political autonomy would foster in one place a less divided and exploitative society on the basis of an islamic moral system that would serve muslims and non muslims alike his notions of the unity of islam were authentically his but also shaped by romantic orientalist notions he absorbed in europe barbara metcalf husain ahmad madani the jihad for islam and india s freedom muhammad iqbal photo credit walikhanphotography via wikimedia commons was partition inevitable indeed although we take partition as synonymous with the mass migration it entailed mass migration was not part of the plan even as late as the early 1940s the idea was rather to create autonomous muslim majority areas in which hindus and sikhs would remain while muslims would remain in areas in which they were minorities then came the idea of splitting muslim majority provinces the idea of mass eviction and migration only came in march 1947 when riots in rawalpindi enforced the notion that minorities did not belong in the lands that had now been designated muslim or non muslim pandey in the 1930s iqbal was thinking outside the box of nationalism whatever the ironic appropriation of his goal for nationalistic purposes the india that was to result from the creation of pakistan was also imagined through the lens of modern rationality even indians who regret partition speak approvingly of a purer nation formed through the sacrifice of dismemberment the journalist alpana kishore argues that without partition india would have gone on wrestling with an unresolved demand for a muslim nation state it would have been haunted by the spectre of partition and the very different vision of national development embraced by pakistan s founders zakaria this recalls br ambedkar s views on pakistan he too was an anti colonial thinker who was simultaneously critical of the nation state yet he saw partition as unavoidable once the demand had been raised and given his own notions of muslim difference to refuse it would simply endanger the new republic with the constant threat of civil war ambedkar thoughts on pakistan 1941 pakistan or partition of india 1944 aishwary kumar radical equality ambedkar gandhi and the risk of democracy arguably in the end partition has haunted india anyway but besides these rationalist idealist visions of a postcolonial pakistan and india other utopic visions were also available for a time some saw an equally post nationalist utopic prospect in the challenge of unifying a subcontinent that they acknowledged was divided the poet mohammad ali jauhar emerged as a leader of the khilafat movement as president of the congress party in 1923 he said i had long been convinced that here in this country of hundreds of millions of human beings intensely attached to religion and yet infinitely split up into communities sects and denominations providence had created for us the mission of solving a unique problem and working out a new synthesis which was nothing low than a federation of faiths for more than twenty years i have dreamed the dream of a federation grander nobler and infinitely more spiritual than the united states of america and today when many a political cassandra prophesies a return to the bad old days of hindu muslim dissensions i still dream that old dream of united faiths of india mohamed ali jauhar 1923 reproduced in sources of indian tradition modern india pakistan and bangladesh like mohani and bismil he became disillusioned with congress and gandhi s leadership in the early 1920s he attended the first round table conference in london in 1930 31 gandhi attended the one later in 1931 visiting the thompsons while there he died in england and was buried in jerusalem at his own request would he have remained in india or moved to pakistan in 1947 or later or would his survival have made his utopic dream a more viable possibility mohammad ali jauhar photo credit public domain via wikimedia commons lost utopia others perceived a different utopia the idea of an india that possessed an inherent unity even in its diversity that was a single nation which partition violated maulana husain ahmad madani leader of the jamiat ulema e hind the senior party of indian ulema saw imperialism as the disrupter of religiously plural societies that had their own integrity iqbal argued that it severed ethnically distinct muslims who might otherwise have been united around their shared religion aamir mufti enlightenment in the colony metcalf much indian historical writing is in this vein and has found it difficult to escape the obligation to demonstrate that oneness this is partly because apart from the ambedkar approach it was difficult for indians to read partition as anything but loss pakistanis however nostalgic could at least pin hope on the strength of having created something new to some pakistanis india is a dreamlike homeland an origin story more than a land from which they are exiled zakaria still many survivors of partition on both sides recall untroubled pre partition times marked by inter communal harmony at times for elites from cosmopolitan settings nostalgia for the raj is part of this mix at times joint resistance to it at times the unionist party s popularity under sir sikander hyat khan a close associate of sir syed ahmad khan in the 1930s is recalled as proof of the existence of a culturally and politically unified punjab betrayed by higher politicians at other times its social conservatism and loyalty to the raj recalled as liabilities even though the pressure of maintaining that unity against the competing forces of the league congress and the british was probably what killed sikander hyat khan in december 1946 we have no way of gauging the accuracy of memories untroubled pre partition harmony but as anam zakaria and other collectors of oral histories note memory and how people choose to remember certain events is as important as historical facts themselves zakaria indeed some memories were shaped by dismay at the violent change partition wrought even those who did not move witnessed the destruction of their communities and the arrival of new tormented faces a transformation that made some see the struggle as a waste at the same time that the pakistani state whitewashes sikh history in punjab literally in the case of the frescoes at the entrance of the dera sahab complex in lahore we hear of pakistanis who miss diwali and eastern punjabis who miss eid nadhra khan lahore revisited the city and its nineteenth century guidebook lecture it is true that many communities have coexisted in india and that partition included many acts of inter communal kindness but equally true is the fact that in the end congress agreed to partition and that since 1947 the community has again and again been constituted through violence in india impossible facts for those committed to the notion of an eternally unified india betrayed only by jinnah and the muslim league as pandey notes violence did not accompany partition it was constitutive of it see also mufti enlightenment in the colony cross border exchanges but apart from nostalgia for a lost utopia even after partition many imagined the possibility for a unique international friendship between the two nations in which the border was in fact a bridge permitting connection and communication deferrals or reversals of the decision to stay or move indicated by late departure or ongoing maintenance of bi national existence for business and family reasons are perhaps most symptomatic of this outlook they represent a willful and wishful belief in the prerogative to remain locally and privately rather than nationally embedded as long as it was practicable it was certainly not obvious that partition would mean total severance of connection and in fact many crossed legally without much obstruction until the 1965 war border communities continued to engage in common celebrations of baisakhi others crossed illegally between bordering villages like germans in the early years of the cold war a refugee special train at ambala station during the partition photo credit photo division government of india zakaria s collection of oral histories includes the poignant case of muhammad boota who repeatedly crossed from his adopted village in pakistan into his old village in indian punjab to search for a sikh girl he had loved as in the great qissas romantic epics like waris shah s he never found her but remained devoted to her zakaria see also the story of ghulam ali in zamindar long partition the border became more clearly demarcated and impassable after the wars of 1965 and 1971 but even then through 1986 no line or wire demarcated the border near kasur villages and people crossed accidentally zakaria finally and perhaps most importantly there was the utopic belief that borders did not change anything even when they became impassable that an un severable regional unity transcends the experience and fact of partition here it is crucial to remember that the indian and pakistani dream for nation statehood was fulfilled in a moment in which the entire system of nation states was in severe crisis with displaced minorities emerging in west asia and europe mufti notes that nationalism has historically been a great disrupter of social and cultural relations setting forth an entire dynamic of inclusion and exclusion within the very social formation that it claims as uniquely its own and with which it declares itself identical by rendering some part of that formation as minority it renders that group potentially movable thus it has historically been a force for violent displacement enlightenment in the colony this context shaped calls to rise above both nationalism and borders incomplete pursuit maulana azad who tried his hand at poetry too in his younger days insisted even after partition on the existence of a composite culture shared among all and possessing secular and cosmopolitan dimensions he was a nationalist in the sense of believing in the reality of an indian nation that could stand independently of british rule but also grasped the dangers nationalism produced for minorities his solution was to refuse politics based on fear to refuse to fear for the fate of a muslim minority in independent india and to refuse the very notion of a muslim minority this leap of faith marks the secularism of azad s public life explains aamir mufti he articulated this complex vision in a speech in october 1947 in jama masjid in delhi which persuaded many muslims there to stay just when nationalism was violently reorganising the region into new nation states those who articulated such visions at once perceived their vulnerability their increasingly outdated utopian nature they knew that refusing nationalism s disruption of pluralism was its own kind of madness reminiscent of bishan singh s stubborn attachment to the no man s land of saadat hasan manto s toba tek singh but while manto s story encapsulated that madness in a dark chekhovian manner such madness found a different kind of sanction in the urdu poetic tradition where it seemed less the breakdown of reason than the typically hopeless but no longer melancholic or politically passive idealism of the poetic subject the lover they were the farzaane learned wise men who double as deewane mad inspired men in jagannath azad s ghazal titled 15 august 1947 na puchho jab bahar aayi to deewanon pe kya guzari zara dekho ki is mausam mein farzaanon pe kya guzari don t ask what befell the mad the lovers when spring came just look at what befell the wise in this season with the plural deewane the sher embraces the world of azad s fellow poets his friends as the losers of this history and indeed the friendship among poets was one critical way in which the border was rendered meaningless at least for some especially those who chose to see it as a temporary inconvenience on the way to a future goal that they knew would transcend all borders while faiz continued his political and poetic pursuits in pakistan his friend makhdoom mohiuddin of hyderabad pursued poetry lyric writing for the film industry labour activism communist party of india leadership trades union activism and activities with the progressive writers association and indian people s theatre association and was a primary leader of the telangana rebellion from 1946 50 the rebellion of peasants against telangana landlords and the nizam of hyderabad he also inaugurated the short lived paritala republic jailed in 1951 like faiz in pakistan he wrote the poem qaid imprisonment on his release he fought elections and joined parliament participating in the national political process as a member of the communist party of india for these poet activists partition was a tragic yet transient event in a long struggle for far more radical ends it was inconclusive and their agreement on that across the border their continued solidarity was a mutual affirmation when makhdoom died in 1969 faiz composed a poetic homage adapting his friend s celebrated ghazal aap ki yaad aati rahi raat bhar both versions can be read on multiple levels as all ghazals but let me offer a suggestive reading of the maqta last verse in each makhdoom s ended koi deewaana galiyon mein phirta raha koi awaaz aati rahi raat bhar evoking the eternal beckoning of some ideal in the darkness towards which the poet as agent of history fumbles perhaps never reaching it it is at once near yet out of reach faiz s version ended ek umeed se dil behelta raha ek tamanna sataati rahi raat bhar evoking the desire for communion with a friend who is now impossibly far in classic sufi fashion but also perhaps a memory of their shared incomplete pursuit the soothingly idealistic hope for a more humane future that is simultaneously agitating despite our knowledge that it is ideal and thus unachievable the journey continues for those entangled in this border transgressing literary and political community partition was not a stopping ground it could not be allowed to become a stopping ground as faiz wrote reflecting on 1947 in 1951 chale chalo ki woh manzil abhi nahi aayi faiz ahmad faiz photo credit amarjit chandan via wikimedia commons to be sure the notion of a long joint journey ahead despite borders was also a mechanism for coping with the actual trauma of partition which faiz genuinely felt he considered it too big to cope with in poetry apart from his attempt in that 1951 poem subah e azadi freedom s dawn although in allusive ways he did in other works too i believe rakhshanda jalil liking progress faiz did not think he wrote about partition beyond this 1951 poem one might reasonably interpret this indifference to borders as a form of denial as fantasy arguably works like toba tek singh engaged in precisely such fantasy as literary form whatever manto s commitments to social realism fantasy is a departure from consensus reality in the words of one literary scholar kathryn hume fantasy and mimesis responses to reality in western literature quoted in karline mclain the fantastic as frontier realism the fantastic and transgression in mid twentieth century urdu fiction annual of urdu studies 16 and belief in the immateriality of the border was a departure from the consensus reality of pakistani and indian nation statehood more than fantasy however it was romance as articulated clearly in faiz and makhdoom s couplets above the unattainable end utopia itself was a reworking of birha in its own way as was the experience of partition itself poets aloofness from partition helps explain why post partition urdu poetry continued to invoke extra national geography the leftist pakistani poet ibn e insha born in jalandhar in 1927 composed tu kahan chali gayi thi where had you gone in the 1950s gesturing with equal ease towards karachi and delhi nazir qaiser s poetry is as ecumenical in its geography shiv kumar batalvi often referred to as punjab s byron drew on the ancient epic about puran bhagat of sialkot for his epic verse play loona in 1965 jagannath azad came to india but his poetry dwelled on memories of his homeland his lost chaman garden while in pakistan on his first post partition visit in 1948 he wrote the celebrated couplet main apne ghar mein aaya hoon magar andaaz to dekho ke apne aap ko manind e mehman leke aaya hoon it remained his home alienated as he was he was still not a guest but guest like he was split into both host and guest at once at home and not at home desi and pardesi divided selves pakistani poets also continued to reach for the non islamic but idols and puja worship implying idol worship on which the ironic idiom of urdu poetry depends despite the vanishing ghostlike presence of such things in their midst indeed in a sense the entire indo islamic poetic tradition presumes a world of muslims coexisting with non muslims to dramatise the ironies of worldly and unworldly faith at its core sikh identity markers similarly presume a mixed social context else why the need for distinguishing markers this literary transcendence of partition mirrored socio cultural continuities such as the celebrations of indian festivals among pakistanis near the border riyaz wani interview with anam zakaria as zakaria notes even those who left out of conviction felt a bond with the home they abandoned because of ongoing relationships and memories there is no clear line for these people it is difficult to decipher what they love more where they belong more this confusion is the only truth for them zakaria if the goal was a coherent national self the result was a population of divided selves the exile the refugee the orphaned the converted the abducted and reclaimed all these survivors were in different ways split in many cases violently split even shredded selves permit me a metaphor from physics in quantum theory the uncertain non deterministic smeared nature of electrons helps explain the stability of atoms similarly the stability of south asian identity depends on a kind of indeterminacy punjabis in particular seem smeared through space nations are like the impossibly rigid atomic structures of classical mechanics they cannot contain such uncertainty makhdoom and faiz were both literally in captivity in independent india and pakistan in 1951 meaning of partition gyanendra pandey calls on historians to explore the meaning of partition in terms of what it produced the social arrangements forms of consciousness subjectivities it created rather than focusing obsessively on causes a focus betraying indian historians commitments to particular utopic visions of india pandey remembering partition curiously as rakhshanda jalil notes urdu poets focus more on the consequences of partition than its causes jalil to me their preoccupation with effects reveals their sense of the epiphenomenal and possibly transient nature of partition their preoccupation with other utopias unfinished business that partition traumatically disrupted pandey might find in poetry if not historical writing the earliest analysis of what partition did to subjectivity and consciousness quite apart from the human destruction it unleashed here again we find intriguing intersections with shifting subjectivities in europe enlightenment notions of a coherent rational self had long since smothered notions of an internally split self among europeans early versions of adam smith s theory of moral sentiments had described a divided or doubled self which became more metaphorical and less literal in later versions once the notion of an individuated internally coherent modern self took hold in the late 18th century see dror wahrman the making of the modern self identity and culture in eighteenth century england the turn of the twentieth century saw new testing of this concept most conspicuously in metropolitan occultist circles who experimented with the relationship of self to other albeit now locating the split internally in the psychology and neurobiology of the individual rather than in the operation of social claims on the individual theosophists were part of this cultural world most notably annie besant whose journey from turn of the century british socialism she famously led the matchgirl strike in london in 1888 to a prominent leader in the indian nationalist movement was inseparable from her explorations of spirituality and selfhood judith walkowitz city of dreadful delight narratives of sexual danger in late victorian london annie besant photo credit wikimedia commons public domain she too was mixed up in the world of poet activists joining the poet sarojini naidu in representing in london the case for indian women to vote naidu was a bengali from hyderabad who joined the national movement after the 1905 partition of bengal and became the second woman to preside over congress after besant she was governor of the united provinces of agra and oudh in 1947 49 when urdu poets there deliberated staying or going longing for union now the subject of urdu poetry had long been understood as split this was what sufi longing for the union was about momin s much loved couplet is exemplary tum mere paas hote ho goya jab koi doosra nahin hota in true mystic union the self becomes extinct this idiom seems ready made to address the post partition condition of a partial parted or divided self urdu as a poetic language figured critically in the articulation of this subjectivity as mufti shows in his beautiful analysis of faiz s poetry indianness has come to encompass the disavowal of indianness like the electron that both is and is not mufti cites paradigmatically faiz s marsia elegy from a 1971 collection dur ja kar qarib ho jitney ham se kab qarib the itne ab na aoge tum na jaoge vasl o hijran baham hue kitne in this four line poem mufti perceives a dialectic of self and other in which the subject and object of desire do not so much become one but simultaneously come near and become distant and are rendered uncertain it recalls zakaria s story of a man in a pakistani village who daily sees his old village across the border it is at once near and far zakaria a similar phenomenon transpires on the german border towns edith sheffer describes in burned bridge this is the reality of modern punjabi subjectivity contradictory tense antagonistic faiz s grasp of this dialectically produced self clearly resonated his work has remained phenomenally popular across the region as mufti explains he articulated an indian experience of the self that took division seriously and yet transcended borders and communal and national divides much as he tried to do in his own literary and political commitments after all he worked within an idiom in which indefinite separation from the beloved was the only ground from which to contemplate union he subversively renders the abandoned home as the beloved rather than a heathen land virtuously abandoned inverting the religious interpretation of partition as hijrat in the sense of the holy prophet s flight from mecca to medina urdu could uniquely convey the reality of this split self nurtured in pakistan where it was cut off from its homelands in delhi the deccan and uttar pradesh where urdu s status simultaneously declined poets worldly experience of exile and refuge gave hijr separation departure a range of new secular connotations notes mufti mufti faiz s agonistic embrace of that inheritance is a south asian expression of modernity at once reminding us of the worldly basis of religious experience itself what early punjabi romances expressed as allegory or in the language of the punjabi tappa folk lyric milna taan rab nu hai tera pyaar bahaana hai for long poets have grasped the instrumental nature of the worldly experience for the sake of higher spiritual experience the persistence of that mystical idiom and the love successive generations profess for it reveals the continued intimacy of the secular modern self with its religious inheritance in this too modern south asian subjectivity senses its incompleteness its exilic existence on this see also mufti this is not a uniquely south asian quality of course see for instance thomas laqueur the work of the dead a cultural history of mortal remains in short we cannot think of post partition identity only in the terms of the normalised vocabulary of the new nation states presuming autonomous national selves based on the european template progressive writers attached to such requirements of normality were the kind who mufti speculates suddenly turned against manto whose work and affect fell beyond that pale mufti manto was disowned by the pakistani marxist leaning literary set charged with obscenity he avoided his sentence of prison with hard labour on appeal the possibility of transcending national identity within oneself is powerful for ep thompson in scott s luminous interpretation again poetry s role was to leaven politics with imagination to suggest a middle ground between disenchantment with perfectionist illusions and complete apostasy that ground is the demanding yet a creative place of continuing aspiration joan scott gender and the politics of history the work of continuing aspiration is the work of azad s deewane the split south asian self is the middle ground poets gave us between disenchantment and apostasy it is beckett s i can t go on i ll go on and gramsci s mantra like pessimism of the intellect optimism of the will the left and poetry the new left that thompson helped form in england after the soviet invasion of hungary in 1956 attracted the communist atheist and anti imperialist pakistani tariq ali the grandson of sikandar hayat khan and an important interlocutor of edward said another deep thinker about exile and anti colonialism who met faiz in beirut ali s anti imperialist critiques were as globally sweeping as faiz s poetry about chile palestine namibia and the rosenbergs talal asad son of muhammad asad has emerged as a major thinker about religion and secularism the chain of inheritance and restless continuing aspiration is long thompson came to india for the first time in 1976 after our poets alternative visions had long expired he was warmly welcomed by indira gandhi and her government in acknowledgement of the friendship between their fathers but it was the time of indira s emergency he was horrified by the government s repression of dissent and by the communist party of india s support of it and noted the strange convergence of western modernising theory with orthodox moscow directed socialist theory both imagined a modern urban intellectual elite with know how imposing modernity and progress upon the nation both prioritised top down capital intensive technologically driven developments depending on a disciplined workforce for national economic take off through a vulgar ie un poetic economic determinism marxism echoed utilitarian and positivist ideas scott hamilton the crisis of theory ep thompson the new left and postwar british politics hamilton s 2007 talk at the history department of the university of auckland politics without poetry is lifeless and poetry without politics tends to the self indulgent it is the same in pakistan i was fortunate enough to meet jazib qureshi in 2016 2021 note he has sadly just passed away through the genius of the bay area s urdu academy and he commented on the absence of poets of real standing in today s pakistan no one to fill the shoes of josh or iqbal if modern urdu poetry evolved as critique of empire and nation it is no surprise that as the left has crumbled so has poetry s most powerfully transcendent function modi s india is bent on suffocating the left further india s poets are returning their national awards in the face of the government s thuggish attacks on dissent of all kinds rediscovering their role in history and outside exclusionist mainstream nationalism see david barstow and suhasini raj indian writers spurn awards as violence flares new york times as we continue to look to technology to save us despite the unending disasters that pile up before our eyes it is time perhaps to revisit and reinvent the possibility and promise of poetic action non normative identity poetry is a social and collective endeavour the writer alone cannot make poetry or poetic action in urdu poetry the reader identifies entirely with the first person voice of the poet the poet s place in history becomes the reader s too this possibility for such total identification for a kind of subsumption in the poet is astonishingly universal i identify with the hum collective and first person subject of faiz s poetry even though on the face of it i am a woman a hindu and an indian punjabi where he was a man a muslim and a pakistani punjabi urdu poetry is queer in this sense a space of non normative identity and politics and yet it could not attend to the plight of heer when jagannath azad was leaving pakistan after a visit to return to india muhammad tufail editor of the pakistani progressive literary journal nuqush took sweets to him at the station quipping tumhein to yun rukhsat karte hain jaise beti ko rukhsat kiya jaata hai i thank hamida chopra for sharing this story instead of separation from a beloved of unspecified gender he rendered azad s exile from his homeland in the more clearly gendered form of the daughter leaving her parents home to join her new family after marriage a rite common to hindu sikh and muslim weddings in the region playing on the land as mother trope the departure becomes forward looking a rite of passage to adulthood progress itself it is more final than the beloved s separation but also less rigid in that a girl can and does go back to her old home at times albeit to be indulged as a guest with few substantive entitlements but tufail s line also reminds us that however vaguely gendered the poetic terms in which faiz and others wrote about it partition s violence was deeply gendered amrita pritam s plea to waris shah and manto s stories like khol do open it acknowledged that reality so too has scholarly work on partition by urvashi butalia ritu menon kamla bhasin veena das and others they diagnose the complicity of the two new states in appropriating the violence that was done to women within an ideology of community and nation amrita pritam photo credit amarjit chandan via wikimedia commons cc by sa 4 0 shiv kumar batalvi born in 1936 may have been activated by such themes in his recuperation of women s agency and sexuality in loona his celebrated retelling of the ancient epic of puran bhagat in 1965 stylistically he was influenced by the qissas as well as european epic poetry the legend goes that the sialkot prince puran bhagat spurned the advances of his young stepmother loona a sinfully lustful seductress who wreaked violent revenge his arms and legs were amputated and he wound up exiled from his home becoming an ascetic who later forgave and blessed his punishers but batalvi tells the story from loona s point of view the disgust of this lower caste young girl from chamba at being married to an old king against her wishes her entirely reasonable desire to be with a man her own age puran s rejection of her out of suspicion of the merely sexual rather than spiritual nature of her attraction and her self sacrificial revenge for her destruction of puran is her own too she knows she will live in infamy for it but hopes that her infamy might prevent society from producing forcing future loonas to marry against their will having borne the blame for puran s death for centuries loona finally finds peace in batalvi s play known for his passionate expression of the agony of separated lovers here batalvi redeems worldly love and the rebellion of youth for more on loona see sa soza shiv kumar batalvi here the punishing violence of partition is visited on a male body with puran s dismemberment and exile in blaming society rather than loona for this tragic outcome batalvi at once exonerates the individual perpetrator of violence whatever her gender while validating all punjabi women s need and desire for such revenge he renders the punjabi subject of history as female notably he published this earthily punjabi work on the eve of the repartitioning of indian punjab on linguistic lines when other punjabi hindus claimed hindi rather than punjabi as their mother tongue a choice made possible by the longstanding elision of hindi with urdu loona was the patakha guddi firecracker kite of her time a song penned by the poet irshad kamil a muslim from malerkotla in indian punjab and sung by jyoti and sultana nooran punjabi muslims from jalandhar composed by ar rahman for imitiaz ali s film highway she is the poet of her own destiny she lives her contradiction as a means of superseding loss a way of living as if in exile even when at home as maulana azad felt he did given his particular background and education and relationship to muslim and nationalist politics in his time on azad see mufti certainly it is also a luxury of class modern urdu writing having displaced the relationship of language and self to place as mufti tells us is a vehicle for exilic thinking an awareness wherever one happens to be that modern history has been one of marginalisation and uprooting on a massive scale that split selfhoods are typical in south asia but also in germany the balkans cyprus palestine israel ireland and elsewhere mufti what is the poet s role in history of course the question is romantic byron was romantic thompson was romantic faiz was romantic punjabis are romantic land is romantic and romanticism has its dangers the british were romantic nehru was romantic silicon valley is a romance dams and drones are romantic the hindu right and the islamic right offer romances of their own there is a marketplace of romance but the romance of the left has too long been out of stock bollywood cannot do it alone and it too after all is bound up in

dubai will dr b r shetty win it in the us more specifically in a new york court of law where he has sought damages totalling more than 7 billion against his former audit firm banks and senior executives of abu dhabi headquartered nmc health the uae exchange centre and neopharma a pharmaceutical business that he owns informed sources in the uae who had dealt with shetty in the past are baffled that he has taken on a legal battle in the us despite being involved in sundry legal issues in the uae in the uk courts and in india his assets are under freeze through various court orders and he remains stuck in india despite repeatedly announcing that he wants to fly back to the uae to clear his name it s interesting that shetty has sought damages of 7 billion plus which is more or less the same amount that was siphoned off from nmc s books while he was holding senior positions in the healthcare group said a senior banker closely involved in the rescue act that the hospital operator went through since april 2020 after finding that loans taken from the banks were never reported in the books the financial misdeeds happened in the uae involving us courts is more of a diversionary play that s how i see it fleecing of nmc s funds assets between 2012 and end 2019 happened in the uae and involved parties based in the country justice too will need to be served in the uae it was nmc funds that got diverted not shetty s if at all anyone has a claim on damages it is nmc s lenders and creditors most notably adcb some sources say that getting the matter into a us court is double edged us based pension funds had shareholding in nmc and if shetty himself gets implicated in any way it will set off more problems such deeds would be viewed quite adversely in the us opening legal proceedings in the us courts could be a potential can of worms said the banker benefit of doubt it will now be up to the new york court to decide whether there is enough merit in the shetty claims and whether the case can be heard in the us there are high stakes involved for shetty who in his filings in the us says that a substantial number of the nmc account diversions involved us dollar denominated transactions that cleared through new york banks the filings suggest that audit firm the banks and senior management put together a ponzi scheme that could tap into ever higher bank loans as and when they were needed jonathan davidson partner at the difc based law firm davidson co said his us lawyers must consider that they have a sufficiently strong argument that the us courts will accept jurisdiction because if the court rejects the jurisdiction shetty will face significant adverse costs awards which he will have to pay as well as his own legal costs it is impossible to crystal ball gaze what that argument might be but i am sure they will unfold as the us courts are a transparent forum what led to b r shetty s current situation the nmc crisis was set off by a report issued by the us financial services firm muddy waters research which in december of 2019 said that there were yawning gaps in the company s financial reporting this despite nmc being listed on the ftse in the uk since late 2019 which is one of the most tightly regulated markets anywhere the muddy waters research report immediately set off a chain reaction leading to the exit of prasanth manghat then then ceo shetty stepping down as non executive chairman and then the departure of the entire board of directors in april 2020 a uk court formally placed nmc health under administration with three alvarez marsal officials overseeing the operations a victory of sorts if the us court takes on the claim and allows legal proceedings it will break the chain of court verdicts that have gone against him in these last few months the latest was an order issued by difc courts early this saying that shetty should pay one of his lenders credit europe bank dubai 9 33 million to settle claims the same court had in april last year issued a worldwide freeze order on shetty trying to dispose of his assets the 9 33 million was to paid within seven days of the court order it is not known whether shetty had indeed paid this off interestingly credit europe bank has been named in the us filing as is e y the former audit firm at nmc and uae exchange centre according to informed sources the last statement that e y signed off on was the first half 2019 results of nmc currently the accounting is done in house in joint supervision with alvarez marsal the consultancy that is administering nmc s return to financial health it is also simultaneously working on a strategy that will see nmc pay off its combined debts and at the same time pursue legal action against nmc shareholders and former management who were party to the diversion of bank loans prasanth manghat was promoted to ceo at nmc health in 2017 and stepped down in early 2020 just as the scale of the crisis was becoming clear his current whereabouts remain unknown image credit supplied naming and nailing the guilty the internal investigations launched by alvarez marsal on nmc s past activities the period between late 2012 and end 2019 is at an advanced stage according to multiple sources once that gets done it will then set the stage for formal filing of charges in the abu dhabi courts against those who were party to the fund diversions once the doca deed of company arrangements is voted through legal cases will start to be brought said a source the doca is a change of ownership where the nmc group operating companies will leave administration and be owned by the creditors it s a step towards an ultimate sale the doca is the best way to ensure quality of patient care while continuing the financial and operational restructuring all major creditors to nmc except dubai islamic bank have extended support to the change of ownership but for shetty this is only a detail at the company that he founded in 1974 and turned into the biggest private hospital operator in the uae

on july 4 president joe biden gave a speech in which he effectively asserted that the covid 19 pandemic was over in america biden said the united states was declaring our independence from a deadly virus we can live our lives our kids can go back to school our economy is roaring back it was a theme biden has repeated in speech after speech on may 13 he said america was nearing the finish line of the pandemic on june 15 he said america is headed into the summer dramatically different from last year s summer a summer of freedom a summer of joy a summer of get togethers and celebrations an all american summer that this country deserves after a long long dark winter that we ve all endured in reality since biden s announcement of independence from covid 19 cases have surged seven fold and hospitalizations and deaths are rising as the dangerous delta variant of the disease has become dominant in the epicenters of the current pandemic outbreak arkansas louisiana and florida cases are at the highest level since january and are on track to set new records president joe biden speaks during an independence day celebration on the south lawn of the white house sunday july 4 2021 in washington ap photo patrick semansky throughout 2020 then president donald trump repeatedly claimed that the pandemic would disappear trump s lies were aimed at eliminating all social distancing measures that had been imposed to contain the spread of covid 19 with the aim of getting workers back on the job to increase the profits of the financial oligarchy biden s lying declarations of independence from the pandemic had the same aim to justify the abandonment of restrictions on the spread of covid 19 take your mask off you ve earned the right biden declared in may and just as trump s insistence on reopening businesses and schools fueled a massive resurgence of the pandemic the biden administration s encouragement of americans to abandon mask wearing and social distancing has fueled what may become the greatest outbreak of the pandemic to date almost the same number of cases were reported today 70 264 as this day last year 71 600 stated caitlin rivers an epidemiologist at johns hopkins university on sunday but the worst is yet to come last wednesday the covid 19 scenario modeling hub a consortium of researchers working in consultation with the centers for disease control and prevention cdc released a model showing that the number of daily us covid 19 deaths could surge to 4 000 by october the highest level of any period of the pandemic while this is the worst case scenario in the model the study s authors stress that the current surge of the pandemic is in line with their earlier worst case projections what s going on in the country with the virus is matching our most pessimistic scenarios noted justin lessler an epidemiologist at the university of north carolina who helps run the modeling hub this is an extraordinary warning despite the availability of vaccines death rates could again reach the levels seen last fall a predictable result of the policies of the biden administration and other governments around the world cnn led its sunday state of the union program with an interview with dr anthony fauci the chief medical adviser to biden the moderator began with the question do you think it s really possible it could get that bad 4 000 deaths a day while fauci did not answer the question directly he gave a blunt warning we re going in the wrong direction separately from the covid 19 scenario modeling hub epidemiologist eric topol told new york magazine that a likely scenario would lead to us cases surging to 250 000 a day nearly four times the current rate we re tracking right with the uk he said they got to 50 000 plus cases and if you multiply that by five for the population difference we d get to 250 000 that s easy extrapolation that could be where we re heading topol warned ominously that 10 percent of those infected could experience major long covid symptoms lasting weeks months or even the victim s entire life as he put it he ones that can t work the real significant brain fog the ones that really are suffering it s probably one out of 10 in the face of this disaster with hundreds of thousands of people dying and tens of thousands suffering debilitating long term symptoms the us ruling class is demanding the continuation of its murderous herd immunity policy in an interview on nbc news thursday evening cdc director rochelle walensky doubled down on the biden administration s demand that schools fully reopen this fall months before any children under 12 will be eligible to be vaccinated asked is there any consideration any scenario in which you might want to reverse yourself on reopening schools walensky replied i remain emphatic that our schools need to open in the fall they need to open for full in person learning asked if the cdc is not recommending people who are fully vaccinated wear masks walensky bluntly stated we are not in its total indifference to the defense of human life in the face of the pandemic the biden administration is carrying out the common policy of the ruling classes throughout europe the americas and virtually every other part of the world this is perhaps expressed most nakedly by the government of uk prime minister boris johnson in a tweet this past weekend uk health minister sajid javid said the public must not cower from the disease instead learning to live with the pandemic epidemiologist deepti gurdasani a leading author of the lancet study condemning the uk government s promotion of herd immunity through mass infection denounced javid s statement saying caring isn t cowardice removing protections from people when almost half of our population hasn t been vaccinated to bow to ideology is the uk is in the words of the wall street journal carrying out a test case for whether it is possible to enjoy something approaching pre pandemic life in the face of fast transmitting versions of the virus the journal elaborated the experiment should give a strong signal of whether covid 19 can be relegated to the status of a manageable seasonal menace such as influenza and whether lockdowns and social distancing can be consigned to the past this experiment is being repeated around the world including in the united states as former food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb made clear last weekend the assumptions built into those models is no mitigation no mandates for masks no closures of businesses he added i think that s likely to be the norm in response to the total intransigence of governments on abandoning all social distancing measures and enforcing the full reopening of schools and businesses the financial markets have surged with the dow jones industrial average hitting a record of 35 000 on friday from the start of the pandemic the response of governments around the world has been animated entirely by the aim of preserving the wealth and privileges of the financial oligarchy at the expense of preserving human lives in response to the murderous herd immunity policies of the ruling class workers must demand urgent measures to stop the spread of the disease including the closure of all non essential production facilities work locations and schools with full compensation for lost wages and trillions of dollars in additional health care spending to ensure the ability to test track and isolate every case all students must be provided broadband internet and high quality computers and additional teachers must be hired to ensure the best possible remote learning until the pandemic is brought under control as scientists have repeatedly made clear covid 19 can be contained and must be contained if millions more lives are to be saved the senseless and preventable deaths of 626 000 people in the united states and over four million around the world according to official figures that drastically underestimate the real toll stand as an unanswerable indictment of the capitalist system and demonstration of the necessity to replace it with socialism

cgtn think tank releases an analytical report on the global situation of the covid 19 pandemic tweet beijing july 26 2021 prnewswire as the global spread of the covid 19 pandemic has not yet subsided the cgtn think tank has released an analytical report on the global situation of the covid 19 pandemic the report by sourcing data from the johns hopkins university website our world in data and pharmaceutical technology that have not been comprehensively processed analyzing research literature from the academic community and referring to the known impact of the pandemic on global economic and social development as well as the recommendations on its prevention and control from renowned public health experts the report puts together the data on pandemic prevention and control measures in 51 sample countries to make rankings as a way of reflecting the current situation of pandemic control in these countries it focuses on the importance that countries attach to personal safety social and environmental stability thereby providing ideas and directions for countries around the world to fight the pandemic the report analyzes and evaluates the current status of pandemic prevention and control in the 51 countries based on five indicators including the total number of confirmed cases the number of newly confirmed cases the total number of deaths the number of vaccinations and the full cycle from pandemic outbreak to control as of 14 july the data shows that the united states has the worst performance on three of the five statistical indicators the u s has over 34 million confirmed cases in total the highest in the world and over 600 000 deaths in total also the highest in the world and the number of days with less than 5 000 daily new cases in the full cycle from pandemic outbreak to control is only 62 still the worst among the sample countries according to the data the situation in main european countries is not encouraging when it comes to the total number of confirmed cases and deaths france the uk and italy all rank high the data shows that some asian countries have performed well in pandemic prevention and control thanks to effective measures such as entry bans quarantine and stringent testing at the border china has the lowest number of confirmed new cases among the sample countries and the highest number of vaccinations in the world singapore and vietnam rank low among all sample countries for the total number of covid 19 deaths and south korea has adjusted the level of pandemic response in a timely manner resulting in 537 days with less than 5 000 daily new cases in terms of the number of vaccinations china is one of a few developing countries with the highest number of covid 19 vaccinations due to its ability to develop and manufacture its own vaccines at present over 1 4 billion doses of covid 19 vaccines have been administered in china china has also supplied more than 500 million doses of covid 19 vaccines and stock solutions to more than 100 countries and international organizations worldwide equivalent to one sixth of the total global vaccine production however the statistics also lay bare that the vaccination progress in developing countries is significantly worse than that in developed countries due to the severe inequality in the global distribution of vaccines countries with a poor vaccination record such as vietnam and iraq are still far from reaching herd immunity due to various limitations such as poor health service and vaccine hoarding by certain developed countries the polarization in the number of confirmed cases the number of deaths and the number of people vaccinated in different countries and regions of the world as shown by the objective statistics is very much related to national pandemic prevention and control policies and measures and highlights the crucial role played by a country s government in pandemic prevention and control source cgtn

record high nestled in the foothills of the sierra madre valparaíso sits on one of those critical highways for the past month a shot up pick up truck has rested here it s a reminder that residents remain in the line of fire even as the army and national guard patrol the area the larger currents of the international drug trade engulfing these zacatecan communities may not be clear to their residents but the impact is inescapable when the shootouts rumble across the plains dotted with ranches farmers often can t go out to feed their livestock goods to stock store shelves and medical care frequently don t arrive for fear of cartel roadblocks gunmen stop residents and demand their cell phones to look for information that could tie them to the other cartel they sometimes beat people or tie them up regardless to instill fear if someone doesn t stop they open fire earlier this month a doctor was killed in neighboring jerez for not stopping two paramedics carrying a woman in an ambulance from neighboring jalisco state to a hospital were killed a few days before passing through valparaíso last month a priest was killed in crossfire on the highway residents said he had been helping them get electricity back after an armed group cut the power to some ranches one town is controlled by sinaloa the next by jalisco the next sinaloa again said a community leader who like more than a dozen people interviewed requested anonymity to avoid repercussions he said just sharing territory with one group makes residents complicit in the eyes of their enemies a rumor circulated that the cartels were forcing youth snatched from the communities to work for them there was panic said a 21 year old man the oldest of five siblings they stayed only because there wasn t any way to go nor any place plenty of families left some for other mexican cities to wait for the situation to calm others to the united states where some 1 1 2 million zacatecans the same number as in mexico reside others just stayed inside there were 15 days that we didn t go out for anything said claudina betancourt a nurse born in san juan capistrano she continues working here but recently moved her belongings to fresnillo where her daughter and mother live in case she has to quickly leave one day for good there s no cellular coverage and just two phone booths isolation that adds to the uncertainty days after the june 24 shootout authorities found two more corpses raising the death count to 20 valparaíso s mayor could not confirm or deny figures given by some residents that were double that a detective who apparently was investigating the shootout and was pulled out of valparaíso for his safety was later killed similar violence is occurring in other states like michoacán and guerrero where residents caught between competing gangs suffer extortion abductions and killings for years attention focused on violence along mexico s northern border in cities like tijuana ciudad juarez and nuevo laredo zacatecas had it then too as cartels battled for control but it was overshadowed now zacatecans including in the state capital of the same name have awoken on several occasions to corpses dangling from overpasses murders occur daily in fresnillo a city that mixes the local offices of major mining companies with farmers working the bean fields with 239 murders per 100 000 residents fresnillo has the highest perception of insecurity in mexico more than 96 of its population lives in fear according to the national institute of statistics and geography there is anxiety and uncertainty not knowing where to find safety for your family said ramos valparaíso s mayor who was just re elected to a third term he said he has not been directly threatened but he has the same fear as everyone mexico s federal government defends its policy of targeting the root causes of violence poverty corruption impunity with social programs while deploying the national guard and soldiers there are more than 100 000 guardsmen deployed in the mexico plus the military yet the violence continues apace arturo nahle zacatecas former attorney general and current state supreme court president said those policies could be right but will take years to bear fruit the strategies that the mexican government has implemented over the last 15 years have not worked he said lópez obrador s party just won the governorship in zacatecas but it remains to be seen if coordination with federal authorities will improve if we don t manage to pacify mexico regardless of what has been done we are not going to be able to historically prove our administration the president said earlier this month last wednesday he announced a special strategy to address the cities with the most murders among them fresnillo more military presence and more social development more troops would be welcome in zacatecas though the effectiveness of their patrols is debated with the army the bad guys don t move in said a 74 year old farmer in san juan capistrano who teared up talking about the situation in his community the government if it pays attention can put a stop to everything but a resident from the same area had a different hope for peace that one cartel wins soon maría verza the associated press

when demand exceeds supply prices rise while the problem of housing affordability has many facets and effects that inescapable fact explains a lot about why so many north carolinians struggle to afford the homes they d like to buy or rent it s not as if there are many idle homebuilders in our state in fact by one measure north carolina is doing better than average when the manhattan institute compared job growth to new housing permits in 20 fastest growing metropolitan areas the three north carolina metros on the list fared very well durham chapel hill 1 raleigh cary 3 and charlotte concord gastonia 4 alas this isn t the whole story it misses an important stock and flow dynamic yes over the past decade north carolina metros have been more accommodating than most of their peers in allowing new home starts to keep up with new residents but our state began the decade with too many consumers chasing too few housing units despite recent construction we aren t adding enough housing stock take a look at the most recent affordability data from the national association of home builders and wells fargo bank their study compares the median sales price of homes to the median income in each jurisdiction for the first quarter of 2021 nahb wells fargo produced affordability scores for 233 metros north carolina s highest ranking places for home affordability were fayetteville 32 and winston salem 58 greensboro high point 96 raleigh cary 102 durham chapel hill 113 charlotte concord gastonia 124 and asheville 150 face bigger challenges our housing markets aren t as locked up as those in california or new york to be sure that s one reason why californians and new yorkers among others continue to move here in significant numbers but home affordability in north carolina is still a worrisome problem most policymakers agree with that of course where they disagree is how north carolina state and local governments should go about trying to address it for decades my john locke foundation colleagues and i have recommended that we loosen housing and zoning regulations to make it easier to provide housing to people of modest means yes that means allowing more units per acre of increasingly pricey land it means duplexes and triplexes it means allowing homeowners to rent out spare rooms it even means allowing more manufactured housing within municipal limits modern units bear little relationship to old fashioned trailers by the way a serious effort to promote affordability in north carolina also means reducing how long it takes from planning stage to final construction for homebuilders to bring new inventory to market it means streamlining the process for obtaining permits it means letting producers and consumers meet in the middle trading off amenities for price rather than imposing housing codes that reflect the preferences of existing residents over those of newcomers such an effort then isn t just about the precise wording of laws or the detailed analysis of regulations it s about public attitudes do people other than buyers and sellers have a legitimate interest in the amount and type of housing stock erected in the community to a limited extent yes regarding public services such as roads or water and sewer that interest need not result in excessive regulation however localities can and do charge developers directly and thus prospective newcomers indirectly for the cost of adding infrastructure capacity to accommodate them such a practice is not about saying no it s about saying yes at the right price let s be honest though when the neighborhood resists new construction or higher density it s not just about traffic or stormwater runoff preexisting residents want to keep things the way they were when they moved in more trees fewer people driving or walking by structures and landscapes that existing residents admire when they drive or walk by here s a principle we should all take to heart when we buy or rent a place to live we don t purchase a right to oversee how many neighbors we ll have or how they choose to live their lives john hood is a carolina journal columnist and author of the new novel mountain folk a historical fantasy set during the american revolution
like like love haha wow sad angry 1 thyblackman com if president joseph biden s administration were considered a corporation their key executives biden vice president harris and chief of staff ron klain would all be in jeopardy of going to jail biden has been president for more than six months now and he is in default of a declared dividend he made to his shareholders especially his largest shareholder the black community but this is nothing new democrats in general and biden in particular have constantly reneged on paying declared dividends to their black shareholders i have a degree in tax accounting from oral roberts university so allow me to explain stock dividends in its most basic form dividends are usually declared at a company s annual stockholder s meeting by its board of directors in this case white house senior staff in simple terms dividend payouts are determined by the percentage of stock you own in the company from the largest to the smallest in this example the shareholders are the american people more specifically voters who voted for biden for president blacks are by far the largest shareholder in biden inc i e the democrat party biden declared a dividend specifically to the black community during his victory speech last november after he won the presidential election biden said the african american community stood up again for me they always have my back and i ll have yours oh really mr biden if biden were accused in a court of law of having black folks back would there be enough evidence to convict him ummm let s see let s start with biden s meeting with media appointed black civil rights leaders last december he was extremely condescending and dismissive of them and they allowed it to happen without so much as a whimper out of them some of biden s first actions as president were to sign several executive orders encouraging open borders to anyone who wants to come to america offer amnesty to everyone in the country illegally give work permits to all illegals bring homosexuals and transgenders under the 1964 civil rights act let me remind my readers that blacks are 13 of the population and gave biden 88 of their vote with black women giving him 96 of their vote hispanics are 17 with homosexuals being 5 transexuals being 6 with these numbers biden inc s largest shareholders would be blacks whites latinos asians homosexuals and transexuals this should be the pecking order of the dividend distribution emphasis on should be based on the above blacks should be the largest recipient of biden s largesse but in typical democrat fashion blacks don t even get crumbs from biden s table thus far the biggest beneficiaries of biden s presidency are illegals homosexuals and transexuals biden signed various executive orders for these groups within hours of him becoming president when will black people take biden to political court and demand payment of their dividend that they are rightfully entitled to how in the hell do black democrats allow illegals homosexuals and transexuals be placed ahead of them blacks have the largest voting block in congress if they were to ever vote as a block they could stop any piece of legislation that comes before them these media appointed leaders like al sharpton marc morial derrick johnson etc constantly sell out blacks how can you support amnesty for illegals when low and under skilled blacks are going to be hurt the most by this how can you allow homosexuals and transexuals to be brought under the civil rights act of 1964 if biden were a corporation blacks could take him to court and would prevail unfortunately these chosen black leaders are all too happy to get an invite to the white house for a photo op other groups go there to witness the signing of legislation of specific interest to their group not for a photo op biden claims without evidence that he has black people s back but where is the dividend where is the legislation where are the senior level appointments to his administration how can you be angry with white liberals constantly screwing over blacks when we allow it to keep happening how can you get angry with white liberals for sentencing our kids to remain in non performing public schools while illegals get private teachers i challenge my readers to name me one thing of substance that biden has done specifically for blacks something that will make a positive difference in the lives of pookie and laquisha when all is said and done there is more said than done staff writer raynard jackson this talented brother is a pulitzer award nominated columnist and founder and chairman of black americans for a better future bafbf a federally registered 527 super pac established to get more blacks involved in the republican party bafbf focuses on the black entrepreneur for more information about bafbf visit www bafbf org you can follow raynard on twitter raynard1223 share post twitter facebook email

oil and gas majors are likely to report bumper second quarter earnings in the coming days energy analysts have told cnbc citing higher commodity prices international benchmark brent crude futures rose to an average of 69 a barrel in the second quarter the wall street bank said up from an average of 61 in the first three months of the year kathy hipple finance professor at bard college in new york argued it was important to note that these earnings will be announced against a backdrop of climate disasters around the globe from extreme heat in the pacific northwest to flooding in europe and china london oil and gas majors are likely to report bumper second quarter earnings in the coming days energy analysts have told cnbc following a brutal 12 months by virtually every measure the expected upswing would build on a surprisingly strong showing in the first quarter and lend further support to the oil and gas industry s efforts to pay down debt and reward investors big oil companies referring to the world s largest oil and gas majors still face significant challenges and uncertainties however get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters these include the remarkable success of shareholder activism in recent months a tremendous degree of ongoing investor skepticism and intensifying pressure to massively reduce fossil fuel use in order to meet the demands of the climate emergency europe s integrated oil sector already enjoyed surprisingly strong earnings in 1q but 2q is set to show further improvement as commodity prices took another step up analysts at morgan stanley said in a research note international benchmark brent crude futures rose to an average of 69 a barrel in the second quarter the wall street bank said up from an average of 61 in the first three months of the year the oil contract was last seen trading at around 73 57 analysts at morgan stanley noted that energy major share prices continue to be anchored by their dividend distributions notwithstanding substantial increases to free cash flow forecasts the bank said big oil dividend expectations remain rather static the energy transition confronts investors with much uncertainty and the sector s capital allocation track record has been mixed at best over the last decade hence investors are only valuing the cash flow paid to them with little credit given for cash flow retained within companies they said as the dividend outlook has not improved much and dividend yields in aggregate are already low by historical standards share prices have trailed the earnings outlook considerably in europe royal dutch shell and totalenergies will report second quarter earnings on july 29 with bp scheduled to follow on aug 3 stateside exxonmobil and chevron are expected to publish their latest figures on july 30 while conocophillips will report second quarter earnings on aug 3 luke sharrett bloomberg getty images rene santos manager for north america supply at s p global platts analytics told cnbc via email that he expects second quarter earnings from u s based energy companies to be significantly higher when compared to the same period in 2020 this is mainly due to much higher oil prices he added in addition the majors large and mid cap companies have kept capital discipline and have continued to focus on paying down debt and increasing free cash flow instead of increasing activity despite higher oil prices santos said s p global platts analytics also foresee an increase in the reporting of esg activity noting that it looks like pressure from environmental groups and fear of more regulations from the current administration is persuading many companies to do more to decrease emissions growing climate risk the oil and gas industry was sent into a tailspin last year as the coronavirus pandemic coincided with a historic fuel demand shock plunging commodity prices unprecedented write downs and tens of thousands of job cuts the torrent of bad news prompted the head of the international energy agency to suggest it may come to represent the worst year in the history of oil markets oil prices have since rebounded to multi year highs and all three of the world s main forecasting agencies opec the iea and the u s energy information administration now expect a demand led recovery to pick up speed in the second half of 2021 clark williams derry energy finance analyst at ieefa a non profit organization said he expects oil and gas companies to try to claim a clean bill of health after a bumper second quarter that s the mantra that we will hear he told cnbc via telephone however while energy majors will likely have had the opportunity to pay down some debt after generating a significant chunk of cash from their operations williams derry said that this hides the fact that these companies have not invested much in future production peter boer bloomberg getty images what i think the market is starting to signal is that it kind of likes when the oil companies shrink and aren t going all out into new production but they are using the cash that their operations are generating to pay down debt and reward investors longer term williams derry warned there s a tremendous degree of investor skepticism about the business models of oil and gas firms citing the deepening climate crisis and the urgent need to pivot away from fossil fuels we saw earlier in the year signs of a sea change in investor thinking about frankly the legal status of some of the supermajors he said referring to a series of landmark courtroom and boardroom defeats for the likes of royal dutch shell exxonmobil and chevron so even if you are riding high for a quarter or two when prices are high the reality is still that stock prices are way below the market as a whole and there s just not the investor enthusiasm for the old business model that i think these companies probably expected to see he said energy transition kathy hipple finance professor at bard college in new york told cnbc via email that she believes two key themes are likely to emerge this earnings season addressing investor concerns around climate risk and the outlining of new business models to survive a pivot toward renewables investors are future oriented and will look past a short term pop in earnings compared to last year s dismal second quarter results hipple said they want to see concrete business strategies that acknowledge the energy transition that is gathering speed she argued it was important to note that these earnings will be announced against a backdrop of climate disasters around the globe from extreme heat in the pacific northwest to flooding in europe and china oil

oil and gas majors are likely to report bumper second quarter earnings in the coming days energy analysts have told cnbc citing higher commodity prices international benchmark brent crude futures rose to an average of 69 a barrel in the second quarter the wall street bank said up from an average of 61 in the first three months of the year kathy hipple finance professor at bard college in new york argued it was important to note that these earnings will be announced against a backdrop of climate disasters around the globe from extreme heat in the pacific northwest to flooding in europe and china london oil and gas majors are likely to report bumper second quarter earnings in the coming days energy analysts have told cnbc following a brutal 12 months by virtually every measure the expected upswing would build on a surprisingly strong showing in the first quarter and lend further support to the oil and gas industry s efforts to pay down debt and reward investors big oil companies referring to the world s largest oil and gas majors still face significant challenges and uncertainties however get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters these include the remarkable success of shareholder activism in recent months a tremendous degree of ongoing investor skepticism and intensifying pressure to massively reduce fossil fuel use in order to meet the demands of the climate emergency europe s integrated oil sector already enjoyed surprisingly strong earnings in 1q but 2q is set to show further improvement as commodity prices took another step up analysts at morgan stanley said in a research note international benchmark brent crude futures rose to an average of 69 a barrel in the second quarter the wall street bank said up from an average of 61 in the first three months of the year the oil contract was last seen trading at around 73 57 analysts at morgan stanley noted that energy major share prices continue to be anchored by their dividend distributions notwithstanding substantial increases to free cash flow forecasts the bank said big oil dividend expectations remain rather static the energy transition confronts investors with much uncertainty and the sector s capital allocation track record has been mixed at best over the last decade hence investors are only valuing the cash flow paid to them with little credit given for cash flow retained within companies they said as the dividend outlook has not improved much and dividend yields in aggregate are already low by historical standards share prices have trailed the earnings outlook considerably in europe royal dutch shell and totalenergies will report second quarter earnings on july 29 with bp scheduled to follow on aug 3 stateside exxonmobil and chevron are expected to publish their latest figures on july 30 while conocophillips will report second quarter earnings on aug 3 luke sharrett bloomberg getty images rene santos manager for north america supply at s p global platts analytics told cnbc via email that he expects second quarter earnings from u s based energy companies to be significantly higher when compared to the same period in 2020 this is mainly due to much higher oil prices he added in addition the majors large and mid cap companies have kept capital discipline and have continued to focus on paying down debt and increasing free cash flow instead of increasing activity despite higher oil prices santos said s p global platts analytics also foresee an increase in the reporting of esg activity noting that it looks like pressure from environmental groups and fear of more regulations from the current administration is persuading many companies to do more to decrease emissions growing climate risk the oil and gas industry was sent into a tailspin last year as the coronavirus pandemic coincided with a historic fuel demand shock plunging commodity prices unprecedented write downs and tens of thousands of job cuts the torrent of bad news prompted the head of the international energy agency to suggest it may come to represent the worst year in the history of oil markets oil prices have since rebounded to multi year highs and all three of the world s main forecasting agencies opec the iea and the u s energy information administration now expect a demand led recovery to pick up speed in the second half of 2021 clark williams derry energy finance analyst at ieefa a non profit organization said he expects oil and gas companies to try to claim a clean bill of health after a bumper second quarter that s the mantra that we will hear he told cnbc via telephone however while energy majors will likely have had the opportunity to pay down some debt after generating a significant chunk of cash from their operations williams derry said that this hides the fact that these companies have not invested much in future production peter boer bloomberg getty images what i think the market is starting to signal is that it kind of likes when the oil companies shrink and aren t going all out into new production but they are using the cash that their operations are generating to pay down debt and reward investors longer term williams derry warned there s a tremendous degree of investor skepticism about the business models of oil and gas firms citing the deepening climate crisis and the urgent need to pivot away from fossil fuels we saw earlier in the year signs of a sea change in investor thinking about frankly the legal status of some of the supermajors he said referring to a series of landmark courtroom and boardroom defeats for the likes of royal dutch shell exxonmobil and chevron so even if you are riding high for a quarter or two when prices are high the reality is still that stock prices are way below the market as a whole and there s just not the investor enthusiasm for the old business model that i think these companies probably expected to see he said energy transition kathy hipple finance professor at bard college in new york told cnbc via email that she believes two key themes are likely to emerge this earnings season addressing investor concerns around climate risk and the outlining of new business models to survive a pivot toward renewables investors are future oriented and will look past a short term pop in earnings compared to last year s dismal second quarter results hipple said they want to see concrete business strategies that acknowledge the energy transition that is gathering speed she argued it was important to note that these earnings will be announced against a backdrop of climate disasters around the globe from extreme heat in the pacific northwest to flooding in europe and china oil companies that ignore climate in their earnings calls will be seen as laggards long term investors will conclude they are financially risky hipple said

information on non ifrs measures can be found in the annual report 2020 use of fair value information in presenting the philips group s financial position fair values are used for the measurement of

are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid at the balance sheet date when quoted prices or observable market data are not readily available fair values are estimated using appropriate valuation models and unobservable inputs such fair value estimates require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments which are inherently uncertain and may therefore deviate from actual developments critical assumptions used are disclosed in the annual report 2020 in certain cases independent valuations are obtained to support management s determination of fair values presentation all amounts are in millions of euros unless otherwise stated due to rounding amounts may not add up precisely to totals provided all

the calculation of adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders to exclude fair value movements of limited life fund investments recognized at fair value through profit and

central banks should know by now that you cannot have negative interest rates with low bond yields and strong growth one or the other central banks have chosen low bond yields at any cost despite all the evidence of stagnation ahead this creates enormous problems and perverse incentives it is not a surprise that markets have bounced aggressively driven by the tech sector after a slump based on concerns about the pace of economic growth stimulus package effects are increasingly short and this was pretty evident in the poor figures of industrial production and the zew survey gauge of expectations the same can be said about a weakening ism index in the united states united states ism services pmi came in at 60 1 below expectations 63 5 in june precisely in the sector where the recovery should be strongest interestingly european markets declined sharply after the european central bank sent the ultimate dovish message a change in its inflation target that would allow the central bank to exceed its 2 percent limit without change of policy what does it all tell us first that the placebo effect of stimulus packages shows a shorter impact trillions of dollars spent create a small positive effect that lasts for less than three months but leaves a massive trail of debt behind second central banks are increasingly hostage to governments that simply will not curb deficit spending and will not implement structural reforms the independence of the monetary authorities has long been questioned but now it has become clear that governments are using loose policies as a tool to abandon structural reforms not to buy time no developed economy can tolerate a slight increase in government bond yields and with sticky inflation in nonreplicable goods and services this means stagnation with higher prices ahead a bad omen for the overall economy third and more concerning market participants know this and take incremental levels of risk knowing that central banks will not taper which leads to a more fragile environment and extreme levels of complacency so called value sectors have retraced in equity markets which shows that the recovery has been priced and that the risk ahead is weakening margins and poor growth while the traditional beneficiaries of low rates forever have soared to new highs despite rating agencies concerns about the rising figure of fallen angel debt there is extreme complacency among investors looking for yield and they are buying junk bonds at the fastest pace in years despite a rising number of bankruptcies central banks justify these actions based on the view that inflation is transitory but ignore the risks of elevated prices even if the pace of increase in those prices slows down if food and energy prices rise 30 percent then fall 5 percent that is not transitory to consumers who are suffering the above headline increase in the prices of the things they purchase every day a problem that occurred already in 2020 and 2019 the most negatively affected are the middle low and poor classes as they do not see a wealth effect from the rise in asset prices sticky inflation and misguided loose fiscal and monetary policies are not tools for growth but for stagnation and debt so far central banks believe their policies are working because equity and bond markets remain strong that is like giving more vodka to an alcoholic because he has not died of cirrhosis yet low bond yields and high levels of negative yielding debt are not signaling monetary success but are evidence of a deep disconnection between markets and the real economy central banks have already stated that they will continue with ultraloose policies no matter what happens to inflation in at least a year and a half for consumers that is a lot of time for weakening purchasing power of salaries and savings markets may continue to reward excess and high risk but that is not something that should be ignored let alone celebrated extreme risk will be blamed for the next crisis as always but the cause of that extreme risk perennial loose monetary policy will not stop in fact it will be used as the solution if there is a market collapse central banks should be tapering already and if they believe that low sovereign yields are justified by fundamentals let markets prove it if negative nominal and real yields are justified by the issuers solvency why is there any need for monetary authorities to purchase 100 percent of net issuances reality is much scarier if central banks started tapering sovereign yields would soar to levels that would make many deficit spending governments quake therefore by keeping yields artificially low central banks are also sowing the seeds of higher debt lower productivity and weaker growth the recipe for crowding out overcapacity and stagnation note the views expressed on mises org are not necessarily those of the mises institute

are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid at the balance sheet date when quoted prices or observable market data are not readily available fair values are estimated using appropriate valuation models and unobservable inputs such fair value estimates require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments which are

roughly every other glass of orange juice drunk around the world comes from the orchards of são paulo state boasts duarte nogueira we have everything beginning with the letter c says the mayor of ribeirão preto a city four hours inland from the state capital before reeling off the portuguese names of produce cultivated in the region coffee sugarcane cana citruses meat carne and cellulose the main ingredient for paper agriculture is growing more and more and it is not only a virtue of our region but of brazil the south american nation is now one of the world s top producers of foodstuffs from soyabeans to sugar and beef to bananas blessed with an abundance of natural wealth like vast iron ore deposits and deep sea oil reserves brazil also supplies some of the most important raw materials for modern economies latin america s largest economy is now riding a rally in prices for many of these basic goods as covid 19 restrictions lift and worldwide growth returns among bullish traders there is even talk of a new commodities supercycle duarte nogueira agriculture is growing more and more and it is not only a virtue of our region but of brazil ricardo lisboa ft after disruptions in global supply chains constrained availability for certain items demand has been stoked by a resurgent china sucking in resources and governments spending on recovery programmes notably the us the bloomberg commodity index following a sharp drop around the start of the pandemic has rebounded to levels not seen since 2015 global food costs dropped for the first time in a year last month with price declines for vegetable oil cereals and dairy products according to a un index but the gauge was still more than 30 points higher than its level for the same period in 2020 the impact is being keenly felt in brazil s agribusiness sector combined with a weakened exchange rate which boosts revenues from products quoted in dollars it is a boon to many brazilian farmers and surrounding communities maurílio biagi filho a tycoon from a sugar and ethanol family in ribeirão preto describes as very rare the confluence of high agricultural prices and record production when that happens when you have both things going for you it s extraordinary he adds the region around ribeirão preto or the brazilian california as it is sometimes called is testament to the prosperity that has flowed from an explosion in the country s agriculture over recent decades porsche and bmw car dealerships are interspersed among rows of luxury high rise apartments in a southern district of the municipality its population has expanded by two thirds over the past 30 years however the affluence is a far cry from the problems now assailing large parts of the nation of 213m people millions have lost work because of the public health crisis leading to a record unemployment rate of almost 15 per cent in a country of plenty hunger has risen as inflation in no small part driven by higher prices for brazilian goods on international markets pushes everyday items out of reach for ordinary citizens and investors alike how the commodities upswing plays out will have an important bearing not only on brazil s convalescence from covid 19 but on its destiny in the years to come there are hopes it will kickstart an economy that was sluggish even before the pandemic and help to unlock the country s long promised potential a window of opportunity is opening for brazil says gustavo arruda an economist at bnp paribas there is a boom that we can take advantage of you can spend and do nothing or else make the most of it and get things done he says alluding to structural reforms to make the economy more competitive that have been promised for two decades the south american nation is now one of the world s top producers of foodstuffs yasuyoshi chiba afp via getty images yet despite the renewed optimism there are obstacles that might prevent the commodities upswing from translating into a broader recovery it will require policymakers to avoid the mistakes of the previous commodities bonanza of the 2000s then an emerging markets darling brazil s performance would later disappoint as opportunities were missed to boost productivity by improving infrastructure and slashing red tape and in parallel to the farming boom a drawn out deindustrialisation is occurring in brazil with factory closures and lay offs as many traditional manufacturers struggle to remain competitive how brazil grapples with these two trends may determine whether the country can break free from an age old pattern of boom and bust that goes back to its origins as a resource colony at the metalworkers union headquarters in the abc region named after three industrial towns south of são paulo where former president luiz inácio lula da silva made his name as a strike leader during the military dictatorship director aroaldo oliveira da silva says booming agriculture by itself will not be sufficient to lift society it s over once and for all we re actually going to be an agrarian country but then we will be in absolute misery because nowadays agriculture is so mechanised that it does not absorb labour he says brazil will not sustain itself with agribusiness alone breadbasket of the world throughout its history brazil s fortunes have often been tied to export manias from sugar in the early days of portuguese conquest through to gold coffee and the amazonian rubber rush of the late 19th century during the noughties it surfed the wave of the commodities supercycle a prolonged period of high prices under lula poverty rates fell as his left leaning administrations spent part of the fiscal dividends on social programmes but as that boom cooled there followed a lost decade in which living standards tumbled a huge corruption scandal failed interventionist policies under lula s successor dilma rousseff and mass protests that foreshadowed her impeachment provided the backdrop to what was then the country s worst ever recession in 2015 16 the region around ribeirão preto is testament to the prosperity that has flowed from an explosion in the country s agriculture over recent decades nelson almedia afp via getty images despite the tumult of recent times though its farming belt has continued a quiet revolution that has cemented its status as an agricultural powerhouse in the 1970s brazil was food insecure we imported everything meat from europe milk from the us beans from mexico apples from argentina says celso moretti president of embrapa a government run agricultural research body in less than five decades we were able to establish sustainable and competitive tropical agriculture that has no parallel in the modern world he adds we have areas that we crop twice or three times a year much has centred on the cerrado or savannah in the highlands of central brazil that occupies more than a fifth of national territory new techniques and technological developments as well as the conversion of forest land has transformed huge expanses in places such as mato grosso into plantations reminiscent of the american midwest the results have been remarkable today the south american country is the largest producer of soyabeans and coffee as well as the biggest exporter of both beef and sugar brazil is already the breadbasket of the world we have the largest agricultural trade balance says josé carlos hausknecht of agribusiness consultancy mb agro consultoria when we look at future projections brazil increases its share of the world market expensive goods key measures of food price inflation are currently at high levels nelson almedia afp via getty images this has offered a rare bright spot from the domestic gloom as brazil s gross domestic product contracted 4 1 per cent last year during the pandemic only agriculture registered positive growth of 2 per cent agribusiness as a whole comprising inputs farming and livestock processing and services has increased its share of the economy during the pandemic and could surpass more than 30 per cent of gross domestic product this year according to estimates by the centre for advanced studies in applied economics at the university of são paulo usp and despite the worst drought in almost a century in central brazil and a more modest growth forecast a record breaking harvest of grains cereals and oilseeds is expected in 2021 according to brazilian statistics authority ibge in the years of poor performance we had in the economy gdp performance would have been worse if not for agricultural exports says pedro dejneka at market intelligence group md commodities while this has enriched a relatively small number of landowners and ranchers it is less clear whether the new commodities boom including the windfall from higher iron ore prices will spread wealth more widely throughout society marcos fava neves an agribusiness expert at usp points to ribeirão preto as an example of how agriculture can fuel urban development when you go to these cities built in the last 30 years they have fancy hotels nice restaurants fitness centres and ice cream stores agribusiness brings the money and then you see the service business booming ribeirão has four big malls even by the us standard that is too much he said the growth of opportunities will be in the countryside arruda from bnp paribas acknowledges that while there are positive knock on effects from the commodities sector it has a concentrating effect on income which can exacerbate inequality modern agriculture requires large properties but little need for labour and has less dependence on other sectors while effective taxes levied on the exports are typically low there is very high productivity in few hands he adds when ford decided this year to quit manufacturing in brazil after a century in the country it stunned thousands of workers amanda perobelli reuters factories floored the ascendancy of brazil s agricultural sector is taking place at a time of malaise in its manufacturing sector when ford decided this year to quit manufacturing in brazil after a century in the country it stunned thousands of workers and dealt a blow to national pride yet it was just the latest in a string of exits that have rung alarm bells mercedes benz ceased passenger car production not long before though it still builds trucks while brands including sony and canon have also ended operations finance minister paulo guedes recently commented on the fact that the agribusiness sector s share of gdp has overtaken that of transformation industries a broad term covering all forms of manufacturing from plastics and pharmaceuticals to beverages and cars he did not mince his words we are slowly being deindustrialised which is bad for the country one of the ironies of this process is that shortages of steel and components have resulted in slower deliveries for farm equipment with its smokestack petrochemical plants car factories and metal workshops the abc region has for decades been the beating industrial heart of brazil s most developed state but the biggest of the three são bernardo do campo was already having to cope with ford s earlier closure of a factory with the loss of almost 3 000 jobs in 2019 recommended mayor orlando morando insists the decision was down to the us automaker s global strategy at the time rather than local factors the old site is now being converted into a logistics centre as the municipality looks to further diversify its economy however the abc region is no longer the magnet it once was for internal migrants from poorer states in the past great fortunes were concentrated in the metropolises says morando today there is a big concentration of wealth in the countryside the trend of deindustrialisation is long running since the mid 1980s manufacturing s share of gdp has halved according to analysis by the getúlio vargas foundation between 2013 and 2019 1 4m industrial jobs were lost or 15 per cent of the workforce ibge figures show experts say this matters as industry tends to create more secure employment and has a stronger multiplier effect on other areas of economic activity rafael cagnin an economist at the institute of studies for industrial development think tank describes brazil s experience as premature compared with more advanced economies that were richer when the hollowing out began outsourcing of low tech activities such as clothing textiles and shoes to lower cost countries often happens as an economy becomes wealthier he explains but in the brazilian case much of the premature deindustrialisation comes from activity of greater technological intensity like machinery and equipment chemicals petrochemicals and the automobile industry has blocked the continuation of the country s development he adds there are still undoubted examples of excellence the world s third largest aircraft maker embraer is the jewel in the crown of brazilian engineering but for cagnin the industrial fabric as a whole has decayed an employee prepares the stella pearl cargo ship heading to china at the tiplam terminal in santos brazil patricia monteiro bloomberg export dependency as commodity prices tend to be quite volatile greater dependence on such exports risks leaving a country more exposed to the ups and downs of global cycles but brazil s farming sector blurs the distinction that economists sometimes draw between producing commodities which is often a low value added activity and the more sophisticated products and services that generate greater wealth for a society agribusiness now is not just farms because we export technology machines and software we have a lot of start ups says denis arroyo alves director at orplana an association of sugarcane producers it is a new economy based in the countryside to optimists this offers an opportunity to revitalise brazilian industry and expand other connected advanced activities from smart heavy duty machinery and self driving tractors to green chemistry electronics and computer programming they say there is considerable potential given the right support and conditions a thriving scene of agritech start ups shows many entrepreneurs are already grasping this agribusiness can be a catalyst for re industrialisation says cagnin although this does not yet exist on a large scale there are instances as sellers of soyabeans and beef in particular come under pressure to prove their supply chains are free from deforestation for example there will be greater need for satellite tracking and reliable tracing systems with threats of products boycotts from european consumers and supermarkets over the amazon environmental protection given short shrift by president jair bolsonaro is likely to become an even more important theme for big agribusinesses as will decarbonisation both will involve innovations technology and r d investments brazil s farming sector blurs the distinction that economists sometimes draw between producing commodities and the more sophisticated products that generate greater wealth for a society carl de souza afp via getty images yet many economists stress the need for deep reforms to help tackle the notorious custo brasil the cost of doing business in brazil which holds back manufacturers this will include dealing with byzantine taxes burdensome bureaucracy and creaking or nonexistent infrastructure particularly in transportation a tax reform bill is now making its way through congress but with elections in just over a year s time there are doubts about the political desire to enact the sweeping changes necessary unlike the last commodities boom this time around china is unlikely to return to the astronomical growth rates that transformed it into a commercial superpower many analysts predict a strong but shorter upswing as warehouse stocks are replenished following the chaos of covid

financial position fair values are used for the measurement of various items in accordance with the applicable accounting standards these fair values are based on market prices where available and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid at the balance sheet date when quoted prices or observable market data are not readily available fair values are estimated using appropriate valuation models and unobservable inputs such fair value estimates require management to make significant

berlin immunity against the coronavirus is waning in people who were fully vaccinated with the shot made by biontech se and pfizer inc in january because of the rapidly spreading delta variant biontech s chief executive said confirming data that emerged from israel last week stocks in this article pfe 26 30 1 77 but even as antibody levels are dropping seven months after immunization among some vaccine recipients most of them will remain protected against severe disease and might not yet need a third dose according to ugur sahin ceo of the german company that invented the vaccine and partnered with pfizer to develop the product for the global market the antibody titers are going down sahin said referring to the unit of measurement for antibodies against the virus the vaccine protection against the new variant is considerably lower fda targets january for pfizer covid 19 vaccine full approval decision sahin made the comments after preliminary data emerged from israel showing that people who had received the shot in january were three times more likely to get infected than those who were vaccinated in may u s centers for disease control and prevention director rochelle walensky said at a white house briefing on thursday that vaccines offer a high degree of protection against infection serious illness and death from the delta variant governments would now need to decide whether they want to administer a third shot to boost immunity or whether to allow controlled infection to progress among people who had been vaccinated in the knowledge that they likely wouldn t experience life threatening symptoms sahin said the biontech pfizer vaccine based on what is known as messenger rna technology generates twofold immunity against the coronavirus protection against infection which is provided by antibodies and protection at a cellular level where so called memory cells are trained to identify the virus defense mechanisms that destroy the pathogen any time it enters the body the weakening of the first line of defense the antibodies meant that vaccinated people could get infected again but there was no evidence that their cellular immunity was dropping since most infections wouldn t end in severe disease sahin said more vaccine mandates likely once fda grants full approvals experts say small sample preliminary data published by israel s health ministry last week showed that after two shots the vaccine was 39 effective at reducing the risk of infection and 40 effective at reducing the risk of symptomatic disease during a period when the delta variant accounted for the majority of cases the vaccine was 91 effective at preventing severe illness in the same period between june 20 and july 17 the ministry said israel already started offering a third dose to immunocompromised individuals this month and government experts are studying whether one is necessary for the wider population unlike pfizer which advocates for a third dose sahin said that he wouldn t be giving public advice on whether to use a third shot known as a booster and that he would only interpret data as they arrive from real life studies such as the one in israel this debate must proceed without us we will only supply data and governments will need to tell us what they want he said click here to get fox business on the go sahin said that in the ideal case the vaccine which is currently only sold to governments would be authorized for broad use and become available on the market for private purchases at present the shot has only been authorized for emergency use in the west meaning that governments must decide whether to make a third shot available to their citizens when the vaccine becomes available on the free market everyone will be able to make this decision for themselves sahin said
my friend greg hunter at usa watchdog weighed in recently with such a despairing outlook for the dollar that it s probably a good time to determine whether the charts support this view here s the post from his site which over the years has featured my own thoughts on deflation the global economy and other topics the fed keeps telling us that inflation is going to be transitory and things will fall in price and go back to normal soon nobody is buying this in the real world where people are watching their dollars fall in value and are paying more for just about everything in simple terms the dollar is tanking maybe this is why jp morgan is the first big bank with many to follow that is putting high net worth clients into crypto currencies bo polny says this is all part of a jubilee year which began in september of last year and ends in early september of this year polny says expect to see in the next four to five weeks a fall of the dollar the world s reserve currency this could start as early as next week causing a run into tangible asset that include gold silver and crypto currencies like bitcoin all hell is about to break loose on evil sounds ominous for sure however it flatly contradicts a forecast i ve held to for decades that deflation would ultimately wreck the global economy driving the dollar into such scarcity that many if not most americans would have to barter to survive this may seem hard to believe at the moment given the fed s unprecedented monetary blowout and the illusory prosperity it has created most of the digital cash has gone into investable assets triggering a seemingly unlikely run up in stocks during a year of covid lockdowns it has also created a real estate bubble even more extreme than the one that popped in 2008 nearly taking the global economy with it this isn t the 1970s we should note that the current inflation is very different from the one of the 1970s that was self perpetuating to the extent wages and prices drove each other higher in a seemingly endless spiral the current inflation is not self perpetuating rather it is being fed by an increase in paper wealth that will reverse and crash in the next bear market nor are people desperate to trade dollars for physical assets as occurs in a hyperinflation mainly it has been baby boomers spending a significant portion of their paper wealth on second homes in desirable locations away from urban centers still one might ask with the fed and every other central bank inflating like there s no tomorrow how could deflation possibly result the answer lies in the inescapable fact that every penny of what we collectively owe must ultimately be repaid if not by the borrower then by the lender this implies for one that when biden and the democrats forgive student loans amounting to 1 7 trillion creditors will eat the entire loss twelve zeroes worth of receivables will be wiped from their books with the stroke of the president s pen shortly thereafter yacht prices will begin to soften ever so slightly in west palm beach and the market for 20 million homes in the hamptons will appear to totter producing small tremors in aspen scarsdale and atherton now imagine this implosion multiplied a hundredfold that s what will happen when the inevitable bear market in stocks unfolds it will suck far more digital dollars into a black hole of deflation than the fed could conceivably monetize in an unrehearsed attempt to hold off a collapse the deleveraging will not stop until it has reduced the 2 quadrillion financial derivatives market to an infinitely dense singularity a thousand financiers working 24 7 and backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government will not be able to pry loose even a dime of credit from this market for at least a decade that s how long it will take at a minimum for a wrecked middle class to push their credit scores back above 400 dollar short squeeze the collapse will end our misplaced faith in a bank clearing system that is ultimately as fragile as crystal rendering atms and credit cards useless overnight money markets will seize up like a flash frozen ocean as lenders refuse to roll overnight loans instead demanding settlement in cash that s when we will discover that real cash dollars are actually in short supply in the absence of a functioning market for digital dollars the resulting short squeeze on real ones will be like the squeeze that pushed the shares of gamestop and amc into the stratosphere the comparison is appropriate because like debt issued by those two companies the dollar ultimately is just a worthless i o u for the time being however the dollar will remain under pressure despite assurances from fed bag man jerome powell that inflation has peaked we should note however that the dollar has not exactly collapsed under the weight of qe derangement to the contrary and as the chart above makes clear the greenback is down just 4 from the sweet spot of its pre pandemic trading range moreover a key long term support at 90 has survived two brutal shakedowns this year although the support could conceivably give way on renewed selling nothing in the chart says this is likely let alone that the dollar is in a condition of imminent collapse bear sinks all ships it is even arguable that the dollar index s sideways move since early 2015 has been base building for a moon shot to 120 or higher that would be extremely bad news for anyone who owes dollars since they would be far more difficult to come by unfortunately this problem will eventually enmesh us all since it is not just a matter of mortgages and car loans but also of our collective liabilities for private pensions social security and medicare these are the deflationary whales that will bear down on us when the actuarial folly that has sustained them lies fully exposed by a stock market bear the whopping debts that we owe ourselves cannot be monetized without hyperinflating the programs themselves into quick oblivion that s one reason why the economic endgame is all but certain to feature deflation rather than hyperinflation if there is a silver lining it is that deflation will visit pain on borrowers that is more or less commensurate with their sins of excess it would also leave intact the banking system and other institutional conduits of credit hyperinflation on the other hand would destroy the bond markets that enable lending throwing the economy into a state of barter indefinitely could things ever get that bad most surely it would simply reflect the deleveraging of illusory financial wealth that has grown to more than ten times the size of global trade in actual goods and services like the stock market the world s financial system is trading at an absurd multiple even more absurd is the notion that the massive debt overhang can be stage managed indefinitely with a sham taper crafted by the charlatans at the central bank

oil and gas majors are likely to report bumper second quarter earnings in the coming days energy analysts have told cnbc citing higher commodity prices international benchmark brent crude futures rose to an average of 69 a barrel in the second quarter the wall street bank said up from an average of 61 in the first three months of the year kathy hipple finance professor at bard college in new york argued it was important to note that these earnings will be announced against a backdrop of climate disasters around the globe from extreme heat in the pacific northwest to flooding in europe and china london oil and gas majors are likely to report bumper second quarter earnings in the coming days energy analysts have told cnbc following a brutal 12 months by virtually every measure the expected upswing would build on a surprisingly strong showing in the first quarter and lend further support to the oil and gas industry s efforts to pay down debt and reward investors big oil companies referring to the world s largest oil and gas majors still face significant challenges and uncertainties however get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters these include the remarkable success of shareholder activism in recent months a tremendous degree of ongoing investor skepticism and intensifying pressure to massively reduce fossil fuel use in order to meet the demands of the climate emergency europe s integrated oil sector already enjoyed surprisingly strong earnings in 1q but 2q is set to show further improvement as commodity prices took another step up analysts at morgan stanley said in a research note international benchmark brent crude futures rose to an average of 69 a barrel in the second quarter the wall street bank said up from an average of 61 in the first three months of the year the oil contract was last seen trading at around 73 57 analysts at morgan stanley noted that energy major share prices continue to be anchored by their dividend distributions notwithstanding substantial increases to free cash flow forecasts the bank said big oil dividend expectations remain rather static the energy transition confronts investors with much uncertainty and the sector s capital allocation track record has been mixed at best over the last decade hence investors are only valuing the cash flow paid to them with little credit given for cash flow retained within companies they said as the dividend outlook has not improved much and dividend yields in aggregate are already low by historical standards share prices have trailed the earnings outlook considerably in europe royal dutch shell and totalenergies will report second quarter earnings on july 29 with bp scheduled to follow on aug 3 stateside exxonmobil and chevron are expected to publish their latest figures on july 30 while conocophillips will report second quarter earnings on aug 3 luke sharrett bloomberg getty images rene santos manager for north america supply at s p global platts analytics told cnbc via email that he expects second quarter earnings from u s based energy companies to be significantly higher when compared to the same period in 2020 this is mainly due to much higher oil prices he added in addition the majors large and mid cap companies have kept capital discipline and have continued to focus on paying down debt and increasing free cash flow instead of increasing activity despite higher oil prices santos said s p global platts analytics also foresee an increase in the reporting of esg activity noting that it looks like pressure from environmental groups and fear of more regulations from the current administration is persuading many companies to do more to decrease emissions growing climate risk the oil and gas industry was sent into a tailspin last year as the coronavirus pandemic coincided with a historic fuel demand shock plunging commodity prices unprecedented write downs and tens of thousands of job cuts the torrent of bad news prompted the head of the international energy agency to suggest it may come to represent the worst year in the history of oil markets oil prices have since rebounded to multi year highs and all three of the world s main forecasting agencies opec the iea and the u s energy information administration now expect a demand led recovery to pick up speed in the second half of 2021 clark williams derry energy finance analyst at ieefa a non profit organization said he expects oil and gas companies to try to claim a clean bill of health after a bumper second quarter that s the mantra that we will hear he told cnbc via telephone however while energy majors will likely have had the opportunity to pay down some debt after generating a significant chunk of cash from their operations williams derry said that this hides the fact that these companies have not invested much in future production peter boer bloomberg getty images what i think the market is starting to signal is that it kind of likes when the oil companies shrink and aren t going all out into new production but they are using the cash that their operations are generating to pay down debt and reward investors longer term williams derry warned there s a tremendous degree of investor skepticism about the business models of oil and gas firms citing the deepening climate crisis and the urgent need to pivot away from fossil fuels we saw earlier in the year signs of a sea change in investor thinking about frankly the legal status of some of the supermajors he said referring to a series of landmark courtroom and boardroom defeats for the likes of royal dutch shell exxonmobil and chevron so even if you are riding high for a quarter or two when prices are high the reality is still that stock prices are way below the market as a whole and there s just not the investor enthusiasm for the old business model that i think these companies probably expected to see he said energy transition kathy hipple finance professor at bard college in new york told cnbc via email that she believes two key themes are likely to emerge this earnings season addressing investor concerns around climate risk and the outlining of new business models to survive a pivot toward renewables investors are future oriented and will look past a short term pop in earnings compared to last year s dismal second quarter results hipple said they want to see concrete business strategies that acknowledge the energy transition that is gathering speed she argued it was important to note that these earnings will be announced against a backdrop of climate disasters around the globe from extreme heat in the pacific northwest to flooding in europe and china oil companies that ignore climate in their earnings calls will be seen as laggards long term investors will conclude they are financially risky hipple said

discontinued treatment during the primary evaluation period or experienced breakthrough haemolysis which can lead to disabling or potentially fatal blood clots 1 the efficacy and safety of ultomiris in children and adolescents is consistent with the established profile of ultomiris in clinical trials involving adults with pnh and is representative of the broad pnh patient population seen in the real world clinical setting 2 3 pnh is an ultra rare and severe blood disorder characterised by the destruction of red blood cells that can cause a wide range of debilitating symptoms and complications including thrombosis blood clots which can occur throughout the body and result in organ damage and potentially premature death 1 4 6 austin kulasekararaj md king s college hospital london united kingdom said pnh can have a significant and devastating impact on a child s quality of life and it can be overwhelming for families to manage their disease the potential approval of ultomiris which offers the efficacy and safety already established with soliris eculizumab and requires fewer treatments each year would have a meaningful impact for children with pnh and their families marc dunoyer incoming chief executive officer alexion said this recommendation shows that ultomiris which has become the standard of care for the treatment of adults with pnh has the potential to transform the lives of children and adolescents in europe suffering from this devastating rare disease as we listen to the patient community and understand the challenges of living with a rare disease we recognize the importance of continuing to deliver options and formulations that enhance patient care and disease management the chmp recommended the expanded use of ultomiris to include children with a body weight of 10 kg or above and adolescents with pnh who experience haemolysis with clinical symptom s indicative of high disease activity as well as for individuals who are clinically stable after having been treated with solirisfor at least the past six months ultomiris was first approved in the eu in 2019 for the treatment of adults with pnh and is also approved in the eu for the treatment of adults and children with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome ahus in june 2021 the us food and drug administration approved the expanded use of ultomiris to include children one month of age and older and adolescents with pnh the first and only treatment for this age group in the us pnh paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria pnh is a serious ultra rare blood disorder with devastating consequences it is characterised by the destruction of red blood cells which is also referred to as haemolysis pnh occurs when the complement system a part of the body s immune system over responds leading the body to attack its own red blood cells pnh often goes unrecognised with delays in diagnosis from one to more than five years patients with pnh may experience a range of symptoms such as fatigue difficulty swallowing shortness of breath abdominal pain erectile dysfunction dark coloured urine and anaemia the most devastating consequence of chronic haemolysis is the formation of blood clots which can occur in blood vessels throughout the body damage vital organs and potentially lead to premature death the prognosis of pnh can be poor in many cases so a timely and accurate diagnosis in addition to appropriate treatment is critical to improving patient outcomes ultomiris ultomiris ravulizumab the first and only long acting c5 complement inhibitor offers immediate complete and sustained complement inhibition the medication works by inhibiting the c5 protein in the terminal complement cascade a part of the body s immune system when activated in an uncontrolled manner the complement cascade over responds leading the body to attack its own healthy cells ultomiris is administered intravenously every eight weeks or for paediatric patients less than 20 kg every four weeks following a loading dose ultomiris is approved in the us for the treatment of adults and children one month of age and older with pnh as well as in the eu and japan as a treatment for adults with pnh it is also approved in the us for ahus to inhibit complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in adult and paediatric one month of age and older patients in the eu for the treatment of adults and children with a body weight of at least 10 kg with ahus as well as in japan for adults and children with ahus alexion alexion astrazeneca rare disease is the group within astrazeneca

this month two right whales in the gulf of st lawrence were found entangled in fishing gear one a female was first spotted entangled off cape cod last year but rescuers were not able to fully free her the other a male is believed to have become entangled in the gulf hunted to near extinction before a partial whaling ban in 1935 north atlantic right whales are once more critically endangered with only 356 left the main threat remains human contact entanglement in fishing gear and ship strikes fatal encounters caused in part by the whales migratory shift into canada s snow crab grounds have soared more than a tenth of the population died or were seriously injured between 2017 and 2021 mostly in canada and new england one of the threats they face is from the growing crab and lobster fisheries the whales migrate from their calving grounds in florida to feed in canada putting them on a collision course with the pots and traps view image in fullscreen a female north atlantic right whale entangled in fishing gear in 2010 months later unable to swim or feed properly she was dead photograph ap we re talking millions of lines placed in the water every year says kate o connell a marine wildlife consultant for the animal welfare institute these animals are running the gauntlet and it s getting harder and harder for them to survive when a whale gets entangled ropes from buoys on the surface to the seabed traps can become embedded in its skin weighing it down and leaving it unable to swim or feed properly leading to a really traumatising death o connell says but what makes it even more concerning to conservationists is that some of the fisheries they say threaten the right whale were certified as sustainable by the world s largest fisheries certification programme the marine stewardship council the msc which grants the right to use its well known blue tick label on products has grown from 315 certified fisheries in 2017 to 421 representing 14 of all global fish landings in the last year its labelled products were worth 12bn 9 5bn in the absence of governments looking after our oceans the msc is definitely the best we ve got in terms of consumer labels according to ruth westcott of the environmental alliance sustain the msc hit the headlines in march however when the controversial netflix documentary seaspiracy accused it of certifying fisheries with a high level of bycatch whereby species such as dolphins and turtles are caught in fishing nets and said its certification was too easily achieved the msc denied the allegations and alongside several other organisations accused the film makers of making misleading claims the producers deny this but the plight of right whales shows how fine a line the msc has to walk between conservationists and the fishing industry and has reignited a fierce debate over what it means when you see a blue msc label on a fish package in the supermarket certainly the presence of msc certified fisheries along the migration route of one of the world s most endangered mammals has become emblematic of the contradictions the organisation has to confront even one dead whale a year brings the species closer to extinction another ecolabel from the conservation group wwf takes a different tack this month wwf hong kong revised its seafood guide to downgrade boston lobster the generic chinese term for all two clawed american lobster species to red avoid because its harvesting grounds overlap with the habitat of north atlantic right whales why then conservationists say would msc give any fishery in the right whales range the green light to fish there q a seafood labels show marine stewardship council s blue tick seafood with a blue tick from the msc can be traced back to a fishery that is certified as sustainable based on whether the stock is heathy and well managed and whether the fishery is minimising its impact on other species and the wider ecosystem to be certified fisheries must submit to and pay for an independent audit marine conservation society s good fish guide the uk based mcs runs a regularly updated good fish guide to advise consumers on which seafood is most sustainable the best scientific advice available is used to create a traffic light system of ratings from 1 5 in which one is best choice and five is fish to avoid based on the health of the population how fishing is controlled and the effects on the wider environment an existing certification with msc can improve the scores monterey bay aquarium seafood watch a us based advisory list along the same traffic light system as the mcs s good fish guide it defines sustainable seafood as that which comes from sources that can maintain or increase production without jeopardising the structure and function of affected ecosystems wwf wwf like mcs and the mba draws from the best available scientific data to provide seafood guides of the most sustainable fish to choose in several countries based on species type photograph graeme robertson graeme robertson was this helpful thank you for your feedback critics also argue that the very nature of the msc s model with fisheries paying to be certified poses a conflict of interest is the msc the world s biggest fisheries certification scheme still fit for purpose the heart of the matter may come down to the fact that the msc exists not just to protect the environment but also to ensure thriving fisheries rupert howes msc chief executive says it is about resource management not pure conservation view image in fullscreen the marine stewardship council logo on a tin of tuna certified as sustainable seafood nothing carries the label without traceability says the msc photograph steven may alamy we re passionate about oceans and marine ecosystems and ocean resilience he says but we re also deeply concerned about global food insecurity and indeed the 500m livelihoods the fao estimate depend on the global seafood industry he admits that the organisation is not perfect and says the level of criticism is difficult there s a tendency for everybody to want us to resolve their particular issues howes says and there s a limit we re already complex and costly compared with other assurances he is at pains to point out what the msc does well nothing carries the label without traceability nothing carries the label without a recertification every five years and the audit every year he argues that the msc system is vastly superior to the industry self certifying he also notes that while some organisations are promoting improvement projects many have no traceability action plan or outcome unlike some other ecolabels with desk based research howe says the msc works with fisheries to drive improvements stakeholders sometimes feel because we re working with the markets that it s compromised but it isn t he says to be certified by msc takes up to 18 months first a fishery is assessed by independent conformity assessment bodies cabs they visit the fishery consult experts and consider all available data to decide whether it meets msc criteria there are several checks and balances including third party monitoring of the cabs and an independent evaluation of the assessment in addition environmental organisations can object to certification which often results in additional conditions placed on fisheries the msc is just trying to empower consumers to do their part to reward the ones that are doing the right thing rupert howes msc chief executive sixteen of its 421 fisheries are currently suspended including the gulf of maine lobster fishery and the gulf of st lawrence snow crab fishery which has now withdrawn from the msc altogether in the past five years a quarter of all new assessments ended without certification but since 2001 msc said it had received 51 objections before certification which resulted in three fisheries not being certified howes believes the market model is driving a more sustainable ocean the msc is just trying to empower consumers to do their part to reward in our mind the ones that are doing the right thing but the right thing means different things to different people scores of organisations have expressed concern that the msc s certification process does not properly account for bycatch particularly of sharks and cetaceans in 2018 a group of 66 conservation groups and academics accused the msc of not paying enough attention to the protection of species not specifically targeted by fisheries view image in fullscreen atlantic snow crabs caught in canada the gulf of st lawrence snow crab fishery which was suspended by the msc has now withdrawn from the scheme altogether photograph charline xia newfoundland collection alamy conservationists argue the msc lacks a gut check on endangered species and right whales are a good example in 2017 due to threats to endangered species o connell and 53 international organisations urged the msc to reassess a number of fisheries including the gulf of maine lobster fishery the same year the msc suspended a sustainable snow crab fishery the gulf of st lawrence after right whales were found dead in its fishing gear but it did not suspend the lobster fishery until 2020 after the federal judge had ruled that us fishing authorities had overlooked the impact of lobster fisheries on right whales the msc argues that certification is part of the solution to right whale entanglement because it drives good practice such as monitoring and taking steps to avoid interactions in the case of the right whales the cabs that certified the fisheries in question have said there is no evidence of them causing a threat and that it imposed conditions on some to monitor and reduce the risk since the gulf of st lawrence deaths and suspension in 2017 there have been no reports of right whale deaths within an msc certified fishery according to the msc its fisheries used colour coded gear it said to identify which fishery was responsible for any entanglements that occur and if issues arose it could audit and investigate quickly last month however a paper co authored by amy knowlton a senior scientist at the anderson cabot center for ocean life at the new england aquarium reported an alarming reduction in the size of right whales suggesting their stunted growth could be the result of hauling around fishing gear it is estimated that 85 of right whales have suffered at least one entanglement a lot of fisheries are in denial they are part of the problem says knowlton one of her biggest concerns she says is the need to get this firm evidence before a fishery will do anything we don t know where the majority of these entanglements occur but we do know they occur throughout the range a lot of fisheries are in denial they are part of the problem amy knowlton marine scientist today six lobster and snow crab trap and pot fisheries within the right whales range remain msc certified as sustainable but none of them should be in o connell s opinion given the cumulative risk from multiple fishing lines the msc s guidelines remain weak she says and are in desperate need of a thorough review the msc says it is doing just that undertaking a review of the fishery standard on which it bases its certification as part of the review it has proposed a more precautionary approach to endangered threatened and protected etp species says rohan currey the msc s chief science and standards officer every marine mammal reptile amphibian and seabird would now all be regarded as etp species irrespective of how abundant it is this would says currey trigger a condition for certified fisheries to reduce its bycatch or unintentional catch of these animals he says the review will examine the possibility of including sharks and other species and also look at requirements for independent data collection for instance using observers or electronic monitoring as well as potentially broadening the criteria for cumulative risks to a fishery the review will end in 2022 however because of the fao s rules allowing fisheries three years to comply any changes would not be likely to take effect until at least 2023 for new fisheries and 2025 for those already in the scheme in the meantime the msc s own advisory council is growing concerned rory crawford of birdlife international one of the advisory council stakeholders conducted a study of 23 fisheries in 2019 and found that only three were actively working to monitor and minimise bycatch view image in fullscreen officials from fisheries and oceans canada collect tissue from a dead north atlantic right whale in the gulf of st lawrence these animals are running the gauntlet says one conservationist photograph reuters consumers cannot be fully confident that certified fish comes without impacts on non target species from sharks to seabirds to whales he concluded given that standards have not changed since 2019 he says there are still msc certified fisheries that are not doing their best to minimise seabird bycatch such as bird scaring or weighted lines as a consumer purchasing a blue tick product i d want to know that every effort was being made to minimise or even eliminate non target bycatch irrespective of whether it s a critically endangered tristan albatross or least concern common guillemot he says ruth westcott campaign coordinator at the environmental alliance sustain says that in the absence of governments looking after our oceans the msc is definitely the best we ve got in terms of labels while the system has failed it was not all doom and gloom for the consumer she said as a consumer you can buy from fishmongers or direct from a fishery as close to the source as possible then look at the msc or mcs rating scheme crawford notes that msc certification has resulted in improvements for some fisheries such as the namibian hake where seabird bycatch fell by 90 he wants the msc to require independent data as well as explicit requirements that fisheries minimise bycatch of species of least concern such as eider ducks and northern fulmars which fisheries catch in their thousands wwf which co created the msc scheme two decades ago is perhaps the highest profile organisation calling for it to reform wwf has already lodged objections to several proposed certified fisheries and says the msc should be more rigorous in its standards and needs to apply the precautionary principle as a matter of course last year wwf and the pew charitable trusts objected to the msc s certification of its first bluefin tuna fishery saying it was too early to declare the stock fully recovered an audit of the assessment of the fishery identified minor nonconformity issues including around the impartiality of the cab which msc said had since been addressed i would not trust all of the fisheries to be sustainable says giuseppe di carlo wwf s director of the wwf mediterranean marine initiative wwf expects msc to make reforms in the standard and also in the assurance process the implementation of standards he says there is a conflict of interest at the heart of the scheme because the fisheries pay the cabs fees of 20 000 to 500 000 for the assessment the msc also charges retailers royalties of up to 0 5 of the net wholesale value of seafood sold for using its label the msc says any risk is mitigated by numerous reviews and consultations to ensure all the evidence is fairly and correctly interpreted a formal objection process is also available for further scrutiny it says in the meantime it is likely to be four years before most fisheries will be pressed to make any improvements at all assuming the msc review even recommends they do so drastic changes are going on increasing biodiversity loss climate change overfishing says o connell right whales don t have time for all this to be figured out they re coming to the point where they will hit a tipping point and it will be too late however msc insisted action was already being taken and said it is not a case of waiting for the outcome of the fisheries standards review to help right whales as for the bigger picture says michelle cho a specialist in bycatch at the anderson cabot center the msc needs to take a hard look at itself there s a lot of criteria they need to follow there are the assessment bodies and they have their guidance on how to score things says cho but a lot of us feel that gut check is not there if things are cumulatively contributing to a species going extinct is that really sustainable
