getty for decades grocery stores have followed a standard basic layout shelf stable items on long aisles in the middle fresh produce and dairy items around the outside and attention grabbing items on end caps the stores were designed to keep customers inside to spend more money but with the covid pandemic and the huge growth of grocery pickup and delivery what customers are looking for in a grocery experience has changed and the store design must change to go with it apps like instacart and shipt are gaining popularity and taking away customers who used to shop in stores to gain those customers back stores are updating their layouts to create more convenient experiences here s what you need to know to create a more convenient and enticing in store grocery trip to get a leg up on delivery apps and maximize the customer experience 1 streamline product layout for faster shopping while customers used to enjoy wandering the aisles to find what they need today many customers are trying to get in and out of the grocery store as quickly as possible what started as a desire to limit germ exposure with shorter trips is now expanding to an overall desire for convenience and speed instead of having to walk through the entire store to the back to pick up a gallon of milk customers want to be able to quickly pick it up towards the front of the store stores are responding to the need by putting common items towards the front or accessible places a streamlined design is a win for stores and customers it creates faster shopping trips that save time while also potentially increasing the number of shoppers who visit the store more people spending less time in the store to get the same number of items could be big for grocers walmart recently unveiled a streamlined redesign that will be in 1 000 stores by the end of 2021 the adjustments are small but designed to point customers in the right direction and get them to the items they need without wandering walmart is consolidating the toy baby and electronics sections into dedicated areas instead of spreading items throughout the store stores will also have much more signage to point shoppers in the right direction as well as clearly marked aisles with numbers and letters to find an item s exact location 2 integrate digital shopping tools to blur online and in person shopping just like many other industries grocery is beginning to blur the line between online and in person shopping in redesigned grocery stores each customer s phone is an important part of the streamlined experience target s app shows the exact location of each item and gives customers options of how to purchase their items either in store delivery or curbside pickup the whole foods app sends alerts when customers are near a store to showcase items that the customer may like albertsons is integrating ai into its app for predictive grocery list making walmart s streamlined app shows where products are located and then helps them follow a map to their exact location in the store the walmart redesign was inspired by airports another place that people don t want to spend more time than needed and that depends on great signage and layout to get people where they need to be kroger recently unveiled its krogo digital shopping carts that automatically ring up purchases as shoppers put items in the cart aside from integrating the digital experience the carts also direct customers to related items such as pointing customers to salsa after they put tortilla chips in their cart when they are done customers simply take their groceries and walk out without waiting in a checkout line 3 group related items for convenience the way items are grouped within grocery stores is also changing to create a more connected experience and to follow the model of grocery delivery apps like instacart when customers shop through grocery delivery apps they see recommendations of items related to what s already in their cart and can quickly add new things the same concept applies to in store groupings to put related items together in the old model a customer shopping for ingredients to make tacos likely has to traverse the store to get each ingredient but a new approach to grouping ingredients puts things together like salsa and tortilla chips or croutons and salad dressing many target locations now stock ice cream toppings on an end cap in the freezer aisle and put bagels and cream cheese near each other for a faster shopping experience 4 improve pickup area visibility and flow once pushed to the back corner of the parking lot by the loading docks pickup areas are getting a much needed upgrade as more customers switch to grocery pickup many stores including walmart are building out pickup areas with better signage and traffic flow in easy to reach areas of the parking lot other stores could head in the direction of drive thru pickup areas similar to fast food restaurants or automated pickup towers for customers to retrieve orders on their own wegmans a chain beloved by customers for its hot and cold food bars recently added additional pickup lanes at some stores one for grocery pickup and another for food service 5 add unique experiences and gathering spaces aside from creating fast and convenient experiences many grocery stores are also differentiating themselves by focusing on experiences this was a major focus for the industry before it was derailed by covid but the opportunity to offer a place to gather learn and experience can provide grocery stores a competitive advantage and bring customers in the store instead of just shopping online in texas h e b opened a food hall that features six local restaurants albertson s opened its largest store ever in idaho that aims to imitate a market street with stations selling popcorn customized pizza straight from the oven and a wine cellar with a sommelier winn dixie recently renovated 32 stores with taprooms fresh seafood stations and grab and go meals to reflect local communities whole foods took some of its experiential features online with virtual cooking classes to showcase products from afar from made to order sushi bars to dine in eating areas and rooftop bars grocery stores are becoming community hubs to offer more than just quick grocery service covid changed the face of grocery forever with an increased push for pickup and delivery grocery chains are updating their physical stores to provide convenient customer first experiences blake morgan is a customer experience futurist keynote speaker and the author of

although joe biden won the 2020 presidential election there is still misinformation circulating about the election results in maricopa county ariz in the november 2020 presidential election joe biden defeated former president donald trump by over 45 000 votes in maricopa county arizona which is the state s largest county and typically a republican stronghold but there is still misinformation circulating around that election in the state on monday may 17 the republican led maricopa county board of supervisors called for an end to an election audit that began on april 23 debunking several claims made by arizona senate republicans that there was any fraud in connection to the 2020 presidential election results in the county the board sent a scathing letter in response to arizona state senate president karen fann s claims that the county deleted important data mishandled the ballots and did not comply with legislative subpoenas in the letter the board also acknowledged a conspiracy theory that alleges the election boxes were stuffed with 40 000 ballots from asia and those ballots may contain bamboo fibers the question is there any evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election the sources maricopa county board of supervisors megan gilbertson communications director for the maricopa county elections department jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services kinder chambers independent textiles expert and bamboo guru with the texas bamboo society the answer no there is no evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election while the arizona election audit has not yet been finalized the manufacturer of maricopa county s election ballots told verify the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills what we found on may 5 dennis welch a political journalist based in phoenix interviewed an official who claimed he was helping oversee the election audit in arizona the official identified as john brakey of audit usa said he was looking for bamboo fibers because of an accusation that 40 000 ballots from southeast asia were flown to arizona and stuffed into the ballot boxes ahead of the 2020 presidential election in a video posted on twitter by welch brakey claimed the audit was being conducted because people in southeast asia use bamboo in their paper while also making it clear that he did not actually believe the claim himself verify reached out to megan gilbertson the communications director for the maricopa county elections department who told us we use vote secure paper for our 19 inch ballots in maricopa county meanwhile jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services which is the manufacturer of all the ballots used in maricopa county during the 2020 presidential election said in a statement that the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills if auditors are concerned about the injection of tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots that may have come from outside the united states they should think through how this would be logistically impossible to accomplish said ellington for example 10 000 ballots is physically a lot of paper that would need to be stored and transported and then successfully smuggled into a tabulation center any such effort would be easily detected kinder chambers an independent textiles expert told verify that while bamboo paper has been made by hand in china for centuries in the united states there has never been that much paper made with bamboo chambers said the only american made paper with bamboo was created in 1995 by one manufacturer who apparently made one big batch and never made any more he says it was never made for commercial use there is no general paper that has some bamboo fibers in the u s that kind of quality is for toilet paper and i don t mean like american quality more like europe in the bathrooms of europe said chambers we don t see any bamboo paper coming out of china they make clothing t shirts sleep clothing and casual clothing bamboo paper stock would be easily recognizable especially by feel in her letter to the maricopa county board of supervisors arizona senate president karen fann invited the board to attend a meeting at the arizona state capitol on tuesday may 18 requesting that they bring officials from the elections department who would have knowledge of their elections procedures in its response the board said we will not be attending we will not be responding to any additional inquiries from your auditors their failure to understand basic election processes is an indication you didn t get the best people to perform in your political theatre we have wasted enough county resources people s tax dollars are real your auditors are not we express our united view that your audit no matter what your intentions were in the beginning has become a spectacle that is harming all of us our state has become a laughingstock you are using purple lights and spinning tables you are hunting for bamboo these are not things that serious auditors of elections do fann in a may 17 tweet said she never officially received the letter from the board claiming she got a copy from cbs news hours after it was released to the public according to a 12 news report the audit won t overturn the results of the presidential or u s senate votes in arizona because those results have already been certified under state law and supported by maricopa county audits for now there is no firm end date of when the audit will be completed but reporter brahm resnik writes the glacial pace of the recount suggests it could go into late july or august a total of almost four months unless the counting staff is beefed up

themselves for such a scenario by putting their money into stocks that afforded them either great short term returns or healthy dividend payments life was easier the dawn of the new year and the

inc nasdaq amzn is one of the best stocks to buy for early retirement in its q1 2021 investor letter polen capital an investment management firm highlighted a few stocks and amazon com inc nasdaq amzn was one of them here is what the fund said we purchased amazon in february 2021 which accounts for 5 of the portfolio s weighting for most of the last decade amazon did not meet our guardrails we also did not have enough visibility into future free cash flow margins to indicate that the company would sustainably meet our guardrails and relatedly if valuation supported the double digit annualized returns we seek we now believe we have that visibility in 2008 almost all of amazon s revenue and operating profits came from its e commerce business amazon prime and amazon web services aws were new and relatively small back then the company had roughly 5 operating profit margins overall entirely from the e commerce business in 2009 the company began harvesting its retail business profits to accelerate investment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure globally and very heavily build out and scale aws data centers the company s return on equity began to decline at that time and turned negative for three full years from mid 2012 to mid 2015 margins and free cash flow declined similarly so beginning in 2010 and continuing to mid 2018 amazon s business was outside our guardrails we chose to stick to our guardrails and not own amazon amazon s profit drivers have changed quite dramatically over the years starting in the back half of 2018 amazon came back above our hurdles revenue generation overcame ongoing heavy investments in areas such as delivery infrastructure data center infrastructure and shipping our research suggests that today after considering cost allocation amazon s underlying profit drivers from higher margin aws and advertising could grow much faster than its low margin e commerce business excluding prime its historical driver of revenues and operating profits amazon prime aws and advertising together account for only about 20 of revenue today but we believe over 150 of operating profits looking forward growth higher margin businesses means amazon s total margins and profit dollars could rise quite dramatically it is important to note that amazon proved to be an exception to our guardrails based on our experience very few companies that remain outside our guardrails for an extended period operate from a position of competitive strength but rather from a position of competitive pressure today we feel we have better visibility into the future earnings growth and margins from aws and advertising and believe these could drive 30 annual earnings growth for the next five years even with significant p e multiple compression we would still expect double digit investment returns 7 microsoft corporation nasdaq msft number of hedge fund holders 258 microsoft corporation nasdaq msft is a washington based technology company

the markets it competes for are enormous which gives the company the ability to compound at scale in the past quarter alone the company generated over 40 billion in revenue representing a 17 growth rate the inherent operating leverage in microsoft s business model continues and led to 34 earnings growth this past quarter despite the broad rotation we saw in the first quarter and microsoft s

dominate the health insurance industry in the coming years overall an ageing population across the globe increasingly suffering from diseases such as arthritis type 2 diabetes cancer and heart problems will also spur insurance market growth a lack of insurance awareness especially in developing economies might offset some of these gains the tech sector also seems to be playing a bigger role in the health industry with each passing year this tech enabled disruption has also touched other parts of the economy like the finance world the entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices

million against the consensus of 822 million inclusive of a preliminary estimate of almost 30 million of revenue generated from direct contracting just like humana inc nyse hum cvs health corporation nyse cvs and unitedhealth group incorporated nyse unh clover health investments corp nasdaq clov is a top health insurance stock to buy 9 cigna corporation nyse ci number of hedge fund holders 53 cigna corporation nyse ci is a connecticut based health insurance firm founded in 1981 it is placed ninth on our list of top health insurance stocks to buy cigna stock has returned more than 38 to investors over the past twelve months in addition to insurance plans the firm markets commercial health services that include medical pharmacy behavioral health dental vision health advocacy programs as well as other products and services for insured and self insured customers on may 7 cigna corporation nyse ci posted earnings for the first quarter of 2021 reporting earnings per share of 4 73 beating market predictions by 0 35 the revenue over the period was 41 billion beating market estimates by 730 million out of the hedge funds being tracked by insider monkey new york based investment firm glenview capital is a leading shareholder in cigna corporation nyse ci with 1 8 million shares worth more than 449 million just like humana inc nyse hum cvs health corporation nyse cvs and unitedhealth group incorporated nyse unh cigna corporation nyse ci is a top health insurance stock to buy in its q4 2020 investor letter artisan partners limited partnership an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and cigna corporation nyse ci was one of them here is what the fund said new purchases include cigna cigna is a leading managed care company which operates through the following major segments health services integrated medical international markets and group disability it s one of the few managed care organizations in the united states with the scale and size to compete effectively cigna has recently focused on deleveraging its balance sheet and further diversifying its business after completing the express scripts acquisition in late 2018 additionally the company has partnered with amazon which will offer two new pharmacy options including a self pay offering cigna will administer the self pay option through its health services division evernorth the partnership should be one of many strong earnings drivers for cigna which we believe is currently trading at an attractive valuation 8 centene corporation nyse cnc number of hedge fund holders 53 centene corporation nyse cnc is a missouri based health insurance company founded in 1984 it is ranked eighth on our list of top health insurance stocks to buy centene stock has returned more than 13 to investors over the past year the company also has a managed care division that offers health coverage to people through government subsidized programs state funded health insurance programs for children as well as long term services and support for foster care and care of the aged blind or disabled individuals in earnings results for the first three months of 2021 posted in late april centene corporation nyse cnc reported earnings per share of 1 63 beating market predictions by 0 10 the revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was just shy of 30 billion up 15 year on year in its q3 2020 investor letter fpa capital fund an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and centene corporation nyse cnc was one of them here is what the fund said cnc was the fund s 2nd worst performer for the quarter the company is a managed care organization discussed in more detail in prior commentaries the stock declined on election uncertainty and on the increased likelihood that the supreme court might strike down the affordable care act due to the death of supreme court justice ginsburg cnc does have the headline risk but the stock is trading at 10x 2021 price to earnings multiple versus its long term historical average of 16x 6 its covid 19 costs appear to be in line with expectations and the worst long term effect from a repeal of the affordable care act is estimated to be a 10 hit to earnings 7 we believe that any likely political scenarios would not cause a major longterm disruption to the company while its valuation appears to price in a much more dire scenario number of hedge fund holders 58 anthem inc nyse antm is an indiana based health insurance firm founded in 2004 it is placed seventh on our list of top health insurance stocks to buy anthem stock has returned more than 42 to investors over the past twelve months the firm has more than 40 million customers and is one of the largest for profit healthcare firms in the united states anthem inc nyse antm has more than three major operating divisions that include commercial and specialty business government business ingeniorx and others anthem inc nyse antm posted earnings results for the first three months of 2021 on april 21 reporting a revenue of more than 32 billion up more than 9 year on year but missing market estimates by more than 910 million out of the hedge funds being tracked by insider monkey new york based investment firm eagle capital management is a leading shareholder in anthem inc nyse antm with 2 2 million shares worth more than 797 million just like humana inc nyse hum cvs health corporation nyse cvs and unitedhealth group incorporated nyse unh anthem inc nyse antm is a top health insurance stock to buy in its q4 2020 investor letter nomadic value partners an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and anthem inc nyse antm was one of them here is what the fund said in mid december we sold our position in anthem nyse antm at the end of q3 the blue cross blue shield association bcbsa the umbrella organization for blues across the country made a preliminary proposal to settle a multi year anti trust case for 2 67 billion this payment is to be made proportionate by each bcbsa health plan the bcbsa covers about 100 million members nationwide and antm represents about 40 of total bcbsa membership antm s proportionate payment could be a 1 billion charge nearly 25 of its expected 2020 earnings interestingly the share price rallied on the news because included in the settlement proposal was bcbsa agreeing to lift restrictions on local bcbs plan geographic boundaries bcbs plans can begin to horizontally integrate and compete in markets historically excluded from reach the more i ve thought about antm s position in this hypothetical marketplace the more i ve become less optimistic on them while consolidation certainly brings better economics to the surviving health plan i think it is only realistically available to much smaller companies looking back at anti trust cases within healthcare over the last decade the large health insurance companies are generally blocked from major horizontal acquisitions why would this change this leaves antm competing in an increasingly crowded marketplace and the only strategy left to grow is to super charge their vertical integration antm is behind in integration and i don t like situations where a company is being forced to play catch up number of hedge fund holders 53 humana inc nyse hum is a kentucky based health insurance firm founded in 1961 it is ranked second on our list of top health insurance stocks to buy humana stock has returned more than 13 to investors over the past twelve months the company is among the largest health insurance providers in the united states and is also a member of the fortune 500 the company has more than 17 million members in medical benefit plans and more than 5 million utilizing specialty products marketed by the firm in quarterly earnings for the first three months of 2021 posted in april humana inc nyse hum reported earnings per share of 7 67 beating market predictions by 0 63 the revenue for the period was over 20 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 59 hedge funds in the database of insider monkey held stakes worth 3 9 billion in humana inc nyse hum down from 61 in the preceding quarter worth 4 8 billion just like unitedhealth group incorporated nyse unh and cvs health corporation nyse cvs humana inc nyse hum is a top health insurance stock to buy in its q1 2021 investor letter oakmark funds an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and humana inc nyse hum was one of them here is what the fund said the third new purchase was humana the industry leader and near pure play in the fastest growing sector of managed care medicare advantage each year more seniors choose medicare advantage over traditional medicare due to the compelling combination of lower costs and expanded benefits humana s scale advantages and focus on senior care allow the company to make targeted investments in its members health resulting in fewer unnecessary hospitalizations and lower chronic care costs much of these savings are then reinvested in the health plan resulting in a continuously improving customer value proposition the company s brand also resonates well in the marketplace and has helped drive double digit annual membership growth over the past decade well above the rest of the industry further we believe humana has a long runway ahead as it benefits from an aging population and continued conversion of the approximately 60 of seniors who are still enrolled in traditional medicare yet humana s shares are currently trading at a nearly 20 discount to the s p 500 earnings multiple which we believe doesn t give the company enough credit for its durable competitive advantages and strong secular growth outlook click to continue reading and see top 5 health insurance

40 volcanoes are erupting right now and 34 of them are along the ring of fire economic collapse may 14 2015 you may not have noticed but our planet is becoming increasingly unstable according to volcano discovery 40 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now and only 6 of them are not along the ring of fire if that sounds like a very high number to you that is because it is a very high number as i have written about previously there were a total of 3 542 volcanic eruptions during the entire 20th century when you divide that number by 100 that gives you an average of about 35 volcanic eruptions per year so the number of volcanoes that are erupting right now is well above the 20th century s average for an entire calendar year and of course we are witnessing a tremendous amount of earthquake activity as well nepal was just hit by the worst earthquake that it had seen in 80 years and scientists are telling us that the himalayas actually dropped by an astounding 3 feet as a result of that one earthquake how much more does our planet have to shake before people start paying attention of course the things that we have been seeing lately are part of a much larger long term trend seismic activity appears to have been getting stronger over the past few decades and now things really seem to be accelerating the following is how one news source recently summarized what we have been witnessing if it seems like earthquakes and erupting volcanoes are happening more frequently that s because they are looking at global magnitude six m6 or greater from 1980 to 1989 there was an average of 108 5 earthquakes per year from 2000 to 2009 the planet averaged 160 9 earthquakes per year that is a 38 9 increase of m6 earthquakes in recent years unrest also seems to be growing among the world s super volcanoes iceland which is home to some of the most dangerous volcanoes on the planet santorini in greece uturuncu in bolivia the yellowstone and long valley calderas in the u s laguna del maule in chile italy s campi flegrei almost all of the world s active super volcanic systems are now exhibiting some signs of inflation an early indication that pressure is building in these volcanic systems but of course most americans are never going to care about any of this until it starts affecting them personally well perhaps they should start paying attention to the warning signs in recent weeks we have seen significant earthquakes in michigan texas mississippi california idaho and washington in addition it is being reported that pressure is building in dormant volcanoes in arizona and california just because we have not had a killer earthquake or a large volcanic eruption in the u s in recent years does not mean that it will always be that way right now the entire planet appears to be waking up and this especially seems to be true of the ring of fire if you are not familiar with the ring of fire just imagine a giant ring that runs around the outer perimeter of the pacific ocean approximately 90 percent of all earthquakes and approximately 75 percent of all volcanic eruptions occur within this area and the entire west coast of north america is considered to be part of the ring of fire for so long the west coast has been incredibly blessed not to have experienced a major seismic event but scientists tell us that it is only a matter of time and right now just about every other part of the ring of fire is shaking violently for example a magnitude 6 8 earthquake just hit japan on wednesday a magnitude 6 8 earthquake that shook northeast japan on wednesday was an aftershock of the devastating 2011 quake that triggered a massive tsunami and nuclear power plant meltdown we consider this morning s earthquake to be an aftershock of the 2011 northeastern pacific earthquake said yohei hasegawa an official at the japanese meteorological agency the temblor which struck just after 6 a m local time 5 p m et tuesday was sparked by the pacific tectonic plate subducting or moving under the main land plate he added hasegawa warned that more tremors may be on the way one japanese expert is warning that japan might have entered an era of great earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and considering the immense devastation that the great earthquake and tsunami of 2011 caused that is a very sobering assessment meanwhile a series of very strong earthquakes have struck papua new guinea recently as well the following comes from the washington post a powerful earthquake rattled papua new guinea on thursday the fourth strong quake to hit the south pacific island nation in a week the temblor prompted officials to issue a local tsunami warning but it was lifted shortly afterward with no reports of damage the 7 1 magnitude quake struck about 150 kilometers 94 miles southwest of the town of panguna on bougainville island at a depth of 23 kilometers 14 miles the u s geological survey reported once again just because things have always been a certain way does not mean that they will always be that way as americans we are not accustomed to being concerned about major earthquakes and massive volcanic eruptions but that could soon change in a big way the truth is that our planet and our sun are changing in ways that are unpredictable and that our scientists don t completely understand for example a recent livescience article discussed the fact that scientists are deeply puzzled by the fact that the magnetic field of our planet is getting weaker 10 times faster than previously believed scientists already know that magnetic north shifts once every few hundred thousand years the magnetic poles flip so that a compass would point south instead of north while changes in magnetic field strength are part of this normal flipping cycle data from swarm have shown the field is starting to weaken faster than in the past previously researchers estimated the field was weakening about 5 percent per century but the new data revealed the field is actually weakening at 5 percent per decade or 10 times faster than thought as such rather than the full flip occurring in about 2 000 years as was predicted the new data suggest it could happen sooner and in a previous article i discussed how one scientist has discovered that activity on the sun is declining at a faster pace than at any time in the last 9300 years right now i don t pretend to have all the answers for why these things are happening but clearly some very unusual things are taking place so what do you think do you believe that you know why our planet and our sun are experiencing such dramatic changes please feel free to add to the discussion by posting a comment below

geneva switzerland world health organization officials said on may 21 that six to eight million people may have died throughout the world to date during the ongoing covid pandemic in releasing its annual world health statistics report the who estimated that total deaths from the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 were at least 3 million in 2020 which would be 1 2 million more than reported we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to covid 19 the report said this number would truly be two to three times higher so i think safely about 6 to 8 million deaths could be an estimate on a cautionary note said samira asma who s assistant director general in its data and analytics division during a press briefing who data analyst william msemburi said the higher estimate of deaths included both unreported covid 19 deaths as well as indirect deaths due to the lack of hospital beds and medical equipment the challenge is that the reported covid 19 is an undercount of that full impact msemburi said as quoted by reuters

a glass of milk a day keeps heart disease away new study finds regular drinkers slash risk of coronary disease or strokes as much as 14 glass of milk each day can reduce the risk of suffering from heart disease new global study also found milk drinkers have lower levels of cholesterol researchers studied health information of two million britons and americans a glass of milk each day can significantly reduce the risk of suffering from heart disease according to a new global study a team of researchers also found milk drinkers have lower levels of cholesterol which can block arteries and lead to heart attacks or strokes those who drink milk each day slashed their risk of coronary heart disease by 14 per cent the study authors said in a release by studying the health information of two million britons and americans scientists discovered those with a mutation enabling them to consume large amounts of milk were less prone to cardiovascular illnesses a glass of milk each day can significantly reduce the risk of suffering from heart disease according to a new global study stock image used the new finding comes as a growing body of evidence is showing that dairy products can actually be good for your health past studies had previously concluded that dairy products were bad professor vimal karani lead author and a nutritionist at the university of reading said we found that among participants with a genetic variation that we associated with higher milk intake they had higher bmi body fat but importantly had lower levels of good and bad cholesterol we also found that those with the genetic variation had a significantly lower risk of coronary heart disease all of this suggests that reducing the intake of milk might not be necessary for preventing cardiovascular diseases the international team were unable to find a link between regular milk consumption and increased levels of cholesterol a team of researchers also found milk drinkers have lower levels of cholesterol which can block arteries and lead to heart attacks or strokes stock image used when they pooled data from the uk biobank study the 1958 british birth cohort and the health and retirement study from the us the scientists found those who drank more milk had lower levels of blood fats however the authors did find that regular milk drinkers generally have a higher body mass index bmi in comparison to non milk drinkers the team from the university of reading university of south australia southern australian health and medical research institute university college london and university of auckland took a genetic approach to milk consumption they looked at a variation in the lactase gene associated with digestion of milk sugars known as lactose and found those carrying the variant is a good way for identifying those who consume more milk though obesity diabetes and other conditions that affect metabolism also have ties to an overindulgence in dairy products prof karani said there was no evidence higher milk intake increased the chances of diabetes milk has long been known to help build health bones and provide the body with a vitamin and protein boost advertisement the latest findings were published in the international journal of obesity
although joe biden won the 2020 presidential election there is still misinformation circulating about the election results in maricopa county ariz in the november 2020 presidential election joe biden defeated former president donald trump by over 45 000 votes in maricopa county arizona which is the state s largest county and typically a republican stronghold but there is still misinformation circulating around that election in the state on monday may 17 the republican led maricopa county board of supervisors called for an end to an election audit that began on april 23 debunking several claims made by arizona senate republicans that there was any fraud in connection to the 2020 presidential election results in the county the board sent a scathing letter in response to arizona state senate president karen fann s claims that the county deleted important data mishandled the ballots and did not comply with legislative subpoenas in the letter the board also acknowledged a conspiracy theory that alleges the election boxes were stuffed with 40 000 ballots from asia and those ballots may contain bamboo fibers the question is there any evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election the sources maricopa county board of supervisors megan gilbertson communications director for the maricopa county elections department jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services kinder chambers independent textiles expert and bamboo guru with the texas bamboo society the answer no there is no evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election while the arizona election audit has not yet been finalized the manufacturer of maricopa county s election ballots told verify the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills what we found on may 5 dennis welch a political journalist based in phoenix interviewed an official who claimed he was helping oversee the election audit in arizona the official identified as john brakey of audit usa said he was looking for bamboo fibers because of an accusation that 40 000 ballots from southeast asia were flown to arizona and stuffed into the ballot boxes ahead of the 2020 presidential election in a video posted on twitter by welch brakey claimed the audit was being conducted because people in southeast asia use bamboo in their paper while also making it clear that he did not actually believe the claim himself verify reached out to megan gilbertson the communications director for the maricopa county elections department who told us we use vote secure paper for our 19 inch ballots in maricopa county meanwhile jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services which is the manufacturer of all the ballots used in maricopa county during the 2020 presidential election said in a statement that the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills if auditors are concerned about the injection of tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots that may have come from outside the united states they should think through how this would be logistically impossible to accomplish said ellington for example 10 000 ballots is physically a lot of paper that would need to be stored and transported and then successfully smuggled into a tabulation center any such effort would be easily detected kinder chambers an independent textiles expert told verify that while bamboo paper has been made by hand in china for centuries in the united states there has never been that much paper made with bamboo chambers said the only american made paper with bamboo was created in 1995 by one manufacturer who apparently made one big batch and never made any more he says it was never made for commercial use there is no general paper that has some bamboo fibers in the u s that kind of quality is for toilet paper and i don t mean like american quality more like europe in the bathrooms of europe said chambers we don t see any bamboo paper coming out of china they make clothing t shirts sleep clothing and casual clothing bamboo paper stock would be easily recognizable especially by feel in her letter to the maricopa county board of supervisors arizona senate president karen fann invited the board to attend a meeting at the arizona state capitol on tuesday may 18 requesting that they bring officials from the elections department who would have knowledge of their elections procedures in its response the board said we will not be attending we will not be responding to any additional inquiries from your auditors their failure to understand basic election processes is an indication you didn t get the best people to perform in your political theatre we have wasted enough county resources people s tax dollars are real your auditors are not we express our united view that your audit no matter what your intentions were in the beginning has become a spectacle that is harming all of us our state has become a laughingstock you are using purple lights and spinning tables you are hunting for bamboo these are not things that serious auditors of elections do fann in a may 17 tweet said she never officially received the letter from the board claiming she got a copy from cbs news hours after it was released to the public according to a 12 news report the audit won t overturn the results of the presidential or u s senate votes in arizona because those results have already been certified under state law and supported by maricopa county audits for now there is no firm end date of when the audit will be completed but reporter brahm resnik writes the glacial pace of the recount suggests it could go into late july or august a total of almost four months unless the counting staff is beefed up

florida man signs blatantly corrupt and unconstitutional social media bill cementing florida as tech laughing stock from the wasting taxpayer funds dept and off we go we ve talked about a bunch of states pushing blatantly unconstitutional social media content moderation bills with florida leading the pack as the most eager to waste taxpayer money on something so obviously bogus as you ll recall at the end of last month florida really added some unconstitutional icing on the unconstitutional cake by exempting disney and any other company that owned a theme park in florida from the bill s social media requirements the bill has a few different unconstitutional provisions but the one getting the most attention is that it bans non theme park associated websites from removing content or accounts from people running for office there are also the ridiculous transparency clauses that have become stupidly popular of late and which really serve as a smokescreen to allow users to sue websites for being moderated and despite tons of experts explaining why this is unconstitutional governor ron desantis who made this bill a key plank in his look at me i m a maga culture warrior platform has now signed the bill and to put a clown show cherry on top of the censorious unconstitutional cake desantis highlighted infamous provocateur and fabulist james o keefe from project veritas who attended the bill signing and is currently suing twitter for defamation over its reasons for kicking him off their platform social media companies use secret algorithms and shadow banning to shape debates and control the flow of information desantis said but yet they evade accountability by claiming they re just neutral platforms even as they amplify partisan agendas and censor dissent every day they act as the proverbial big brother and 2021 looks an awful lot like the fictitious 1984 i mean i just can t even bother to respond to this nonsense as the orlando sentinel article notes this attack on internet companies comes at the same time that miami in particular has been hyping itself up as a good destination for tech startups except that this bill would create a massive liability regime for any internet company that hosts any user generated content i mean unless they buy one of the thousands of theme parks found around florida none of that will matter in the long run because this bill is going to be tossed out eventually after desantis wastes a ton of taxpayer funds trying and failing to defend this bill in court the bill is 1 pre empted by federal law as section 230 makes clear and 2 a blatantly unconstitutional violation of the 1st amendment s prohibition on laws that infringe upon speech rights not to mention a pretty obvious attack on basic property rights but these days things like the constitution and free speech take a back seat to republican culture warrioring and victim playing even some republicans recognize just how dumb the bill is my concern is about potential candidates about crazy people nazis and child molesters and pedophiles who realize they can say anything they want if all they do is fill out those two pieces of paper said fine r brevard county though it s notable that fine still voted for the bill despite recognizing that a key clause is going to have wildly stupid consequences and that s basically all you need to know about why florida will never become the tech hub it pretends it wants to be filed under 1st amendment content moderation corruption florida ron desantis section 230 social media

geneva switzerland world health organization officials said on may 21 that six to eight million people may have died throughout the world to date during the ongoing covid pandemic in releasing its annual world health statistics report the who estimated that total deaths from the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 were at least 3 million in 2020 which would be 1 2 million more than reported we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to covid 19 the report said this number would truly be two to three times higher so i think safely about 6 to 8 million deaths could be an estimate on a cautionary note said samira asma who s assistant director general in its data and analytics division during a press briefing who data analyst william msemburi said the higher estimate of deaths included both unreported covid 19 deaths as well as indirect deaths due to the lack of hospital beds and medical equipment the challenge is that the reported covid 19 is an undercount of that full impact msemburi said as quoted by reuters
san francisco and suzhou china may 24 2021 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announces that the first patient has been successfully enrolled and dosed in the clinical trial of pemigatinib ibi375 a fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 2 3 fgfr1 2 3 inhibitor for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in china the study is a key component of the global phase 3 clinical trial which evaluates the efficacy and safety of pemigatinib versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin in first line treatment of participants with unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 fgfr2 rearrangement dr hui zhou the senior vice president of innovent stated cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary liver cancer with a high incidence in asia due to relatively widespread infection of hbv and parasites he emphasized that a significant portion of patients receive an initial diagnosis of unresectable and or metastatic status and that first line systemic therapy is typically gemcitabine plus cisplatin with a response rate of 26 median progression free survival mpfs of 8 months and overall survival mos of 11 7 months the poor prognosis and the side effects associated with systematic chemotherapy increase the urgency of improving upon the treatment efficacy as well as the quality of life of patients with cholangiocarcinoma data from previous clinical trials of pemigatinib in participants with advanced cholangiocarcinoma with fgfr2 fusion as second line or later treatment has not only shown satisfactory safety results but also revealed compelling efficacy signals the results demonstrate that pemigatinib has an objective response rate orr of 35 5 mpfs of 6 9 months and estimated os of 21 1 months with the refractory subjects being seen as the more challenging population and based on the promising data we believe that participants with fgfr2 rearrangement may benefit from targeted therapy like pemigatinib we are looking forward to see the therapeutic contribution of pemigatinib in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma as the pre nda process of the drug in china is under preparation dr zhou highlighted about advanced cholangiocarcinoma and fgfr2 rearrangement cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumour originated from biliary epithelium cells and it is categorized as intrahepatic or extrahepatic based on anatomical location of origin the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma has been increasing progressively over the past decade surgery is the first priority for patients with resectable disease however most cholangiocarcinomas has been in advanced and or metastatic status at diagnosis and lost the chance for surgical resection the treatment options for patient who relapse after surgery or have advanced metastatic disease are limited and the recommended therapy method is systemic chemotherapy with gemicitabine plus cisplatin which has a medium overall survival of less than a year aberrant signaling through fgfr resulting from gene amplification or mutation chromosomal translocation and ligand dependent activation of the receptors has been demonstrated in multiple types of human cancers fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling contributes to the development of malignancies by promoting tumor cell proliferation survival migration and angiogenesis results from early clinical studies of selective fgfr inhibitors including pemigatinib have shown a tolerable safety profile for the class and preliminary signs of clinical benefit in

it s hard for markets to understand and calibrate when the rules of the road have fundamentally changed warsh tells douglass in a magellan podcast interview the sudden end to the idea that governments need to live within their means is just one example of these new rules warsh says the reversal of decades of globalisation is another but perhaps the biggest rule change is that prices in financial markets which are supposed to act as judgments on the future are being distorted because the largest bidder in many of those markets are governments who have thrown trillions of dollars at buying bonds and other debt instruments at a time of massive regime change in the conduct of governments and economic policy financial markets are being asked to take in a lot why warsh is worth listening to warsh is well placed to comment on regime change having started his career at morgan stanley in 1995 he became a special assistant to president george w bush on economic policy in 2002 working closely with ben bernanke then chairman of bush s council of economic advisers advertisement when bush picked bernanke to become fed chairman in 2006 he also nominated warsh to become a fed governor at the tender age of 35 i thought this was going to be a nice relaxing way to spend some time after killing myself with all nighters for 4½ years in the white house warsh says the gfc took care of that warsh with his banking experience and connections became bernanke s primary liaison to wall street as the crisis unfolded in some sense it was scarier then because markets didn t appreciate the fear when markets are scared in some sense they re doing their jobs and they re policing when markets are calm when the vix is low that s when government officials frankly should be quite scared when quantitative easing was new warsh credits bernanke for coming up with the fed s original quantitative easing program in 2008 when it bought us600 billion of mortgage backed securities but he was critical of the decision to launch a second round of qe in 2010 when the economy was getting back on its feet advertisement i was concerned at the time that if we did qe2 we d end up doing qe346 and it would become a rather permanent feature of a monetary policy toolkit warsh says because if in fact we ve gone to a world where qe is standard operating procedure and obviously governments economies markets can grow dependent on it warsh who was interviewed by donald trump for the job of chairman of the federal reserve but lost out to jerome powell is clearly staggered by the fact that qe is continuing today in a us economy that has roared back following the pandemic the mix of fiscal policy monetary policy and the rest have conditions looser than they were in the darkest day of the global financial crisis of 08 or 09 or any day in between yet another example of regime change he says is the willingness of the fed and other central banks including the reserve bank of australia to wait for inflation to arrive rather than look out at the horizon and try to anticipate it as central banks have traditionally done advertisement his fear is that if the fed is wrong and the inflation currently building doesn t prove to be transitory central banks may have little room to move we see what i think we could safely describe as bubbles across many parts of the world s financial markets we have to ask ourselves the question if it s a bubble when would it bust the answer warsh fears lies in applying aggressive medicine to a patient that is largely healed in the us and then seeing an inflation outbreak that forces the fed to raise rates long after the horse has bolted the longer they wait the more expensive it will be the bigger shock it ll be to markets the bigger risk that it ll be to the real side of the economy my guess is we re going to see increases both in volatility as well as in the volatility of volatility as we re racing through the next 12 months with a series of facts that we can only hypothesise now but if i look broadly across assets i would say our governments have been trying to bid up asset prices for most of the last dozen years especially over the last 12 months or so what happens if the governments either are forced to exit being such a big participant in these markets because of inflation or the markets decide to exert their own influence over governments something that happens quite frequently in foreign exchange markets

theory that alleges the election boxes were stuffed with 40 000 ballots from asia and those ballots may contain bamboo fibers the question is there any evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election the sources maricopa county board of supervisors megan gilbertson communications director for the maricopa county elections department jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services kinder chambers independent textiles expert and bamboo guru with the texas bamboo society the answer no there is no evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election while the arizona election audit has not yet been finalized the manufacturer of maricopa county s election ballots told verify the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills what we found on may 5 dennis welch a political journalist based in phoenix interviewed an official who claimed he was helping oversee the election audit in arizona the official identified as john brakey of audit usa said he was looking for bamboo fibers because of an accusation that 40 000 ballots from southeast asia were flown to arizona and stuffed into the ballot boxes ahead of the 2020 presidential election in a video posted on twitter by welch brakey claimed the audit was being conducted because people in southeast asia use bamboo in their paper while also making it clear that he did not actually believe the claim himself verify reached out to megan gilbertson the communications director for the maricopa county elections department who told us we use vote secure paper for our 19 inch ballots in maricopa county meanwhile jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services which is the manufacturer of all the ballots used in maricopa county during the 2020 presidential election said in a statement that the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills if auditors are concerned about the injection of tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots that may have come from outside the united states they should think through how this would be logistically impossible to accomplish said ellington for example 10 000 ballots is physically a lot of paper that would need to be stored and transported and then successfully smuggled into a tabulation center any such effort would be easily detected kinder chambers an independent textiles expert told verify that while bamboo paper has been made by hand in china for centuries in the united states there has never been that much paper made with bamboo chambers said the only american made paper with bamboo was created in 1995 by one manufacturer who apparently made one big batch and never made any more he says it was never made for commercial use there is no general paper that has some bamboo fibers in the u s that kind of quality is for toilet paper and i don t mean like american quality more like europe in the bathrooms of europe said chambers we don t see any bamboo paper coming out of china they make clothing t shirts sleep clothing and casual clothing bamboo paper stock would be easily recognizable especially by feel in her letter to the maricopa county board of supervisors arizona senate president karen fann invited the board to attend a meeting at the arizona state capitol on tuesday may 18 requesting that they bring officials from the elections department who would have knowledge of their elections procedures in its response the board said we will not be attending we will not be responding to any additional inquiries from your auditors their failure to understand basic election processes is an indication you didn t get the best people to perform in your political theatre we have wasted enough county resources people s tax dollars are real your auditors are not we express our united view that your audit no matter what your intentions were in the beginning has become a spectacle that is harming all of us our state has become a laughingstock you are using purple lights and spinning tables you are hunting for bamboo these are not things that serious auditors of elections do fann in a may 17 tweet said she never officially received the letter from the board claiming she got a copy from cbs news hours after it was released to the public according to a 12 news report the audit won t overturn the results of the presidential or u s senate votes in arizona because those results have already been certified under state law and supported by maricopa county audits for now there is no firm end date of when the audit will be completed but reporter brahm resnik writes the glacial pace of the recount suggests it could go into late july or august a total of almost four months unless the counting staff is beefed up

stock market new uptrend starting current position of the market spx long term trend there is some evidence that we are still in the bull market which started in 2009 and which could continue into the first half of 2021 before major cycles take over and it ends a move past 4500 is possible before the current bull market makes a final top and spx corrects into its next major cycle low due in 2023 spx intermediate trend phase three wave 5 rom 3723 is now likely underway analysis of the short term trend is done daily with the help of hourly charts they are important adjuncts to the analysis of

me know at anvi1962 cableone net a new uptrend starting cycles looking ahead 7 yr cycle last lows 2009 2016 next low 2023 market analysis charts courtesy of qcharts iwm spx weekly iwm continues to diverge significantly from spx over the intermediate term based on previous similar divergences one should be prepared for an important correction to take place in spx but perhaps not before the latter makes a new high to complete its current structure spx daily chart last week s letter warned that a minor cycle low was due on the 5 17 18 time frame in fact the cycle made its low on 5 19 bringing about a retest of the former short term bottom from a structural standpoint now that this has taken place it is likely that wave 4 of the move which started from 3723 is complete and that wave 5 has started friday s index action appears to have completed the first leg of a new uptrend which should lead it to a new all time high before long the long term p f base established at the march 2020 low consists of multiple phases each of which corresponding to a specific count which determines the consecutive price levels to be achieved by spx during its uptrend and from which it should correct before moving to the next indicated level this is a peculiarity which does not appear on a bar chart but can only be observed on a p f chart the last phase gave us a count to 3950 which was attained precisely on 2 16 2021 and followed by a three week correction of 227 points down to 3723 before a new uptrend started the next phase which is currently underway gives us a count to 4310 long term base counts which are provided by a 3x10 chart can be fine tuned and re confirmed by the 1x10 chart pattern which defines the most recent re accumulation phase in this case with a count taken across the 4100 level this short term count calls for a move to 4350 which in fact pretty well verifies and confirms the base phase count taken in 03 2020 this price projection would seem to be in tune with the structural pattern which calls for one more short term move higher wave 5 to complete the structure from 3723 from which the last phase uptrend got underway as always there is a caveat that the analysis could go awry and this would become evident if spx should fail to make a new high over the next week or so spx hourly chart on the hourly chart we can follow the short term progress of the index after ostensibly making a wave 3 high at 4238 on 5 07 and a wave 4 double bottom prompted by the bottoming of the short term cycle last tuesday spx now appears to have started wave 5 which made a high at friday s opening 1 5 and started a near term correction which does not appear quite complete and which could retrace 382 of the first wave to 4139 before it is ready to resume its uptrend since it would also find support from the 50 hr ma at that level it would appear the more logical target but we cannot exclude a full 50 retracement to 4124 since this is more frequent a continuation of the price declining beyond 50 would be suspicious and could lead to a revision of the current analysis uup dollar etf dly usd chart is not available from this data provider usd chart is not available from this data provider uup again made a new low last week but that low was made last monday and the index held that low for the rest of the week which gave the oscillators the opportunity to develop positive divergence which is more apparent in the srsi this could mean that it is ready for at least a short term reversal at the same time usd appears to be at or near a temporary downside projection on its p f chart gdx gold miners dly gdx has broken out of its correction channel at the same time it may have filled a near term objective on its p f chart which could require a little consolidation before it moves higher the daily cci does not show negative divergence but this does not seem to be always required in this index for a top to be formed at the daily level whereby it appears to be much more consistent at the weekly time frame the mas appear to be much better indicators of a trend reversal in this case we should watch for a decline below 38 58 as a sign that a short term top has been established however by having moved well past its 50 dma the index has clearly given an intermediate buy signal paas pan american silver corp dly paas pulled back to its lower channel line after it reported disappointing earnings for its last quarter this was viewed as an opportunity by traders who were aggressive buyers in the case of paas both oscillators do show some negative divergence which could lead to additional consolidation the stock has been trading in a 9 10 point range for several months and should experience a good uptrend if it can get past

although joe biden won the 2020 presidential election there is still misinformation circulating about the election results in maricopa county ariz in the november 2020 presidential election joe biden defeated former president donald trump by over 45 000 votes in maricopa county arizona which is the state s largest county and typically a republican stronghold but there is still misinformation circulating around that election in the state on monday may 17 the republican led maricopa county board of supervisors called for an end to an election audit that began on april 23 debunking several claims made by arizona senate republicans that there was any fraud in connection to the 2020 presidential election results in the county the board sent a scathing letter in response to arizona state senate president karen fann s claims that the county deleted important data mishandled the ballots and did not comply with legislative subpoenas in the letter the board also acknowledged a conspiracy theory that alleges the election boxes were stuffed with 40 000 ballots from asia and those ballots may contain bamboo fibers the question is there any evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election the sources maricopa county board of supervisors megan gilbertson communications director for the maricopa county elections department jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services kinder chambers independent textiles expert and bamboo guru with the texas bamboo society the answer no there is no evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election while the arizona election audit has not yet been finalized the manufacturer of maricopa county s election ballots told verify the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills what we found on may 5 dennis welch a political journalist based in phoenix interviewed an official who claimed he was helping oversee the election audit in arizona the official identified as john brakey of audit usa said he was looking for bamboo fibers because of an accusation that 40 000 ballots from southeast asia were flown to arizona and stuffed into the ballot boxes ahead of the 2020 presidential election in a video posted on twitter by welch brakey claimed the audit was being conducted because people in southeast asia use bamboo in their paper while also making it clear that he did not actually believe the claim himself verify reached out to megan gilbertson the communications director for the maricopa county elections department who told us we use vote secure paper for our 19 inch ballots in maricopa county meanwhile jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services which is the manufacturer of all the ballots used in maricopa county during the 2020 presidential election said in a statement that the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills if auditors are concerned about the injection of tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots that may have come from outside the united states they should think through how this would be logistically impossible to accomplish said ellington for example 10 000 ballots is physically a lot of paper that would need to be stored and transported and then successfully smuggled into a tabulation center any such effort would be easily detected kinder chambers an independent textiles expert told verify that while bamboo paper has been made by hand in china for centuries in the united states there has never been that much paper made with bamboo chambers said the only american made paper with bamboo was created in 1995 by one manufacturer who apparently made one big batch and never made any more he says it was never made for commercial use there is no general paper that has some bamboo fibers in the u s that kind of quality is for toilet paper and i don t mean like american quality more like europe in the bathrooms of europe said chambers we don t see any bamboo paper coming out of china they make clothing t shirts sleep clothing and casual clothing bamboo paper stock would be easily recognizable especially by feel in her letter to the maricopa county board of supervisors arizona senate president karen fann invited the board to attend a meeting at the arizona state capitol on tuesday may 18 requesting that they bring officials from the elections department who would have knowledge of their elections procedures in its response the board said we will not be attending we will not be responding to any additional inquiries from your auditors their failure to understand basic election processes is an indication you didn t get the best people to perform in your political theatre we have wasted enough county resources people s tax dollars are real your auditors are not we express our united view that your audit no matter what your intentions were in the beginning has become a spectacle that is harming all of us our state has become a laughingstock you are using purple lights and spinning tables you are hunting for bamboo these are not things that serious auditors of elections do fann in a may 17 tweet said she never officially received the letter from the board claiming she got a copy from cbs news hours after it was released to the public according to a 12 news report the audit won t overturn the results of the presidential or u s senate votes in arizona because those results have already been certified under state law and supported by maricopa county audits for now there is no firm end date of when the audit will be completed but reporter brahm resnik writes the glacial pace of the recount suggests it could go into late july or august a total of almost four months unless the counting staff is beefed up

this is the second part in a two part series read part one while much of the manic rise in tesla s share values is driven by speculation there is another basis for the company s money making the brutal exploitation of its workforce the world socialist web site recently spoke at length with a former tesla worker who has documented the deeply exploitative and highly unsafe working conditions from his time at the company s flagship production facility in fremont california in the san francisco bay area we have changed the worker s name to howard in this article to protect his identity at the end of 2016 howard began his new job at tesla in the metal finishing department of the fremont plant optimistic at having secured a position at the much celebrated company over the next three years he would experience relentlessly long hours and callous indifference to worker safety and management harassment culminating in his termination in 2019 after getting injured on the job tesla was playing fast and loose with worker safety from the very beginning of his employment instead of being provided careful training and given a review of safety checklists before being put on the line all of howard s training was hands on only on my first day i was stacking parts coming off the 5a line and on the second working a dual action sander until my wrists were throbbing in pain the same negligent management attitude toward safety persisted throughout his time at tesla about four months before i was fired they laid off a bunch of workers and started reassigning those of us left throughout the factory howard said my team got put on the small parts press 3a there was only one worker actually trained on it who knew how to adjust the belt height for differently sized parts but he was working on a different line without adjustments the belt could launch these pieces of metal right at you as you can see in the video and there s no real protection video from fremont factory according to business insider from 2017 through 2019 tesla was cited by cal osha for 45 safety violations and received 277 955 in associated fines related to vehicle manufacturing more than all the detroit big three automakers combined which themselves have increasingly undermined workplace safety with the assistance of the united auto workers union in the same period general motors logged six violations and 22 411 in fines ford had 18 and 90 162 or fiat chrysler 23 and 90 797 safety problems weren t just from a lack of training howard explained they placed the station where we clocked in and out within three feet of this huge crane battery right next to stacks of part palettes and an active forklift lane you had to step over the caution tape on the ground just to punch in we d always joke whether today was the day we d get crushed by a palette or hit by an arc coming off the battery we tried using other stations to clock in but our supervisor insisted that this was his idea and we had to use that station the entire situation with forklifts was a mess they gave us training that consisted of driving an empty bin and stacking it on another then they gave us the answers for the written test and we were certified but we weren t driving empty bins around they d have us double and even triple stack them with these metal part bins when you were overloading them like that it was easy to fall over while making a turn but we were always told to go fast and make quota forklifts are legally required to be inspected at the beginning of each shift and if any significant safety issues are found they must be taken out of service nothing at the fremont plant was organized like that howard said no one inspected the forklifts you can see in the pictures those frayed battery cables it was also a free for all if you needed to move a palette you just grabbed the closest forklift and took it people left them running unattended all the time howard described widespread homelessness among tesla employees when i started working at tesla i was sleeping in the parking lot a lot of people parked their rvs in the walmart parking lot next door there was also the loft in the factory with couches about 20 people would just sleep there every night tesla factory workers or production associates make about 20 an hour according to glassdoor com with a 40 hour work week 50 weeks a year this amounts to 40 000 a year or 3 300 a month barely enough to cover the rent of a two bedroom apartment in fremont where the factory is located the chaotic environment created a multitude of problems and dangers the attitude of management was an accident wasn t an accident as long as you cleaned it up before anyone noticed so if you dropped a sheet of metal on the ground with all the oil and dirt it didn t matter pick it up and toss it in the press then when parts started coming out with defects they d have us climb in the stacks of palettes looking for other defective pieces it didn t matter if you wore protective sleeves or how careful you are digging through that pressed metal you d get cut those palettes weren t designed for climbing either they were supposed to interlock to form a steady structure but most of the time they didn t i remember one time i was standing near a stack and a nearby forklift unbalanced it it started tilting like it was going to fall and i thought i guess this is how i die luckily the driver regained control another time a forklift driver managed to knock over a whole set of those stacks like dominoes and if we had been looking for defects at the time that would be it this narrative suggests a multitude of violations of safety regulations and training requirements and a blatant disregard by tesla management for the well being of workers in contrast to the dangerous practices described by howard typical forklift safety standards although far from being universally enforced at other workplaces include ensuring only balanced and secured loads are operated maintaining safe speeds and distances never allowing vehicles to be left unattended and running unless the wheels are blocked and not allowing trucks to be driven near anyone standing in front of a fixed object such that the person could be caught between the truck and object like placing an active forklift lane next to a clock in station howard also described an abusive work environment and an insidious cult of personality promoted around elon musk by management some of the managers would really push this creepy cult around elon musk one of them would point to the cameras in the factory and say elon s watching or he can read your emails the desired goal was to speed the f k up we re worried that if we re not working hard enough this little tyrant is going to come over musk himself howard said is a demagogue who surrounds himself with yes men all the talk of his intelligence no he s got a lot of money and he s got people around him who want to make money and get his stuff done managers also acted like royalty they d call a team meeting and be late but if you went back to the line after 10 minutes and they showed up they d start screaming at you the company would prey on whatever emotion or angle they can to get the most out of you saying how good it was to work to tesla it gets really tiring really fast but it worked on me for a while howard said supervisors would respond hostilely if workers pointed out safety problems with the common refrain being hey why are you preventing us from meeting our targets why are you taking money out of our mouths it s just guilt trip after guilt trip they set things up so that if they wanted you gone they could find a reason like clocking in they had one station for our shift of 70 people if you clocked in a minute late they could write you up if you clocked in too early they could write you up the whole thing was just so they d have a reason to punish anyone they wanted to tesla is leading the charge in the worst kind of way they re an innovator but they re an innovator in psychological terror while tesla currently produces a relatively small proportion of the automobiles manufactured in the us it has a disproportionate share of workplace inspection cases among automobile manufacturers these cases are primarily opened following a workplace accident or complaint a search of all federal and state program osha inspection data involving the north american industry classification system naics code for automobile manufacturing since the beginning of the year shows there have been 50 inspection cases opened tesla accounts for 12 of these inspections or 24 percent the division of occupational safety and health dosh commonly referred to as cal osha has several ongoing inspection cases involving tesla the most recent was opened on may 5 related to an accident at a factory in lathrop california about 50 miles east of the fremont plant this also does not account for numerous incidents at other tesla operations such as battery manufacturing plants in nevada the reno gazette journal recently published an exposé that details the influence of tesla over the nevada state government and osha program following repeated accidents where workers had their fingers crushed the fact is that osha and related agencies nominally tasked with regulating workplace safety are beholden to the corporations even when egregious violations of safety regulations are found leading to death or serious injury they often lead to nothing more than token fines which are often waived on appeal in september of 2020 the federal osha issued its first covid 19 related citations against the meat packing industry after more than six months of inaction during which time 18 000 workers were infected and at least 203 died the fines levied against jbs and smithfield foods totaled less than 30 000 or less than 2 500 per worker who died at the two plants that received citations in 2019 after cal osha became aware that tesla was routinely under reporting annual counts of workplace injuries which are considered an important metric for assessing injury rates at worksites and across industry sectors the state agency levied just a 400 fine against the company after tesla reopened its fremont factory in may 2020 in open defiance of county public health ordinances state and county democratic party officials including california governor gavin newsom gave tesla free rein for its unsafe reopening plan this callous willingness to endanger human life to meet production targets is a major reason that tesla s stock is now soaring the case of tesla demonstrates once again that workers rights to a healthy and safe work environment is incompatible with a system the subordinates the needs of the world s working class to the profit interests of a handful of ultra wealthy oligarchs if the major automakers get their way the transition to electric vehicles will bring the horrific conditions facing tesla workers to the rest of the auto industry the wsws urges workers at tesla to contact us to discuss initiating rank and file safety committees democratically controlled by workers themselves and completely independent of and hostile to the democrats republicans and trade unions such as the uaw which itself functions as a bought and paid for tool of corporate management rank and file committees which have been initiated at a number of major plants including the volvo truck plant in virginia where workers recently overwhelmingly voted down a uaw sellout contract will form lines of communication with like minded workers across the auto industry and among their brothers and sisters in other sections of the working class these rank and file committees must ultimately be linked with an international network to coordinate the fight for workers rights in the us and across the globe to that end the international committee of the fourth international which publishes the wsws has initiated the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc these new workers organizations in contrast to the pro corporate trade unions are taking as their starting point what workers really need and not the profit imperatives of tesla and billionaire oligarchs such as musk for tesla workers to secure a safe workplace sufficient pay and benefits along with every other democratic and social right the wealth of the corporate and financial elite must be expropriated and redirected to the working class and the auto industry placed under workers collective control and ownership as part of the struggle for socialism

by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks these include but are not limited to the risks associated with the economic recovery from the covid 19 pandemic the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general e g commodity pricing operational risks in

press release contains certain financial measures as described below which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by gaap in addition this press release contains other key performance indicators kpi financial and non financial that do not have standardized meanings under the applicable securities legislation as these non gaap financial measures and kpi are commonly used in the oil and gas industry the company believes that their inclusion is useful to investors the reader is cautioned that these amounts may not be directly comparable to measures for other companies where similar terminology is used adjusted funds from operations is calculated as cash provided by operating activities before changes in non cash operating working capital and adding back if applicable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions provisions for potential credit losses and settlement of decommissioning obligations adjusted funds from operations per common share is calculated

press release are before financial instruments except as otherwise indicated as being after financial instruments net bank debt surplus is equal to bank debt net of working capital deficit surplus working capital deficit surplus excludes current bank debt net bank debt surplus is calculated by adding the working capital deficit surplus to bank debt the company uses a net bank debt surplus and working capital deficit surplus to annualized quarterly adjusted funds from operations ratio and as a benchmark on which management monitors the company s capital structure and short term financing requirements management believes that this ratio as well as the company s net bank debt surplus provides investors with information to understand the company s liquidity risk the net bank debt surplus and working capital deficit surplus to annualized quarterly adjusted funds from operations ratio is also indicative of the net debt surplus to cash flow calculation used to determine the applicable

boe basis natural gas volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at six thousand cubic feet per barrel and sulphur volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at 0 6 long tons per barrel the term boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is significantly different than the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil and natural gas this conversion factor is an industry accepted norm and is not based on either energy content or current prices such abbreviation may be misleading particularly if used in isolation references to oil in this press

geneva switzerland world health organization officials said on may 21 that six to eight million people may have died throughout the world to date during the ongoing covid pandemic in releasing its annual world health statistics report the who estimated that total deaths from the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 were at least 3 million in 2020 which would be 1 2 million more than reported we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to covid 19 the report said this number would truly be two to three times higher so i think safely about 6 to 8 million deaths could be an estimate on a cautionary note said samira asma who s assistant director general in its data and analytics division during a press briefing who data analyst william msemburi said the higher estimate of deaths included both unreported covid 19 deaths as well as indirect deaths due to the lack of hospital beds and medical equipment the challenge is that the reported covid 19 is an undercount of that full impact msemburi said as quoted by reuters
signs of impending economic doom continue to grow all around us for years highly respected experts have been warning about the steady destruction of our standard of living and the death of the u s dollar perhaps you didn t listen to those voices at first and that is understandable most americans have their hands full making a living and taking care of their families but then housing prices started to go absolutely nuts health costs continued to spiral out of control and a trip to the grocery store just kept getting more painful at this point nobody can honestly deny that inflation has become a major problem but even though the chorus of voices that is warning of a dramatic inflationary collapse is growing by the day the federal reserve just keeps pumping more giant piles of money into the financial system and the federal government continues to engage in the most reckless spending binge in the entirety of u s history despite the utterly insane policies of our leaders the u s economy continues to languish in economic purgatory trillions upon trillions of dollars have been poured into the economy and yet the u s still has 8 2 million fewer jobs than it did last february they had hoped to create an economic boom but instead they are setting the stage for an implosion of epic proportions in fact john williams of shadowstats com insists that we are eventually headed into a hyperinflationary economic collapse so is the choice inflation or implosion williams says that s the choice and i think we are going to have a combination of both of them i think we are eventually headed into a hyperinflationary economic collapse it s not that we haven t been in an economic collapse already we are coming back some now the fed has been creating money at a pace that has never been seen before you are basically up 75 in money creation year over year this is unprecedented normally it might be up 1 or 2 year over year the exploding money supply will lead to inflation i am not saying we are going to get to 75 inflation yet but you are getting up to the 4 or 5 range and you are soon going to be seeing 10 range year over year the fed has lost control of inflation and remember when the fed has to admit the official inflation rate is 10 john williams says when they have to admit the inflation rate is 10 my number is going to be up to around 15 or higher my number rides on top of their number you don t want to believe williams that is fine he has just been right time after time over the years but feel free to ignore him if you wish if you are determined to ignore the truth you probably will not like what egon von greyerz is saying either as technological developments and markets go parabolic we observe many market experts even intelligent ones forecasting that we are now in an exponential economic era thus many believe that this will go on forever this is the typical attitude at market and economic tops and guarantees that this will not end well it is clearly absolute nonsense to believe that exponential expansion based on deficits debts and fake money is the beginning of a new era anyone studying the economy and history of markets knows that exponential moves indicate the end of an era and not the beginning as i have repeatedly said history is our best teacher and it both rhymes and repeats itself and history now gives us dire warnings if you wish to reject what these experts are telling us can you point to another time in history when officials have wildly created new money and everything has turned out just great new money is always such a tempting solution because every time it always seems to work at the beginning it is kind of like a tonic that instantly makes you feel better for a few hours but that ultimately kills you in the end as you keep taking it now that we have greatly accelerated our journey toward an inflationary collapse even warren buffett has started to sound the alarm we are seeing substantial inflation warren buffett told attendees at last week s annual berkshire hathaway shareholder meeting we are raising prices people are raising prices to us and it s being accepted ordinary americans are searching for inflation online more frequently now than they have in more than a decade data from deutsche bank strategist jim reid shows but cnn insists that everything is going to be just fine so that means that we don t have anything to be concerned about right personally i am deeply concerned about the second half of this calendar year and it appears that i am not the only one billionaires and corporate insiders have been offloading stocks at a very brisk pace in recent weeks when the country s ceos and billionaires start to head to the exits a little bit quicker than usual at the tail end of a 13 year bull market it may be time to start paying attention that s what we found noteworthy about a recent bloomberg piece which noted that stock sales by some of the world s richest shareholders are reaping a windfall thanks to our current inflated equity markets to the tune of trillions amazon com s jeff bezos and google co founder sergey brin are just two of the well known names that have been offloading stock they are joined by names like mark zuckerberg and larry ellison if you have been snoozing for the last few years now is the time to wake up because we are steamrolling toward an economic implosion that will make the history books and our economic problems are just one element of the perfect storm that our society is facing but a lot of people out there are going to be absolutely blindsided by what is coming because they have no interest in listening to the warnings instead they have placed their trust in the talking heads that the corporate media puts on television and those talking heads keep assuring us that everything is going to be just fine michael s new book entitled lost prophecies of the future of america is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael snyder and my brand new book entitled lost prophecies of the future of america is now available on amazon com in addition to my new

three more states maryland new york and oregon have launched similar lottery style initiatives with the hopes of boosting vaccinations as nearly 40 of the u s population is fully vaccinated against covid 19 states are getting creative to entice people who are hesitant to get vaccinated a program that caught the attention of many people across the country is a lottery in ohio called vax a million which will award five 1 million prizes to people who are fully vaccinated against covid 19 since the announcement of the lottery in ohio three more states maryland new york and oregon have launched similar lottery style programs with the hopes of boosting vaccinations some people on social media have claimed that more states are trying lottery style games because there was an increase in vaccinations in ohio following the announcement of its 1 million prizes the question was there an increase in vaccinations after the announcement of ohio s vax a million lottery the sources the answer yes there was an increase in vaccinations after the vax a million lottery was announced in ohio what we found on may 12 ohio gov mike dewine announced the vax a million program he said the state would announce once a week beginning may 26 that a person who had received a covid 19 vaccine would win 1 million he said there would be a winner announced every wednesday for five weeks totaling five 1 million winners only ohioans who are 18 and older and have received at least the first dose of the pfizer or moderna vaccines or received the johnson johnson vaccine are eligible to register for the weekly 1 million prizes children between 12 and 17 who have received at least one dose of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine can enter for a chance to win one of five four year full ride scholarships including room and board tuition and books to any ohio state college or university in the days after vax a million was announced the ohio department of health said there was an increase in vaccinations among ohioans 16 and older compared to the days before the announcement in a may 19 news release stephanie mccloud director of the ohio department of health said vaccinations were increasing across all age groups except for those 80 and older who mccloud said were highly vaccinated already in a news release the next day on may 20 the department of health said the weekend after gov dewine announced vax a million from may 14 17 there was a 28 increase in vaccinations among ohioans 16 and older there had been a decline in vaccinations the weekend before the announcement from may 7 to may 10 this dramatic increase in vaccinations indicates that the vax a million drawing has been impactful in creating momentum for vaccinations throughout ohio mccloud said in the may 20 news release we are grateful that the drawings are helping spur ohioans to take this important measure to protect their health their loved ones and their community vaccines are our best tool to return to the lives we remember from before the pandemic three states maryland new york and oregon have followed ohio s lead and announced similar lottery style initiatives to try and get more people vaccinated against covid 19 maryland announced its lottery program on may 20 there will be 40 straight days in which a person 18 and older who got at least one dose of a covid 19 vaccine will win 40 000 the daily 40 000 drawings begin may 25 and continue through july 3 then on july 4 one person will win a grand prize of 400 000 new york also announced its program on may 20 people 18 and older who get their first dose of the pifzer vaccine or a johnson johnson vaccine at one of 10 state mass vaccination sites from may 24 to may 28 will get a lottery scratch off ticket the top prize is 5 million but other winning amounts range from 20 to 50 000 oregon announced its initiative on may 21 everyone 18 and older who has received at least one dose of a covid 19 vaccine by june 27 will be eligible to win a 1 million drawing that takes place on june 28 one person in each of oregon s 36 counties will also win 10 000 for oregonians younger than 18 who have received at least one dose of a covid 19 vaccines they ll have a chance to win one of five 100 000 oregon college savings plan scholarships the number of people getting vaccinated in maryland new york and oregon has slowed after earlier peaks during the vaccine rollout because full reporting of vaccinations typically takes days it s still too early to tell what kind of impact if any the lottery announcements have had on vaccinations in those states
on may 25 2011 the international organization of epizootics oie something like the who of veterinary medicine declared eradicated an infectious disease that killed millions of animals and also ended the lives of millions of human beings this article has been conceived to show that animal health and human well being are intimately connected also to share the history of a terrible disease that caused enormous suffering to narrate the global race that led to its eradication and finally as a tribute to those that made this feat possible today rinderpest along with smallpox are the only two infectious diseases eradicated worldwide let s hope polio soon is next i would like to start with a travel back in time rome a d 1713 nothing could appease pope clement xi the recent signing of the treaty of utrech had caused him to lose territories and influence france with the jansenist heresy and its king that arrogant louis xiv did nothing but give him headaches all this although annoying fell within the logic of the struggle for power something much more serious was keeping the bishop of rome awake it was not sin or the works of the evil one that tormented him but something much more prosaic his cattle were dying not even the procession to st peter s basilica followed with zeal by the faithful who also lost their animals gave the expected results the lord seemed to have turned his back on him 1714 began with the worst omens the cold did not contain the epidemic and the fields were covered with dead animals hunger lurked there was no milk no meat and much worse no animals to plow the fields without them it was impossible to cultivate the land and obtain crops as the year progressed their losses were approaching 25 000 head a catastrophe so the supreme pontiff to save his flocks put his trust in the same person who took care of his health his personal physician giovani maria lancisi portrait of giovani maria lancisi the pope s physician the doctor put to work and obtained the papal favor to against the criteria of many cardinals promulgate a series of norms among which the following consideration stood out it is better to kill all the sick and suspicious animals rather than allow the disease to spread in order to have enough time and the honor to discover a specific treatment that is often sought without success to the sacrifice of all sick animals and those that had been in contact with them he added a strict control of the movements of livestock and other animals such as dogs as well as the obligation to bury the corpses in quicklime and not take advantage of anything skin nor meat to avoid future infections in addition those who did not comply with these norms paid it well with the punishment of galleys in perpetuity if they were ecclesiastical or were directly executed all others there were no exceptions of degree social class or economic position in nine months the epidemic was under control the success of the italian doctor did not go unnoticed in the european courts and his standards were imposed in much of the continent he also served to lay the foundations for the study of the principles that had controlled the epidemic and that resulted in the creation of the world s first veterinary college founded in the french city of lyon in 1761 with the royal support of louis xv royal document of approval of the first veterinary college in the world lyon france 1761 although in a very timid way the rulers began to realize that this evil could not be overcome without cross border collaboration historical enemies would have to work together to fight this cattle plague today we know that the disease that ruined pope clement xi s finances was cattle plague also known by its german name of rinderpest a highly contagious and highly deadly virus over 90 that preyed on both domestic and wild ruminants it arrived in europe with the asian armies and it was later the local armies that spread the infection since the logistics and transport of war materials made it necessary to use the traction force of the oxen who together with the weapons carried the infection with the arrival of the railroad the cattle trade grew exponentially and with it the transmission of the virus accelerated throughout the continent arriving in waves mainly from russia where it was endemic the virus belongs to the genus of morbilliviruses such as canine distemper or measles the latter appeared as a rinderpest mutation that was adapted to humans around the 11th or 12th century ad it is a highly contagious rna virus after infection the animal began to show the first symptoms 3 6 days later fever lethargy nasal and eye discharges mouth sores and a foul odor later diarrhea appeared and the animal died a few days afterwards symptoms of the disease and an actual photo of ocular discharge the high animal mortality became a death sentence for the communities without cattle milk and meat were lacking but worse still the driving force that allowed the fields to be plowed disappeared without oxen it was the people who had to tie themselves to the plows and drag them to try to obtain a meager harvest always insufficient those who could afford it bought horses or mules immune to the disease but high demand drove prices up thus in the successive epidemics that have been documented in the england of the sxiv a draft horse went from a cost of 12 shillings to 35 in full epidemic hunger reached the villages and it was not uncommon that hunger pushed people to eat carrion and even to commit acts of cannibalism horse prices sharp increased in impacted communities it took years to bring prices back to normal rinderpest accelerated historical events of first magnitude thus in 1749 the french physician blondet described the situation in the countryside of his country desolate pastures uncultivated lands abandoned farms everything testifies to our misfortune in the limousin region alone 4 000 people died of hunger in march 1770 in addition to the mortality caused by the disease there were also the shots that the soldiers had been ordered to fire on any animal suspected of having been in contact with sick cattle although the king paid for the shot animals the new prices of healthy cattle always on the rise made the royal compensation worthless with no ploughing force no manure and without key food sources it is not surprising that spirits were stirred and that discontent as some historians point out contributed to the breeding ground that led to the french revolution in 1789 without oxen people had to plough the fields exhausting work to obtain poor results the horror was not limited to europe africa suffered the plague as a result of successive imports of european cattle at the end of the 19th century the ethiopian emperor menelik lost more than 250 000 cattle thus began the great ethiopian famine of 1888 1892 which a french missionary described as follows wherever i go i come across walking skeletons or corpses half eaten by hyenas of the hungry who have fallen from exhaustion one third of the ethiopian population died because of this famine but not only domestic livestock were involved wild animals also suffered from the disease buffalo giraffe antelope all ungulates fell prey to the infection livestock is deeply rooted in many african cultures for which animals are the only way to have capital cattle constitute an economic system in themselves dowries inheritances and loans are paid with livestock animals death meant the death of entire cultures cattle plague deaths in south africa something had to be done and a good number of countries came to an agreement to put aside their quarrels and try to join forces and fight this disease in 1871 the austrian government launched the first international conference for rinderpest control governments agreed to alert each other by telegraph when there was an outbreak of disease to interrupt the trade in animals they promised to compensate farmers for their losses as well as to implement stringent disinfection measures in the event of any positive diagnosis following these rules the german authorities alerted their british counterparts in 1877 that the animals that had just arrived in their territory from hamburg could be contaminated as in the german city an outbreak of rinderpest had just been diagnosed rapid communication enabled english veterinarians to immobilize and slaughter the cows and prevent the disease from spreading across english territory the immobilization of german animals was quickly established as well as the prohibition of importation into dutch belgian swiss and french territory among others the efforts made it possible to stop the disease in europe but although the virus saw its expansion in the old continent short circuited it began its wide expansion in other latitudes thanks to the colonizing activity of the european powers as an example the importation of cattle to feed the spanish military contingent located in the philippine islands introduced rinderpest in the archipelago but where the virus was rampant was on the african continent in south africa the plague preyed on cattle and no preventive measure seemed to work so serious was the situation that the government of the cape province requested the services of robert koch who years before had established his famous postulates that allowed a disease to be attributed to a specific germ koch knew his trade and was certain that a micro organism caused the plague vaccination experiences against rabies and smallpox made him optimistic about finding an effective prophylaxis against rinderpest after many tests with different body fluids he ended up recommending that healthy cattle be inoculated with bile from animals that had died of the disease the method was unsuccessful but it allowed local scientists to create another alternative injecting serum from infected animals it was not an ideal solution many other infections were transmitted trying to avoid the plague but the inoculated animals developed some immunity against the virus mortality in treated cattle dropped from 77 to 44 colons of european origin had more access to this remedy and inoculated more hence we can know the difference between cattle that did not receive prophylaxis mainly from native cattlemen versus those of owners of european origin robert koch in 1902 turkish researchers proved that the agent behind plague outbreaks was a virus a few years later in 1910 the japanese invaded the korean peninsula and japanese veterinarians set out to create an immune belt between korea and china to protect the korean herd from rinderpest to do this the veterinarian chiharu kakizaki was able to inactivate the viral agent in blood and spleen samples by mixing them with glycerin the first vaccine against rinderpest was born international coordination efforts to fight the plague took another big step with the signing of 28 countries for the creation in 1928 of the oie the international organization of epizooties still active today and which played a leading role together with the fao in eradicating the rinderpest from the earth a few years later in the philippines an american military veterinarian raymond alexander kesler used chloroform to inactivate the virus present in macerated spleen lymph nodes and liver the vaccine required multiple doses and provided immunity for a limited period of time but the important thing was that it helped along with quarantine and slaughter measures to limit the disease the philippines launched a vaccination campaign that between 1924 1931 it was administered at a rate of 300 000 heads year raymond alexander kesler dead vaccines do not cause infection because the virus is inactive but they are capable of alerting the immune system and generating defenses the major drawback is the need to repeat the doses to maintain their prophylactic capacity which is often prohibitively expensive and labor intensive the next battle was to get live vaccines which could stimulate long term immunity without causing the disease or led to an attenuated form with mild symptoms previous experiences with rabies virus and smallpox invited to test the attenuation of the virus by passage in non target species thus it was tested on different animals with varying success the first successful experience was obtained by passing in goats and gave rise to the vaccine called kabete o very effective for african cattle although it produced a mild disease but still fatal for 50 of the european herd so the the old continent should continue with the administration of the dead vaccine kabete o could easily be transported in previously immunized live goats once slaughtered between 500 and 800 doses could be obtained from each goat it was a tremendously efficient mode of transport in the conditions of the african continent we thus arrive in the 1940s quite surprisingly the second world war was de facto a boost in the fight against rinderpest american president roosevelt knew firsthand the consequences of an infection at the age of 40 he suffered a paralysis that he would live with for the rest of his life polio preyed on the little ones but adults were not safe either now the war was his main concern and the dossier that had just arrived from the defense staff convinced him that he must act quickly american intelligence knew that the japanese were successfully developing biological weapons in manchuria unit 731 of the japanese army experimented with typhus plague and cholera his victims numbered in the hundreds of thousands it was essential to have vaccines and medicines that could neutralize a japanese biological attack and the us military got down to work and not only to defend itself from attacks on its human population but also to protect animals the island of grosse is a small point on the map in the enormity of canada located on the saint lawrence river this island was the entry and quarantine point for the thousands of irish emigrants who arrived on the coast of the country fleeing the great famine of 1845 49 due to the poor potato harvest many died there of typhus and cholera it is the largest cemetery due to the great famine outside of irish territory it closed its doors in 1932 but reopened them ten years later to this time deal with rinderpest the americans knew that if the virus reached their territory the cattle lacked defenses completely so it was imperative to immunize them with a vaccine but to do so the responsible virus had to be brought to american soil with the risks that this entailed the solution focus all the investigations on an isolated space such as the island of grosse the us army was successful in 19 months they had a new vaccine ready we have already seen how the japanese knew about the disease and had not stopped making progress on its control the veterinarian junji nakamura managed to attenuate the virus after repeated passage through a non target intermediate species the rabbit protecting cattle in japanese territory was critical to the war effort the american soldier was the best fed of the war not so the japanese protecting the herds was extremely important the use of lapinized vaccine passed more than 100 times per rabbit was widespread in asia the reproduction of the plague virus had no secrets for the japanese junji nakamura on his part hitler ruled out biological warfare altogether from the start and although his lieutenant himmler toyed with the idea there were no real efforts to make it happen this was not the case with the empire of the rising sun the japanese accelerated with their tests and the americans on the island of grosse tried to beat them with an effective vaccine and above all easy to produce and administer work began with the chloroform inactivated vaccine but when injected into the calves they produced only about 350 doses per animal in 1943 to produce 100 000 doses 270 bovids were needed virologist richard shope in charge of the canadian facility estimated that to protect the north american herd which then numbered about 60 million animals it would take 170 000 calves and about 60 years of work at the current rate obviously other solutions had to be found the vaccine could stop small outbreaks but not protect all livestock richard shope shope decided to try a different route grow the virus in bird eggs previous experiences with the flu virus had been successful so that route was explored he used the kabete o strain the process required passing the virus through a suspension of bovine spleen and then passing it through the chorioallantoic membrane of the egg for 8 12 times from there it went to the yolk at that point the virus replicated with enormous speed invading the embryo and all the fluids that surround it within 24 hours this avianized vaccine conferred complete protection within 10 days after administration and 3 4 doses were obtained per egg in addition frozen and vacuum packed it retained its properties for 15 months with this vaccine in 1944 the us was prepared to neutralize a rinderpest attack by the japanese and the threat was absolutely real at the forefront of the japanese effort to infect american cows was the japanese veterinarian noboru kuba the plan consisted of adding viral preparations to hot air balloons that were built to bomb north american soil some did hit and one caused the death of 6 people the only casualties in the american continent from this war kuba prepared a mash of infected organs dried it and obtained 50 grams of highly contagious powder he did a test with a rocket that after exploding in midair spread infectious dust around 10 cows had been placed in the vicinity the experiment was successful as all 10 cows developed symptoms and died of rinderpest the project arrived at unit 731 known after the war for its many atrocious experiments mutilations tests with the bubonic plague etc with the idea of producing 20 tons of infective powder the idea reached general tojo who although retired still had an important influence on military decisions tojo was convinced that if rinderpest plan succeeded the americans would wipe out the rice crop driving hunger to the heart of the japanese empire the plan was aborted japanese war balloon after the end of the war the nations collaborated again to end the plague as it continued to rage thus the chinese herd lost 200 000 300 000 heads each year due to the infection which condemned many farmers children included to pull the plows to get some grain from the land starting in 1947 millions of egg vaccine doses arrived from canada a network of local laboratories was established to produce the vaccine on site unfortunately it was impossible to multiply the virus in eggs the goat vaccine produced too severe symptoms in asian cattle so finally the lapinized vaccine was chosen each rabbit provided between 300 600 doses was easy to transport and to replicate the lagomorph was injected and 3 6 days later it could be sacrificed to procure more vaccines the program was an absolute success and the last rinderpest case was declared in china in 1955 at the international level nations joined forces with notable exceptions to fight hunger thus in 1945 the fao was created an agency dependent on the un created for this purpose fao took responsibility in collaboration with the oie to help the poorest countries provide resources but above all technical collaboration to eliminate rinderpest their performance was key to addressing joint prevention programs providing vaccines developing new versions of them and validating the results once the campaigns had been implemented fao and oie worked together to control cattle plague thailand had carried out many vaccination campaigns but was repeatedly re infected due to cattle smuggling from neighboring cambodia these situations underscored the need for an international effort with assistance from fao thai technicians developed a lapin vaccine that was adapted to pigs much more abundant than rabbits in the region and with a higher yield since up to 800 doses were obtained from each animal in 1957 the greatest success according to the then fao secretary general was the practical eradication of the disease in asia and its control although much remained to be done in africa the 1960s gave another great boost to the fight against the disease british veterinarian walter plouwright was able to reproduce the virus in cow kidney cell cultures this finding made it possible to dispense with live animals or eggs to keep the virus alive in a laboratory the new tcrv tissue culture rinderpest vaccine vaccine was safe for all species of livestock of all ages conferred lifelong protection and was cheap and easy to produce walter ploughwright the only downside is that it needed to be refrigerated this point was not minor since reaching remote areas in africa often zones of armed conflict was not easy but as this vaccine did not cause the disease or casualties the farmers allowed the vaccination of their animals without reluctance here is a short video that explains his findings in detail the immunization and control of this virus had two factors that facilitated its success it was fortunate that the characteristics of the virus helped control it namely the virus has 3 lineages asian and african i and ii immunity against one viral strain conferred protection against all the others allowing the same vaccine to be used in different areas of the world the reproductive rate r 0 of the virus the number of animals that an animal carrying the virus can infect is relatively low it ranges from 1 5 lineage ii to 4 6 in sudan lineage i to determine the minimum herd immunity it is calculated with this formula 1 1 r 0 which gives a herd immunity requirement ranging from 33 to 78 in fact the disease was eradicated from the somalian region with herd immunity never exceeding 50 to give a different example measles virus has an r 0 of 18 therefore it requires a very high immunization rate over 95 of the population to be effective starting in 1987 fao established a surveillance program in which after two years of no cases the countries stopped vaccinating it was the only way to verify that the virus was not active since the serology did not distinguish the animals that had antibodies due to the vaccine or to natural infection if there were no clinical cases in two years after the vaccine was discontinued fao determined that the country was free of rinderpest also towards the end of the 80s another twist came to corner the plague the veterinarian jeffrey c mariner together with scientists from the plum island research center in ny after passing the virus through vero cells from african green monkey kidney got a thermostable vaccine that is it did not need refrigeration for 30 days the trv or thermovax jeffrey c mariner the shepherds ranchers nomads veterinarians authorities all absolutely all collaborated to vaccinate the animals new diagnoses also allowed a simple swab applied to one eye to determine in 10 minutes whether or not an animal had antibodies like dominoes countries were receiving plague free status india in 2004 pakistan in 2007 ethiopia in 2008 somalia in 2010 so it was on may 25 2011 when the oie declared all countries free and rinderpest was declared the second disease ever eradicated from planet earth after smallpox in 1980 a month later the fao would ratify the oie declaration the efforts to achieve this eradication had an approximate cost of 610 million the benefit is incalculable millions of people who can escape hunger avoid suffering and death of millions of animals the protection of wildlife from a threat that caused countless deaths in addition to the many learnings obtained to mitigate the impact of other animals and human diseases as well both fao and oie have passed resolutions for member countries to destroy their stocks of plague virus that are still stored in various laboratories 24 countries still have viable virus the risks are enormous in case of escape millions of cattle would die the wild fauna would be in danger the cost of eradication would be exponential the paralysis of the cattle trade would slow down livestock development there would be a certain risk of lack of food millions of small producers would see their existence and viability compromised furthermore there is no objective need to maintain virus samples if a new epidemic were to appear today it would be possible to gather the genetic information of the virus that is available at genbank a genetic database that contains the complete sequences of the nakamura iii and kabete o strains in case it becomes necessary to develop vaccines again today we can celebrate an event like few others in history

although joe biden won the 2020 presidential election there is still misinformation circulating about the election results in maricopa county ariz in the november 2020 presidential election joe biden defeated former president donald trump by over 45 000 votes in maricopa county arizona which is the state s largest county and typically a republican stronghold but there is still misinformation circulating around that election in the state on monday may 17 the republican led maricopa county board of supervisors called for an end to an election audit that began on april 23 debunking several claims made by arizona senate republicans that there was any fraud in connection to the 2020 presidential election results in the county the board sent a scathing letter in response to arizona state senate president karen fann s claims that the county deleted important data mishandled the ballots and did not comply with legislative subpoenas in the letter the board also acknowledged a conspiracy theory that alleges the election boxes were stuffed with 40 000 ballots from asia and those ballots may contain bamboo fibers the question is there any evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election the sources maricopa county board of supervisors megan gilbertson communications director for the maricopa county elections department jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services kinder chambers independent textiles expert and bamboo guru with the texas bamboo society the answer no there is no evidence of bamboo fibers in the paper ballots cast in maricopa county arizona during the 2020 presidential election while the arizona election audit has not yet been finalized the manufacturer of maricopa county s election ballots told verify the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills what we found on may 5 dennis welch a political journalist based in phoenix interviewed an official who claimed he was helping oversee the election audit in arizona the official identified as john brakey of audit usa said he was looking for bamboo fibers because of an accusation that 40 000 ballots from southeast asia were flown to arizona and stuffed into the ballot boxes ahead of the 2020 presidential election in a video posted on twitter by welch brakey claimed the audit was being conducted because people in southeast asia use bamboo in their paper while also making it clear that he did not actually believe the claim himself verify reached out to megan gilbertson the communications director for the maricopa county elections department who told us we use vote secure paper for our 19 inch ballots in maricopa county meanwhile jeff ellington ceo of runbeck election services which is the manufacturer of all the ballots used in maricopa county during the 2020 presidential election said in a statement that the company prints ballots on paper from north american paper mills if auditors are concerned about the injection of tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots that may have come from outside the united states they should think through how this would be logistically impossible to accomplish said ellington for example 10 000 ballots is physically a lot of paper that would need to be stored and transported and then successfully smuggled into a tabulation center any such effort would be easily detected kinder chambers an independent textiles expert told verify that while bamboo paper has been made by hand in china for centuries in the united states there has never been that much paper made with bamboo chambers said the only american made paper with bamboo was created in 1995 by one manufacturer who apparently made one big batch and never made any more he says it was never made for commercial use there is no general paper that has some bamboo fibers in the u s that kind of quality is for toilet paper and i don t mean like american quality more like europe in the bathrooms of europe said chambers we don t see any bamboo paper coming out of china they make clothing t shirts sleep clothing and casual clothing bamboo paper stock would be easily recognizable especially by feel in her letter to the maricopa county board of supervisors arizona senate president karen fann invited the board to attend a meeting at the arizona state capitol on tuesday may 18 requesting that they bring officials from the elections department who would have knowledge of their elections procedures in its response the board said we will not be attending we will not be responding to any additional inquiries from your auditors their failure to understand basic election processes is an indication you didn t get the best people to perform in your political theatre we have wasted enough county resources people s tax dollars are real your auditors are not we express our united view that your audit no matter what your intentions were in the beginning has become a spectacle that is harming all of us our state has become a laughingstock you are using purple lights and spinning tables you are hunting for bamboo these are not things that serious auditors of elections do fann in a may 17 tweet said she never officially received the letter from the board claiming she got a copy from cbs news hours after it was released to the public according to a 12 news report the audit won t overturn the results of the presidential or u s senate votes in arizona because those results have already been certified under state law and supported by maricopa county audits for now there is no firm end date of when the audit will be completed but reporter brahm resnik writes the glacial pace of the recount suggests it could go into late july or august a total of almost four months unless the counting staff is beefed up

china has warned australia it is in for economic pain in the near future saying plans to hit our highest export are already taking effect and could wipe billions from our economy according to commsec iron ore prices are down sharply again this morning dropping us 11 85 a tonne or 5 9 per cent to us 188 25 a tonne after hitting a record high of more than us230 a tonne earlier this month that comes after it dropped 5 1 per cent at the end of last week sending shockwaves through mining companies on the stock market the valuable steelmaking ingredient is by far australia s biggest export and a whopping 60 per cent of it is gobbled up by china for its constantly churning mills sparked by china s high demand for steel the roaring iron ore trade has thrown australia an economic lifejacket in the midst of the coronavirus recession but beijing has had enough of paying record prices for it and is cracking down hard to reduce the cost on sunday the national development and reform commission ndrc china s top economic planner along with four other departments held a meeting with industry leaders and vowed to severely punish excessive speculation price gouging and other violations that they say helped lift prices regulators would adopt a zero tolerance approach toward illegal activities and strengthen regulation of abnormal transactions and malicious speculation the ndrc said in a statement the skyrocketing ore prices are putting china s economic recovery from the pandemic at risk with companies and everyday chinese citizens bearing the cost chinese government mouthpiece the global times says companies have already raised prices for a wide range of products including refrigerators washers and bicycles citing rising costs however analysts told the paper that china s latest moves to crack down on speculations and other market manipulation is about to send chilling waves across the globe australia s pain the times singles out australia as the nation that will be hit hardest by the crack down given iron ore is such a dominant force in our exports and accused us of profiteering from the rising prices among the most affected could be iron ore exports from australia which has benefited massively from the sky high prices in its main export emboldening officials in canberra to continue on their relentless provocation against china the paper stated while china s reliance on australian iron ore will likely continue in the foreseeable future despite its efforts to diversify sources sharp drops in iron ore prices would mean heavy losses in export revenue for australia which is already seeing declining trade with china in areas such as wine and seafood it says that iron ore prices have dropped 9 25 per tonne since beijing took action last week it says that could translate into a loss of over 2 billion in extra revenue for australia based on the amount of exports to china in the first four months of 2021 if prices fell from about 200 per ton last week to about 60 per ton during the same time last year losses in revenue could have been over 32 billion it stated related china s empty threat to harm australia australia s iron ore exports to china are at an all time high flaws in china s plan the price of iron ore is dropping as beijing implores its steelmakers to explore overseas ore resources and widen their sources of imports however analysts have pointed to flaws in the plan saying china would need to develop hundreds of new mines in a short space of time to keep up with its steel production china has been the main driver of global metal markets for more than a decade and they re showing no signs of slowing down research house capital economics estimates that chinese steel production rose by 7 5 per cent in april compared with march while capital economics believes april s production level may prove to be the peak australia s miners have seen strong activity continue into may however china is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and has promised to take steps to do so which is at odds with its recent ramp up in steel production beijing started the year with a plan to drive steel production lower in 2021 to reduce pollution from the sector which is estimated to account for about 15 per cent of the nation s total emissions this clearly isn t going to plan with steel production hitting record levels but the expectation is that the chinese government will attempt to put the brakes on booming steel production in the second half of this year given australia sells over 60 per cent of its iron ore to china alone this could mean we take a serious economic hit australian mining insiders have told the afr they are wary of what could happen in the near future if china goes hard on its intervention in the steel market global demand feeds industry optimism however they said the level of demand across the rest of the world is so strong that they see no need to panic if china cuts steel production someone else will do it a source inside one of australia s big miners told the publication feeding that optimism is the fact that the steel market around the world is red hot right now european steel giant arcelormittal this month lifted its steel prices for the 12th time since november taking a tonne of hot rolled coil steel in europe to 1050 a1655 up by more than 80 per cent over the past seven months related china to step up domestic iron ore mining roughly 60 per cent of our iron ore goes directly to china meanwhile nucor the biggest steel maker in the united states is taking the stock market by storm and struggling to find workers to keep up with its expanding operations even covid 19 ravaged india is going hard to increase steel exports which rose about 26 per cent in the march quarter according to s p global platts however shiro armstrong director of the australia japan research centre at the australian national university told news com au if china and australia try to diversify away from each other then it will have serious consequences for both nations he said that the idea australian mines can simply find other nations to make up for the iron trade we do with china sounds fanciful it would be unrealistic in the short term and likely in the medium and long term for both nations because it would come at a cost neither governments or mining companies will be able to bear he said government intervention could lead to more uncertainty he said the international market between australia and china is one that has delivered there is not good track record when governments try to intervene in the market and china s efforts could lead to more uncertainty and higher prices there he said none of their policies will work because they would lead to a huge hit to china s construction sector on the flip side for australia he said the demand for iron ore elsewhere in the world simply isn t there especially with prices as high as they are now the latest figures show that china produces over half of the world s steel producing over 996 million metric tonnes in 2019 the next highest was india which produced nine times less with just over 111 million metric tonnes mr armstrong said it would be best for the governments of both nations to stay out of the market we ve had a very beneficial relationship with china that s driven by market fundamentals if both countries start looking to retreat from that open market that s a pathway to living standards in both countries he said china s reliance on australian iron ore which has resulted in massive financial windfalls for our biggest mining companies have come despite trade tensions between the two countries being at an all time high related australia has failed on assertive china china s president xi jinping picture world economic forum wef afp prime minister scott morrison picture nca newswire joel carrett outright ban is unimaginable according to chinese state media ndrc spokesman jin xiandong blamed australia for damaging trade relations consequently we have to make the legitimate and necessary reaction and australia should bear full responsibility for such moves mr jin told the conference we urged the australian side to treat china australian co operation objectively and reasonably to treat chinese companies fairly end the disruption of bilateral trade and investment co operation and take actions to bring forward bilateral relations for healthy development but despite australia and china s icy relationship an outright ban on iron ore is almost unimaginable instead beijing could resort to other tactics to make the export of iron ore more difficult for australia companies energy research and consultancy firm wood mackenzie told bloomberg earlier this month while an outright ban would be almost unimaginable various forms of restrictions delays or increased administrative burdens on australian iron ore imports could yet happen wood mackenzie warned
