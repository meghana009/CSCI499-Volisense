the other side of is that the state has tons of debt on its books currently luby said so having a credit rating upgrade means that they can borrow more cheaply which means that they may have opportunities to refinance the existing debt still it s important to keep perspective illinois bond rating is still the worst of any state in the country and it s not really close and challenges persist namely a structural budget deficit brought on by growing pension obligations not to mention existing pension debt and the one time infusion of federal stimulus dollars cannot be counted on in years ahead the state of illinois is still baa rated there s a significant difference in credit worthiness comparing it to a aaa rated state like texas or maryland or minnesota luby said so illinois still has a long way to go here

the us china trade war saw an unprecedented episode of reciprocal tariff increases between the world s two largest economies following a series of multilateral tariffs in early 2018 the trump administration increased tariffs on imports from china in several stages and almost every product category average rates rose from the mfn average of roughly 4 to about 23 by mid 2019 china retaliated promptly so that bilateral trade collapsed by 15 30 on both sides see figure 1 figure 1 tariffs and bilateral volumes of us and chinese exports during the trade war source he et al 2021 notes panels a and b indicate average tariff rates the two countries applied on imports from the respective other country and how they contrast with most favoured nation mfn rates applied under wto law in normal times panels c and d suggest a decrease in bilateral trade by 15 30 percent when comparing actual with fitted lines during 2018 19 in shared area the effects of the trade war are not limited to bilateral trade flows they are felt in many areas of economic activity supply chain disruptions higher prices and increased economic uncertainty cool down consumption and investment climate amiti et al 2020 cavallo et al 2021 fajgelbaum et al 2020 huang et al 2019 at the firm level exporters exposed to higher tariffs have to cope with an artificial increase in the price of their sold products while importers have to pay more for foreign purchases or find new second best suppliers both see their competitiveness eroding and lower sales and profits force them to re optimise their cost structure and investment decisions including their labour demand what we can learn from firms online job vacancy postings in recently published research he et al 2021 we exploit data from a major chinese online job board 51job com to document within firm adjustments of labour demand to the trade war vacancy postings reveal firms willingness to invest into new employees and can therefore be interpreted as indicators of their short to medium term business expectations firms expecting increasing sales hire more while an expected contraction should result in fewer postings the data are representative of the scale of economic activity across chinese regions figure 2 but less so of its sectoral economic structure and labour market demographics as can be seen in figure 3 vacancy postings at 51job com mostly target young white collar workers 1 figure 2 number of job vacancies and the economic size of chinese prefecture level cities in a cross section source he et al 2021 notes data combines information collected from 51job com during may november 2019 and 2016 information from china statistical yearbooks all variables are expressed in logs and standardized to have a mean equal to zero and a standard deviation of 1 each dot denotes a different prefecture level city slope indicates estimated coefficient of bivariate linear regression figure 3 chinese online job ads mainly target higher educated workers source he et al 2021 notes authors calculations using data collected from 51job com between may and november 2019 and from china s population censuses 2000 2015 proportions in census data are based on urban employed population proportions in job vacancy data reflect requested minimum level of educational background a key advantage of the data is their high frequency and timeliness enabling us to evaluate short term responses of chinese firms to the trade war in terms of their revealed hiring intentions i e business expectations 2 the data also offer detailed insights into different dimensions of firms labour demand in contrast to the typically more aggregated administrative data on job openings we observe the number of jobs posted by individual firms as well as the content of each of their job vacancies these include among others announced salary offers alternative forms of compensation e g non monetary or performance based fixed term or permanent contracts as well as required educational background skills or work experience our sample covers the period from may through november 2019 which includes the final stage of escalation in the trade war we successfully match about 30 000 firms with their corresponding trade record from 2016 at china customs together with product level information on the timing and magnitude of reciprocal tariff increases we can evaluate firms exposure and adjustments to the trade war over time 3 about one quarter of the firms were entirely unexposed to the trade war according to our measure because they did not trade with the us in 2016 a small fraction of our firms were exposed only to earlier stages of the trade war during 2018 but not to the latest stage by using 2016 data to determine firms trade structure and their resulting tariff exposure we avoid identification and endogeneity problems that could bias our estimates the trade war resulted in fewer job postings and shifting job profiles we use econometric panel data methods to evaluate the effect of tariffs on several outcome variables characterising firm level labour demand all our specifications include fixed effects to control for underlying seasonality patterns and other potential confounders such as regional and sectoral trends or unobserved firm characteristics our outcome variables include the stock i e the total number of active vacancy postings of a firm and their flow i e only the newly posted vacancies in a given month we find that firms that were relatively more exposed to us tariffs in 2019 responded by posting fewer jobs in the six months following the tariff increase the reduction amounts to 2 4 3 2 fewer ads on average per firm announced salary offers were also reduced by 0 5 on average which corresponds to about us 70 less per year converting this number into us purchasing power assuming it to be about four times higher we obtain a loss of approximately 280 next to this we find some evidence of increased advertisement of potential bonus and subsidy payments in the vacancy postings of exposed firms although these latter effects are statistically fragile they might indicate firms ambitions to shift towards more flexible performance based compensation schemes a robust finding is that job ads of firms facing us tariff increases request a lower educational background which might reflect a compositional effect as goods affected by us tariffs are relatively skill intensive firms exposed to china s retaliatory tariffs on imported us products do not reveal statistically significant and systematic adjustments in their vacancy postings in some cases the signs of our estimated coefficients are the opposite to those obtained for us tariffs suggesting potentially compensating effects however our core indicator the number of job ads suggests fewer postings so that both us tariffs and chinese retaliation seem to have had predominantly negative effects on firm level labour demand during the period of investigation next to these average effects our study explores heterogeneous adjustments across firms where we distinguish their size and ownership in some cases larger firms appear to respond differently than the rest of our sample they show more modest adjustments to us tariffs in terms of their overall job posting activity and salary offers while more job ads offer bonus payments and subsidies to employees educational background requirements increase slightly among large firms differential patterns are also found among ownership dimensions where privately owned domestic firms appear to drive our findings while this is partly due to their dominance in our sample state owned controlled enterprises and foreign owned firms account for 7 1 and 21 2 respectively we argue that such firms are also more constrained in adjusting to the trade war as they cannot rely on an external network or safety net when facing economic disruptions erratic trade policies will hardly stimulate job growth our empirical evidence suggests that the us china trade war had mainly negative effects on job growth even though we cannot ultimately quantify their magnitude however given that our sample does not capture earlier stages of escalation in the trade war our estimates are likely to indicate a lower bound and adjustments to previous rounds of tariff increases would need to be added moreover we do not consider the indirect effects of the trade war on firms that have demand or supply linkages or other business relations with chinese importers and exporters similarly the fact that our data comes from a job board that targets mainly white collar workers implies that adjustments among blue collar workers remain largely undocumented nevertheless our results suggest that the experience of firms and job seekers in china is similar to that in exposed us industries and regions waugh 2019 goswami 2020 after all tariffs remain an indirect labour market policy tool that can hardly fulfil the promise of jobs and economic prosperity and the trade war reveals their complexity old style protectionism does more harm than good when international supply chains are disrupted handley et al 2020 flaaen and pierce 2020 moreover the economic uncertainty created by discretionary and legally disputed trade policies adds to the difficulty of foreseeing the economic consequences of the tariffs this is particularly true in the labour market where hiring denotes an investment which entails sunk costs and uncertain returns for the firm before hiring new workers and substituting tariffed imports for own in house production firms might find it rational to search for alternative suppliers of their inputs first given the bilateral i e discriminatory nature of most tariffs during this trade war many alternative suppliers might reside in foreign countries creating trade diversion so that positive employment effects remain uncertain even at the industry level it is therefore questionable that a return to protectionism brings real benefits for any of the countries involved references amiti m s h kong and d

trim his sails into a growing wind of unease about the direction of inflation said chris beauchamp chief market analyst at ig in a note whether he moderates this line under sustained questioning

undergone a broadly underwhelming session in contrast to us markets which continue to set new records said cmc s michael hewson uk cpi jumped sharply in june to 2 5 a much bigger jump than expected though it really shouldn t have been too unexpected given how strong recent ppi numbers have been in recent months the bigger puzzle is why expectations are always on the low side when it comes to

economists at pantheon macroeconomics cast their eye over the written testimony from fed head jerome powell ahead of his appearance at the house later today saying he has not broken any new ground mr powell repeated his view that inflation will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating as bottlenecks unwind and unfavorable base effects fade the chair did not directly allude to his previously expressed view that rising labor supply in the fall will prevent the reopening inflation spike from becoming embedded though he did note that labor participation right now is little changed from a year ago and is still low on the policy front mr powell said that the substantial progress needed to trigger tapering is still a ways off but that the debate will continue in coming meetings in short no change from the june fomc meeting and no hint that the latest round of inflation data are threatening mr powell s core view still dovish they added back in london the ftse 100 was continuing

are down 0 65 at just over 22 777 in the uk the continued rise of delta variant cases provides downward pressure on stocks that should be looking forward to monday s full reopening said market analyst joshua mahony at ig instead airlines cinemas restaurants and alike are all under heavy selling pressure as investors consider the potential ramifications of another major surge in hospitalisations the uk has gone from having the lowest cases per 100 000 in europe to the worst in just six weeks thus while there is hope that the uk vaccination efforts will stop the rise in hospitalisations at a manageable level there is a very tangible risk that monday s reopening leads to a third wave of cases and another bout of restrictions from an international perspective the hope is that proof of vaccinations and testing will allow travel yet airlines are likely to remain under pressure given the rising likeliness that the uk is consigned to the red list for many major tourist destinations alongside the higher than expected inflation data earlier higher house price trends also continued with a 10 leap in uk house prices over the 12 months to may many will point towards falling commodity prices to speculate that a decline factory costs will soon transmit to lower prices with the uk ppi input reading showing a surprise decline on 0 1 added mahony nonetheless many businesses will have hiked their prices in a bid to regain lost earnings with few expecting that shift to be temporary in nature the bank of england has remained steadfast in their stance that above target inflation will be fleeting but markets will only truly breathe a sigh of relief once we see this upward trajectory reverse the soaring new zealand dollar is also worth flagging as the kiwi central bank turned more hawkish with the market now pricing a first interest rate hike at the october meeting the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz said they expected inflation to spike higher but that it would be the result of either one off factors such as higher oil prices or temporary factors having to do with the pandemic such as supply shortfalls and higher transport costs this is a significant change for the rbnz which is now the first g10 central bank to withdraw its stimulus and probably warrants a stronger nzd said analyst marshall gittler at bdswiss gittler said he didn t anticipate this kind of price action on the nzd luckily bloomberg said it was a surprise move meaning i wasn t the only one caught out 10am ftse losses narrowing heading into mid morning trading the ftse 100 had recovered some ground lost in the wake of the spike in inflation but was still down around 34 points at 7 090 at around 10am the blue chip index was being supported by defensive stocks with banks and miners among the biggest risers as investors looked for havens to park their cash amid fears of inflationary pressures continuing for the foreseeable future natwest group plc lon natw was the biggest gainer rising 2 to 205 4p while lloyds banking group plc lon lloy jumped 1 4 to 47 4p while barclays plc lon barc climbed 1 1 to 171 9p banking analyst andrew coombs at citigroup said the bounce back in the economy has been sharper than expected with mar apr gdp growth well ahead of expectations even if may was slightly softer and we consequently expect further write backs with there is also the possibility that rising inflation may force the boe to hike rates earlier than first envisaged meanwhile the fpc statement on dividends implies a return to more normalized capital return payouts among the london large caps citi said it preference in order is nwg buy lloy buy hsbc buy barc neutral stan neutral meanwhile miner anglo american plc lon aal was up 1 at 2 976p while glencore plc lon glen rose 0 9 to 316 7p the main driver for these gains appears to be that higher inflation is a positive sign for commodity producers and the chance of interest rate hikes which in turn benefit banks defensive stocks may continue to be in play for some time with analysts at the national institute of economic and social research niesr estimating that inflation will not peak until march next year 9 20am inflation in depth uk inflation will reach close to 4 by the end of this year forecasts capital economics though it should not last long at that level before falling back in 2022 as the impact of higher commodity prices and supply shortages fades as a result the economists said we don t expect the bank of england to tighten policy anytime soon but taking lessons from history pretty much all periods of high inflation appeared temporary at first said economist kallum pickering at berenberg the risks to the inflation outlook are titled to the upside over the medium term given the long run outlook for persistent inflation modestly above central bank targets in the uk and the us a stronger than expected near term inflation impulse could turn into a sustained trend for now this risk remains modest however the warning from history is clear all periods of high sustained inflation appear temporary at first pickering said he added that the fact that the boe has acknowledged the potential economic risks from a sudden tightening of financial conditions helps to mitigate part of the threat aware of a taper tantrum risk policymakers can take steps to soften it broadly speaking rising market rates supported by better economic performance would be a positive sign in our view they would reflect strong demand for investment assets and credit while the market adjustment may trigger some temporary correction it would probably would not present a serious headwind to medium term economic growth 8 50am ftse 100 opens on the back foot the ftse 100 fell at the open as the inflation threat in the uk

every investor in united states steel corporation nyse x should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups large companies usually have institutions as shareholders and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies we also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned united states steel is a pretty big company it has a market capitalization of us 6 5b normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size taking a look at our data on the ownership groups below it seems that institutional investors have bought into the company let s take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about united states steel see our latest analysis for united states steel what does the institutional ownership tell us about united states steel many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market so they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices advertisement advertisement as you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in united states steel this can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community however it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors they too get it wrong sometimes it is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time so it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of united states steel below of course keep in mind that there are other factors to consider too institutional investors own over 50 of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions we note that hedge funds don t have a meaningful investment in united states steel our data shows that blackrock inc is the largest shareholder with 13 of shares outstanding for context the second largest shareholder holds about 8 4 of the shares outstanding followed by an ownership of 4 2 by the third largest shareholder a closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50 implying that no single shareholder has a majority advertisement advertisement while studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock s expected performance there are plenty of analysts covering the stock so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting too story continues insider ownership of united states steel the definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count company management run the business but the ceo will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders however on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1 of united states steel corporation keep in mind that it s a big company and the insiders own us 41m worth of shares the absolute value might be more important than the proportional share it is good to see board members owning shares but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying general public ownership the general public holds a 32 stake in united states steel while this group can t necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run next steps i find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company but to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too be aware that united states steel is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis and 1 of those doesn t sit too well with us advertisement advertisement ultimately the future is most important you can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company nb figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months which refer to the 12 month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated this may not be consistent with full year annual report figures this article by simply wall st is general in nature it does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock and does not take account of your objectives or your financial situation we aim to bring you long term focused analysis driven by fundamental data note that our analysis may not factor in the latest price sensitive company announcements or qualitative material simply wall st has no position in any stocks mentioned have feedback on this article concerned about the content get in touch with us directly alternatively email editorial team at simplywallst com

the news hitting the market is clouding the precious metals outlook higher u s treasuries and a hawkish fed are turning into a dangerous concoction running out of excuses with investors attention span rivalling that of a young child the inflationary carousel has gone from hot to cold and to hot once again for example after short covering the delta variant and the fed s hawkish shift dropped the guillotine on the u s the long term benchmark languished in defeat however with inflation s reincarnation once again shifting the narrative i warned on july 9 that investors are still underestimating the inflationary fervor i wrote with the consumer price index scheduled for release on july 13 another dose of reality could be forthcoming case in point with the commodity producer price index ppi surging by 18 98 year over year yoy in may the highest yoy percentage increase since 1974 the print implies a roughly 5 to 5 5 yoy increase in the headline cpi to explain when the commodity ppi increased by 17 4 yoy in july 2008 the headline cpi rose by 5 3 in august thus with the commodity ppi surging by 18 98 in may all signs point to another surprising headline cpi print for june to that point with the headline surging by 5 32 yoy on july 13 vs 4 90 expected the transitory narrative suffered another body blow for context all inflation is transitory however there is a profound difference between three months of transitory inflation and 12 months of transitory inflation please see below to explain the green line above tracks the yoy percentage change in the commodity while the red line above tracks the yoy percentage change in the headline cpi if you analyze the relationship you can see that the pair have a close connection likewise while investors comb through the print and search for aberrations that support their outlook they re missing the most important link for example with the used cars and trucks cpi surging by 45 2 yoy in june disbelievers suggest that once the outlier recedes it will quell the inflationary momentum for context i ve been warning since april that the manheim used vehicle index signalled a profound jump in the used cars and trucks cpi despite that while investors lament the obvious of course the used cars and trucks cpi will decelerate in the coming months the commodity ppi is still the most important indicator of where the inflation story is headed next please see below to explain the scatter plot above depicts the relationship between the headline cpi and the commodity ppi since 1994 for context the headline cpi is plotted on the vertical axis while the commodity ppi is plotted on the horizontal axis if you analyze their movement you can see that the pair have a strong linear relationship correlation moreover if you focus your attention on the right side of the chart you can see that the commodity ppi has only risen by 15 yoy or more for a month five times since 1994 on top of that if you follow the red arrow you can see that the ppi cpi relationship remains on trend the bottom line if the commodity which is scheduled for release today remains hot then expect the headline cpi to follow suit the economy growing too much furthermore while the used cars and trucks cpi is poised to slow over the medium term i warned on june 3 that rent inflation could easily take its place for context the shelter cpi accounts for more than 30 of the movement of the headline cpi and with the federal national mortgage association otc fannie mae projecting that the shelter cpi will increase from 2 0 annualized to about 4 5 and last through at least 2022 the transitory increases to the rate of overall inflation may be more prolonged than many are expecting please see below source fannie mae likewise with inflation surging and the u s federal reserve pouring gasoline on the fire st louis fed president james bullard told the wall street journal on july 12 released on july 13 that i am a little bit concerned that we re feeding into an incipient housing bubble i think we don t need to be doing that with the economy growing at 7 please see below source wsj in addition conagra brands nyse ceo sean connolly also warned on july 13 that this is an atypical level of inflation it s the highest inflation level our company has seen in as many years as we can remember for context conagra brands is an american food manufacturer and is home to well known brands such as marie callender s healthy choice and slim jim please see below source bloomberg if that wasn t enough jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon was asked during the company s q2 earnings call on july 13 about how the current recovery compares to the recovery following the global financial crisis gfc he responded i think they re completely different fundamentally the consumer their house value is up their stock rises up their incomes are up their savings are up their confidence are up the pandemic is kind of in the rearview mirror hopefully nothing gets worse with it and they re ready to go he added jobs are plentiful wages are going up these are all good things and so obviously if the inflation can be worse than people think i think it will be a little bit worse with these kinds of things i don t think it s all temporary but that doesn t matter if we have very strong growth even more revealing while dimon said that he s not predicting that the u s 10 year treasury yield goes to 3 he mentioned that you may have growth in the second half this year stronger than it s ever been in the united states of america furthermore cfo jeremy barnum said that the largest bank in the u s is putting its money where its mouth is and that s why the cash on its balance sheet has not been invested in u s treasuries please see below source jpmorgan seeking alpha finally with the chicago fed releasing its survey of business conditions cfsbc on july 13 its labor cost index is now at an all time high and its non labor cost index remains materially elevated thus the fed is running out of excuses for not scaling back its bond buying program source chicago fed in conclusion precious metals continue to hope for a bullish catalyst but the news hitting the market is clouding their outlook while conventional wisdom suggests that surging inflation is bullish for the and mining stocks the cocktail of higher u s treasury yields and a hawkish fed more than offsets the optimistic long term argument as a result while precious metals may generate short term bursts of strength and their very long term outlook remains favorable their medium term outlook is extremely ominous with the gunning for 93 and surging inflation likely to force the fed s hand a september taper is unlikely to elicit a positive response from the metals

washington reuters a strengthening u s economy was spinning off broad based job gains through early july that were particularly strong for lower skilled occupations the federal reserve reported wednesday in its latest beige book compendium of reports about the economy but prices were also strong rising at an above average pace the fed said with its business contacts apparently uncertain that higher inflation would fade soon while some contacts felt that pricing pressures were transitory the majority expected further increases in input costs and selling prices in the coming months the fed reported in its beige book report of anecdotes on economic conditions across the 12 regional reserve banks districts the report was released as fed chair jerome powell was in the middle of the first of two days of semi annual congressional testimony on the economy and monetary policy powell pledged to keep the fed s powerful support in place to complete the rebound from the coronavirus pandemic but was peppered with pointed questions about the current hot streak of inflation overall the u s economy in the period from late may through early july was described in the beige book as displaying moderate to robust growth marking the report s strongest overall characterization of the national economy since early 2018 but the report noted a heightened sense of concern among businesses that the supply chain disruptions that have become a staple of the economy s reopening from covid 19 related shutdowns would persist for longer than officials had predicted the outlook for demand improved further but many contacts expressed uncertainty or pessimism over the easing of supply constraints the report said all 12 districts reported employment gains with a quarter of them characterizing the improvement in the labor market as moderate or strong wage growth was also widespread with low wage workers in particular seeing above average pay increases as companies scramble to fill a record number of vacant jobs and references to other perks such as bonuses were abundant across districts but a number of employers reported the draw of higher pay was not bringing in job seekers one kentucky restaurant reported offering a starting wage of 16 per hour and receiving no applicants according to a report from the st louis federal reserve whose president james bullard is among the more hawkish policymakers bullard one of seven fed officials to see interest rates needing to rise next year has posited that the coronavirus pandemic and other factors such as a booming stock market may have changed the dynamics of labor supply with some workers choosing to retire for instance rather than go back to work the beige book is produced eight times a year published two weeks ahead of the conclusion of each meeting of the federal open market committee the central bank s policy setting panel the latest report was compiled by the federal reserve bank of boston based on information collected by july 2 the fomc next meets on july 27 28 and is expected to continue the debate joined at its june meeting over how much longer to keep its extraordinary support measures for the economy in place in the face of higher than expected inflation reporting by howard schneider editing by andrea ricci
traditionally the embodiment of the american dream was homeownership easily one of the best investment decisions you can make buying a home facilitates building wealth for yourself not for a landlord real estate provides potentially robust passive income revenue streams particularly if you live in a high profile metropolitan area unfortunately because of the covid 19 pandemic s unprecedented disruption the housing market went berserk leaving many buyers on the outside looking in that s why real estate manager bridge investment group s initial public offering ipo is intriguing by siding with the professionals public investors have another pathway to wealth accrual bridge investment group financial history when the covid 19 pandemic first breached u s borderlines the crisis threw the entire commerce infrastructure for a loop most notably the sudden drop in foot traffic devastated the consumer discretionary market which then translated to missed revenue opportunities for multiple industries to mitigate both the public and economic impact of the sars cov 2 virus state and federal authorities initiated lockdown measures along with financial support to bolster consumer confidence the unique dynamic of this public health crisis created a strange dichotomy in the housing market at first many prospective buyers sat on the sidelines anticipating that a deflationary wave would induce lower prices instead residential real state went on the opposite trajectory booming to incredible heights this dynamic caused panic among buyers who reasoned that they better get in now before prices moved any higher cynically the skyrocketing valuations in housing set up a lucrative environment for residential real estate management firms such as bridge investment group according to its s 1 filing net income attributable to the company registered 146 9 million in 2020 from a total revenue of 231 9 million a 63 revenue to income conversion rate despite the destruction of the pandemic speaks to the fruitfulness of the underlying sector moving forward the expected normalization of society could inspire ipo investors to pay a higher than normal premium for brdg stock for instance a similar publicly traded company mid america apartment communities nyse maa featured a price earnings pe ratio of 43 in 2019 the following year the pe ratio jumped to nearly 58 then to 63 times earnings during the first quarter of 2021 because bridge investment covers both multifamily and affordable housing units the company will play a relevant role in the post covid era therefore it might not make sense to assess brdg stock on its current financial status but rather its expected premium based on peer comparisons bridge investment group potential according to information provided by fortune business insights the global property management market could reach over 28 billion by 2028 representing a compound annual growth rate of 9 3 from 2021 combined with an eventual recovery trek in both personal and professional activities property management firms may benefit from a demand boomerang effect first while no one can predict where the housing market will eventually end up little evidence exists that it will correct to the downside instead as a recent article by the washington post noted only the fast pace of growth has slowed however the prices themselves are still rising which is becoming incredibly problematic for everyday buyers instead many home seekers priced out of the market may turn to property management firms effectively pooling their funds with other discouraged buyers to secure wealth building opportunities in real estate though it s not quite the same as direct ownership at the moment an investment in brdg stock and its ilk is the most realistic and viable alternative in this sector second bridge investment group manages properties in the commercial and professional markets including office spaces development and logistics net lease and properties here the rebound effect from revenge shopping basically consumers reclaiming their normal activities as coronavirus infections fade into the rearview mirror should filter down into every segment of the economy ultimately then bridge investment provides retail buyers an opportunity to advantage not only the residential bounce back but also the restoration of commerce so brdg stock might command a surprising premium following its ipo how to buy bridge investment group brdg stock although the introduction of new shares provides the possibility of tremendous upside public market debuts carry significant risks primarily retail buyers don t get the best deal as they usually must buy new equity units at the open in contrast privileged investors and entities can buy shares assuming underwriter acceptance at their initial selling price underwriters often price their ipos below their expected market value to entice their best clients mainly institutional investors to continue participating in new offerings herein lies the advantage to retail buyers they can pick and choose the ipos they want to participate in also the process of acquiring ipos at the open is easy if you already know how to buy stocks if you don t just follow the steps below step 1 pick a brokerage when the internet first gained public acceptance online brokerages competed heavily on price now the advent of mobile trading apps essentially negated the pricing paradigm as virtually all consumer level platforms feature commission free trading instead the competition among brokerages comes down to convenience educational opportunities and access to derivative markets and vehicles below is a list of the best brokers to consider step 2 decide how many shares you want the share count is a vital component of your investing strategy as it determines your risk reward profile a higher count opens the door to more profitability but simultaneously exposes you to greater risk therefore pick a number that balances conviction with risk tolerance step 3 choose your order type before diving in familiarize yourself with these market concepts bid the bid is the highest price a buyer will offer it is always lower than the ask the bid is the highest price a buyer will offer it is always lower than the ask ask conversely the ask is the lowest price a seller will take it is always higher than

profile tighter spreads indicate healthy demand due to buyers and sellers willingness to negotiate in contrast wider spreads indicate less demand and more risk the difference in the bid and ask price

the montana department of environmental quality laid down the law last week issuing a violation letter to the montana tunnels mine in jefferson city the mine is considered officially abandoned or complete the company owes a 16 8 million reclamation bond and reclamation is overdue said the deq montana tunnels mining inc owns the once active gold silver zinc and lead mine in jefferson county if the company doesn t respond and resolve the issues within 15 days of official receipt of the letter the mine will forfeit ownership and the 19 7 million bond the state is currently holding should forfeiture occur deq mining bureau chief dan walsh said montana house bill 722 passed in 2019 would open the door for another mining company posting the full bond to come in and take over the operation which would include a major expansion the deq could allow up to five years for a company to establish itself if there are no takers the deq would assume responsibility for reclamation 16 8 million shy of the planned cost the mine hasn t produced ore since 2008 since then the state has pushed for reclamation as the mine s potentially unstable pit wall necessitates re routing clancy creek waste rock must be contoured buildings demolished and the tailings impoundment dewatered as well instead of proceeding with remediation montana tunnels has long promised a major expansion costing an estimated 145 million it claims would generate 270 jobs the company has yet to show up with the funds to do so let alone put up the full bond it owes the mine s permit was suspended in 2018 for failure to post adequate bond estimated at 36 5 million as of september 2020 in addition to the 16 8 million bond still owed to the state the company owes 7 7 million to jefferson county in back taxes abandoned mines are an old story in montana but the story isn t over pegasus gold corp s notorious 1998 bankruptcy left behind endless environmental cleanups across the state and left taxpayers in the state to foot an over 100 million bill at the pegasus mine near zortman alone pegasus once ran the montana tunnels mine apollo gold an entity that emerged from the bankruptcy took ownership in 2002 and denver based montana tunnels fully acquired the mine in 2009 since then all that montana tunnels has mined at the site is debt reclamation reclamation of the site is at the forefront of concern for the deq conservation groups montana trout unlimited and earthworks have for years pushed the deq to take the bond money paid so far and reclaim the site the organizations have even gone to the length of privately investigating the structural integrity of the mine s pit the deq initiated and approved a new addition to the site wide reclamation plan last year which would permanently divert clancy creek away from the eroding edges of the mine s defunct pit the mine installed a pipe to temporarily divert the creek several years ago when part of the pit wall collapsed montana fish wildlife and parks in 2017 said clancy creek needed to be addressed in order to avoid negative impacts to native westslope cutthroat trout habitat downstream but despite last year s new plan to get the show on the road montana tunnels still hasn t moved forward with reclamation at the site the deq said in the violation letter fortunately the mine doesn t show acid mine drainage common in abandoned mines in montana the mine doesn t currently pose a significant threat to environmental health the deq said in its letter adding that the pit is filling with water but the water has been tested and meets water quality standards montana trout unlimited hired environmental engineer jim kuipers to investigate montana tunnels in 2017 kuipers said it s not a question if the north side of the pit is going to cave in but when this mine is on the most extreme end of unstable in my experience it s the most extreme case of high pit wall caving i ve ever seen kuipers told the montana standard in 2017 dave williams a bureau of land management geologist at the time concurred with that assessment when reclamation will start still depends on montana tunnels response to the violation letter and the deq s course of action afterward in the event expansion does go forward either by montana tunnels or another company clancy creek would be reclaimed in a different manner but would still be a top priority going forward walsh said promises on tuesday montana tunnels owner patrick imeson told the montana standard something he has said in the past the mine will get the money and expand you know we re working on an overall financing plan and so we re kind of a little bit at the vagaries of the financial markets but we are active in the market on the capital raising side now he said imeson said he had a commitment from a bonding company but didn t reveal the name of the company he said he s engaged with a major investment bank to raise the 145 million for the expansion of the mine but didn t reveal the name of the bank he said the company has been actively fundraising with the bank for two or three weeks it s an ongoing process they re giving us indications that they believe that they can complete this transaction in 60 to 90 days he said so if that s reality that would be the kind of time frame that we d be posting both the bonds and continue with the expansion plan in august 2017 imeson told the montana standard financing would be secured in fall of that year meanwhile the company owes jefferson county about 4 9 million in back taxes on the mine property and 2 8 million in mining tax according to jefferson county treasurer terri kunz the county has worked diligently to get what s owed since 2009 kunz said and is now in the process of trying to take control of the tax deed for the mine property the county is working with the deq to see if it can be done without taking on responsibility for the cleanup kunz said in the meantime the county s been without a mine that some including mark thompson vice president of montana resources in butte have said has real potential and been left with a massive shortage in funding for community essentials those taxes would be a windfall for the schools and the fire department it would make a huge difference to them their budgets have been short every year since 2009 because those taxes aren t paid kunz said jefferson county commissioner leonard wortman said montana tunnels would be among the top taxpayers in the county if the company paid its taxes the schools are the biggest losers in the deal he said imeson said the company will pay those taxes however he said they re tied in with the same long running funding promise securing the owed bond for reclamation and the 7 7 million in owed taxes will likely depend on securing the 145 million his company hopes to acquire from an investment bank for the expansion he said imeson also said the company intends to respond to the deq s request do the reclamation pay the remaining bond owed and expand the mine we re in discussion with our lawyers at this point regarding the response imeson said as the montana standard reported in 2017 imeson has had serious troubles with the securities exchange commission in the past and has been sued by his lawyer for disputed legal claims wortman remains hopeful the county will someday see the tax money but doesn t expect it he said he is generally pro mining and cited golden sunlight as a mine that s been good to the county he said he s concerned for the remediation of the site for clancy creek the stability of the pit wall and for the state taxpayers who may get stuck paying for part of the cleanup imeson has let the county down wortman said he s made promises to us that he hasn t been able to fulfill looking forward david brooks executive director of montana trout unlimited said the montana tunnels debacle is more proof the law needs to better protect the public from irresponsible mining practices if the bond is forfeited and no company takes on the bond and expansion of the mine the deq will have 19 7 million to perform a cleanup the agency estimates will cost 36 5 million walsh said the deq would then hire a private engineering firm to produce a new assessment of the remedy cost and seek funding for the difference one possible avenue would be a grant from the montana department of natural resources and conservation state money another possible resource is reclamation specific funding paid by currently operating mines that s taxes paid by operating mines they re self taxing in that regard and that s money that s available for reclamation so in the traditional look at taxes of citizens i don t feel like it fits that category but others might interpret that differently walsh said whether any funding could be obtained from those sources is yet undetermined and would likely fall short of what the current plan for reclamation requires walsh said in other words the public may not pay as much but would instead have to settle for a lesser cleanup so at this point it s really hard to predict how much or if there would be a public funded source that could be used for the reclamation activities there and as a result the fallback is that we look at the reclamation plan we potentially look at changes to that reclamation plan to get the best reclamation outcome that we can for the bond dollars that we do hold he said kunz and wortman said they would love to see a responsible mining company come in and continue production at the mine in their county brooks said he isn t convinced more mining is the answer in the event of forfeiture which would mean another company will have walked away without paying its dues leaving another expensive mess in its wake i think there is some urgency to start reclamation now brooks said

crop producers will be able to salvage more crop for feed without insurance penalty while livestock producers will be able to access more money for water projects crop producers will be able to salvage more crop for feed without insurance penalty while livestock producers will be able to access more money for water projects david marit the provincial agriculture minister announced the measures as a response to drought conditions on july 14 the government of saskatchewan is looking at all the options available to support the producers at this time he said we are encouraging producers to take advantage of our existing programs and services we have in the province for the saskatchewan crop insurance corporation s purposes when crops are severely damaged and the appraised yield falls below an established threshold level the yield is reduced to zero as there is a feed shortage the corporation is doubling the low yield appraisal threshold values for those who salvage their cereal or pulse crops as feed without negatively impacting future individual coverage the government is asking producers to contact their local scic office before they graze bale or silage any damaged crops to discuss their options crop insurance coverage will not be negatively impacted if customers choose to divert grain crops to feed we encourage grain producers to work with neighboring livestock producers to make feed available marit said the province has also temporarily boosted the farm and ranch water infrastructure program the maximum rebate for livestock producers only will increase from 50 000 to 150 000 for the april 1 2021 to march 31 2022 period the first 50 000 will be based on a 50 50 cost share while the remaining 100 000 will be on a 70 30 government producer cost share this will further help with the development of secure sustainable water sources for the livestock producers marit said the province has also requested the federal government offer assistance through the livestock tax deferral program for producers who need to liquidate part of their herd due to feed and water shortage the announcement from the provincial government comes after the agricultural producers association of saskatchewan and the saskatchewan stock growers association called for action while the requests about salvaging crop for feed and making changes to the farm and ranch water infrastructure program were addressed by the province one that wasn t was a call for both the provincial and federal governments to extend the agristability enrollment deadline and provide enhanced coverage the announcement today really has to be more about what is needed today not 18 months from now when agristability would kick in marit said we feel this announcement today will obviously help quite a few livestock producers in sourcing feed because i don t think this is just a saskatchewan issue i think this is a western canada issue it s even a midwestern united states issue as well
deaths due to overdose have skyrocketed at an alarming rate over the past year according to the national center for health statistics the rate rose to a record 93 000 amid the covid 19 pandemic the associated press noted that this estimate far eclipses the high of about 72 000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year and amounts to a 29 increase brandon marshall a public health research at brown university stated that this is a staggering loss of human life and acknowledged that covid has greatly exacerbated the crisis the report notes that lockdowns and other restrictions related to the pandemic have made life more difficult for those suffering from drug addictions even worse they have presented challenging obstacles when it comes to seeking treatment the ap report provides a short history of overdose deaths while prescription painkillers once drove the nation s overdose epidemic they were supplanted first by heroin and then by fentanyl a dangerously powerful opioid in recent years fentanyl was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasingly been sold illicitly and mixed with other drugs cdc data shows that fentanyl caused over 60 percent of overdose deaths last year shannon monnat an associate professor of sociology at syracuse university told the ap nearly all of this increase is fentanyl contamination in some way heroin is contaminated cocaine is contaminated methamphetamine is contaminated interestingly enough the professor also said there is no evidence that a greater number of americans began taking drugs in 2020 the number of deaths is mostly made up of individuals who had already been struggling with addiction the detroit free press noted the reduction in resources and increase in isolation plus the panic and stress and worry associated with covid 19 created a perfect storm for relapse people who re start drugs after a period of sobriety are prone to relapse because their bodies have lost their tolerance for drugs and for continued use of drugs that are more powerful than ever even more noteworthy is the fact that some of these folks told the ap that suspensions on evictions and extended unemployment benefits added to their problems with addictions because they left them with more money according to monnat these people said when i have money i stock up on my drug supply the 93 000 deaths translate roughly to 250 deaths per day which breaks down to 11 each hour it marks the most significant jump since 2016 when the rate moved up by 11 000 by way of comparison the ap noted that fewer than 7 200 overdose deaths occurred in 1970 during the heroin epidemic only 9 000 deaths occurred in 1988 at the peak of the crack epidemic due to the proliferation of fentanyl experts do not expect the number of overdose deaths to start lowering anytime soon this issue was already worsening even before the covid 19 outbreak even with the lockdown orders winding down it does not seem that the nation has found an answer to this problem but what professor monnat said about the impact of deferred evictions and enhanced unemployment benefits is of particular interest in fact it s a bit surprising that the ap would even include that piece of information in the report given the fact that it is democrats who typically champion these types of policies the effect of these government welfare programs on the increase in overdose deaths cannot be overlooked indeed it seems appropriate that a more thorough probe of this matter be conducted to determine the extent to which these measures are contributing to increased rates of drug use while data on this question is not yet available and may never be it is evident that the lockdown orders and subsequent welfare programs are an integral element of this equation it is yet another example of government action that is ostensibly well meaning but turns out to be deadly in the end this should be yet another lesson as to why big government programs are typically worse than the problem they are created to solve

total revenues increase 4 year over year strong international growth with 34 increase in product revenues year over year increase in net loss by 0 8 million year over year due to 3 6 million in gain on sale of assets last year ebitdas loss declined by 3 4 million year over year woodstock ga business wire sonoma pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq snoa a global healthcare leader developing and producing stabilized hypochlorous acid hocl products for a wide range of applications including wound care eye oral and nasal care and dermatological conditions today announced financial results for fiscal year 2021 and the fourth quarter ended march 31 2021 for the past 18 months we have been restructuring the company to cut losses while positioning it for growth said amy trombly ceo last year we consolidated all manufacturing at our factory in mexico june and ended our contract with invekra that required us to sell product with low margin october this year we entered into a partnership agreement with emc pharma llc for the sale and distribution of our prescription products in the u s allowing us to significantly cut our overhead expenses including the direct sales force while continuing to sell our high quality prescription products moving forward we intend to identify additional distribution partners in the u s while continuing to bring our pipeline of established products to market and to build on the strength of our international business business highlights on march 26 2021 sonoma entered into a new partnership with emc pharma who gained exclusive rights in the u s to commercialize our prescription dermatology and prescription eye care products and non exclusive rights to sell our wound care products into government channels the initial term of the agreement is five years it is renewable and subject to minimum purchases we continue to forge new partnerships and expand existing ones to increase our reach both in products sold and regions we sell into some recent examples are in september 2020 along with our partner te arai biofarma ltd we launched two new products in new zealand nasocyn nasal care and oracyn oral care in december 2020 we partnered with gabriel science llc to sell our hocl product endocyn into dental markets in the u s in january 2021 we received clearances in thailand and began selling dermodacyn disinfectant in hong kong and thailand through our partner vetsynova co ltd in may 2021 we first shipped wound care products to egypt via sonoma s partner in the middle east microsafe care additionally we continue to seek new regulatory clearances to expand potential markets we can sell our products into for example sonoma secured the eu article 95 biocidal registration in february 2021 as a follow up in march 2021 sonoma was granted the pt2 disinfectant approval for germany france and portugal in addition sonoma has been granted pt3 approval for veterinary hygiene for its microcynah product in germany france and portugal results for the quarter ended march 31 2021 total revenue of 2 2 million for the fourth quarter ended march 31 2021 decreased by 2 1 million or 50 from 4 3 million for the same period last year the primary reason for the decline was the 1 6 million decline in united states sales driven by the decline of our dermatology business which we have now partnered with emc pharma llc and 800 000 of revenue adjustments related to overestimation of revenue in the year ended march 31 2020 that was determined using a look back analysis another reason for the decline was the 0 7 million decline in latin america revenue as a result of the invekra contract ending in october 2020 pursuant to the invekra contract sonoma manufactured for invekra at low margins since the contract has ended sonoma has continued to manufacture for invekra at reduced quantities but higher margins during the quarter ended march 31 2021 sonoma reported total revenues of 2 2 million and cost of revenues of 2 4 million resulting in total gross loss of 0 2 million or 9 of total revenue compared to a gross profit of 1 4 million or 33 of total revenue in the same period last year adjusted for the 800 000 of revenue adjustments made to the dermatology business the gross profit percentage for the quarter ended march 31 2021 would be approximately 20 the decline in gross margin is the result of product mix associated with higher sales to invekra at a lower margin and higher product sales to distributors versus sales through our direct sales force which tend to have higher net selling prices and thus higher margins although distributor sales typically have lower margins they don t require the higher operating expenses associated with a dedicated sales force total operating expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 were 2 6 million down 2 0 million or 49 as compared to the same period in the prior year this decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower employee costs resulting from a reduction in headcount and consolidation of manufacturing combined with a refocusing of the business activities resulting in cost reductions across all divisions net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was 3 6 million up by 1 9 million or 111 compared to the same period last year the increase in net loss was due primarily due to a gain on sale of assets to microsafe of 1 1 million in the fourth quarter of fy 2020 and to a lesser extent the writedowns of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 ebitdas loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 of 2 7 million was up by 100 000 or 4 compared to an ebitdas loss of 2 8 million for the same period last year as of march 31 2021 sonoma had cash and cash equivalents of 4 2 million results for the year ended march 31 2021 total revenues for the year ended march 31 2021 of 18 6 million increased by 0 6 million as compared to 17 9 million for the year ended march 31 2020 product revenues for the year ended march 31 2021 of 18 5 million increased by 0 7 million or 4 as compared to 17 8 million for the year ended march 31 2020 the product revenue consisted of a decrease in product revenue of 2 6 million or 32 in the united states an increase in product revenue of 2 2 million or 58 in latin america and an increase of product revenue of 1 0 million or 17 in europe and rest of world for the year ended march 31 2021 sonoma reported total revenues of 18 6 million and total cost of revenues of 12 0 million resulting in total gross profit of 6 6 million or 35 of total revenues compared to a gross profit of 8 1 million or 45 of total revenues for the same period in the prior year the gross profit percentage adjusted for the 800 000 over estimation of prior year revenues would have been 37 for the year ended march 31 2021 the decline in gross margin is the result of product mix associated with higher sales to invekra at a lower margin and higher product sales to distributors versus sales through our direct sales force which tend to have higher net selling prices and thus higher margins although distributor sales typically have lower margins they don t require the higher operating expenses associated with a dedicated sales force total operating expenses during fiscal year 2021 were 10 million down 5 5 million or 35 as compared to the same period in the prior year this decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower employee costs resulting from a reduction in headcount and consolidation of manufacturing combined with a refocusing of the business activities

new york ap whec overdose deaths soared to a record 93 000 last year in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic the u s government reported wednesday that estimate far eclipses the high of about 72 000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year and amounts to a 29 increase in monroe county there was an increase in overdose deaths during the pandemic but not by nearly as much as the rest of the country saw in 2020 137 people died of overdoses in monroe county compared to 127 in 2019 an increase of 8 monroe county s 2020 overdose deaths also represented a dramatic drop when compared to 2017 s overdose deaths when the county recorded its highest number of fatalities this is a staggering loss of human life said brandon marshall a brown university public health researcher who tracks overdose trends the nation was already struggling with its worst overdose epidemic but clearly covid has greatly exacerbated the crisis he added lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get experts said jordan mcglashen died of a drug overdose in his ypsilanti michigan apartment last year he was pronounced dead on may 6 the day before his 39th birthday it was really difficult for me to think about the way in which jordan died he was alone and suffering emotionally and felt like he had to use again said his younger brother collin mcglashen who wrote openly about his brother s addiction in an obituary jordan mcglashen s death was attributed to heroin and fentanyl while prescription painkillers once drove the nation s overdose epidemic they were supplanted first by heroin and then by fentanyl a dangerously powerful opioid in recent years fentanyl was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasing been sold illicitly and mixed with other drugs what s really driving the surge in overdoses is this increasingly poisoned drug supply said shannon monnat an associate professor of sociology at syracuse university who researches geographic patterns in overdoses nearly all of this increase is fentanyl contamination in some way heroin is contaminated cocaine is contaminated methamphetamine is contaminated fentanyl was involved in more than 60 of the overdose deaths last year cdc data suggests there s no current evidence that more americans started using drugs last year monnat said rather the increased deaths most likely were people who had already been struggling with addiction some have told her research team that suspensions of evictions and extended unemployment benefits left them with more money than usual and they said when i have money i stock up on my drug supply she said overdose deaths are just one facet of what was overall the deadliest year in u s history with about 378 000 deaths attributed to covid 19 the nation saw more than 3 3 million deaths the centers for disease control and prevention reviewed death certificates to come up with the estimate for 2020 drug overdose deaths the estimate of over 93 000 translates to an average of more than 250 deaths each day or roughly 11 every hour the 21 000 increase is the biggest year to year jump since the count rose by 11 000 in 2016 more historical context according to the cdc there were fewer than 7 200 total u s overdose deaths reported in 1970 when a heroin epidemic was raging in u s cities there were about 9 000 in 1988 around the height of the crack epidemic the cdc reported that in 2020 drug overdoses increased in all but two states new hampshire and south dakota kentucky s overdose count rose 54 last year to more than 2 100 up from under 1 400 the year before there were also large increases in south carolina west virginia and california vermont had the largest jump of about 58 but smaller numbers 118 to 186 the proliferation of fentanyl is one reason some experts do not expect any substantial decline in drug overdose deaths this year though national figures are not yet available there is data emerging from some states that seems to support their pessimism rhode island for example reported 34 overdose deaths in january and 37 in february the most for those months in at least five years for collin mcglashen last year was an incredibly dark time that began in january with the cancer death of the family s beloved patriarch their father s death sent his musician brother jordan into a tailspin mcglashen said someone can be doing really well for so long and then in a flash deteriorate he said then came the pandemic jordan lost his job it was kind of a final descent ___ the associated press health science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institute s department of science education the ap is solely responsible for all content

billion total revenue this was an impressive 76 sequential improvement from the march quarter more encouragingly the momentum is continuing as we exited june with a demand environment that s accelerating domestic leisure demand and yields are above june quarter 2019 levels and we see clear signs of business in international demand recovery heading into the fall through the crisis we ve earned an unprecedented level of brand loyalty and trust thanks to the world class service operational reliability and innovation that drives the delta difference and our commitment to safety

recovery of our business and the challenges of getting our airline fully back to the service level our customers expect and deserve is daunting in light of the huge surge in demand that we are experiencing but we re taking all the right steps primarily through increased staffing levels about delta and our contract service providers to service this demand without compromising on the standard of care and cleanliness that our customers have become accustomed to on delta throughout the pandemic and even with these challenges our team continues to run the very best airline in the industry leading on all key operating metrics for the month of june and year to date for the june quarter we narrowed our pre tax loss to 881 million this was meaningfully better than initial expectations

solid profitability and generating meaningful free cash flow a little over a year from the start of the worst crisis in this industry s history is an impressive statement about the resilience of our business and the great work of our people in showcasing the value of the commercial partnerships that we ve developed leveraging the delta brand we have created almost 1 billion in investment value this year through our partnerships with wheels up and clear and i want to point out that 1 billion is against a zero cost base i want to give a big shout out to kenny dichter and the wheels up team as their listing on the new york stock exchange goes live today we re proud to be a wheels up exclusive commercial airline partner and largest shareholder with a stake valued at over 500 million also congratulations to caryn seidman becker and the clear team on their successful ipo our investment in clear is worth approximately 340 million and finally i want to congratulate sir richard branson and our team at virgin atlantic for making history last weekend in completing their first fully crude space flight it was exciting to watch richard break new barriers once again this time commercial space travel i d take the time to mention these relationships because of the much larger ecosystem that delta operates and attracts and these opportunities to create value will continue to be nurtured as we extend our brand beyond traditional airline boundaries with june profitability in the books we re now in the restoration phase of recovery and focused on harnessing the power of our differentiated brand and our resilient competitive advantages to drive sustainable profitability in the second half 2021 and enable long term value creation specifically for the september quarter we expect a mid single digit pre tax margin as demand continues to improve with the return of corporate travel and gradual reopening of international markets we are starting to see signs of a resurgence of business and international travel both of which are supporting the next leg of the revenue recovery and we re well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate share and a strong global network around the country more and more offices are opening and people are reconnecting to their businesses and to each other with 72 of our employees vaccinated we officially reopened our own offices last month in june and as i interact with other ceos i m encouraged to hear about their own plans to accelerate their return to office that sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate survey with almost 95 of our accounts indicating they ll be returning to their offices by the end of this year domestic corporate volume grew from 20 base in march of this year in the march month that is to 40 recovered in the june month and we expect it to be close to 60 recovered by september based largely on these reopenings i m also encouraged by the strength that we re seeing in international while we know international demand recovery will be very choppy and uneven we re seeing strong bookings to europe when countries open their borders from our experience in the u s we are seeing the impact that widespread vaccinations have on reopening the economy we know the same will be true for the rest of the world over time but are mindful of the risks that new variants pose to the pace of recovery and our team will stay very disciplined in restoring international capacity as the recovery builds steam we are making the required investments including hiring frontline and reservations employees and investing ahead of the full recovery of the airline in places like maintenance and training this will allow us to continue to provide industry leading service levels and prepare the airline for success in a stronger than previously expected demand environment these investments are key to the execution of our strategy to win which is defined by providing best in class service to our customers and leveraging the brand while creating a simpler more efficient airline the power of our brand has come through the crisis stronger than ever and we re seeing evidence of this across the business the resilience of our american express co brand credit card program is a great testament to the increasing brand affinity that we have card spend on the delta american express portfolio in the month of june was 115 recovered to 2019 levels for the same month despite travel purchases still being off by 25 in that same period we re continuing to renew and simplify our fleet and yesterday we announced that we re opportunistically adding seven airbus 350s and 29 737 900ers that will enter service over the next 12 to 24 months these are current vintage to the aircraft that we operate in our existing fleet and we re adding these pre owned aircraft for substantially less than the cost of new planes these aircraft align with our fleet strategy that s focused on simplification scale size and sustainability and create optionality for future growth or replacement in a capital disciplined manner these transactions accelerate our recovery plans which also began with the exercise of 25 airbus 321neo options in april the a321neos which will start to deliver in 2022 offer the lowest seat cost in our fleet and will strengthen delta s gauge advantage relative to our competitors our recent actions on fleet enhanced efficiency throughout the cost structure gary will talk more about this shortly and will highlight the progress that we re making on our balance sheet and journey back to investment grade metrics as our recovery path becomes clear so does our future as a carbon neutral airline in 2020 we committed to our airlines carbon neutrality and we re taking actions today that are critical to our future this includes the reduction in emissions that we re achieving with our fleet renewal investments in sustainable aviation fuel together with many corporate partners and the evaluation of long term investments in carbon reduction and removal technologies during the quarter we released our inaugural 2020 esg report which expands on the corporate responsibility reports that we have issued in the past you ll be able to hear more about our esg commitments as well importantly as our multiyear financial targets and vision moving forward at delta s capital markets day which we will be holding in person in new york on december 16 this event will give everyone an opportunity to hear from our management team which over the past year we ve strengthened by bringing in outside perspectives and promoting our deep bench that includes allison ausband who during the quarter pleased to announce was named our executive vice president and chief customer experience officer in addition john laughter who i m also pleased we announced as our new executive president and chief of operations allison and john are delta veterans who bring deep experience and unmatched expertise to their roles in addition our incoming cfo dan janki brings extensive business and financial skills to his role as well as a broad global perspective and operational experience that will serve us well in the recovery and beyond dan s background makes him the ideal leader to advance our efforts to restore delta to our pre pandemic financial position you ll hear from him briefly before gary delivers the financial update with this great team of servant leaders we re building an airline that s positioned to drive long term value for all our stakeholders our people our customers our owners and our communities where we live work and serve i could not be more excited about our future and now i d like to turn it over to glen glen hauenstein president thanks ed and good morning everyone 16 months after the start of the pandemic i m encouraged by the pace of the recovery and excited about our future delta is well positioned with a powerful brand strong competitive advantages and a differentiated customer experience all of which are increasingly driving deeper customer engagement during the quarter we saw consumer demand for travel return at an accelerated rate as pent up demand drove an increase for air travel as customers return to the skies delta is their airline of choice given our industry leading service that s provided by the best employees in the industry this resulted in a more than 2 7 billion improvement in revenue from the march quarter compared to 2019 revenues were 49 lower beating our initial guide on 39 less sellable capacity bookings in domestic and short haul latin and leisure markets recovered to nearly 90 of 2019 levels and during the quarter we began experiencing strength in demand to select european countries as they reopened domestic business travel is on an improving trajectory with corporate volumes 40 recovered in the month of june doubling from the 20 recovery rate in march small and medium sized enterprise volumes continued to outperform corporates by 10 points and are now 50 recovered i ll talk more about the encouraging trends we see in corporate in a few minutes from april to june passenger unit revenues improved by 25 points with both load factor and yield strengthening through the quarter this is a great accomplishment considering that we had the middle seat block in place for the month of april which when lifted on may 1 resulted in a 45 increase in sellable capacity with minimal incremental costs so kudos to the delta team for managing through this transition period and driving these outstanding results i also want to congratulate our cargo team for an outstanding quarter with cargo revenues up 35 compared to the june 2019 quarter despite running a much smaller operation we are also seeing momentum in daily bookings and net cash sales our average net cash came in 20 higher than forecast doubling relative to the march quarter importantly in the month of june our average net cash sales are 70 restored to corresponding 2019 levels that s earning about 10 points ahead of revenue recovery as customers are making travel plans out into the future as ed mentioned we re exiting june with a demand environment that s much stronger than just three months ago since the start of the year we ve seen a sequential revenue improvement from 35 recovery versus 2019 in the first quarter to 51 in the second quarter that trajectory is continuing and we expect our september quarter total revenue to be 65 to 70 recovered on capacity that s 70 to 72 recovered when compared to the same quarter in 2019 this positions us for another significant sequential improvement in unit revenues at the midpoint of our guidance this represents another 2 billion sequential increase in revenue on approximately 10 higher capacity we expect strong leisure demand to continue through the fall and winter and we re starting to see the next leg of the recovery take hold with improving trends in business and international travel delta is well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate share and a strong global network corporate travel volumes accelerated in may and june with almost 95 of our accounts booked in travel in the month of june we re also beginning to see a return of consulting and sales related travel and higher volumes in traditionally business heavy markets like new york city and boston our recent corporate survey results show that over 90 of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the september quarter up from just 33 in the march quarter in addition to these survey results our close engagement with customers give us increased confidence of the acceleration of business travel especially as we move toward the post labor day period as schools and offices continue to reopen we expect domestic corporate volumes will recover between 55 and 60 of 2019 levels by the end of the september quarter up from 40 at the end of the june quarter despite volatility in global covid recovery trends international travel is accelerating with capacity and load factors increasing as we head into the fall when we spoke last quarter only two european countries had reopened for u s citizens today more than 15 european countries are open and we re seeing strong bookings follow as border closings lift we are also helpful that 212 f restrictions prohibiting inbound travel to the u s will be significantly reduced in the september quarter the recovery in short haul latin exceeded 2019 levels but in long haul latin demand remains muted as many countries are still closed specific demand remains low and will likely be the last region to recover delta has a strong platform internationally due to the structural changes in the landscape but more importantly because of elements unique to delta first we will have the no 1 joint ventures in each entity and our international partners will emerge from their restructuring efforts more competitive than before we look forward to continuing our valuable strategic relationships with all of our global partners as they navigate through the covid 19 crisis and as they position themselves to emerge from their restructuring processes we are confident these strategic relationships will accelerate our international recovery in the years to come second our hubs are powerful offering extensive and efficient global coverage the strengths of our global hubs resemble those of our core domestic hubs namely strong presence and local share and the ability to connect traffic efficiently third our wide body fleet renewal will be instrumental in our recovery and path to higher margin adding the seven a350s announced yesterday build on our long term plan efforts our wide body fleet renewal program improves our product offering enhances our cargo capability reduces our unit cost and is more efficient fuel efficient contributing to a more sustainable future as we rebuild the airline we re optimizing the network for the return of business in international travel and are building on the strength of our core and coastal hubs where we ve been able to improve our local share by three points from pre pandemic levels we also continue to put the customer at the center of everything we do creating an enhanced premium experience this is successfully de commoditizing air travel on delta providing customers with the products and flexibility that they value most premium products are demonstrating resilience where demand is strongest with domestic and short haul latin premium revenues outpacing main cabin by five to 10 points we believe this will be reflected at the system level as premium revenue and other entities improves with a return of business and international travel at scale we re also seeing increases in customer engagement and brand momentum this is evident in skymiles acquisitions which set an all time record in the month of june outpacing the prior record achieved in july of 2019 these acquisitions allow us to bring new customers into the delta ecosystem engagement is also coming through the performance of our co brand credit card program as customers are increasingly seeing the value proposition and continue to aspire for travel status and premium experience for the quarter co brand spend was 110 recovered to 2019 levels driven by improving t e spend indicating customers desire to explore the world and reconnect with friends and family we exited the quarter with co brand spend around 115 recovered for the month of june new co brand account acquisitions improved more than 75 sequentially and were around 90 recovered to 2019 levels for the quarter in addition we re seeing more customers moving into premium co branded cards given the value proposition for those products the improving trajectory resulted in cash renumeration from american express in the month of june exceeding 2019 levels we expect renumeration will continue to remain at or above 2019 levels into the second half with significant growth opportunities in the years ahead in closing the foundational building blocks for our long term success are in place with the industry s best domestic and global network renewed and efficient fleet a de commoditized product and a highly valued brand and the industry s best employees we continue to extend our commercial and financial lead combining that with our efficient cost structure puts us on a path to improve on our pre pandemic margins and generate sustainable free cash flows allowing us to reinvest in the business and restore our balance sheet strength delta s future is incredibly bright and with that i d like to take this opportunity to welcome our incoming cfo to delta dan i m looking forward to working with you and now i ll turn the call over to you for a few minutes dan janki chief financial officer thank you ed and glen for the warm welcome i m certainly pleased to be here and begin working closely with ed glen and the entire executive leadership team to ensure that we continue to establish clear priorities deliver on our commitment and build a more resilient valuable delta there is no doubt it is an interesting time to join but what really drew me to this opportunity at delta is a unique culture industry leadership and growing brand strength with customers it s a combination like no other in the industry it s really clear that there s a great deal of talent in the finance organization i m humbled and honored to lead this organization forward through this pivotal time a key guiding principle for me will be open and transparent communication with the financial community i look forward to speaking with all of you and getting to know the key stakeholders in the coming weeks and months including many of you on the call now i ll turn it over to gary for the financial update gary chase chief financial officer thank you dan and on behalf of the entire finance team welcome to delta good morning everyone on the call and thanks for joining us delta people shined and carried our brand to new heights during the crisis those efforts combined with the strong demand recovery glen described and the benefits of operating a simpler more efficient fleet are enabling us to cross a number of key milestones on our journey to return to and exceed 2019 performance let me quickly review the second quarter then provide color on our second half cost outlook i ll wrap with a discussion of our capital outlook and balance sheet starting with highlights from the quarter we reported an adjusted pre tax loss of 881 million a more than 2 billion sequential improvement and generated a solid june month profit despite revenues for the month of june still 40 below 2019 nonfuel costs rose 6 sequentially on 21 higher capacity as the teams continue to rebuild our network efficiently nonfuel casm was 9 higher than 2019 we realized savings from tax credits and third party rate reductions that were offset by rebuild expenses and maintenance and pilot training and a noncash expense for employee flight passes awarded to our employees in recognition of winning the j d power award adjusted fuel price per gallon of 2 12 was 11 higher than the first quarter including a 0 23 per gallon impact from refinery losses we realized a 7 1 fuel efficiency gain versus the june quarter of 19 with the majority driven by fleet renewal demand momentum fueled cash sales across the booking curve driving 1 5 billion of growth in our air traffic liability to nearly 7 billion now 300 million higher than the same period in 2019 with the strength we see in the demand environment we expect our air traffic liability to remain above 2019 levels into next year daily cash generation was substantially positive for the full quarter more importantly we generated nearly 200 million of free cash flow excluding our 1 5 billion pension contribution and 2 5 billion in psp grant proceeds we are transitioning now away from daily metrics to focus on regular free cash flow the best measure of value creation as we turn the corner on profitability and look to restore our financial strength as we head into the second half we re excited to shift our focus to returning to profitability generating cash and restoring and exceeding our pre covid results and financial position with continued recovery in limited cost growth we expect to be profitable in both the september and december quarters at current fuel prices regarding the cost outlook i m very happy with the team s performance in the first half as we continue to rebuild the network efficiently we remain on a path to achieve nonfuel casm below 2019 levels by the fourth quarter though the strength of demand recovery is creating some welcome cost pressure in the form of higher rebuild and selling related expense we have also experienced inflationary pressure from vendors and our operating teams have accelerated hiring of frontline employees to ensure we maintain excellence in operations and service levels as we rescale despite these pressures we will see continued leverage in key areas for example we expect an approximate 8 headcount growth through the end of the year on a nearly 15 increase in asm production we ll see our fleet utilization rise from 2q levels approximately 15 below 2019 to approximately 5 in the fourth quarter our airports will also see better utilization particularly our coastal hubs as they move from 70 to more than 90 restored as we accelerate maintenance and training to meet higher potential capacity in 22 rebuild expenses are stepping up in both the third and fourth quarters to a five to six point cost headwind versus three to four points in the first half september quarter will see nonfuel costs grow sequentially at roughly the same rate as capacity due to the higher rebuild and revenue related expenses i mentioned with these factors september quarter nonfuel casm is expected to be 11 to 14 higher than 2019 we expect to close the gap to 2019 nonfuel casm in the fourth quarter through continued volume leverage as capacity remains essentially flat from the third to fourth quarters instead of the more normal seasonal decline of approximately 15 adjusted fuel price per gallon for the third quarter is expected at 2 05 to 2 15 and fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than the september quarter 19 period by approximately 5 on the capital outlook we now expect gross capex of approximately 3 2 billion in 21 up from our original guidance of 2 5 billion driven by our aircraft announcements hats off to our fleet and technical supply chain teams for landing these compelling opportunities that meet three key criteria these transition transactions are opportunistic and take advantage of attractive economics in the used market these aircraft types are currently active in our fleet and entirely consistent with our fleet simplification strategy in addition these aircraft along with the 321neo options we exercised in april will support the potential for up to seven points of additional capacity restoration at compelling marginal economics by 2023 we have a lot of additional optionality in our fleet plan to flex capacity up or down at low cost depending on the shape of the recovery our 717 and 767 fleets are our largest levers we re still flying these fleets at scale today and could retire additional units or reactivate parked aircraft to meet higher demand scenarios let me now move to the balance sheet with improving financial performance and a strong liquidity position we re using cash to reduce leverage and nonoperating expense while rebuilding unencumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile during the quarter we prepaid 450 million in aircraft related debt in addition to normal amortization of 875 million and contributed 1 5 billion to the pension plans additionally we paid cash for all but three aircraft deliveries since october our debt reduction initiatives have totaled 11 billion and freed up 6 billion in collateral with the additional funding this quarter we do not foresee the need to make any material pension contributions in the future by year end we expect the plans to be fully funded on a pension protection act basis and 90 funded on a gaap basis with this level of funding and the plans frozen to new participants we are now reducing the investment risk of the portfolio to protect our funded status the great work of our pension and treasury teams over the last decade in funding this obligation frees up roughly 1 billion in annual free cash flow that can be used in the future to further delever or otherwise create value adjusted net debt is expected to be approximately 19 billion at the end of the september quarter modestly increasing from where we ended june as we pay cash for aircraft deliveries as we turn the corner on profitability and look to the future we re excited to shift our focus to restoring our business and delivering long term value for our owners restoring our financial foundation remains a top priority as we position for the future and we look forward to sharing more of our long term vision with you in december let me conclude by congratulating the 75 000 people who make the delta difference a reality every day these excellent results are your scorecard and a reflection of all you do to delight our customers with that i ll turn the call back over to julie to begin the q a julie stewart investor relations katie can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question will come from helane becker with cowen helane becker cowen and company analyst thanks very much operator hi everybody and thanks for your time welcome dan so here s my questions my first question is i was wondering if you could talk about maybe glen this is for you how you expect the non u s recovery to look by the different regions over the next say six to 12 months if you can and then my other question is i think glen you might have talked a little bit about this in the atl line are you seeing that people are booking further out and i don t know if you can talk to like after labor day bookings or even holiday bookings how they re comping to previous levels glen hauenstein president so helane first about the entities a little bit we re seeing a u s based demand recovery to the open countries in the transatlantic and we expect our loads to move to be close to historical levels running probably in the low to mid 80s by the august september october period again you know that 212 f restricts europeans from coming to this country so i think we focused on those countries that generally have high u s outbound demand and as we move forward we will be adding a little bit of capacity but essentially keeping our levels flat where we would normally cool down in the september october time frame and focusing on our european hubs and distributing traffic through them so i m pretty optimistic about how the results could play out in the transatlantic and that s really we have 35 to 40 of our travel still missing with the european origin piece not open for sale and with business really not recovering at the same level as leisure so pretty optimistic about where we can get to on this leg but there s a lot more to come in the transatlantic in latin it s really the tale of two markets one is the close in u s point of origin leisure market as well as mexico business both of these are actually exceeding 2019 levels so short haul latin is doing quite well and we continue to expect that to be very very strong as we move into the more traditional leisure season in the late fall and then the pacific which i think ed has talked in the past we expect this to be the laggard due to low vaccination rates and continuing outbreaks over and restrictions in the pacific and we really don t see any impetus for that to be lifted now i think we re looking at a 2022 at the earliest probably significant recovery in the pacific so atlantic clearly the furthest along that s great for us because 65 of our international revenues are in the transatlantic so we re excited about what we see in terms of u s demand there domestically post labor day this is every month that we look from august to september and october clearly as you move out you have fewer and fewer bookings but we have about a third of our september bookings on the books now and we have as it sits today and we expect to give some of this back but we have positive yield in every one of the entities we have sequential improvements in rasm so i think we are seeing very strong indications of demand through the post labor day period of course those are initial indications we have a long way to go as we move closer and closer to those departure dates helane becker cowen and company analyst gotcha that s very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst good morning everyone and thank you for the time maybe just some cost related questions on casm they re expected to remain fairly elevated in q3 how do you think about the delta in driving casm from up 11 to 14 in q3 versus 2019 levels to flat in q4 i get about half of that is rebuild costs but maybe what s the bridge and the moving pieces and more broadly how do you think about cost headwinds and inflationary pressures gary chase chief financial officer well sheila we talked about the major drivers the key is really leveraging the continued build of the network and as i was describing in prepared remarks generally when we move from the third into the fourth quarter we have a pretty big reduction in our activity level this year we expect that to be relatively flat that gives us the opportunity to leverage the things that i was describing to get some good incremental leverage on our people some good incremental leverage on our asset utilization and it s just a natural outcome of the way the capacity progression is moving in terms of how we see the bigger pieces they don t change that much between the third and the fourth quarter we expect that rebuild expenses will still be at elevated levels in that five to six point range in both quarters and one of the things i mentioned on the last call from a mix point of view both the second and third quarters we ve got about a five point drag from not having anywhere near as much of our long haul international flying which is just structurally very low casm long stage length flying as we move into the fourth quarter it s still a headwind it s not quite as much it s about three points so that s the color that i would add operator thank you our next question comes from conor cunningham with mkm partners conor cunningham mkm partners analyst hi everyone thank you it s great to hear that corporate continues to improve as people return to the office i will i do have to ask like your competitors are now pushing to replicate some of your success that you ve had with large corporates so i was curious if you could talk to the moats that you ve built around that franchise and how you anticipate strengthening that segment in the face of potential competition ed bastian chief executive officer well thanks conor it s a very important segment for us and we have won as i think you know business travel news airline of the year for 10 straight years and we expect to hopefully win it again this fall as well our team does a magnificent job of servicing the accounts providing the technology the access the insights to make their job and travel in delta as easy as possible and that s supplemented by the great product and service that our people put forward every single day we re the leading operational airline in the industry so when you marry up the investments that we ve been making particularly in the premium product sector which our corporates are a main consumer of with the great service ourselves and commercial team provide and the product and operational integrity of the business it s a very very strong moat we have gained share over the pandemic meaningful amount of share that we have gained and the one thing that we have seen is when customers come to delta they don t leave and so we re gonna continue to expand upon that conor cunningham mkm partners analyst good to hear thank you operator thank you our next question comes from hunter keay with wolfe research hunter keay wolfe research analyst hey thanks good morning i got two questions for you the first one is for you ed how do you feel about deleveraging the balance sheet if it hurts your ability to maintain market share ed bastian chief executive officer good morning hunter i have to ask you first are you sitting on a rocking chair asking that or no hunter keay wolfe research analyst actually i am ed bastian chief executive officer well i ll rock back in my chair as i answer to you hunter keay wolfe research analyst i really am ed bastian chief executive officer that s good that s good deleveraging is important to us it s something that first of all we re the same team that s been here for over the last 15 years we believe in de risking our balance sheet and paying down debt and we also know that we can do that while also driving a premium product and service offering in the markets that we see as being critical to delta we were able to do the both do both of those things over the last decade and we ll continue to do that the level of debt that we took on over the pandemic candidly it s a meaningful amount but it s not an overwhelming amount it was about 8 billion of net debt that we took on during the pandemic and when you think about as gary mentioned we re basically done funding our pension plan with no more pension contributions required as i think you also know that we ve been averaging over the last several years close to 3 billion 2 billion to 3 billion a year in stock repurchases which clearly we won t be doing in the next certainly in the next two to three years until we get our investment grade metrics back and another 1 billion on top of that of dividend distributions that we ve been making there s a substantial amount of free cash that is available to us as we reclaim investment grade for delta and we ll be sharing our longer term metrics at the investor day in december and showing you the path forward but we can do all this and have plenty of headroom to compete hard and effectively in the marketplace hunter keay wolfe research analyst ok that s super helpful thank you and then gary if you would just clarify i think you said something about 7 capacity are you saying that the current plan for 23 system capacities to be 7 above 2019 but you can take that higher or lower if you need to am i interpreting that correctly gary chase chief financial officer no hunter that s not what i was saying what i was saying is that the fleet actions we ve taken give us the potential to add seven points to our capacity profile by 23 but i was also noting the flexibility that we continue to have with some of the flex fleets to go up or down and i think the teams have positioned us really well to react to what comes at us in terms of the demand environment hunter keay wolfe research analyst i see ok thank you gary thank you ed operator thank you our next question comes from jamie baker with j p morgan jamie baker j p morgan analyst hey good morning everybody and just apologies off the bat that my colleague mark isn t joining us but he is on one of your aircraft on the j p morgan sponsored business trips so i guess we are all better off glen is there a way to tell what portion of summer domestic revenue is driven by reallocated international demand for example could you look at skymile behavior this summer identify what portion of those travelers would have historically been in europe or asia instead glen hauenstein president yeah i think domestically we see a redistribution toward domestic from long haul international that s a natural occurrence i think people are ready to get out the exact quantification i think would be difficult but we do see that if those leisure destinations are open there s significant demand for that and that includes the transatlantic where it is open and if you think about running load factors in the mid to high 80s in the shoulder season as we head to the end of the summer here just on u s origin travel there s pretty strong demand trends that we re seeing and so if it is open people want to get there jamie baker j p morgan analyst yeah definitely and gary just a follow up on the atl and i haven t historically obsessed about the air traffic liability until we all sort of had to ordinarily the second to third quarter sequential decline for delta would be somewhere around i don t know 750 million 800 million if we continue to get international reopening particularly for inbound u s could we model for something closer to a flat outcome next quarter so staying in the 6 5 billion range that sort of thing or would that just be too ambitious i know you said it would be above last year s levels but that still leaves a lot of room gary chase chief financial officer yeah jamie obviously there s still a lot of uncertainty around that our thinking right now and that s embedded in how we re thinking about net debt is for a slight decline in that but we don t expect that you re gonna see the normal seasonal pattern as we move through the remainder of this year for all the reasons you just highlighted jamie baker j p morgan analyst ok perfect thank you everybody appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from stephen trent with citi stephen trent citi analyst hello everybody and thanks very much for taking my question just a quick one from me when we think about in certain pockets in the united states that we are seeing some difficulty with new variants and low vaccination rates do you see any scenario in which delta could trim capacity to some of these regions or reinstate on some routes blocking of middle seats ed bastian chief executive officer good morning steve i don t as we ve been monitoring our bookings and clearly we re mindful of the risks around covid and the new variants and the continued information that the cdc provides us with we have not seen any reduction or drop in demand looking out over the next one to 90 days which is about as far as our crystal ball can go right now we know our customers are largely vaccinated our people are largely vaccinated we have over 72 of delta people are vaccinated and the vaccines work and they re giving people the ability to get back to their lives so no we re not anticipating any changes at this time stephen trent citi analyst ok appreciate that and looking forward to seeing you guys in december 15th as i believe you said ed bastian chief executive officer december 16th stephen trent citi analyst 16th excuse me gary chase chief financial officer you can fly down and see us on 15th too if you want operator thank you our next question comes from myles walton with ubs myles walton ubs analyst thanks good morning ed i think at the beginning you mentioned commercial partnerships and creating 1 billion of value from wheels up and clear from a zero cost base i m curious of your view on the e retail market given the news by american as well as united on that front and where that fits in your portfolio of investments and operations over the medium term ed bastian chief executive officer thanks myles as you can appreciate every one of the proposed manufacturers has been after delta we ve heard from many of them we re studying this space and we will continue to get smart in the space i think it s at a very very early stage right now and i think a lot of the plans that we ve seen are a bit premature candidly but it s not anything that we are unaware of and i guarantee every one of those manufacturers would love to have delta colors on their planes so hard to predict timing but we are in the marketplace having lots of conversations myles walton ubs analyst ok and then maybe gary just a clarification the casm ex questions i m just looking in absolute dollars it looks like sequentially 3q you re looking for the same unit cost x and fourth quarter the same and the improvement was really just about comps in 2019 is that right and then for 2022 how much of these rebuilding costs go away and we get the tailwind of six points gary chase chief financial officer yeah i m not sure i would characterize it exactly that way but it is about having more scale relative to 2019 so sequentially i think that what you outlined is roughly accurate and that is what we expect as we go into 22 your question was about the sustainability of the rebuild myles walton ubs analyst yeah what goes away from what you re doing gary chase chief financial officer yeah we definitely expect those to moderate a lot of that is going to depend candidly on how the demand environment develops what i would say is what we ve articulated is driving to levels below 19 we re not excluding rebuild expenses this year they happen to be particularly high as we get into 22 we expect those to be more normal and it s part of the thought process on what we ve got to accomplish ed bastian chief executive officer myles if i could speak to that for a second we at delta our no 1 task is to safely get our business back up with the service levels that our customers deserve and expect of delta and given the huge surge in demand that we ve seen over the last 90 days the entire industry is challenged with that that s not a unique delta position and we re going to do everything we can to get ahead of it and that includes staffing levels providing whatever support we need to the service providers the service contractors training maintenance because we realize that this is about protecting our brand and our long term customer base rather than trying to manage costs for an individual quarter we will hit the cost targets that we mentioned to you one of the things that we learned a lot about delta over the pandemic is our ability to manage down labor cost is really unique in this industry and we have a whole lot more to more tools and flexibility i think than we ever really appreciated and so we shouldn t think about labor which is the biggest part a big part of the rebuild cost as a fixed cost that s not going to stay so the productivity the efficiency the ability to work closely with our people will be in really good shape on the cost front next year and we ll protect our customers experience at the same time in the revenue base which is the most important operator thank you our next question comes from savi syth with raymond james savanthi syth raymond james analyst good morning competing on products is kind of good for the consumer in the industry but one of your competitors plans to grow like first class extra leg room seats by about 10 a year through 2026 and just kind of curious if that level of growth is something we ll see at delta because it s part of some kind of a structural trend or if that has any implications to delta s premium kind of revenue leadership or how delta is set up to kind of compete against that glen hauenstein president sure well i d first like to say we re proud that we started the decommoditization process many many years back and we are well along and i think we re objectively maybe the furthest along in terms of exploiting that opportunity there s probably more space out there for other carriers given the appetite we ve seen for these products that have been sustained through the pandemic so i m not gonna articulate on anybody else s plan but we think that there s continued growth in our fleet evolution as we continue to up gauge the airline over the next several years our percentage of seats that are in the premium cabins continues to increase and we think given the fact that we are still in the early stages of being able to distribute those products and services to all of our customers through all of our channels that there s plenty of opportunity for us to continue to grow that space in the next years next several years savanthi syth raymond james analyst that makes sense thanks glen and maybe a quick follow up for you glen as well just i appreciate the color on the domestic corporate demand recovery i know that s around volumes is that rpk and curious what that looks in terms of revenue i m guessing volumes have to recover first and then revenue comes back but i was just wondering if it s similar or if there is a disconnect there glen hauenstein president yeah those are passengers and yields on domestic leisure are up yields on domestic corporate are down but we see trajectory in domestic corporate and we expect that as you say to continue as we move forward savanthi syth raymond james analyst makes sense thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike linenberg with deutsche bank mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst hey good morning i guess two projection related questions for glen on amex over the last year you sort of had backpedaled on when you would get to the 7 billion of contribution obviously because of the pandemic the fact that i guess the month of june or the june quarter we were 110 115 in the month of june glen can you update us are we now not on just track but maybe at a pace that will get to that amex bogey prior than the previous forecast glen hauenstein president yeah well i think that s something you ll have to come to our december investor day to see i don t think we re ready to disclose the exact date yet but it s suffice it to say that we re feeling much better about making up some ground that we lost during the pandemic today than we ve set six or nine months ago ed bastian chief executive officer yeah i would mike this is ed if i just chime in i would say that we are thrilled with the relationship with american express our team their team i was with steve squeri last friday and i think we have the best performing card in their entire portfolio delta even though we are the highest value that we create i think we re also the best performing on top of that in terms of growth so it s really been a great relationship and that s still without a lot of travel spend that s missing international and business yet from the card so we re excited mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst great and then just sort of a second projection question glen i mean to watch you go from 20 of corporate volumes to 40 and 60 and yet even recently i think we had a survey from u s travel and even the dbta talking about u s corporate travel getting back to i don t know 70 85 by 2024 it just feels very conservative i mean it seems like we re running well ahead of that is that the case or is there just something different to where you guys are outpacing the industry ed bastian chief executive officer mike this is ed let me chime in on that one too because i ve got the numbers right here in front of me we ve done our own survey talking to our clients the biggest companies in the world and a very large number of them and i could make heads or tails out of what the gpa was speaking to either let me give you the most recent survey and this is as of last week updated 36 of our big corporates expect they re going to return fully to pre covid levels no later than next year 2022 that s 36 another 21 says fully back no later than 2023 interestingly only 5 of our big corporates say that we never return to pre covid levels 5 that had been 8 in previous surveys that s now down to 5 while 38 indicate it s still unclear as to what their levels not that they re not getting back it s just the level of flying and the timing is still somewhat uncertain which is understandable so if you take the 2022 2023 that s 57 no later than 23 and you assume say 75 of those unknowns a 43 that gets you actually to 90 back over the course of the next couple of years and frankly i think it s going to be even better than that so this is one of the things that as we have seen there s enormous pent up energy and demand for travel also in that survey 93 of our customers said they re going to increase travel in q3 over q2 and many of those by meaningful amounts so i think the surge is coming and just as we ve seen it on the consumer side we are getting ready for it on the business side and once you open businesses offices and you get international markets opened i think it s gonna be it s really it s going to be a very good run over the next 12 to 24 months mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst great great insight gentlemen thank you operator thank you our next question comes from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst hey thanks good morning ed you have a good board in my opinion lots of experience driving real value in consumer industries maybe arguably easier consumer industries can you give us some insight into debate at the board level regarding balance sheet improvement as a priority right here and now versus investment are there differing opinions on investment rate versus balance sheet improvement and i guess longer term is investing half of your operating cash flow how we should be thinking about 2022 and beyond or have we kind of moved away from that ed bastian chief executive officer well thanks duane we do have a great board i agree with that and there is a lot of good insight that we garnered from that board this is largely the same board that s been with us over the last decade it was the board that was involved in how we delevered coming out of the financial crisis in 2009 how we managed the to lead the industry in getting back to investment grade metrics over five years ago while delivering a premium product and service level and expanding internationally at a rate probably faster than anyone particularly with the investments that we ve made so the board knows the strategy that we re on we ve talked a lot at the board level about needing to get our debt down off the balance sheet to get those investment grade metrics back we ll give you some very specific guidepost on that when we have our capital markets day in december so you ll know what to expect from us and at the same time we re also investing meaningfully into the business with opportunistic purchase of airbus 350s and 737 900s that are current vintage they re plug and play and we ll continue to be able to grow the business accordingly so the strategy actually is not that different from where we ve been and i think it s going to we re going to stay very focused to getting the investment grade back and growing the business at the same time duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst ok appreciate the thoughts operator thank you our next question comes from joseph denardi with stifel joseph denardi stifel financial corp analyst thanks good morning ed in response to mike s question you said i think based on your time with steve that the delta card is amex s highest value like what do you mean by that are you trying to say that it s a very profitable card for amex as well or their most profitable card ed bastian chief executive officer no i don t know if it s the most profitable i hope we are you d have to have steve that but what i can tell you is it creates the highest overall level of spend and growth in the portfolio and it s been that way for some time and it continues and we both continue to invest to keep it that way joseph denardi stifel financial corp analyst ok ok and then gary you said the fleet actions would allow you to add seven points to asms by 2023 so what level of asm production are you on track you kind of achieve in 23 i know there s a lot of flexibility but does the current fleet support 100 of 2019 capacity in 23 105 like where are you now with that thank you gary chase chief financial officer yeah joe we ll talk more about that and what our long term capital needs will be in december with you what i was pointing out was the portfolio of decisions that we ve made gives us seven points of additional capacity that we bring in that time frame and just continue to point out that the team has positioned us with a tremendous amount of flexibility to go either up or down depending on how we see the demand environment but we ll have more color on that with a bigger picture about how some of the other components play into it as well joseph denardi stifel financial corp analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna international chris stathoulopoulos susquehanna international group analyst good morning thanks for taking my question so your marginal cost per mile in 3q was just under 0 04 and it s ticking up sequentially significantly and i realize that as you said you re just pulling up capacity here but i was wondering at what point whether it s in asms or revenue where the where we could expect to see this operating leverage for the costs that you ve taken out over the last year or so more clearly show up in results meaning normalizing for the change in your marginal cost per mile from the second to the third quarter as you spool up here what kind of a more accurate run rate looks like and that would also assuming corporate does return as you expect by the end of the year gary chase chief financial officer well chris on an underlying basis we still have and are experiencing a lot of leverage even as we move into the third quarter that will be the case for good bid here the guidance we have in the third quarter we are still operating 28 to 30 below we were in 2019 so there are parts of the system where we re under pressure as i described and we re absolutely meeting the needs there but there are also lots of opportunities for us to drive that leverage some of which you re seeing in terms of the moving pieces are at least i think unrelated to that a big cost pressure as we ve moved from the second to the third quarter at least a couple of points is just selling related expenses we re obviously thrilled to be seeing and it s just a function of the demand recovery that we are experiencing normally when we re in a typical year we work very hard to not be maintaining aircraft during the peak summer months for obvious reasons we want them flying and generating contributions this year we ve got a maintenance step up as we move from the second to the third quarter in fact i think when you look at third quarter maintenance it will be comparable to if not even slightly ahead of where we were in 2019 instead of the down 30 ish percent that you ve been seeing over the last few quarters so it s a year with a lot of unique features in terms of how they play out on the cost side but the fundamental leverage that we ve been describing is there julie stewart investor relations and now we ll go to our final analyst question operator thank you our next question comes from andrew didora with bank of america andrew didora bank of america merrill lynch analyst great good morning everyone i just kind of want to go back to the costs obviously the labor market is very tight right now and i think your last base pay increase was in october of 2019 so gary is there anything in your 3q or 4q casm expectations for a wage increase and i guess ed how are you thinking about the need for one right now ed bastian chief executive officer thanks andrew we re we don t preannounce what we re doing on our labor strategy and cost and obviously our people are working really hard and delivering great value we re still losing money we need to get the company stabilized first before we start talking about wage increases andrew didora bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then last one for ed i m not sure if you re gonna have any comment on this but the end of last week the president issued an executive order and you just called out slot administration as one of the objectives what do you think this means just given your position in a pretty stock and train market here in new york i just love to hear if you have any comments on that thanks ed bastian chief executive officer i really don t we ll study we ll talk to the administration and department of transportation and secretary buttigieg and many individuals about it we have a long history of driving great value for our customers it s expensive to drive great value and we are making the investments to drive great value there s no question when you think about the level of service the quality of service reliability the affordability everything is moving in the right direction so we re thrilled to be able to show them the actual results of what we re doing julie stewart investor relations that will wrap up the analyst portion of our call i ll now turn it over to tim mapes our chief marketing and communications officer to start the media questions tim mapes chief marketing communications officer well good morning to all the members of the media thank you for your time this morning we re grateful for that and katie if you wouldn t mind reiterating for the members of the media the rules of asking a question with one follow up please operator thank you our first question will come from mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news mary schlangenstein bloomberg analyst while you re planning for the rest of the year if you can talk about the numbers versus the percentage increase that that will be and then also if you ll comment on whether you re having any trouble finding enough people to hire ed bastian chief executive officer mary this is ed we missed the first part of your question could you repeat that mary schlangenstein bloomberg analyst yes i wondered if you could say how many employees you re going to add the number versus the percentage increase ed bastian chief executive officer over the course of this year we re in the process of hiring between 4 000 and 5 000 mary schlangenstein bloomberg analyst and are you having any trouble finding applicants for those jobs ed bastian chief executive officer we are not the delta brand is a very strong hiring brand we re having great success the challenge as i mentioned on the call is the training the time it takes to get people in position whether it s on the phones and reservations or in the airports it takes a few months and the demand has come back at such a fast clip it s taken us all a little bit of time to catch our breath but we ll be fully back over the next couple of months and providing we ve been providing great service but the service levels that customers should expect and deserve you ll be getting back from delta in the next couple of months mary schlangenstein bloomberg analyst ok and have your flight operations been affected at all in terms of lack of flight crews ed bastian chief executive officer not at all not at all we ve been managing the best completion factor in the industry and it s not even close our team is doing a good job we ve been at this for over a year managing the training queue and the training pipeline and our pilots and our maintenance team are doing great mary schlangenstein bloomberg analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from tracy rucinski with reuters tracy rucinski thomson reuters analyst hi good morning i was wondering if you have any updates on your plans for the trainer refinery and particularly on the outstanding liability on the buying of fuel credits ed bastian chief executive officer tracy we don t have anything any news in that regard we continue to operate trainer and the team does a very nice job there we ve said in the past that there are opportunities to pull another strategic partner and we d be open to that relative to the question around rins we are fully accrued so i know there s been some discussion in the press about whether we pulled away from acquiring rins we just know the pricing of rins is not a market based price at the present time and we are not going to spend good cash chasing a fairly a marketplace that isn t transparent so we ve accrued the cost but we have time to decide as we settle those obligations over the next couple of years tracy rucinski thomson reuters analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from david koenig with the associated press david koenig the associated press analyst oh hi well mary asked my questions but if i could kind of follow up i know ed you said that it s too early to raise wages but what about starting pay are you having to raise starting pay to attract people or do anything else out of the ordinary to find those 4 000 to 5 000 folks ed bastian chief executive officer it s interesting dave we ve looked at potentially hiring bonuses and other incentives and largely we have we haven t needed to resort to that people look at the delta brand as a place they want to be long term and they see this as an opportunity to get inside delta so no we haven t had to make any changes to scale we always watch it we re very competitive in the market we pay well our people we take great care of them but no we haven t had to adjust our salary scales in any meaningful way david koenig the associated press analyst ok thanks operator thank you our next question comes from dawn gilbertson with usa today dawn gilbertson usa today analyst hi good morning my questions are about the customer service wait times they still are as long as six hours at least as recently as yesterday so i m wondering from a traveler s perspective is there any end in sight i ve also noticed that you guys have temporarily suspended help through twitter dms which is a frequent recommendation i and other travel reporters give so is there any end in sight and what s your best advice for people to reaching delta especially with last minute travel questions thank you ed bastian chief executive officer well thanks dawn this is ed we are hiring a couple of thousand people into reservations we ve already hired at least half that number and we ve got more to go every single week more and more people are getting on the phones we ve reached out to many of the people at reservations who have retired as we had separation packages and voluntary departure packages over the last year we have a fair number of them that have returned they re on the phones we have people working from home it s not a question of not providing the staff and we re doing everything we can the volumes are beyond anything we ve ever seen they re beyond the high point of 2019 and the handling times are substantially longer as people have more questions as travel has changed it s their first time back so we re incredibly sensitive to it the number you mentioned is not the average number at all yes there are reoccurrences of that we have the callback features in place we manage every one of the queues whether it s the general skymiles queues the premium queues the nonmember queues and we re all at the longest the average we are seeing is in the one hour time frame which is by the way way too long and by september we expect to get that back down to normal levels dawn gilbertson usa today analyst could somebody comment or get back to me on the twitter dm because you guys appear to be the only one of the major airlines that s temporarily not responding via dm ed bastian chief executive officer yeah i m not sure about that we ll get back to you and by the way people email me every day every hour and i think that s a good way if somebody needs help just send me a note i ll take care of it dawn gilbertson usa today analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from leslie josephs with cnbc leslie josephs cnbc analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question for the employees that are coming in now that you re hiring are they on average at lower wages than some of the people that left since a lot of senior people took retirement and then also for the 28 of employees that are not vaccinated are there certain work groups that that s concentrated in are you doing anything to increase the vaccination rates across the company ed bastian chief executive officer your first question leslie yes the starting rates of people joining the company are clearly lower than the rates that people retired at as they left the company after 25 30 40 years of service so we are getting a juniority benefit in the scale we re giving a lot of people a lot of our particularly our young managers are having opportunities to take on more responsibility and grow in their careers and that s all very very healthy your question around vaccinations the 28 could you repeat that leslie josephs cnbc analyst what are you doing to increase that vaccination rate across the company and is that do you see that s concentrated in any one work group or geography due to best access on information ed bastian chief executive officer listen 72 candidly we re proud of it it beats any national average by a meaningful amount we do have pockets within the company in certain regions and certain demographics that are below 72 and we are doing everything we can to continue to encourage and incent we provided 1 million last month in total awards to vaccinated employees through drawings we had 40 different drawings with 25 000 a piece i think we have one more drawing today that we have of anyone that s just been newly vaccinated within the last month to win 25 000 we ve given away free travel to employees through drawings that can be vaccinated and we continue to describe the risks to individuals if they re not vaccinated from the variant so i don t know a company that s doing more to get its team vaccinated than delta leslie josephs cnbc analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from alison sider with wall street journal alison sider the wall street journal analyst hi thank you so much i m just curious what you are hearing about the mask mandate on planes if you think it will be lifted in september and i guess how you feel about that if you are hoping it will be lifted earlier or if you d like it to be extended ed bastian chief executive officer hi ali i don t know what s gonna happen it s up to the fda it s not really up to the airlines to make that decision we ll be in conversations clearly with the fda i think it s important that medical experts make those decisions not airline professionals as we ve learned through the pandemic they re the ones that have all the insight and the information and keeping people safe i appreciate people not wanting to wear the mask i don t like wearing the mask when i m onboard either but it s something that we need to do to keep each other safe and i think with your question about what s going to happen in september it really depends on where we are in the recovery phase if the variants are continuing i think people are going to be a little more careful about lifting the masks if international borders are not yet opened i m not sure lifting the mask is going to help opening up those borders so there s a lot that goes into that and i think there s many pros to taking the mask requirement off as there are to keeping it on at the present time alison sider the wall street journal analyst thanks operator thank you our next question comes from madhu unnikrishnan with skift airlines weekly madhu unnikrishnan skift airline weekly analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my call or my question i had a question about the federal payroll support and whether based on the arguments delta management made last year if you still believe that the support was facilitated faster recovery protected jobs and the second part of my question is what happens after october 1 and whether and what burning off of or the expiration of support will mean for delta s earnings ed bastian chief executive officer well the i think it s without debate that the federal support was critical to keeping our industry afloat and keeping our employees employed and being in position for the recovery as we ve talked on this call one of the biggest challenges we re having now is getting everything fully stood up even though we ve kept a lot of our employees so you can imagine had to actually let many many people go and abandon those individuals the challenges we d be facing in our country of getting travel moving again so i think it s been an incredible success i think one can debate the length of the psp2 and psp3 i see no interest in going beyond what we have at the present time with psp3 and we expect to be profitable in q3 and beyond without any psp support yes madhu unnikrishnan skift airline weekly analyst thank you tim mapes chief marketing communications officer katie we have time for one final question please operator thank you our final question comes from david slotnick with tpg david slotnick tpg analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question i m wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you ve seen in the last few weeks with unruly passengers has there been any upward or downward trending in incidence of that and do you have any thoughts on just what s been causing the sort of surge this spring and early summer ed bastian chief executive officer you know david i we haven t seen any meaningful shifts it s been something we ve been dealing with over the course of the pandemic i know some people want to relate it to having to wear masks i m sure that s a piece of it i don t know that s the main piece i think the bigger challenge is that we ve got a lot of individuals that have been impacted their emotional well being have been impacted during the pandemic and as people are coming back out into society you see challenges in all walks of life not just in our industry you see it happening in other places as well in society so obviously social media amplifies that and puts it on a stage that s not our experience it s not our normal experience by any means they re rare our crews are trained and they re incredibly professional in managing the conditions when we have someone who doesn t want to follow instructions of the crew and unfortunately something we ve become good at and i look forward to the return of our business and patterns of normalcy so that we can start to manage our business without having to worry about these effects tim mapes chief marketing communications officer thank you for the question david and thank you to all the members of the media for your time this morning as we wrap up we ll turn it over to ed for final comments ed bastian chief executive officer well i thank you all for joining us it s been an hour and a half we spent a fair bit of time with you but hopefully you ve learned a lot as to why we re encouraged and as we power our plan for the post pandemic future why that i am and our team is as optimistic as ever for the journey that we are on u s travelers are returning and it s really a tribute to the incredible work of our scientific community in developing effective vaccines that s gonna be key to opening the world our return to profitability in the month of june is a major milestone a solid profitability close to 10 speaks to the strength of our brand and the great work of our team worldwide as we move past this inflection point from crisis into restoration the people of delta will be front and center serving our customers and our communities our mission of connecting the people of the globe is a noble one it s an important one it s got great purpose and the social good that s generated by travel will be essential in the months and years ahead as our world heal so i thank you all for your time today for joining us and one more time i want to say a special thanks to all the delta people worldwide for their great work over the course of this last 16 months and getting our business to a point where we re looking to bright skies ahead so thank you all operator duration 86 minutes call participants julie stewart investor

5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented rocket companies lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years the stunning collapse in rocket companies gain on sale margin reflected the fact that the favorable market conditions purportedly being experienced by rocket companies during the class period had in fact reversed during a conference call to explain the results rocket companies chief financial officer and treasurer defendant julie r booth revealed that the sharp decline in quarterly gain on sale margin was being caused by three factors i pressure on loan pricing ii a product mix shift to rocket companies lower margin partner network segment and iii a compression in price spreads between the primary and secondary mortgage markets defendant booth also admitted that certain of these trends began at the end of q1 on this news the price of rocket companies class a common stock fell by nearly 17 to close at 19 01 per share as the market

companies class action lawsuit alleges that throughout the class period defendants made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that i rocket companies gain on sale margins were

in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets ii rocket companies was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket companies partner network operating segment iii the adverse trends identified above were accelerating and as a result rocket companies gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 iv as a result the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket companies to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as rocket companies gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 v rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket companies company wide gain on sale margins had fallen materially below pre pandemic averages and vi consequently defendants positive statements about

berlin us president joe biden has found his mission to secure the west by strengthening its liberal democracies against authoritarian temptations both foreign and domestic having witnessed both an attempted coup and steeply rising socioeconomic inequalities in his own country biden knows that democracies will not find support abroad until they have fulfilled their promises of fairness justice and security at home if europe wants to be a partner in this democratic revival it can start by recognising the realism behind the us administration s rhetoric biden is not pining for some mythical lost era of american greatness as his predecessor did he is focusing on the future and he is concerned with questions that animate democratic liberals and conservatives alike for example how do we create opportunities for those left behind by global capitalism so that they will not fall prey to populists false promises how do we restore other developed democratic countries commitment to democratic values how do we rein in overpowered financial and tech industries or forge a more dynamic global order the idea of the west was always meant to be universal offering a normative framework for peaceful prosperous coexistence among all people human rights freedom of expression democratic self determination and the rule of law are not exclusive to any region or group of countries but if you are a chinese leader you will ask why your country should follow the west especially now that most chinese regard the western designed international order as hostile to their own aspirations from this perspective the european american era is over signs of western decadence are ubiquitous from the iraq war debacle and the trump presidency to the united kingdom s exit from the european union while americans and europeans argue for the importance of individual human rights the self confident chinese rebuttal is that there are alsosocial human rights to education nutrition adequate housing and so forth here china has undeniably achieved great things lifting more than 800 million people out of abject poverty over the past four decades the lines then have been drawn for europe to make a meaningful contribution to biden s mission it must become stronger and because its common foreign and security policy tends to evolve only very slowly europe must also continue to press ahead with the expansion of the single market which will remain europe s main attraction and source of strength but the single market can retain its attractiveness only if it allows for greater dynamism to become a technological leader with less dependence on china and the united states europe must invest more in research and development r d digitalisation and artificial intelligence it should be pursuing a joint climate policy with the us and while the g 7 recently agreed on a build back better world partnership to compete with china s belt and road initiative in central asia africa and latin america the eu must do more to support this program while also bolstering nato s deterrent power with federal elections coming in september germany the eu s biggest economy should be debating how it intends to strengthen the bloc in the coming years yet all the main german parties and politicians have been silent on this issue presumably because they are still waiting to see how the pandemic will evolve many fear that richer northern member states will regain their economic strength quickly while others namely italy and france fall further behind the eu s 750 billion recovery fund will not be enough to achieve anything close to a convergence between southern and northern member states indeed it will not even be enough to prevent them from drifting further apart since the eu s poorer member states are already over indebted they cannot borrow much more particularly if interest rates rise whenever inflation begins to increase again the european central bank s implicit policy of monetising member state debt through the unlimited purchase of government bonds from poorer countries will have to end under these conditions the only remaining way out would be a transfer union with richer countries like germany increasing their own financial investments in poorer member states greater investments in infrastructure digitalization and r d are needed not only to boost efficiency and productivity in the economically weaker member states but also to hold the eurozone and the eu together the road is long however and longer still because europe currently lacks the instruments needed to see the journey through from the perspective of german fiscal policy investing in a more economically and socially stable europe would offer enormous returns yes the prevailing view in germany is that the country already puts more into europe than it gets out but that is nonsense as an export champion with a massive persistent trade surplus germany by definition receives more than it pays out instead of creating the impression that germany is dependent on the chinese export market german leaders should make clear that the country s real dependence is on the european market germany s exports to other eu member states account for over 50 of its total exports whereas china and the us each account for only about 10 per cent in the long run germany will do only as well as its european neighbours the sooner we recognise that the better off we will be biden s credo about fixing things at home applies to us too we must show that our own democratically constituted societies are better than the autocratic alternatives otherwise the normative idea of the west will continue to lose its luster sigmar gabriel former federal minister and vice chancellor of germany is chairman of atlantik brücke

new york overdose deaths soared to a record 93 000 last year in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic the u s government reported wednesday that estimate far eclipses the high of about 72 000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year and amounts to a 29 increase this is a staggering loss of human life said brandon marshall a brown university public health researcher who tracks overdose trends the nation was already struggling with its worst overdose epidemic but clearly covid has greatly exacerbated the crisis he added lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get experts said jordan mcglashen died of a drug overdose in his ypsilanti michigan apartment last year he was pronounced dead on may 6 the day before his 39th birthday it was really difficult for me to think about the way in which jordan died he was alone and suffering emotionally and felt like he had to use again said his younger brother collin mcglashen who wrote openly about his brother s addiction in an obituary jordan mcglashen s death was attributed to heroin and fentanyl while prescription painkillers once drove the nation s overdose epidemic they were supplanted first by heroin and then by fentanyl a dangerously powerful opioid in recent years fentanyl was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasing been sold illicitly and mixed with other drugs what s really driving the surge in overdoses is this increasingly poisoned drug supply said shannon monnat an associate professor of sociology at syracuse university who researches geographic patterns in overdoses nearly all of this increase is fentanyl contamination in some way heroin is contaminated cocaine is contaminated methamphetamine is contaminated fentanyl was involved in more than 60 of the overdose deaths last year cdc data suggests there s no current evidence that more americans started using drugs last year monnat said rather the increased deaths most likely were people who had already been struggling with addiction some have told her research team that suspensions of evictions and extended unemployment benefits left them with more money than usual and they said when i have money i stock up on my drug supply she said overdose deaths are just one facet of what was overall the deadliest year in u s history with about 378 000 deaths attributed to covid 19 the nation saw more than 3 3 million deaths the centers for disease control and prevention reviewed death certificates to come up with the estimate for 2020 drug overdose deaths the estimate of over 93 000 translates to an average of more than 250 deaths each day or roughly 11 every hour the 21 000 increase is the biggest year to year jump since the count rose by 11 000 in 2016 more historical context according to the cdc there were fewer than 7 200 total u s overdose deaths reported in 1970 when a heroin epidemic was raging in u s cities there were about 9 000 in 1988 around the height of the crack epidemic the cdc reported that in 2020 drug overdoses increased in all but two states new hampshire and south dakota kentucky s overdose count rose 54 last year to more than 2 100 up from under 1 400 the year before there were also large increases in south carolina west virginia and california vermont had the largest jump of about 58 but smaller numbers 118 to 186 the proliferation of fentanyl is one reason some experts do not expect any substantial decline in drug overdose deaths this year though national figures are not yet available there is data emerging from some states that seems to support their pessimism rhode island for example reported 34 overdose deaths in january and 37 in february the most for those months in at least five years for collin mcglashen last year was an incredibly dark time that began in january with the cancer death of the family s beloved patriarch their father s death sent his musician brother jordan into a tailspin mcglashen said someone can be doing really well for so long and then in a flash deteriorate he said then came the pandemic jordan lost his job it was kind of a final descent
