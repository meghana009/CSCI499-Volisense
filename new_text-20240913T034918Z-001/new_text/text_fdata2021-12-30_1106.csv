the u s trade deficit in goods mushroomed to the widest ever in november as imports of consumer goods shot to a record ahead of the second straight covid 19 distorted holiday shopping season along with industrial supplies while exports slipped after a historic gain a month earlier the goods trade gap reported wednesday by the commerce department is likely to remain historically high as long as the coronavirus pandemic continues economists said the emergence of the fast spreading omicron variant of covid 19 that has driven u s and global caseloads to a record this week may exacerbate it further in the near term if it limits american consumers spending on services and restokes demand for imported goods omicron also stands as a downside risk in the housing market a reading of pending home sales also out wednesday showed an unexpected drop in november and while that data largely predated omicron s ascendance in the united states the highly contagious new variant could further limit home sales in the near term the national association of realtors nar said the goods trade deficit widened last month by 17 5 to 97 8 billion from 83 2 billion in october census bureau data showed that exceeds the previous record deficit set in september of 97 billion and may damp optimism that trade might finally add to u s economic growth this quarter for the first time in more than a year imports rose by 4 7 with industrial supplies leading the way with an increase of 5 7 billion to 63 2 billion followed by consumer goods rising by 2 9 billion to just shy of 67 billion as retailers rushed to fill store shelves ahead of christmas both were record highs the emergence of the omicron variant may further ignite demand for imported goods if services activity is restricted in the first quarter of 2022 nancy vanden houten lead economist at oxford economics wrote after wednesday s report goods exports meanwhile declined 2 1 with weakness across the board outside of a 4 3 increase in food exports the drop was led by declines of 1 4 billion in industrial supplies and 1 3 billion in capital goods the worldwide surge of coronoavirus cases to a record in recent days including a record u s caseload may weigh on global demand in the months ahead risking an even wider trade gap vanden houten said the so called advance indicators report also showed wholesale inventories climbed 1 2 last month while retail inventories increased 2 0 retail inventories excluding autos which go into the calculation of gross domestic product edged up by 1 3 to 465 2 billion the latest in a string of record high readings the economy grew at a 2 3 annualized rate in the third quarter a step down from earlier in the year but activity has rebounded in the fourth quarter with a consensus among economists building around a growth rate of 6 to 7 in the final three months of 2021 trade has been a drag on gross domestic product growth for five straight quarters while inventories added to output in the third quarter earlier this month the commerce department reported a sharp reduction in the overall trade deficit including services for october which had generated some optimism that trade may contribute to the improvement in output in the final quarter of the year the big reversal to a record goods trade gap in november may prompt a rethinking of that economists at action economics have dialed back their fourth quarter gdp growth estimate to 6 5 from 7 0 with exports now seen subtracting from growth rather than adding to it as had been previously expected economists at jpmorgan and goldman sachs meanwhile left their estimates intact at 7 meanwhile contracts to buy u s previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in november as limited housing stock and lofty prices crimped activity and the explosion of new coronavirus cases poses a risk to the housing market headed into 2022 nar said its pending home sales index based on signed contracts fell 2 2 last month to 122 4 pending home sales were lower in all four regions economists polled by reuters had forecast contracts which typically become final sales after a month or two would rise 0 5 in november there was less pending home sales action this time around which i would ascribe to low housing supply but also to buyers being hesitant about home prices said lawrence yun nar s chief economist looking ahead yun said omicron poses a risk to the housing market s performance as buyers and sellers are sidelined and home construction is delayed

from our partner lenders all opinions are our own not sure if you should pay off your student loans or invest your money here s how to make the right choice for your situation istock student loan debt is a burden for many americans in 2020 30 of all adults reported that they had student debt according to federal reserve data student loans can cause financial strain and make it hard to save for retirement or other goals if you re in this boat you may be eager to pay off those student loans as quickly as possible but in some cases that might not be the right move if you re wondering whether to pay off your student loans or start investing now this guide will help you weigh the pros and cons of each consider refinancing your student loans to save money with credible you can compare student loan refinance rates from various lenders pay off student loans or invest what to consider there s a lot to think about when deciding whether to invest your extra cash or put it toward your student loans here are a few things you ll want to keep in mind as you make your decision your emergency fund ideally you should have three to six months worth of living expenses in an ideally you should have three to six months worth of living expenses in an emergency fund just in case something unexpected happens if you don t already have savings stowed away building up this fund should be your top financial priority interest rates how do your student loan interest rates compare to the returns from the stock market or other investment vehicles if your student loan rates are lower then investing could earn you more money in the long term but if your rates are higher you may be better off prioritizing your student loans so you can save money on interest type of student loans if you have federal student loans you have many repayment options at your disposal including income based repayment plans these can help you lower your monthly payment while investing your cash elsewhere if you have federal student loans you have many repayment options at your disposal including income based repayment plans these can help you lower your monthly payment while investing your cash elsewhere private student loans don t have perks like this and they may have higher interest rates than federal loans so it may make more sense to pay these off faster financial priorities how important is it that you re debt free and how much risk can you afford to take investing is always riskier than paying down a debt and getting rid of the interest costs that come with it retirement fund consider how long you have until retirement the amount currently in your retirement accounts and how much you d like to have saved when you retire you may choose to prioritize investing in your retirement account if your savings are lacking additionally if your employer offers 401 k matching you may want to take advantage of this rather than invest that money when it comes to choosing between investing and paying off student loan debt there s no right or wrong answer it depends on your unique situation and your goals option 1 pay off student loans first here are some scenarios in which you might want to prioritize paying down your student loan debt before investing your money your interest rates are particularly high if your student loan rates are particularly high paying them down quickly is typically the best way to utilize your money generally speaking if your loans have a higher interest rate than what you could earn on the stock market or from another investment paying them off first is probably a better choice than investing you have a variable interest rate with a variable interest rate both your rate and payment can increase regularly in this situation it may make more sense to pay off the loans quickly or refinance into a fixed rate loan instead your debt is creating stress financial or otherwise if your student loan debt is making it hard to get by or just causing mental stress paying it off is probably the best path forward if you think paying off your loans first is the right move you have several ways to go about it in some cases refinancing may be the best route should i refinance my student loans refinancing can give you a lower interest rate and potentially a lower monthly payment making it easier to pay your loans off quicker keep in mind that if you refinance federal student loans into a private student loan you ll lose all the benefits of federal loans including income driven repayment plans loan forgiveness and forbearance also consider your credit score which plays a big role in your ability to refinance lenders generally require a score of at least 670 to qualify and the lower your score the higher your interest rate is likely to be you may want to add a cosigner with good credit to help you qualify for refinancing with a better rate and terms check out credible to compare student loan refinance rates from multiple lenders in minutes debt payoff strategies several debt payoff methods can help you handle your student loans efficiently the most common are the debt snowball method and the debt avalanche method with the debt snowball method you make the minimum payments on all your loans and then put any extra cash toward the smallest student loan balance aiming to pay that one off first once that s paid off you move on to the next lowest balance and so on the debt avalanche method prioritizes the debts with the highest interest rates you focus on paying off the loan with the highest interest first and then continue to tackle the rest of the loans ultimately this method saves you the most money in the long term since you re reducing the amount of total interest you pay option 2 invest first in some cases investing before paying off your student loan debt may be the smarter move you may want to consider investing before paying off your student loans in the following situations the rate of return is higher than your student loan interest rates the estimated return on the stock market is about 6 6 through 2030 according to charles schwab investment advisory inc if your student loan interest rates are below this investing could earn more than you d save by paying off your student loans faster but remember there s no guarantee of returns in the stock market you re behind on saving for retirement if you re nearing retirement or are just behind on your savings goals investing in your retirement now with a 401 k or other retirement plan can help you build up those savings more efficiently compound interest is on your side and the earlier you start the better you qualify for loan forgiveness or other assistance if you know you ll qualify for student loan forgiveness or some sort of loan assistance even a few years down the line paying off your loans sooner may not be the best use of your funds keep in mind that investing also comes with risks while returns might be estimated at higher rates than your student loan rates those returns are never guaranteed option 3 pay off student loans and invest at the same time you don t have to choose just one or the other a hybrid approach can also work allowing you to both pay down your debt and invest simultaneously to do this take any discretionary funds and split them between your loans and your investments you can still use the debt snowball or avalanche methods when paying down your loans the upside to this approach is that you ll make progress toward both goals you ll also minimize risk since you re not putting all your funds toward investing the drawback is that you ll stretch out your loan repayment timeline which will cost more in interest you also won t see the full potential of your investments since you ll be limiting the funding you put toward them with credible you can compare student loan refinance rates from various lenders all in one place how to invest when you have student loans if you have extra cash after making your student loan payments or you decide to take the hybrid approach you ll need to follow a few steps to start investing calculate how much you have to invest sit down and crunch the numbers after paying the bills how much can you comfortably put toward your investments decide between self managing and working with a professional you can pick your own investments or enlist the help of a fund manager with a fund manager you entrust your investment portfolio to an expert but you ll typically pay a fee for this service research your options you have many options for investing including investing in your 401 k buying an s p 500 index fund and using an investing app open your accounts once you ve chosen your investment path you ll need to establish your investment accounts from here you ll choose your investments or they ll be managed by a fund manager if you re unsure whether to invest or pay off your student debt consider speaking to a financial advisor they can offer personalized advice to guide you down the best path for your situation

looking back at a turbulent 2021 economists and analysts hit on a few themes that defined the economic trajectory of the past year and which they say will shape the contours of money markets and management going into the new year the year began with the promise of an end to the coronavirus pandemic with the approval of highly effective vaccines and u s consumers ready to spend it ended with the cloud of the pandemic still hanging over the u s economy as successive variants triggered new waves of disease and lockdowns further aggravated roadblocks in the just in time global supply chain the stock market notched record after record and wages were climbing but a meteoric rise in the cost of living threatened to dampen or even eclipse the good news and while jobs remain plentiful an untold number of workers have remained on the sidelines unwilling or unable to rejoin the labor market the year began with the promise of an end to the pandemic with the approval of highly effective vaccines we came into the year with sort of this euphoria that we had vaccines said liz young the chief investment officer for sofi an online finance company the early expectations were that the government could mobilize a massive immunization rollout and covid could be relegated to a historical footnote we saw some really positive information from consumer confidence consumer spending gdp young said there was a lot of optimism about the economy recovering but reality in the form of resistance to the vaccines and politically motivated misinformation campaigns collided with the early public health ambitions with americans primed to spend but without enough goods or workers available to meet the burgeoning demand prices started to soar first for highly specific goods like computer chips and lumber and then for everything now we ve got this weird problem of inflation being high and a labor market that s sort of stuck and that s what the rest of the year ended up being about young said brad mcmillan the chief investment officer at the commonwealth financial network said it remains unclear how and how severely the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus will affect or inhibit economic activity but he asserted that companies are better prepared today to handle future coronavirus curveballs obviously we had multiple waves this year he said once everything reopened we learned we can have considerable growth he said looking back we ve learned that the economy can keep operating despite the pandemic robust demand was the biggest economic success story but it also came with a darker flip side in the form of higher prices for rent to refrigerators to restaurant meals economists and even monetary policymakers at the federal reserve have had to revisit their expectations for when inflation would cool it was only in the last two months of the year that fed chair jerome powell retreated from the stance that such price spikes were transitory the two big things for 2021 were inflation and the labor shortage said dan north a senior economist at euler hermes north america north said u s consumers have been reaping the benefits of globalization in the form of low prices for a growing array of imported goods over the past few decades the u s has been exposed to countries where the wage rate was very very low that s what has kept inflation down he said covid threw a wrench into the finely tuned machine the combination of repeated shutdowns across asia port bottlenecks and shortages of all kinds of goods and components turned the u s advantage into a liability when you add in the supply chain disruptions that of course exacerbates the situation north said on top of that came a surge in energy prices which sent inflationary pressures seeping into nearly every remaining crevice of business and industry from an investment standpoint it was a pretty perfect year lackluster improvement in the labor force participation rate even as the top line unemployment number improved more quickly than many had predicted was another expensive headwind for companies with record numbers of people quitting their jobs and a multimillion worker gap between the numbers of available jobs and applicants willing to take them companies had to raise pay to attract and keep talent after years of growth below the 3 5 percent to 4 percent rate that economists consider optimal for economic expansion rapidly rising wages meant u s companies were paying more for labor costs on top of rising costs for equipment materials and other inputs and yet despite a few bouts of volatility stocks soared in defiance of the looming threat posed by rising inflation from an investment standpoint it was a pretty perfect year said eric diton the president and managing director of the wealth alliance while earnings certainly contributed to the bullish sentiment technical factors and monetary policy also fueled the big influx of money into wall street diton said with a big increase in corporate earnings the fed s full force open market bond buying and keeping rates incredibly low there was no place to go but stocks stocks and especially u s stocks had a tremendous year as a response he said young suggested however that the party might be winding down the euphoria can only last so long she said we got to the end of the year and i think reality struck in the sense that as the stock market has been on this runaway tear the reality of the situation is there are some cracks in the economic pavement the latest inflation projections indicate that higher prices are set to linger through at least the first half of 2022 in a climate of tighter monetary policy rather than the ultra accommodative stance the fed adopted in march 2020 and remained committed to until recently young said we re not going to be in an environment of unlimited liquidity she said valuations matter more

as auckland prepares to move into orange under the covid 19 traffic light system in time for the arrival of 2022 a dire warning has been issued that an influx of customers at hospitality venues will be too late a financial reprieve for some operators auckland will shift to orange at 11 59pm today after more than 130 days of existence under level 4 and 3 lockdowns and most recently life under red as part of the traffic light system the shift will lead to a lifting of restrictions for bar pub and restaurant owners who employ vaccine pass requirements including the end of crowd limits a dancing ban but a hospitality industry source told the herald that the move would be too late to save some establishments and jobs due to debts unable to be paid during the most recent protracted lockdown it will be too late for some totally the source said i know of operators who can t even get supplies anymore because they are still carrying their debts forward from 120 or 130 days ago they are running around with bundles of cash trying to buy stock from other operators and that is tragic extended lockdowns and earlier alert level settings this year have seen the many normally profitable businesses lurch into debt around the region that includes establishments around the viaduct which had to remain closed for periods of the america s cup other bars which haven t been able to open to show footage of other large sporting events like all black tests and restaurants both large and small hospitality nz chief executive julie white confirmed she was aware of some downtown auckland venues which had been cut off by their regular food and beverage suppliers i am hearing that white confirmed on december 3 when introduced the traffic light system our members were saying it is do or die this summer she said businesses were struggling through no fault of their own and white said no blame could be attributed towards suppliers of various goods who had decided the debt they were owed from respective venues meant they could no longer trade with them until they received payments it would be reasonable for suppliers to start calling in what they are owed and i think this is the start of it ninety per cent of our sector is made up of small operators who rely heavily on working capital so when you are not open you have no access to working capital cashflow but you have those fixed costs adding up with us being shut suppliers who had no channel for market white said lockdown and the previous red light had meant 2021 had been a fizzer for many of its members for some operating is just going to get too hard and they won t reopen their doors in 2022 100 per cent that is the year we will see the industry shrink these are mums and dads and it is not through their fault they have literally lost access to their customers closure of venues would have a wide ranging ripple effect which would then impact financially on suppliers and also musicians who performed at them it is so welcome moving to orange but i just hope that it is not too late that is the reality the previous red light status which included maximum size groups and enforcement of seating had impacted on trading during what was meant to be a festive time what we are hearing is that people are choosing to stay home or stay local so the hardest hit are the venues that are in the viaduct white said she said members of hnz hoped that people understood venues operating under the vaccine pass scheme meaning only vaccinated people were allowed in were safer than private parties which anyone might attend regardless of their vax status auckland mayor phil goff said earlier this month that the industry would be the big winner of a shift to orange telling newstalk zb the main thing is really for the hospitality industry it has taken a real hammering and obviously it would welcome that high profile bar owner and auckland mayoralty hopeful leo molloy fears for the future of some of his counterparts and their venues photo michael craig two leading restaurants on the auckland waterfront euro and saxon parole have already closed their doors unable to keep trading under covid 19 euro for a time one of auckland s most popular waterfront locations made its announcement on social media in october saying the ongoing challenges caused by the covid 19 pandemic over the past 18 months have meant that it is no longer sustainable to reopen despite doing everything in our power to do so leo molloy owner of popular viaduct basin venue headquarters said there had been no summer sugar rush of business for bars in auckland s prime entertainment area things are solid without being fantastic but it is a bit like running with your pants around your ankles no matter how hard you try you can only go at a certain pace when you are limited to three lots of 100 and then you have all these addition pile on costs of having security for each defined area so all your operating costs are doubled effectively and your turnover is halved it is pretty easy to work out that there is no bottom line there so we are providing a service at the moment he said it was inevitable more bars and restaurants would fold as summer heated up regardless of what colour the covid 19 traffic light system was at they will go into january february and march and january will be a very tough month for a lot of people we will be fine but there are a lot of people out there smaller businesses and vulnerable businesses where january will be a very tough month god knows what will happen once summer is gone they will be gone i think molloy who is a confirmed contender for the auckland mayoralty race said auckland s cbd had been eviscerated by the lockdowns brought on by successive covid 19 lockdowns since early 2020 earlier this month heart of the city chief executive viv beck described the shift from red to orange as great and will allow for an extra special new year s eve it s just disappointing we have to wait until december 31 she said on the positive side it will give event organisers certainty for the new year get the hospitality sector operating at full capacity for new year s eve and give the confidence to

cd reviews thought mood and emotion provoking valleyviolet texas usa 10 14 2004 5 out of 5 stars years ago i walked into a music store wanting to stock up on a few items the man behind the counter placed this blue and red bubbly looking album cover on the playing now stand and what happened stopped me dead in my tracks suddenly the most beautiful music started filling the store and i stood in a stunned silence seduced by one of the most beautiful songs ever composed before you go i then bought street dreams and lyle mayes two albums i never tire of over the years they evolved to tapes and then to cds but i must say that street dreams particularly the previously mentioned cut and the title suite street dreams are stellar i had a wonderful moment when i played street dreams at the stroke of midnight on new years about 10 years ago my friends even the ones not into jazz loved it to this day i love this entire album because it truly takes me to another place mixed bag anon 12 28 2004 3 out of 5 stars speaking as someone who loves the pat metheny group and lyle mays playing in general i d have to say that this cd is a mixed bag some might find it a bit cheesy or trite but when lyle gets into his serious soloing he really shines sometimes sounds like he doesn t know exactly what he s trying to do he tries to mix different jazz idioms big band electronic fusion etc with occassional success i would recommend his first album over this but this one is a good minor addition to any metheny mays collection a great modern jazz album beautiful timeless peter sjogren sweden stockholm 04 13 2007 5 out of 5 stars lyle mays compositions are absolutely fabulous all albums are great the 2 first albums are similar in character and influence very beautiful modern jazz compositions lyle is supported playing with the greatest musicians the other 2 more recent albums are quite different yet very impressive work in particular the fictionary good but needed more thought david j ohanlon lilyfield nsw australia 02 16 2008 3 out of 5 stars this was lyle s follow up to his self titled debut album of 1986 and unfortunately the attempt at imitation fell short one of street dream s major problems is that the previous album was a certifiable masterpiece one cd which i would risk my life to salvage if my house caught fire was therefore an incredibly hard act to follow another problem is that i m generally unimpressed with lyle s keyboard set up quite often his tone sounds cheesy or like a popsicle eg chorinho hangtime i really like it when lyle uses synths as texture for his piano playing here he seems to have inverted this rule to his detriment i also think he could have done away with the chamber orchestra which only succeeds in inhibiting lyle s usual free flowing tone colour compositional performance approach finally the material itself needed editing more time to develop fresh ideas best examples of this are before you go which starts off just the same as hangtime finishes then descends into almost pure schmaltz the title track which tries to deliver another masterpiece in the vein of alaskan suite but fails to breathe or evoke anything other than a seeming haste to get the record out look overall street dreams is not a bad album but imho lyle really needed to take a step back at some point have a major re think of some of the material the instrumentation musicians needed to fully realise it

for months the gop fox news axis forecast the bluest of christmases house republican leader kevin mccarthy joined 159 house republicans in a letter to president biden saying his policies will certainly ensure that this christmas will not be merry because of a supply chain crisis and inflation chairman jim banks of the house republican study committee citing the same reasons wrote to colleagues our job as republicans is to explain to the american people what the grinches at 1600 pennsylvania ave did to ruin christmas fox news told viewers that christmas presents for your kids may not arrive on time or even at all sean hannity that the president is the biden who stole christmas laura ingraham and that biden is facing a nightmare come christmastime when gifts are going to cost a fortune and that s even if you re lucky enough to snag anything jesse watters advertisement breitbart news trumpeted a trump campaign adviser s forecast for a frankly miserable christmas the biden blue christmas newsmax foresaw biden s blue christmas shortages frustration economic malaise follow this author dana milbank s opinions follow and then a christmas miracle holiday retail sales were the highest ever jumping 8 5 percent from last year and nearly 11 percent from pre pandemic 2019 as consumers splurged throughout the season mastercard reported sunday stores were stocked package deliveries were overwhelmingly on time inflation though a serious concern clearly didn t deter shoppers and holiday motorists found gas prices 14 cents a gallon lower than in november so did gop leaders and fox news acknowledge they fearmongered in error my closed caption search might have missed something but i found only three passing mentions on fox news of the holiday sales triumph amid a new round of doomsaying it looks like things are about to get a lot worse in the new year republican twitter guns were similarly silent advertisement after a year of such deception the united states is experiencing the worst economy we never had the economy is going gangbusters historically so yet americans particularly republicans express a gloom not matched by economic reality or by their own spending behaviors polls and consumer confidence indices show an economic pessimism as grim as when millions lost jobs in the pandemic shutdown this is in large part because disinformation has prevailed partisanship long colored economic views but now republicans in addition to occupying a parallel political reality are expanding an alternate economic universe america s economy improved more in joe biden s first 12 months than any president during the past 50 years notwithstanding the contrary media narrative contributing to dour public opinion matthew winkler former editor in chief of bloomberg news wrote last week among the gains the economy expanded an estimated 5 5 percent in 2021 fourth quarter growth dramatically outpaced europe and even china unemployment plunged to 4 2 percent record setting u s stock markets the s p 500 is up nearly 30 percent outperformed the world productivity jumped corporate profits are the largest since 1950 and corporate debt the lowest in 30 consumer credit expanded confidence among ceos is the highest in 20 years the american rescue plan cut child poverty in half the force of the american expansion is also inducing overseas companies to invest in the u s betting that the growth is still accelerating and will outpace other major economies added the wall street journal advertisement the fly in the ointment is inflation estimated at 5 6 percent for the year the highest in 40 years which is suppressing disposable income this causes real pain for consumers particularly low income americans buying groceries and gas and anybody buying a car but studies show that among the lowest earners wage gains outpaced inflation also inflation is less than half what it was 40 years ago and unlike then today s bond yields signal investors don t expect inflation to worsen forty years ago stagnant growth combined with inflation to cause stagflation now the economy is roaring yet a gallup poll out last week found that americans confidence in the economy has dropped to where it was in april 2020 when nationwide shutdowns brought on by the covid 19 pandemic plunged the nation into a recession the reason is clear as the post s philip bump explained republicans in april 2020 were evenly split on whether the economy was in excellent good condition or fair poor now despite dramatic improvements 91 percent of republicans say the economy is in fair poor condition the democratic shift in the opposite direction was smaller advertisement this happened surprise during fox news s hysterical coverage of inflation gas prices and supply chain problems it invoked inflation roughly twice as often as cnn and msnbc now as bump reported three quarters of republicans say prices are the most important measure of the economy s health only one quarter did a year ago eclipsing unemployment personal finances and the stock market

student loan refinance rates from various lenders pay off student loans or invest what to consider there s a lot to think about when deciding whether to invest your extra cash or put it toward your student loans here are a few things you ll want to keep in mind as you make your decision your emergency fund ideally you should have three to six months worth of living expenses in an ideally you should have three to six months worth of living expenses in an emergency fund just in case something unexpected happens if you don t already have savings stowed away building up this fund should be your top financial priority interest rates how do your student loan interest rates compare to the returns from the stock market or other investment vehicles if your student loan rates are lower then investing could earn you more money in the long term but if your rates are higher you may be better off prioritizing your student loans so you can save money on interest type of student loans if you have federal student loans you have many repayment options at your disposal including income based repayment plans these can help you lower your monthly payment while investing your cash elsewhere if you have federal student loans you have many repayment options at your disposal including income based repayment plans these can help you lower your monthly payment while investing your cash elsewhere private student loans don t have perks like this and they may have higher interest rates than federal loans so it may make more sense to pay these off faster financial priorities how important is it that you re debt free and how much risk can you afford to take investing is always riskier than paying down a debt and getting rid of the interest costs that come with it retirement fund consider how long you have until retirement the amount currently in your retirement accounts and how much you d like to have saved when you retire you may choose to prioritize investing in your retirement account if your savings are lacking additionally if your employer offers 401 k matching you may want to take advantage of this rather than invest that money when it comes to choosing between investing and paying off student loan debt there s no right or wrong answer it depends on your unique situation and your goals option 1 pay off student loans first here are some scenarios in which you might want to prioritize paying down your student loan debt before investing your money your interest rates are particularly high if your student loan rates are particularly high paying them down quickly is typically the best way to utilize your money generally speaking if your loans have a higher interest rate than what you could earn on the stock market or from another investment paying them off first is probably a better choice than investing you have a variable interest rate with a variable interest rate both your rate and payment can increase regularly in this situation it may make more sense to pay off the loans quickly or refinance into a fixed rate loan instead your debt is creating stress financial or otherwise if your student loan debt is making it hard to get by or just causing mental stress paying it off is probably the best path forward if you think paying off your loans first is the right move you have several ways to go about it in some cases refinancing may be the best route should i refinance my student loans refinancing can give you a lower interest rate and potentially a lower monthly payment making it easier to pay your loans off quicker keep in mind that if you refinance federal student loans into a private student loan you ll lose all the benefits of federal loans including income driven repayment plans loan forgiveness and forbearance also consider your credit score which plays a big role in your ability to refinance lenders generally require a score of at least 670 to qualify and the lower your score the higher your interest rate is likely to be you may want to add a cosigner with good credit to help you qualify for refinancing with a better rate and terms check out credible to compare student loan refinance rates from multiple lenders in minutes debt payoff strategies several debt payoff methods can help you handle your student loans efficiently the most common are the debt snowball method and the debt avalanche method with the debt snowball method you make the minimum payments on all your loans and then put any extra cash toward the smallest student loan balance aiming to pay that one off first once that s paid off you move on to the next lowest balance and so on the debt avalanche method prioritizes the debts with the highest interest rates you focus on paying off the loan with the highest interest first and then continue to tackle the rest of the loans ultimately this method saves you the most money in the long term since you re reducing the amount of total interest you pay option 2 invest first in some cases investing before paying off your student loan debt may be the smarter move you may want to consider investing before paying off your student loans in the following situations the rate of return is higher than your student loan interest rates the estimated return on the stock market is about 6 6 through 2030 according to charles schwab investment advisory inc if your student loan interest rates are below this investing could earn more than you d save by paying off your student loans faster but remember there s no guarantee of returns in the stock market you re behind on saving for retirement if you re nearing retirement or are just behind on your savings goals investing in your retirement now with a 401 k or other retirement plan can help you build up those savings more efficiently compound interest is on your side and the earlier you start the better you qualify for loan forgiveness or other assistance if you know you ll qualify for student loan forgiveness or some sort of loan assistance even a few years down the line paying off your loans sooner may not be the best use of your funds keep in mind that investing also comes with risks while returns might be estimated at higher rates than your student loan rates those returns are never guaranteed option 3 pay off student loans and invest at the same time you don t have to choose just one or the other a hybrid approach can also work allowing you to both pay down your debt and invest simultaneously to do this take any discretionary funds and split them between your loans and your investments you can still use the debt snowball or avalanche methods when paying down your loans the upside to this approach is that you ll make progress toward both goals you ll also minimize risk since you re not putting all your funds toward investing the drawback is that you ll stretch out your loan repayment timeline which will cost more in interest you also won t see the full potential of your investments since you ll be limiting the funding you put toward them with credible you can compare student loan refinance rates from various lenders all in one place how to invest when you have student loans if you have extra cash after making your student loan payments or you decide to take the hybrid approach you ll need to follow a few steps to start investing calculate how much you have to invest sit down and crunch the numbers after paying the bills how much can you comfortably put toward your investments decide between self managing and working with a professional you can pick your own investments or enlist the help of a fund manager with a fund manager you entrust your investment portfolio to an expert but you ll typically pay a fee for this service research your options you have many options for investing including investing in your 401 k buying an s p 500 index fund and using an investing app open your accounts once you ve chosen your investment path you ll need to establish your investment accounts from here you ll choose your investments or they ll be managed by a fund manager if you re unsure whether to invest or pay off your student debt consider speaking to a financial advisor they can offer

inflows into mutual funds and exchange traded funds have declined in recent weeks in line with seasonal patterns with predicted jan 1 reallocations a municipal market analytics report said things might quickly turn around notably in favor of municipal etfs dealer inventories increase in anticipation of a supply lull the usual december inventory build produced dealer carry levels exceeding an average of 20 billion little more than half of a typical supply month between 2016 and 2018 noted kim olsan senior vice president at fhn financial she noted the current yield set with the 10 year aaa holding just above 1 and uncertainty around early 2022 markets has led to slower inventory turnovers federal reserve data show that dealers are carrying an average of 14 billion this month up from 9 billion a month during all of 2021 an example of a static mindset this month is the fact that the 10 year aaa refinitiv mmd yield has not moved at all stuck at 1 03 since nov 30 while other benchmark 10 year aaas have shown a similar trend market returns have been driven by coupon payments this month as a result up 0 15 olsan said olsan laid out the recent historicals on dealer carry and january performance depending on circumstances at year end returns in the following month of january have been mixed as dealers committed more capital she said following the election in 2016 markets adjusted to a risk off mindset benefitting generic municipals as january 2017 s market gain was 0 50 a similar scenario played out in 2018 as the market selloff in october moved the 10 year aaa to the 2 75 area generating brisk year end business with better entry points and creating an opening for january to post a 0 75 return olsan said in 2017 dealer inventories surged to an average of 27 billion through december ahead of tax reform taking hold in 2018 market returns were pressured a month later when a generic index lost 1 she said a stingier yield set late in 2019 drew lower dealer commitments but strong demand for munis forced yields to test the 1 area that led to a near 2 gain for the market in january 2020 during a volatile 2020 end of year trading reflected a reduced inventory profile with dealers holding an average of 7 billion during december olsan said returns were not compromised though with a main index gaining 0 65 this past january forward looking performance for the upcoming month suggests participants more or less comfortable with fundamentals driving a positive result she said municipal market analytics partner matt fabian also points to dealer carry trends over the following two months when net supply pressure among tax exempts is expected to worsen compared to last year the move toward richer tax exempts is unlikely to reverse fabian said dealers seem to be acknowledging this looming challenge he noted even when year end loading of variable rate demand obligations are excluded data for the week of dec 15 reveal the largest dealer investment in product since mid march 2020 at 15 7 billion we cannot yet call this a full re engagement however seeing as the jump in dealer holdings of vrdos above 3 billion on dec 8 was followed by a spike in the sifma index including an 11 basis points print last week likely aiming at putting bonds back in investor hands fabian said informa money market muni funds rise tax exempt

to the state street investor confidence index the global confidence index plunged to 85 6 in december from 111 5 a month earlier while the north american index fell to 96 4 from 110 4 our investor confidence index fell by its widest margin as the omicron variant emerged as a new threat to mobility and commerce at a time when inflation was reaching global peaks and central banks began to more aggressively signal a willingness to tighten policy to address rising prices said marvin loh senior macro strategist at state street global markets the index measures investor risk appetite so the drop reflects a smaller portion of portfolio holdings dedicated to risky investments he said the index for europe fell more than the one for north america or asia probably due to many countries adopting stricter mobility rules right before the holidays loh said the declines in north america and asia were more muted either as additional covid restrictions were limited or stricter measures were already in place as more becomes known about omicron s impact we may see a bounce back in investor confidence as witnessed by recent strength in equity valuations he added having said that the tightening bias of many of the largest central banks will continue to prove a headwind to confidence as we start the year also released wednesday pending home sales unexpectedly fell 2 2 in november

the climate crisis is killing migrants who are crossing the us border from mexico a new study finds many people making the dangerous journey have died of dehydration but a team of american scientists found that specifically most travelers die in the area between nogales mexico and three point arizona this is a region within the sonoran desert the area has a concentration of places with the greatest predicted evaporated water loss the study found those who trek through it experience disorientation and organ failure that can lead to death more men have died of dehydration than women the researchers determined the study concludes that in 30 years even under an intermediate mitigation scenario people would be expected to lose one third more water on a journey across the us southern border than they would today scroll down for video the image shows recorded deaths of 93 men top and 28 women bottom who were travelling on foot in southern arizona the black dots indicate individual deaths while red coloring indicates regions in which deaths are most likely to be recorded the study was conducted by scientists from the university of idaho princeton university the university of california and the university of wisconsin who sought to quantify the costs in terms of water lost through respiration and sweating of the migrant journey and how variation in those costs corresponded to patterns of migrant mortality ryan long associate professor of wildlife sciences at the university of idaho and senior author of the study said in a statement over the past several decades thousands of men women and children have died attempting to circumvent border protection efforts and cross from mexico into the united states because official ports of entry are heavily fortified many migrants attempt to enter the u s by crossing remote desert regions the team determine which parts of the crossing are the most dangerous using geo referenced records of adult male and female deaths recorded from 1981 to 2019 with a focus on those who died between may and september when the hottest and driest weather hits and the most migrant deaths occur carbon brief reports it has been known that many people making the dangerous journey die of dehydration but a team of american scientists found that most travelers die in the area between nogales mexico and three point arizona this is a region within the sonoran desert stock the study shows the amount of drinking water carried by a typical migrant is likely not sufficient to prevent severe dehydration and this deficit will only increase as the climate warms pictured are water bottles found along the route to the us using the niche mapper biophysical model scientists then calculated how much people dehydrate at different points of the trip this allowed them to determine where people are more likely to be hit with dehydration different levels of dehydration were then given from severe dehydration in which people lose over 10 percent of their body mass in a single day from water loss to mild dehydration in which people lose zero to five percent the study includes quotes from migrants who made the crossing describing their experiences with one who explained the extent of dehydration lucho a 47 year old migrant from jalisco mexico said in an interview in june 2009 we were dying of thirst i was hallucinating at that point we were surrounded by dirt but i kept seeing water everywhere in the desert taking a deeper look the team found that people will experience more water loss in june the black dots indicate individual deaths while red coloring indicates regions in which deaths are most likely to be recorded the data shows that on average a 152 pound pregnant woman would be expected to lose two gallons of water during a day time journey while a 41 pound five year old would lose five cups and taking a deeper look the team found that people will experience more water loss in june the study shows the amount of drinking water carried by a typical migrant is likely not sufficient to prevent severe dehydration and this deficit will only increase as the climate warms long said we provide the first empirical evidence that the physiological stresses experienced by humans attempting to cross the sonoran desert into the u s are sufficient to cause severe dehydration and associated conditions that can lead to death long said our study provides strong evidence that patterns of migrant mortality in the desert can be explained by spatiotemporal variation in the physiological costs experienced during the journey a disproportionately large percentage of migrant deaths occur in areas where the predicted rates of water loss are highest

under scourge of the pandemic â humanâ is left out in us style human rights by global times editorial global times 08 25 december 30 2021 white flags are seen on the national mall in washington d c the united states on sept 16 2021 more than 660 000 white flags were installed here to honor the lives lost to covid 19 in the united states photo xinhua the us hit a record high of 543 928 daily new covid 19 cases on tuesday the number of new deaths reached 3 023 the same day for two consecutive days new covid 19 cases in the us have exceeded 500 000 behind each startling number is an unfortunate live and family as the epidemic hits new records again and again washington is ending 2021 in an extremely somber way and its fiasco will go down in history the previous record of new covid 19 cases was a figure of 294 015 recorded on january 8 one day after the confirmation of joe biden s presidential election victory by the congress after taking office biden made control of the epidemic a top priority and launched a series of prevention and control measures many thought that the record on january 8 would be the peak and even the most pessimistic person at that time probably couldn t have imagined that a new record would be reached by the end of the year the white house has a new president but the epidemic is raging even more widely in 2021 the us still presents the world with chaos disorder and contradiction in its fight against the epidemic los angeles times columnist michael hiltzik wrote in his article entitled farewell to 2021 the stupidest year in american history that instead of unity and immunity this year has brought us stupidity and insanity on an unimaginable scale he argues that covid 19 is surely the focus of the most obtuse and ignorant public reactions and state and local policy responses to any crisis in american history some media outlets commented that a sense of powerlessness over political confrontation social rifts and rampant anti intellectualism has further dissipated expectations of a united response to the epidemic as the country with the most advanced technology and top comprehensive strength the us has the strongest financial and medical resources moreover it only has a population of 329 million people but two years since the covid 19 epidemic broke out over 810 000 people have died of the pandemic under the so called democratic system nobody is held accountable for such a huge loss of human lives people don t even know who is responsible for fighting the pandemic under the us president human is left out of human rights such an absurd logic just happened in a modern society people found that the death toll has a much smaller impact on politicians in washington than the number of votes and the ups and downs of the stock market in developed countries with advanced medical conditions and better welfare systems we have constantly seen cruel scenes of social darwinism the poor are facing a higher risk of being infected and witnessing a higher death rate some medical institutions have even given tacit permission for selective treatment of impoverished patients or those of ethnic minorities when a large number of ordinary families are caught up in financial difficulties due to the epidemic the assets of billionaires have risen significantly according to a recent report by business insider 52 members of the us congress were found to have concealed their technology pharmaceutical or other stock trades violating the stock act they were suspected of taking advantage of the turmoil of the epidemic to make a fortune out of national crisis through engaging in insider trading what s currently happening in the us is a humanitarian catastrophe and a human rights disaster but those human rights preachers are either at a loss about what to do or they just turn a blind eye to it apart from being symbolically mentioned on occasional commemorative ceremonies the misfortunes of the broken families and individuals have been collectively neglected the human has been left out of us human rights that s why the economy has been put above human lives and saving the stock market is considered more important than curbing the epidemic in 2021 under the scourge of the covid 19 pandemic the us has defeated the us and the true nature of the human rights defender has been exposed we feel sympathy for the american people who have suffered miserably from the pandemic while having a more sober understanding of the hypocrisy of the us style human rights web editor zhong wenxing liang jun
one analyst gets notably more bullish on the biotech s shares what happened dynavax technologies dvax 1 42 a biotech considered by some to be a coronavirus stock outpaced the broader market on wednesday the company s shares rose by 5 6 on the back of a significant price target increase from an analyst so what that analyst is edward white of h c wainwright who this morning lifted his price target on the stock to 28 from the previous 23 while maintaining his buy recommendation this didn t occur out of the blue on tuesday india s biological e announced that its coronavirus vaccine candidate corbevax had received approval for emergency use from that country s pharmaceutical regulator the drugs controller general corbevax utilizes dynavax s cpg 1018 adjuvant to maximize its effectiveness an adjuvant is a substance used in vaccines to create a stronger immune response from the body the american company s involvement in the indian jab should be a compelling piece of business dynavax quoted its ceo ryan spencer as saying we have secured the capacity to deliver on our commitment to supply cpg 1018 adjuvant to biological e to meet their needs for their existing contract with the indian government for 300 million doses as well as any additional adjuvant required to fulfill future demand in 2022 and beyond now what the corbevax authorization isn t white s only reason for upping his target price on dynavax stock he pointed out that the biotech is presently involved in three other coronavirus vaccine projects as ever in the biotech world there s no guarantee that any will come to market but this shows that cpg 1018 is a compelling product that should benefit dynavax as long as the coronavirus remains a threat
the ai powered consumer lending company thinks it has a better method for determining borrowers ability to repay the consumer lending industry is ripe for disruption application and approval methods have been relatively unchanged for decades in this segment from the five recorded on dec 14 fool com contributor trevor jennewine highlights one stock that is using artificial intelligence to improve consumer lending find out why upstart holdings inc is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now our award winning analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now upstart holdings inc is on the list but there are nine others you may be overlooking click here to get access to the full list stock advisor returns as of december 16 2021 trevor jennewine one of the trends i really like is artificial intelligence and i m going to go with upstart upst 3 76 as a good way to invest in that trend i m sure that a lot of foolish investors are familiar with upstart but it s an ai powered lending platform the company s mission is to improve access to consumer credit and also to reduce the associated costs and risks for lenders basically its platform connects consumers to lending partners like banks and credit unions one of the drivers for this is that traditional credit models use up to about 30 variables most of the time when they re deciding who gets a loan and what interest rate they will pay upstart s management team which is led by co founder and ceo david girouard the former president of google enterprise they believe that methodology is flawed it s not including enough data to get an accurate picture of risks for instance they mentioned that 80 percent of americans who have borrowed money have never defaulted on a loan but only 48 percent have access to prime credit or the interest rate that s the interest rate that financial institutions charge their best customers the current system hurts banks and borrowers in a few ways some creditworthy applicants are being turned away and then other approved applicants are being charged too much upstart uses artificial intelligence to make the process better it captures about 1 600 data points per borrower measures that information against 10 5 million repayment events that number is always going up that creates a network effect as you get more borrowers you have more data each time someone makes or misses a payment the ai models get a little bit better at predicting the risk of default that network effect should be a significant growth driver in the years ahead more importantly the company has some results to back it up am going to show us another slide here in one study where they looked at a few different banks and they held the approval rates constant upstart s platform was able to reduce defaults by about 75 percent then that also works the other way if you hold your loss rates constantly or your default rates constant they can expand the number of approvals by 173 percent there s a nice middle ground in there where you can approve more borrowers and you can still lower your loss rates that s a pretty compelling value proposition the financial picture looks pretty solid revenues 621 million over the last 12 months that s up 190 percent they re free cash flow positive in fact they re actually positive on a gaap basis but when you look at transactions volume their platform is used to originate 8 9 billion in loans over the last year that figure is up 175 percent but it is a small fraction of the 753 billion market opportunity right now 753 million is a very small fraction of that that just includes personal loans and auto loans the company is also mentioned going into mortgages and other lending verticals that could push their market opportunity eventually to over five trillion dollars i think there s plenty of room for this business to grow i want to say the stock has done about 65 percent right now from a tie if that s interesting to you now might be a good time to buy a few shares of upstart

by michael sheikh head research analyst falcon strategic research special to the digest impact fusion international inc otcmkts ifus markets products in the health and wellness sector using its proprietary nutri mastic ingredient their product aids in the digestive health of both humans and animals by increasing the absorption of nutrients they repurposed their nutri mastic with sugar cane waste fiber known as bagasse and came up with a brand new product unique to the cattle feed business this repurposed agricultural fiber waste is approved by the us fda usda and epa for use in cattle feed the waste fiber comes from sugar cane producers and ifus converts it into low cost high benefit healthy cattle feed using proven time tested proprietary processes that only ifus has for every investor that wants to stop reading at the mention of cattle feed and thinks it s a completely dead sector resist the urge the cattle feed market has been dull and boring because there hasn t been any innovation for decades until this point in time this isn t just any cattle feed it s a cattle feed and supplement that when used properly can substantially lower the ammonia and methane emissions from cattle while increasing productive protein weight gain and it improves healthy milk production of dairy cows while reducing the need for antibiotics and hormone injections yes this innovation can slow global warming and make your hamburger and milk healthier and cheaper too good to be true right disrupting the cattle feed market the production cost of this ifus feed is about 10 per ton yet the farmer pays at least 40 per ton for hay hay is the low cost alternative when available and is up to 240 per ton on a seasonal and drought severity basis ifus is a disruptor in the cattle feed market which measured 73 5 billion in 2019 and they are in a position to do 100 million in revenue in the coming year so stick around and keep reading ifus has a 62 acre facility located in napoleonville louisiana and it is strategically positioned near the 12 major sugar mills that are also close to the sugar cane growers in louisiana antibiotics are inefficient and expensive ways to increase yield most cattle graze on grass but their diet is supplemented with grain corn wheat and oats ranchers are paid by the pound and use grains or yellow corn to bulk up their herd before the auction the grains and corn are full of calories but they come at a cost of nutritional value when the cattle don t get the proper nutrition it affects their immune system and they become susceptible to infection in a quest to increase the bulk weight ranchers use antibiotics to help out their weakened immune systems antibiotics are not cheap but the ranchers can ill afford an outbreak which would cost them their herd this mass administration of antibiotics costs 1 8 billion annually the department of agriculture estimates that a majority 59 of u s feedlots have embraced the practice of using antibiotics prophylactically the bottom line is that 20 5 of all cattle are placed on a regimen of grain feed and antibiotics the moral hazard of antibiotic overuse the cattle industry is playing with fire because the more they use antibiotics the greater likelihood there is of creating a superbug that becomes resistant to the current antibiotics a bug resistant infection could easily wipe out their herds adding to the problem are the large feedlots that hold the cattle right before slaughter in 2018 there were 33 million cattle slaughtered in the united states and 25 million spent time on these large feedlots getting fattened to market weight that is a staggering statistic that over 75 of the cattle were treated with antibiotics rising hay prices due to prolonged drought the usda is in full emergency mode already since 2020 the severe drought this summer in the west and great plains forced the u s department of agriculture usda into action they have made plans to help cover the cost of transporting feed for livestock that rely on grazing usda is updating the emergency assistance for livestock honey bees and farm raised fish elap the program is designed to immediately cover feed and transportation costs of ranchers impacted by the drought usda is currently determining how our disaster assistance programs can best help alleviate the significant economic physical and emotional strain agriculture producers are experiencing due to drought conditions the duration and intensity of current drought conditions are merciless and the impacts of this summer s drought will be felt by producers for months to come today s announcement is to provide relief as ranchers make fall and winter herd management decisions said agriculture secretary tom vilsack climate change and prolonged droughts have put increased pressure on the price of cattle feed this summer s headlines read the worst drought in 1 200 years as many had to cope with triple digit temperatures the reality was that 93 of the land in 7 western states was under drought and 59 was under extreme drought with the worst conditions seen in 100 years hay prices spiked 100 600 setting aside these bad conditions the price of hay is quite volatile many variables determine the pricing of hay region type of grass weather drought excessive rain how many cuttings per growing season by area transportation costs fertilizer costs whether fertilizer was used and demand are some of the more important factors opportunity the cattle feed market is enormous and has had no real innovations in decades prices are so high that a disruptive solution would spread rapidly and bulldoze over any hesitancy to change because cattle ranchers are getting desperate for a solution so desperate that they are cutting the size of the us herds which has since 2013 led to higher beef prices and more shortages the second half of the opportunity is about 80 million tons of waste sugarcane fiber known as bagasse that the sugar mills pay big bucks to landfill they pay to throw it away the solution we needed something fast cheap plentiful and easy to produce the fact that it helps save the planet may be an irrelevant talking point for some small ranchers in crisis but bagasse represents the solution that hits on all the high points for example cattle feedlots and dairies are facing future epa limits on their massive methane emissions and they face huge future costs to capture and destroy or somehow reduce the methane emissions from dairy cows and cattle they specifically name enteric fermentation in their literature which is the methane gas that leaks out of the cow s digestive system universities worldwide are starting massive r d efforts to find ways to reduce methane emissions from these dairy and cattle feedlots the same universities that tried for 70 years to solve how to convert bagasse into a suitable digestible cattle feed and not just a fiber additive ifus has already solved both problems technology that increases cattle weight gain while they eat less eliminates need to burn bagasse which adds to the greenhouse gas problem lowers the greenhouse gas emissions footprint of cows dairy and cattle feedlots lowers water consumption by cattle and for growing feed improves cattle s immune health and reduces their reliance on antibiotics supported by government policies is very profitable while it saves bbq milk beef and the planet lower cost means less expensive beef milk ice cream and cheese on your table greenhouse gas ghg reduction there are 2 primary greenhouse gases carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 but most of the world s controversy focuses on fluorinated gases like hfcs pfcs sf6 the paris climate agreements were focused on co2 emissions the irony of these talks and agreements is that methane is by far the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases yet little is being done to curb cattle production cattle are the biggest producers of methane and rank just behind electricity on their contribution to greenhouse gases ghg many of the statistics are misleading because they compare gas volume but methane is 20 times worse than co2 because it traps 28 times more heat than co2 over 100 years one of ifus leading competitors zaluvida indicated that if cattle burped a little less they could reduce ghg emissions by 30 by simply improving cow gut health ranchers could be a major tool in fighting the rising levels of ghg s it s not hard for investors to imagine lucrative government incentives to reduce cows ghg s early this month the eu and the united states pledged to cut emissions of methane by 30 it may be a coincidence or perhaps they are familiar with this type of technology and this pledge is the first step in its adoption which would be a huge boon to ifus the technology exists but now the concept needs exposure and to be accepted by the cattle ranchers nutri mastic this cattle feed is made from 100 natural products which primarily consists of sugar cane waste fiber from sugar mills and ifus nutri mastic nutri mastic is an ifus proprietary formula containing mastic gum which is an aromatic resin from the mastic tree pistacia lentiscus indigenous to the mediterranean region of greece the gum and other ionic materials in ifus nutri mastic aid in absorption and digestive health the waste product from refining sugar is called bagasse and it is a dry fibrous material that remains after the juice is extracted from the sugar cane stalks when mixed together it almost creates a super cattle feed ifus introduced its first human nutraceutical products in 2009 which are based on the ifus proprietary nutri mastic formula here is how it works the normal gastrointestinal gi tract is a very toxic environment bacteria colonies start at the mouth and are found throughout the gi tract and end at the anus one of the primary byproducts of bacteria metabolizing and breaking down the food into amino acids is scavenge ammonia scavenge ammonia within the digestive system makes it impossible for probiotics to reach the colon area the liver filters out this ammonia and turns it into urea so that the urea can be excreted in the urine nutri mastic reduces the levels of scavenging ammonia making it easier for the intestinal floral mix of bacteria to thrive and in turn aid in digestion and also improves the uptake of nutrients the next part is the uptake of the minerals minerals fall into three categories with neutral positive and negative charges ifus nutri mastic has positive and negatively charged mineral ions this is how the essential minerals move from the digestive system into the bloodstream the acidity and ph of the digestive system play a key part in the mineral uptake the buildup of hydronium ions which is a waste product of digestion can lead to a more acidic body which hurts overall digestion the uptake of minerals and increases the risk of infections ifus nutri mastic balances and buffers the ph putting this together means that cattle using ifus supreme gold plus cattle feed have better overall digestion which creates a better probiotic environment in their gut that ends up producing less methane there is also better absorption of the nutrients which means the cattle will gain weight faster and be healthier as a result of less ammonia toxicity being allowed to accumulate swift rollout and sales expected they have a fully equipped turn key and proprietary facility that can scale quickly to the point where they can operate at a run rate of 100 million in cattle feed alone annually with an extremely high profit margin up to 90 they could continue growing organically without the need for financing additional equipment or infrastructure their sweet spot no pun intended are the sugar producing states to expand their footprint beyond 400 million year they need to go where there is ample availability of raw material or charge higher prices which is possible during droughts like the current 1200 year historical drought but there is enough waste bagasse in louisiana a 10 year supply already available they could use a hub and spoke model and ship from these regional hubs in the sugar producing states and then export to many drought stricken counties shipping in bulk by train using the nearby railroad spur and using barges from the new orleans port is already part of the plan from there the bulk treated bagasse based feed can be shipped worldwide india and brazil have massive piles of waste bagasse that can be tapped in the future ranch case study on a large ranch cows on a feedlot or dairy farm can consume 50 pounds of processed feed per day 10 000 head of cattle will consume 250 tons per day at an average cost of up to 100 per ton or more this equates to 25 000 per day spent feeding the cattle there are over 93 million cattle in the united states alone cattle eat 365 days a year that works out to 9 125 000 year for just 10 000 cattle on one large feedlot or dairy farm or ranch during a drought high producing dairy cows will eat 110 to 120 pounds of wet feed a day or 50 to 55 pounds of dry matter dm a day as cows produce more milk they eat more a typical diet for a dairy cow could include about 30 to 35 pounds of baled hay 26 30 pounds dm and 25 pounds of grain mix 22 pounds dm aug 16 2019 competitors their top competitor on the technology front is zaluvida which is privately owned their products work on the gastrointestinal health of the cows their supplement is called mootral and it optimizes the process of digestion which also improves their overall health and fitness when reviewing the competitive landscape the most obvious observation is that cattle feed companies are measured in the billions there are no small companies in the feed business nutreco is a new zealand company but it has a 3 0 billion market cap in china new hope liuhe co ltd has a market cap of 19 3 billion wens foodstuff group co ltd is also located in china and has a 97 3 billion market cap the smaller names like forfarmers are located in the netherlands and they have a market cap of 405 million the only other otc company is charoen pokphand foods ord shs f otcmkts chpff has a market cap of 5 77 billion financial analysis company structure many otc investors would consider ifus to have an optimal share structure there are 625 million shares authorized and 349 6 million shares issued and outstanding which means there is virtually no potential for a reverse split there are approximately 190 million shares in the float indicating there is a good percentage of retail investors holding the stock 601 shareholders last reported by the ta on otc markets in mid october the company announced a reduction in its long term debt by 42 when it converted 656 000 into a preferred voting only stock that has no conversion feature more recently another 150 000 in debt due against 250 000 in equipment assets listed in the financials was settled for 11 million common shares and solidified ownership of that equipment on the books of ifus less than 900 000 of debt is currently left on the books and 650 000 of it is notes payable to an officer and the other two notes are directed toward long term retail investors and equipment the company has characterized to be in friendly hands 62 acre manufacturing site the balance sheet is weak with only 15k in cash equivalents but it did have 70 000 of wip inventory given the great margins of the company it could turn its inventory into approximately 700 000 of sales and use the profits to reinvest back into the company in order to scale up manufacturing all this can be done without issuing any more shares plant equipment and processes the 62 acre site was once an operating sugarmill it has massive buildings and outdoor space to store raw bagasse finished product inventory and more than ample room for expansion it also has access to a railroad spur for shipping railroad car loads of the feed by rail in north america train loads can be shipped by rail to new orleans for shipping barge loads of the feed to anywhere in the world they have a bailing line that includes the mixing process press and bailing stages they also have a massive in house bagging line and massive room in existing buildings to add mixing baling and bagging lines as needed to meet an unmet demand once sales pass 24 hour day 7day week operations bails sold on pallets by truck load investment summary ifus with their nutri mastic technology has the potential to transform the cattle feed market measured in tens of billions in the united states to hundreds of billions worldwide not only is this technology disruptive to the price of cattle feed but it has major implications with respect to greenhouse gasses a win for investors and the planet their business model is very simplistic in that they could very quickly become the lowest cost producer of cattle feed by taking the waste from sugar cane production bagasse and turning it into valuable feed they have already done the proof of concept and have the factory and facilities in place the only thing that remains are the orders the stock has an 8 0 market capitalization because it is in that lull between when companies become current with otc markets and then unveil their business plan to the market the first salvo in this plan seemed to be the debt reduction but that release had little impact because investors saw this didn t take any shares out of circulation and didn t seem to reach a wide audience the establishment of their twitter account impactfusionl seems to be another indication that more news is imminent but they are just beginning to establish a following they have a good share structure with 175 million at dtc after revealing their plan for revenues the market should adjust the market cap to its revenue projection market multiples of 2x revenues are realistic targets for this industry which means for every 100 million in sales the stock should seek 200 million in market cap given the incredible need for this product investors should brace themselves for a unicorn valuation or a minimum of a doubling of the market cap for every 10 million of orders

drone delivery has done some pretty incredible things in 2021 drones have delivered to bustling cities some of the most remote locations on earth and even your backyard they ve airdropped everything from chicken wings to blood transfusions and they ve grabbed the attention and lightened the coffers of massive companies like alphabet and fedex but drone delivery has yet to really take off despite drone delivery companies demonstrating technology that can enable automated takeoffs and landings flights spanning hundreds of miles and drones that pilot themselves drone deliveries by and large have been on a selective basis that has limited flights to companies with faa approval and subjected them to certain restrictions such as having to fly within the operator s line of sight yet the value proposition for drone delivery remains tantalizing early indications suggest that commercial drone deliveries will be far cheaper than car based services and they could also reduce the environmental impact of delivery so what s ahead for drone delivery modern shipper asked drone delivery ceos what s in store for the industry over the next five years so you can hear predictions straight from the folks taking delivery to the skies yariv bash ceo and co founder flytrex bash s company flytrex is focused on suburban deliveries and currently operates in north carolina where it delivers food and parcels directly to customers backyards in five years drone delivery will be a standard in on demand delivery the efficiency speed economic benefits and sustainability of drones will be embraced by retailers making it a key go to option for delivery at scale while traditional couriers are only able to make around two deliveries per hour by car a single drone operator can perform more than 10 deliveries per hour allowing everyone everywhere to enjoy the convenience of swift and sustainable on demand delivery as on demand services continue to gain momentum the desire for instant gratification will only increase as more consumers get used to the ease and convenience of ultrafast delivery out of toothpaste missing an ingredient need just the right tool burn your dinner and kids are famished any item can be delivered to your front door or backyard within five minutes anytime as drones gain traction in the delivery space traditional delivery methods along with all of their disadvantages will become less and less attractive leading to less congestion on the roads fewer accidents and less pollution drones are 100 electric dan o toole ceo and founder dronedek o toole and dronedek are the makers of the mailbox of the future a new kind of receptacle that can receive deliveries from drones as well as traditional methods within five years we believe you ll see drones whizzing through u s neighborhoods and office parks headed for smart mailboxes as commonly as you see delivery vans now the drone package delivery market is expected to reach 18 65 billion by 2028 according to the latest analysis by emergen research so we don t think this is fantastical at all we re one of the few companies thinking about where all those packages will end up dronedek solves the last inch of the last mile of package delivery with its smart mailbox which offers an app controlled climate controlled and most importantly secure receptacle dronedek smart mailboxes will be used by consumers as well as businesses with the first roll out coming in q2 2022 as drone delivery becomes more common we think the demand for secure receptacles like dronedek smart mailboxes will grow people just won t stand for their packages to be stolen as they are today we think smart mailboxes will be like cell phones something everyone will have or at least want within five years or sooner that will require relaxed regulations and we expect that to start happening in earnest next year related conor french general counsel zipline zipline has been a disruptor in drone delivery for years mainly homing in on humanitarian deliveries to rural and hard to reach areas put simply the future of drone delivery is more deliveries this year and particularly this holiday season we ve seen our existing logistics systems strained to their breaking point across industries there s a need for faster more agile more sustainable delivery options to augment and in some cases replace the usual trucks and vans we know technology is ready to meet this moment at zipline we ve proven that automated on demand delivery can be rolled out at national scale and we ve seen the impact that s possible for systems communities and individuals when it is now our industry is experiencing skyrocketing demand from companies across retail and health care looking to solve last mile delivery challenges offer contactless options provide faster deliveries or just serve their customers and patients more effectively over the next five years we ll continue to see this uptick in demand across new industries and use cases and we ll likely see regulatory progress from aviation authorities around the world eager to bring the benefits of autonomous aircraft to their residents the result widespread automated on demand deliveries that improve more people s lives we are only starting to scratch the surface of what s possible with this technology in the next five years this industry will truly take off cameron chell ceo draganfly chell s company draganfly nasdaq dpro has been making drones since the 90s before drone delivery was even on the public s radar and is now working with the drone racing league to advance drone delivery technology i predict that five years from now drones will be well on their way to being an integrated part of our consumer economy as well as critical infrastructure and services the underpinnings of drone airways and an integrated logistics system will be in place the entire platform will not be pervasive in five years but multiple major regional systems will be in operational mode critical services like ems disaster response and search and rescue will be in place in multiple areas as well as having yearly government budgets being allocated to expanding these services larger and more complex drone systems will be in the later stages of testing and the birth of a multibillion if not trillion dollar industry will be at hand the first real steps in this scaling are all about autonomy and integrated systems this along with regulation is moving forward but it still has a ways to go five years from now the basics of this system will be coming together and the dawn of the drone age will be evident and about to exponentially take off you may also like faction gets in on driverless vehicle action faa greenlights flytrex for 1 mile drone deliveries in

by john ward with clinical timing the small circuit board controlled paraffin heater i use during mild weather had an epi three days ago just a year and 16 hours after i bought it i ll leave all of you to work out the length of the guarantee without any help from me the appliance had been mumbling quite happily for ten minutes when it cut out and the screen displayed e09 a sort of cross between room 101 and error 404 orwell meets kafka while out for a stroll with solzhenitsyn the manual like everything else these days virtual said there must be a dust blockage probably in the bessemer sprocket loop connection throughput filter fig 14 so i disassembled the single incabloc warp booster connecting the bessemer sprocket loop connection throughput filter to the internalised paraffin splash feed and with a small paint brush removed five tiny bits of gunk repositioning the parts carefully avoiding the potential nightmare of warp loop in the splash feed see page 113 i switched the little chap back on again and he worked perfectly what you might ask is the moral of this story well not much actually because seven minutes later we were back to eo9 again and as a man who knows his paint brush from his bessemer sprocket i m here to tell you this usually means trouble so it was with a heavy heart and muttered latin oaths that your correspondent clicked on trouble shooting in the online manual if you ve never encountered 21st century after sales trouble shooting then your life has been blessed the title suggests a fun day out during which armed with a solid gold purdey one shouts pull and evil looking gremlins fly into the air to be smashed by both barrels it s not like that at all more accurately it s like stumbling by accident into a seminar called modern life for morons check if appliance is plugged in in which some attempt is made by the instructor to let light into the blair educated head this ends in failure whereupon the invigilator walks offstage and shoots himself thus he has no trouble in shooting himself but the trouble itself remains stubbornly unshot this coincides with the real life point at which the trouble shooting section opines as follows if the problem persists take the appliance back to your local dealer note how the manufacturer deftly absolves himself of all blame here by reassigning his trouble as something that is now your problem there was no trouble to shoot because it turned out to be a problem so over to you mr retailer except of course that i live in france and so be in no doubt it s my problem an honest manual under such circumstances would proffer the advice go out and buy another one put your gadget into a french retailer and you might just as well buy the bloody thing a first class ticket on the next cunard round the world cruise because it ll be more than eighty days before you see it again so armed with my 22 years experience of french service après vente this is what i did i took the plug out of its socket bade the heater goodnight and went off to bed the next day i used the wood burning wall insert instead and then yesterday i switched on the paraffin heater since when it has been functioning like the little angel it usually is the british pre war prime minister stanley baldwin was fond of remarking doing absolutely nothing is a perfectly valid strategy if you live in france it has always been the best course of action we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us but since covid19 that rule has changed as our warm october here turned into a freezing november i toddled off to my local diy store to purchase more paraffin bottles it was there i discovered that we are about to enter the age of double digit inflation for the bottle that cost 13 95 last february now weighed in at a whopping 23 50 this is south american banana republic stuff energy inflation is upon us and as usual the experts at the pay grade below the micro élite new order fail to understand its uniquely dangerous nature everything is connected there are two elementary mistakes being made by those who see only the trees now as opposed to the wooden floor it might later become the first is a simple mistake in basic arithmetic and we aren t talking pure maths here or exponential complexity surf around the web of herd opinion and you ll pick up this kind of fluff the historic plunge in global energy consumption in the early months of the covid 19 crisis last year drove the prices of many fuels to their lowest levels in decades but since then they have rebounded strongly mainly as a result of an exceptionally rapid global economic recovery global oil demand continues to recover from its 2020 lows and prices at the pump in many countries are at or near their highest levels in years companies around the world are expected to continue to draw on their oil stocks to help meet demand until the end of this year observe the highlights plunges to lowest levels in decades have somehow produced the highest levels in years furthermore with high oil stocks at the same time sorry oilco apologists but this is bs of the smelliest order a period of just ten months does not produce historic lows turning into historic highs especially when there s a glut of stocks what we re seeing is an energy sector facing very high costs of new exploration and dumb politicians pushing dumber alternative energy solutions milking the age old cow before she heads for the abattoir and they re being given permission to pull this stunt by the jerome powells and mario dragis of our new world because they want to see debt inflated away and cash devalued before the digital reset kicks in supply and demand folks supply and demand yes demand has been revitalised but supply is more than sufficient to meet it that will change if the 2022 2023 period continues to rip ahead with slightly overheated inflation but that s not what we re going to see this is where the second nightmare hasn t been factored in because unlike 1929 or 1972 the arrival of mass car manufacture and the internet respectively mean that energy inflation in 2021 drives everything nor after either of those two historical horrors was nothing but bandaid applied to the 2008 9 near disaster these are the only considerations that really matter bourses are obscenely overvalued and the bankers need an escape excuse they and their secret state allies need hyper inflation preferably accompanied by a war to excuse global theft and totalitarian control while making blocist debt disappear they need useful idiot radical green leftists to approve that control among their number are genocidal billionaire headcases who regard mechanised and transhuman developments as effectively rendering human drones expensive to feed and prone to violence and last but not least globalist business not only big pharma needs a guaranteed monopolous system of consumption whereby marketing overheads can be dumped in favour of top down quasi political regimented consumption energy consumption today is tied to every inflation typology exploration production innovation distribution competition media exposure and end consumer usage this represents a secular buddhist level of connection and interpendence never seen before in recorded history we are entering a brief mini epoch in which none of the costs outlined above can possibly be absorbed to produce a profit margin until such time as the top down quasi political regimented consumption defined above enables it that is our window of opportunity and it is the only one left for after that a world of plenty for the few who control intelligent but placid slaves is the only possible outcome one final point of drawing together before we part company today i cannot stress enough the degree to which we have arrived at where we are via an utter failure to complain about bad behaviour i see this very much as one of the major moral dilemmas of our age on the one hand the breezy freudian relativists preach the acceptance gospel of ok you were treated badly but for the sake of your mental health put it behind you and move on somehow these days if you don t deny the past you have no place in the future i could not disagree more moving on is another way of saying i don t care about the socio cultural ramifications we will never get a better world until we bring manipulative exploitation to book be that at the macro or micro level i am often accused of being obsessive frankly obsessives ensure everything from trains running on time to action against every kind of cruelty i m not saying everyone should be like me i merely observe that calling me obsessive is a veiled compliment i would replace with the word uncompromising
