the four day school week is spreading rapidly throughout missouri to make it easier to recruit and retain teachers but some experts argue the policy won t be enough to solve a teacher shortage problem there are 119 districts around the state that have transitioned to a four day week since 2010 at least 18 more districts are planning to make the transition next year adding up to 25 of all districts in missouri the policy is meant to recruit people like ellen weimer a high school math teacher at keytesville school district which transitioned to a four day week in 2019 weimer said the move was a key reason she came to the district last year she said having an extra day to prepare curriculum and instruction is helpful to new teachers like herself the extra day has been so beneficial for me to work on all the things that a seasoned teacher doesn t have to do as much because they re used to it weimer said i can only see it being helpful for other teachers as well who are new and need that extra extra day to prepare because that s been what i do with the day off normally along with the supply of teachers decreasing katnick said the demand to hire new teachers is increasing because of high turnover rates he said that missouri s rate of teacher retention after three years of employment is just over 60 and when supply is down and demand is up it creates a recipe for labor shortages annie jennemann columbia missourian more school districts in missouri are moving to a four day school week a crucial reason teachers are leaving education is stagnating salaries public school teachers were paid 6 less than other college educated workers in 1996 and the gap has grown to over 19 less than other college educated workers in 2019 according to a report from the economic policy institute teacher compensation is a significant issue in missouri the state ranks second to last in the country in teachers average starting salary of 33 234 a year according to a report from the national education association but the missouri legislature is looking to solve this problem in may the general assembly approved a bill to increase the minimum starting pay to 38 000 the policy could especially benefit rural teachers because their salaries are often less than teachers in suburban and urban areas keytesville superintendent josh shoemaker said the wage floor for teachers in his school district is 36 350 i m sitting here talking about a base pay of 36 350 which is one of the best in the area and let s be honest with a four year degree out of college that s minimal pay shoemaker said the state is slated to pay for 70 of the wage increase with local funds making up the rest jon turner a professor at missouri state university has been researching the four day school week in missouri for eight years turner said rural communities might struggle to raise the funds because they don t have the business tax revenue that other areas in the state have if you re looking at missouri where we generate money from is property tax with things like businesses and your property like cars combines and cows and the property that you own turner said if some rural districts struggle to come up with the money it could force them to push for school levies or consolidate and merge with other districts in recent years teachers are also leaving education because of increased pressure and negative public sentiment teachers face scrutiny about their curriculum with concerns of the way history race sexual orientation and gender are taught in schools turner said public opinion of teachers shifted dramatically during the pandemic when we first started the pandemic people working in schools were all heroes and boy did that change fast turner said i mean you went within six months and now everybody that works in schools is some kind of communist conspiracy theorist that s trying to steal your civil rights recruiting teachers while all school districts are having a hard time recruiting teachers attracting them to rural areas poses additional challenges the wage difference isn t the only factor hurting rural schools retention efforts keytesville superintendent josh shoemaker said the two biggest teacher recruitment challenges in his district are a lack of employment opportunities for the teacher s spouse and lack of housing starting in the late 1990s the country has pivoted to an economy that focuses more on providing services to customers rather than physical goods this transition has harmed rural economies that were founded on manufacturing and agriculture sarah low is a professor of regional economics at the university of missouri college of agriculture food natural resources low s research focuses on strategies to develop rural economies low said the number of businesses in rural missouri have shrunk because of significant population declines in rural areas when there are fewer businesses in rural areas it makes it harder to find a job if you re the spouse of a teacher low also said while rural areas often provide enough housing to meet demand the quality of housing isn t high enough to attract white collar professionals the rural housing stock tends to be 100 year old houses low said they don t have closets they don t have air conditioning and they most certainly don t have granite countertops because they would cost more than the house and the land itself missouri s rural communities also often don t have the gathering places and opportunities for social interaction compared to suburban and urban areas missouri sen karla eslinger r wasola worked in rural missouri education as a principal and superintendent of schools in ava and west plains she said it is difficult to attract young teachers because rural towns lack the social opportunities urban areas provide you think about the age group of the folks who are going into the profession they re 22 23 years old eslinger said the idea of living down in a small town with really not much socialization kinds of things it s tough to get them down there in the first place this story was originally published in the missouri business alert a

police say a 34 year old man was near the entrance to playo s nightclub and a 26 year old woman was found inside both were declared dead four others were wounded gary ind two people were killed and four others were wounded in a shooting at an indiana nightclub early sunday police said officers responding to reports of shots fired around 2 a m in gary southeast of chicago said they found two people who had been shot and were unresponsive a 34 year old man was near the entrance to playo s nightclub and a 26 year old woman was found inside police said both were declared dead after being taken to a local hospital four other people were also wounded including one who was in critical condition police said authorities did not release the victims names or information about what may have led up to the shooting they said multiple law enforcement agencies responded due to a large crowd that needed to be evacuated and the large number of victims this shooting comes amid a wave of gun violence and mass shootings one of which happened last weekend near a nightclub in tennessee three people were killed in that shooting and 14 others suffered gunshot wounds and other injuries on sunday senate bargainers announced a bipartisan framework responding to last month s mass shootings a modest breakthrough offering measured gun curbs and bolstered efforts to improve school safety and mental health programs the proposal falls far short of tougher steps long sought by president joe biden and many democrats even so if the accord leads to the enactment of legislation it would signal a turn from years of gun massacres that have yielded little but stalemate in congress
stonington five years after town officials decided not to enforce what initially appeared to be the town s prohibition of short term rentals in residential zones they are now considering possibly regulating the increasingly popular practice first selectwoman danielle chesebrough has announced the town will hold a series of community conversations this summer beginning monday june 20 from 5 30 to 7 30 p m in the velvet mill at 22 bayview ave the flyer for the event states it will offer opportunities for residents to share their ideas for how stonington can work to ensure a fair and balanced approach to short term rentals the forums come as other southeastern connecticut communities such a groton ledyard and noank decide how to deal with short terms rentals listed on sites such as airbnb and vrbo this has resulted in complaints from some residents about noise parties and traffic from what they say are commercial operations in residential neighborhoods other impacts include a reduction in long term rental stock and decreasing demand for hotel rooms chesebrough said last week that she has done a lot of research on the issue and talked to other communities about how they are dealing with it she said she hopes town officials will get some good ideas from residents at the forums that they can then include in proposed regulations she stressed the town has not yet developed a proposed regulation one could be presented at the second or third forum there are no easy answers but we have the time to now to take it on she said during last week s board of selectmen s meeting we re not going to fix it right now but we can take some steps that will lead to solution steps being taken in communities across the country include making owners of short term rentals register their operation obtain a permit or be subject to some sort of taxation or fines chesebrough said her office does receives complaints about short term rentals but it ebbs and flows she also pointed out that income from short term rentals helps some homeowners afford their taxes and mortgage payments in december 2016 a large crowd of short term renters and opponents of the practice attended a planning and zoning commission forum to tell members how they felt about the practice one masons island homeowner told the commission that his neighbor had suggested he might want to leave on weekends during the summer because there would groups of people renting his house next door two months later the planning and zoning commission decided that the town s zoning regulations do not regulate short term rentals and it would not enforce the violation notices the town had issued to people who rented out their homes former director of planning jason vincent said at the time it would be up to someone to propose an ordinance to regulate the practice that would then have to be approved by residents at a town meeting at the time planning staff had interpreted existing zoning regulations to mean that short term rentals of less than 30 days is not a permitted use in the town s residential zones complicating the issue is that for many years homes and cottages especially in waterfront communities such as lord s point and masons s island have been rented to people during the summer months in recent years short term rentals in mystic have become popular a search on sunday of stonington mystic rentals available on vrbo for sept 10 17 revealed 166 rentals those who can not attend the june 20 forum can send emails to director of economic and community development susan cullen at scullen stonington ct gov or chesebrough at dchesebrough stonington ct gov

food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and export bans have followed rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and rice a staple food in much of asia could be next industry watchers said the prices of many foods ranging from wheat and other grains to meat and oils have shot up that s been driven by a slew of factors including the rising cost of fertilizer and energy in the past year as well as the russia ukraine war food export bans or serious disruptions have included those from india wheat ukraine wheat oats and sugar among others and indonesia palm oil get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high according to the latest may data published last week to be sure rice production is still bountiful experts said but rising wheat prices and the generally higher costs of farming would make rice prices worth monitoring next we need to monitor rice prices going forward because rising wheat prices could lead to some substitution towards rice increasing demand and lowering existing stocks said sonal varma chief economist at japanese bank nomura risk of protectionism protectionist measures actually worsen price pressures at a global level for various reasons she told cnbc s street signs asia feed and fertilizer costs for farming are already rising and energy prices are adding to freight costs she added so there is a risk that we see more protectionism from countries said varma nevertheless she maintained that risks to rice are still low as global rice inventories are ample and harvests in india are expected to be good this summer russia s war on ukraine has driven up wheat prices both countries are major exporters of wheat and russia s invasion has disrupted farming and blocked grain exports from the country wheat prices have soared more than 50 since a year ago on monday of last week alone they jumped 4 after the russian military destroyed one of ukraine s largest grain exporting terminals according to reuters citing ukrainian authorities thailand and vietnam were in talks on a deal to increase the price of their rice exports according to a reuters report citing a thai government official in late may four exporters told reuters that rice traders have been buying more indian rice in the last two weeks according to a june 6 report right now i will be much more worried by india slapping an export ban on rice in the coming weeks as they were thinking about after wheat and sugar david laborde senior research fellow at the international food policy research institute told cnbc india and china are the world s top two producers of rice accounting for more than half of the global total according to the world economic forum vietnam is the fifth largest while thailand is in sixth place india imposed export bans on wheat in may citing a need to manage the overall food security of the country it also slapped restrictions on sugar just days after the wheat ban are price hikes preferable laborde said that a price increase would be far preferable to any export ban we should really differentiate between a price rise that compensates for higher costs and will benefit farmers and help them producing than an export ban that pushes prices up on world markets but pushes prices down on domestic markets he said nafees meah regional representative for south asia at the international rice research institute added that energy costs which have been rising globally are a big part of rice production costs so there is an argument to say if the market is indicating an increase in price then why shouldn t the farmers benefit from increased prices nafees told cnbc s squawk box asia but an increase in rice prices would badly affect many in asia which is the biggest consumer of the staple so in in the southeast asia pacific region countries like east timor laos cambodia and of course places like indonesia which very large population and many of whom are food insecure will be pretty badly affected if prices continue to rise and stay at these very high levels said nafees way above pre pandemic levels the u n s food price index showed prices are now 75 above pre pandemic levels said frederique carrier managing director and head of investment strategy for rbc wealth management pandemic related labor shortages and russia s invasion of ukraine have aggravated the situation by both curtailing food supply and pushing up energy prices even further she wrote in a june report about a third of food production costs are energy related carrier said fertilizer in particular is very energy intensive to produce and prices have soared since last year

downtrend resumes getty it was evident at the start of the week that it was going to be a challenge for the retreating stock market with the much anticipated consumer price index cpi on friday the averages had been holding the monthly pivots but the deterioration in the market s technical outlook by lunchtime on thursday was a reason to reduce risk this was supported by the last hour plunge on thursday but the massive plunge on friday was beyond expectations markets tom aspray viperreport com the selling was the heaviest in the dow jones transportation average as it was down 7 5 outpacing the 5 7 drop in the nasdaq 100 index ndx and the 5 1 decline in the s p 500 spx the ndx is now down 27 5 year to date ytd while the spx has dropped 18 2 another similar decline in the week ahead would drop more of the averages below 20 ytd as the weekly 4 3 drop in the ishares russell 2000 has moved it to down 19 4 ytd only the spdr gold trust gld gld was higher for the week up 1 1 and it is now slightly higher ytd 10 year t note yield tom aspray viperreport com two markets i focused on as the week started were the yield on the 10 year t note which had stayed below 3 that changed on monday at 3 038 and the yield ended the week at 3 156 the weekly yield had pulled back from its weekly starc band see arrow that was exceeded in early may the macds turned correctly positive at the start of the year and stayed positive during the pullback both macds have turned higher with next yield targets at 3 248 and then 3 500 i was also monitoring the volatility index vix as it was in a short term downtrend that is typically a positive for stocks last wednesday it was below 24 but spiked to a high of 29 63 on friday before closing at 27 79 with this week s fomc meeting retail sales the leading economic indicators and other key economic reports the pressure its likely to stay high on both the stock and bond market the higher than expected cpi report convinced traders and investors that inflation had not peaked and therefore assumed that the fed would have to raise rates higher and faster than previously thought that could be true but higher rates are unlikely to have an impact on inflation in the near future they are likely to weaken the economy which will eventually lower consumer prices higher rates in the weeks or months ahead are unlikely to change the price or demand for oil which is still pointing higher based on last month s technical review so what about the stock market last week s decline supports the view that the bounce from the may 20th low was just a bear market rally or a rebound within the overall downtrend i have been looking for a much stronger rally and the potential end to the market decline that is why risk management is so important as it limits the damage when your market view is wrong adding pressure to stocks in the week ahead may be a further decline in bitcoin btc as sunday s decline is consistent with my may outlook for a six to ten week decline spy tom aspray viperreport com the action last week identified the 417 44 as the spyder trust spy py spy initial resistance with the still declining 20 week ema at 423 55 there is more widely watched resistance in the 430 area as for support the may low at 380 54 and the 38 2 fibonacci support at 379 31 are the key levels to watch a daily close below these levels will point to the weekly starc band at 363 28 and then the 50 support at 348 21 the s p 500 advance decline line has dropped back below its wma after testing its downtrend line a as i mentioned previously a decline below the support at line b would be quite negative and signal a further downtrend the a d line has next support at the june 2021 low dashed line the spy is well below its corresponding low and is acting weaker than the a d line qqq tom aspray viperreport com the invesco qqq qqq trust qqq gapped lower friday and closed below the daily starc band another day or two below the starc band will favor either a rally or some sideways price action the may 30th low of 280 21 is next important support now that the 50 support from the march 2020 low of 164 40 has been broken the 61 8 support is at 257 73 there is initial resistance at 300 and then the 20 day ema at 303 68 there is additional resistance at 314 56 line a the nasdaq 100 a d line has reversed to the downside and looks ready to test the bullish divergence support at line d this support needs to hold and then a strong rally would be needed to support the potential bottoming formation the major downtrend line c needs to be overcome to signal a change in the intermediate term trend as i pointed out in early 2018 and early 2020 the stock market does not go up forever and the same is true on the downside the market sentiment is still too bearish in my opinion which in the past has led to a longer and stronger rally this week s survey from the american association of individual investors aaii should be quite interesting invesco s p 500 pure value tom aspray viperreport com so where should you be looking for new investments instead of the bond market at the end of bear markets or after major market corrections those stocks or etfs that are outperforming the s p 500 during the decline are often the new market leaders one such etf is the invesco s p 500 pure value rpv rpv which has a yield of 2 assets of 3 8 billion an expense ratio of 0 35 and 120 holdings according to morningstar it also has over 11 in the energy sector the monthly chart shows a positive upward sloping trading channel lines a and b the monthly starc band is at 96 51 with the rising 20 month ema at 75 94 the monthly relative performance rs completed its bottom formation in april as it moved above the resistance at line c the monthly obv has been above its wma since may 2020 and made a new high in may as for individual stocks one should look at those stocks that were higher on friday and higher last week this stockscharts link will take you to friday s best performers from the s p 500 as always before establishing new long positions one must consider the risk and where you will exit if the market does see another wave of selling
humanitarian operations take place in challenging contexts when a minute can make a difference between life and death stakeholders from international donors to local communities are hard pressed to make decisions quickly often with poor information and constrained budgets in the ukraine crisis while temporary homes for refugees were quickly found in european countries the need for more sustainable semi permanent solutions becomes clear as the crisis wears on households that were quick to welcome refugees in times of crisis may not be able to host them for more than a few months beyond a roof over their heads refugees need jobs and schools among other needs to get back on track moreover given how quickly refugees have been matched with hosts mismatch can happen and they might even end up worse off e g subjected to harassment or trafficking the lack of preparedness means that solutions which are not necessarily sustainable have to be improvised along the way more often than not the immediate post disaster emergency portrayed in the media are but the tip of the iceberg in addition to addressing short term needs to relieve acute suffering humanitarian operations must balance the long term need to sustainably recover and to strengthen local communities in reality humanitarian crises last more than nine years on average but does sustainability stand a chance in the face of the urgency of disaster response is there room for sustainability sustainability as defined in the un s sustainable development goals sdgs covers a range of economic social and environmental factors thankfully there is growing awareness that it is fundamentally impossible to meet the sdgs if some people are left behind in fact the humanitarian development gap has been recognised for decades since the mid 1990s the fields of humanitarian operations and sustainable operations have formed the cornerstone of my research agenda this culminated in a workshop in 2019 on how can we make humanitarian operations more sustainable as i transitioned to emeritus professor the workshop co organised with charles j corbett from ucla anderson school of business and alfonso j pedraza martinez from the kelly school of business brought together over 100 academics logistics practitioners in humanitarian organisations hos and sustainability managers from industry during the workshop we demonstrated how sustainability could be better integrated into humanitarian operations in spite of the tension between immediate and long term needs given that humanitarian operations span the entire disaster management cycle hos can and have to operate in more sustainable ways in each phase of the cycle this requires stakeholders including hos donors and watchdog organisations to think differently new perspectives make a world of difference in the 2010 earthquake in haiti the influx of donated bottled water created mountains of plastic bottles that cluttered drains and caused flooding after heavy rains how did good intentions go so wrong haiti s experience highlights the importance of better alignment of humanitarian and environmental imperatives at the core of this problem is material convergence when an avalanche of in kind donations arrive on site in the aftermath of a disaster better logistical coordination among hos could have prevented the second disaster in haiti in most disasters water is critical only during the first two or three days before quickly becoming a low priority item the pan american health organization classifies donations as either urgent high priority low priority or non priority with this knowledge and with better coordination improving material convergence can lead to reduced waste ideally donors would not contribute not donations in kind but cash that hos can use to purchase the most needed relief items in the next best scenario logistical support could prevent non priority items from entering the disaster area such as by sorting the items in the donors home countries before shipping there would be an appropriate level of coordination that ensures that relief items are sent to a specific receiving organisation with a bill of lading or cargo list detailing the items in the package relevant local information from the disaster area could also ensure that priority items are in the most appropriate packaging such as water in 10 litre bottles instead of small bottles long term vs short term perspectives better planning and coordination cannot happen if stakeholders do not recognise that rather than a single event the entire humanitarian operation as detailed in the disaster management cycle consists four phases preparedness response rehabilitation and mitigation first funders need to recognise that most funding systems pose a barrier to capacity building in the longer term when donors earmark funds for emergency response the same funds cannot be used for long term investments such as improving coordination between local and global hos unfortunately such investments in preparedness are typically categorised as overhead and hence frowned upon by potential donors overcoming these barriers requires discussion with local communities hos local governments international donors and other stakeholders at the operational level hos need to recognise the importance of pivoting to a different time scale when needed during the ebola virus outbreaks the world health organization s who operating model was designed to stop the outbreak within three months but the ebola virus programmes became longer and the operating model must change initially the who rented 600 vehicles but buying them might have been wiser and acquiring motorcycles would have helped them to reach rural areas with no paved roads more efficiently in fact merging supply chains for short term emergency response and long term operations has enabled the united nations high commissioner for refugees to expand its global warehouse network while reducing cost and lead time this involves allowing stocks earmarked for long term operations to be used in emergencies and for stocks left over from emergencies to be used in longer term operations while this fruitful endeavour has led to both cost and time efficiency it requires close collaboration between relief and development operations global vs local when disaster strikes hos do not always adequately include local communities even when these communities have invested in disaster preparedness in fact local knowledge is key to ensuring sustainability a great deal of work remains to be done to improve coordination between global hos and local non governmental organisations ngos for global hos to work more effectively with local hos they must accept that the people who live in a disaster area know the local conditions best for example dark bread was shipped internationally to albania which was not favoured by the local population for months international humanitarian workers were eating dark bread at every meeting to avoid throwing them away the voices of beneficiaries must be heard to implement sustainable solutions that respect their culture and dignity local volunteers are also immediately operational and familiar with the context as we have seen in the ukrainian crisis local or global must again be addressed in procuring the necessary relief items although local procurement might be more sustainable it is often stymied by the effectiveness of the global machinery using local procurement would require better interfaces between local and global organisations that operate using different technologies the more standardised offering by global hos would reduce the need for coordination and detailed information which could result in more efficient response however if disaster response is too standardised it may not match local demands and would create more waste greater adaptation to local needs means that items are earmarked for specific populations which reduces the flexibility achievable by pre positioning supplies this trade off between the benefits and disadvantages of standardisation remains an important topic for operations management research navigating trade offs for sustainability in many ways tough trade offs are required if sustainability is to be integrated in humanitarian response at the end of the day a key deterrent is cost how should short term and long term damage and costs be measured and compared sustainability in humanitarian operations involves diverse stakeholders ranging from global donors to local beneficiaries stakeholders need to think differently about the balance between short term and long term interventions and the role of local vs global organisations at the same time their decisions and action are often driven by their own metrics and incentives therefore it is important that they set the appropriate metrics and incentives with a long term perspective such that they do not miss the woods for the trees while carbon footprint is a key measure of sustainability in supply chains other environmental aspects may be more relevant in the humanitarian setting there are no clear standards for measuring societal impact even if intergenerational justice is often mentioned there is a need for more benchmarking in the humanitarian sector and those benchmarks can be more integrated in decision making overall when humanitarian operations are seen through the lens of the disaster management cycle there are long term actions that can improve their sustainability most of these actions must be put in place either before a crisis or during the long term rehabilitation that follows the immediate response it is more feasible to incorporate sustainability during preparation rehabilitation and mitigation than during the immediate response to disaster

washington a bipartisan group of senators said sunday that it has an agreement in principle on gun control legislation though the lawmakers did not provide specific and detailed legislation families are scared and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities a group of 20 senators said in a statement that outlined their plan ten of the signers were republicans the number needed to break a gop filibuster on the package the group said its plan increases needed mental health resources improves school safety and support for students and helps ensure dangerous criminals and those who are adjudicated as mentally ill can t purchase weapons lawmakers who have long sought to tighten the nation s gun laws redoubled their efforts after the recent mass killings at an elementary school in uvalde texas saturday protests we re angry thousands to rally against gun violence saturday in march for our lives protests corporate support ceos from more than 200 companies including levi strauss lululemon urge senate to pass gun safety legislation senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y called the agreement a good first step and added that we must move swiftly to advance this legislation because if a single life can be saved it is worth the effort the proposal is vastly more limited than changes pushed by president joe biden to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines add universal background checks and raise the minimum age to buy guns to 21 years old still he urged immediate passage in both chambers obviously it does not do everything that i think is needed biden said but it reflects important steps in the right direction and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to pass congress in decades biden on gun reform joe biden pressed by jimmy kimmel on gun control can t you issue an executive order biden s wish list biden wants action on guns even if he doesn t get everything he asked for white house senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky issued a tepid statement praising the work of negotiators but not specifically endorsing their proposal i continue to hope their discussions yield a bipartisan product that makes significant headway on key issues like mental health and school safety respects the second amendment earns broad support in the senate and makes a difference for our country he said the senators who signed the statement included the four who led the negotiations chris murphy d conn john cornyn r texas thom tillis r n c and kyrsten sinema d ariz the others are richard blumenthal d conn roy blunt r mo cory booker d n j richard burr r n c bill cassidy r la susan collins r maine chris coons d del lindsey graham r s c martin

for the republicans who signed the proposal four of the 10 gop senators are retiring this year another five are not up for re election until 2026 the 10th romney often goes his own way murphy an especially vocal proponent of new gun laws since the 2012 mass killings at an elementary school in his home state of connecticut called the deal a breakthrough agreement on gun violence the first in 30 years that will save lives what s in the gun legislation deal the group said its proposal includes support for state crisis intervention investment in children and family mental health services protections for victims of domestic violence funding for school based mental health and supportive services funding for school safety resources clarification of definition of federally licensed firearms dealer telehealth investments penalties for straw purchasing the plan also calls for an enhanced review process for young gun buyers for buyers under 21 years of age requires an investigative period to review juvenile and mental health records including checks with state databases and local law enforcement the statement said house action on gun bills house lawmakers voted last week to raise from 18 to 21 the minimum age to buy semi automatic rifles following a day of poignant testimony from survivors of mass shootings including a fourth grader a mother taking care of her wounded son and parents who lost a 10 year old daughter the house approved on a party line vote the age change as part of a package of gun reform measures that also would clamp down on gun trafficking ban bump stocks and require safe storage of firearms the bill known as the protecting our kids act heads to the senate where it s not expected to pass because republicans have enough votes to block gun legislation rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y told cnn s state of the union on sunday that all options on the table must be looked at closely regarding guns i think we need to really look at the text and once we look at that text i think we ll be able to see if this legislation has been responsibly put together and i hope it is my hope that it has been ocasio cortez said she hopes to vote yes on the gun legislation deal announced sunday from a group of senators rep chris jacobs r n y a longtime supporter of gun ownership is in favor of some gun controls including raising the minimum age to purchase guns he grew up in buffalo though he does not represent the city so i m going to do all i can i have to in my heart of hearts think all i can do to make sure that no other community has to experience what happened in my city and what happened with all those beautiful children down in uvalde he said reaction from both sides the national rifle association did not comment in detail saying in a statement that it does not take positions on frameworks and adding that we will make our position known when the full text of the bill is available for review the nra also said it will continue to oppose any effort to insert gun control policies initiatives that override constitutional due process protections and efforts to deprive law abiding citizens of their fundamental right to protect themselves and their loved ones into this or any other legislation vice president kamala harris praised the bipartisan group of senators who put the safety gun proposal together on sunday calling it an important step toward saving lives this gun safety proposal is an important step toward saving lives harris said while it does not reflect everything we need to do i applaud senator chris murphy and the bipartisan group of leaders who came together to put this forward enough is enough this is a huge step for gun safety aspen fain a kentucky students demand action volunteer said in a statement fain added that young people will keep fighting until this deal is done and look forward to the day we are celebrating in washington d c instead of begging our lawmakers to keep us safe contributing

20 senators announce outline of bipartisan deal to reform u s gun laws washington cbs news a bipartisan group of 20 senators including 10 republicans announced on sunday the outline of a deal to reform the nation s gun laws a breakthrough after weeks of negotiations sparked by the mass shootings in buffalo new york and uvalde texas today we are announcing a commonsense bipartisan proposal to protect america s children keep our schools safe and reduce the threat of violence across our country families are scared and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities the coalition said in a statement the agreement would provide incentives for states to pass so called red flag laws which the group calls state crisis intervention orders boost mental health resources provide funding for school safety resources clarify the definition of federally licensed firearms dealer and crack down on criminals who illegally straw purchase and traffic guns it would also expand background checks for firearms buyers under 21 by requiring an investigative period to review juvenile and mental health records convicted domestic violence abusers and people subject to domestic violence restraining orders would also now be included in the national instant criminal background check system closing what is called the boyfriend loophole most importantly our plan saves lives while also protecting the constitutional rights of law abiding americans the senators said in a joint statement we look forward to earning broad bipartisan support and passing our commonsense proposal into law if passed the plan would represent the most significant update to the nation s gun laws in nearly three decades although the provisions fall far short of what democrats have proposed in the wake of recent mass shootings and what president biden has advocated for the framework was announced on the sixth anniversary of the shooting at pulse nightclub in orlando florida where 49 people were killed the democratic senators who signed onto the proposal are richard blumenthal of connecticut cory booker of new jersey chris coons of delaware martin heinrich of new mexico mark kelly of arizona angus king of maine an independent who caucuses with the democrats joe manchin of west virginia chris murphy of connecticut kyrsten sinema of arizona debbie stabenow of michigan the republican signatories include john cornyn of texas roy blunt of missouri richard burr of north carolina bill cassidy of louisiana susan collins of maine lindsey graham of south carolina rob portman of ohio mitt romney of utah thom tillis of north carolina pat toomey of pennsylvania the support from the 10 gop senators ensures that if all 50 democrats back the plan and the republicans maintain their backing it can advance in the senate once introduced as legislation mr biden thanked the bipartisan group for their tireless work on crafting the plan and said it must swiftly pass both chambers of congress obviously it does not do everything that i think is needed but it reflects important steps in the right direction and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to pass congress in decades he said in a statement with bipartisan support there are no excuses for delay and no reason why it should not quickly move through the senate and the house each day that passes more children are killed in this country the sooner it comes to my desk the sooner i can sign it and the sooner we can use these measures to save lives senate majority leader chuck schumer pledged to put the bill on the floor as soon as possible once legislative text is finalized a process that could take several weeks after an unrelenting wave of gun related suicides and homicides including mass shootings the senate is poised to act on commonsense reforms to protect americans where they live where they shop and where they learn he said in a statement we must move swiftly to advance this legislation because if a single life can be saved it is worth the effort the framework schumer said is a good first step to ending the persistent inaction to the gun violence epidemic that has plagued our country and terrorized our children for far too long senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said the proposal announced show the value of dialogue and cooperation and said he supports the ongoing negotiations but stopped short of endorsing the framework outright i continue to hope their discussions yield a bipartisan product that makes significant headway on key issues like mental health and school safety respects the second amendment earns broad support in the senate and makes a difference for our country he said in a statement led by murphy and cornyn the senators began working last month on efforts to find common ground on reforms to gun laws in response to the massacres at a tops grocery store in buffalo and an elementary school in uvalde which together left 31 people including 19 children dead while prior attempts at passing gun control legislation have failed senators involved in the latest round of negotiations were optimistic they would reach an agreement on a plan that would garner support from at least 10 republicans whose backing is needed in order for legislation to advance in the 50 50 senate supportive of the senate s efforts mr biden continued to pressure congress to take legislative action to harden gun laws in the wake of a spate of mass shootings that shocked the nation while the president has advocated for lawmakers to reinstate the federal ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines or raise the minimum purchasing age for those firearms from 18 to 21 and strengthen background checks among other measures the senate has instead been working toward a more narrow proposal that would have gop support separately the house last week passed a package of bills that raises the age to buy a semi automatic weapon from 18 to 21 years old bans large capacity magazines incentivizes safe storage of firearms and establishes requirements regulating storage of guns on residential premises and builds on the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms regulatory ban on bump stocks which allow semi automatic rifles to fire more rapidly
for more than a year democratic lawmakers and like minded advocates have pleaded with joe biden to create a gun czar to address the epidemic of violence each time the president s team pushed back with force contending it has the perfect person already in place someone with command over the issue and extraordinary access to the president himself that person is susan rice as director of the domestic policy council rice leads a team of roughly a dozen staffers examining ways to push through modest gun reforms should congress again falter and explore new executive orders even if lawmakers succeed her ascendence to the role of point person on guns marks the latest chunk of policy turf over which she has claimed jurisdiction joining a sprawling portfolio that stretches from policing and racial justice to student loan debt immigration and health care policy including a prime piece of protecting abortion rights the scope of her fiefdom is as remarkable as how she managed to secure it having eschewed a public facing role rice has relied on a combination of internal maneuvering and bureaucratic know how to place herself at the nerve center of some of the fiercest debates roiling washington and she s further cemented her status with the president in the process rice and biden meet multiple times a week as the president prepared for his recent prime time address on guns she joined him on several occasions in his residence senior aides say biden s trust in her is so profound that she can see him whenever she needs to i ve seen it a recently departed senior white house official said of the relationship you see it in the meetings you see how he talks about her in meetings even when she s not around in interviews with 21 current and 13 former white house and administration staffers along with two dozen officials on capitol hill and from across the party and advocacy worlds rice is described as an underappreciated political operator a pragmatist consumed with putting points on the board and a process obsessed micromanager she personally goes through and edits her staff s typos in the memos they draft rice s elevated stature in the west wing has come with fierce loyalty from colleagues and praise so superlative laden that it borders on deification more recently it has led to speculation inside the white house that she will succeed ron klain should he leave the chief of staff post rice has privately told people in recent days that she has no interest in the job describing herself as a policy person at heart there is a reason that she is the only person in american history to have led both the white house s national security council and its domestic policy council klain said she has unique talents intellect and determination to get results but her style has also irritated lawmakers and high ranking officials on capitol hill to some former colleagues and outside advocates rice has come to personify a kind of risk averse incremental approach to policy making that they fear falls far short of addressing the country s needs and will ill serve democrats in the midterms and elections beyond rice is seen as a domestic policy lightweight and a block to any good things that happen to cross her desk said the leader of one progressive organization who asked to withhold their name out of fear of angering rice and the white house so everybody who wants to do big things has a vested interest in her desk being as empty as possible regardless of one s views on her rice s rise resembles one of the great lazarushian tales in modern politics she was too hot to touch even for some in her own party by the end of the obama years having become the chief protagonist in republicans investigations into the attacks on the u s consulate in benghazi she weighed running for the u s senate in maine then saw her stock rise as an alternate to presumptive frontrunner kamala harris during biden s veepstakes but both those prospects fizzled and with little chance of being nominated for a senate confirmed position there was uncertainty about what her next step would be in less than two years time she s become one of the more influential domestic policy operatives of her generation sparking another question what will be her encore i ve been in the cabinet i ve been national security adviser i ve been domestic policy adviser i feel pretty good about my professional trajectory and if i leave government and never come back and do other things that challenge me in different ways that s good rice said in a rare interview if i feel a need to come back and there s a role i think i can contribute to and i m excited about doing it i leave open that possibility too she added i honestly haven t answered for myself the question of is this the last thing i want to do in government or not and i don t feel any sense of urgency to answer that rice is a creature of washington she grew up in the nation s capital and was the valedictorian at her private girls school there before attending stanford university and becoming a rhodes scholar international affairs always seemed to be her calling during the clinton years she served on the national security council and when barack obama was elected she decamped to new york to become u s ambassador to the united nations she was poised to be obama s nominee for secretary of state to replace hillary clinton but withdrew from consideration amid fear the confirmation process would become a vehicle for relitigating benghazi even before the 2020 veepstakes her foreign policy experience was still being sought rice helped informally advise a handful of democratic presidential candidates running in the primary including harris taking their frequent calls and responding to questions about national security the idea for her to take all that history and pivot to domestic policy was first broached in conversations during the biden transition about what type of role she could conceivably play either in the cabinet or elsewhere in the white house the concerns were obvious she had three decades of experience in international affairs there would be a learning curve but those who ve worked closely with her viewed rice as possessing the right skill set the most important element of this job is the ability to move the process within the government and that is the hardest part that is the part that requires the most experience and expertise said cecilia muñoz who headed the dpc under obama helped lead the biden transition and spoke with rice when she considered the position this is somebody who was going to have zero learning curve with respect to how to make the process work during those early discussions rice made clear that she envisioned the dpc operating differently than in the past she pushed for the council s stature to be raised and for there to be four senior deputies who would allow the team to drill down on several fronts simultaneously rather than shuttle between major issues she got the structure she wanted but that centralization came with a cost rice has struggled at times to cultivate close relationships in congress lawmakers have complained that she can be short with them during one on one conversations and dismissive of the role congress plays in developing policy people with knowledge of the matter said there is no effort at charming the hill coming from susan rice one person with knowledge said adding that it s an open secret among democratic staffers that when rice gets involved in an issue the process is bound to become more difficult in one tone setting episode at the beginning of the administration rice grew frustrated with senate democrats over a perceived delay in getting miguel cardona confirmed as education secretary going as far as to air her complaints directly to sen patty murray d wash who chaired the committee in charge of his nomination a person with knowledge of the back and forth said the incident was memorable for rice s willingness to confront a senior democrat so early on in the administration and because it was eventually discovered that the delay was the fault of the white house which had simply been slow to file necessary paperwork others downplayed any distance between dpc and the hill pointing to the scores of meetings by one count more than 130 that rice has participated in with members during last year s burst of congressional negotiations on policing and social and climate spending rice spoke with several lawmakers a day rep jim clyburn d s c a close rice ally asked her to brief his whips meeting and she touched base with progressives moderates and some republicans such as rep liz cheney r wyo before cheney was removed from gop leadership i have not found anything to be dissatisfied with clyburn said calling himself one of rice s biggest fans i have full faith and confidence in her as a human being and as a professional sen michael bennet d colo another lawmaker close with rice countered the notion that she s on the outs with senators in their first conversation after she took the dpc job he talked about including the child tax credit expansion in biden s covid relief bill at a time when it was uncertain if it would be in there i think i sent her the longest text message i ever sent anybody on a sunday night and i woke up the next morning and it was in the plan said bennet i think she had a lot to do with that the debate over gun policy however has added a layer of strain to the rice hill relations democrats led by reps joe neguse of colorado and lucy mcbath of georgia have argued that the president needs to appoint a director of gun violence prevention sen chris murphy d conn a leading party voice on guns has echoed their call while those demands are not explicit critiques of the job rice is doing the clear implication is that they believe housing the policy response inside the dpc is insufficient as one democratic lawmaker put it rice says the right things to them during meetings but then action on guns is pushed aside for other policies so far the white house isn t budging officials note that biden has signed four packages on gun violence reduction through executive order outpacing the previous administrations at this point in their histories they maintain that if not for rice making issues like community violence intervention a priority far less would have been done already and they say she s looking closely at how they could do more that is just impossible work to do because it is so hard to make progress on gun violence through executive action said white house counsel dana remus who has worked closely with rice but she and her team have been so creative on how to make progress rice is tough and blunt say those who have worked with her through the years she is the opposite of a lofty idealist one aide called her a process perfectionist others described her as overly rigorous socratic and really academic she s no bullshit you always know where you stand with her she s very decisional said a former white house official she just doesn t really suffer fools compiling rice s so called decision packages are a vivid illustration of her approach to the job the thick documents have taken on quasi legendary status inside the dpc they lay out an issue the policy background and where each cabinet secretary stands on them rice has been known to personally log phone calls to the cabinet to fact check the documents and comb them for typos occasionally she and her staff will go through as many as a dozen variations of the packages before signing off she s not the friendliest person you ve ever come across a former senior administration official who worked with rice said but i think she s also respectful rice s toughness can manifest itself in different ways one is her notoriously sharp tongue and proclivity for profanity that intimidates some and endears her to others we ve been in the situation room we ve been in the cabinet room we ve been in each other s houses and she s a person who is not afraid to express her opinions in as direct a way as possible former attorney general eric holder said last year as rice began steering the council she s strategic in the use of but if there were a guy saying these things this would not be a reportable thing the other is in her territorialism rice bristles at those in the administration who she believes are encroaching on her turf she and her staff have issued reminders to others in the white house that paper needs to be run by dpc beforehand they ve thrown brush back pitches at vp staff on maternal mortality and voting rights she s like why is this person proposing policy we are the policy makers and that person is already at the table said another white house official the boundaries of rice s coverage area have grown in time her office has been involved in addressing mental health and efforts to ban menthol cigarettes expand second chance opportunities for people incarcerated and address racial and ethnic bias in home appraisals progressives believe she has used that power to weaken the link between the dpc and the liberal intellectual community that spent the last several years crafting the party s most ambitious policy proposals among other things they accuse rice of opposing broad based student debt forgiveness but unlike some of her colleagues who have warned against any debt relief on grounds that it would be inflationary rice has made it clear to colleagues that she supports offering income capped debt relief to the vast majority of borrowers and according to two white house officials she s been appalled at press coverage that suggests she s betraying her family s legacy by standing in the way of broader relief her late mother lois rice helped design the federal pell grant system sometimes we joke about how she s the only one fighting for advocating for debt relief when she s painted as against it a white house official said randi weingarten the president of the american federation of teachers and one of the most high profile progressives pushing the white house to embrace an expansive student debt cancellation plan said rice is a pragmatist but she also argued that it has boosted her standing in the west wing even as it s frustrated outside advocates and lawmakers she s asking advocates to not just advocate for their side but be able to answer the hard questions that will inevitably come up and i think that surprises people said weingarten if you re not used to it it s very daunting it s been on immigration policy not student loan relief where rice has found herself most at odds with people inside the administration and the party s liberal wing soon after joining the administration rice concluded that many of the administration s immigration specialists weren t suited to running the crisis level response needed to manage the record number of migrants arriving at the border two former officials said she complained that they were unresponsive to biden s concerns ultimately opting to bring in an outside adviser obama era national security official amy pope to coordinate the effort rice also butted heads with department of health and human services personnel early on she felt hhs secretary xavier becerra lacked relevant experience on the issues and was hesitant to get in there and try and some dpc staff saw becerra as worried about his own political exposure to the issues at the border according to a former official who worked closely with rice hhs has disputed the criticism leveled at becerra pointing to his extensive work on immigration issues over more than two decades as a member of congress people familiar with the dynamics at the time said she also perceived harris as ducking responsibility for addressing the border surge she didn t have a lot of patience for that and felt like making distinctions that were cutting it too fine the same former official said an additional point of contention was over the number of unaccompanied children that could be transferred into hhs shelters with limited shelters available rice pushed hhs to exceed its traditional capacity limits to get more migrant children out of the sparse border facilities at the center of the immigration crisis matters again came to a head over the administration s plan to lift title 42 the trump era pandemic rule designed to slow the spread of covid 19 colleagues said rice didn t agree with lifting the order warning it would be inconsistent to open up the border when the administration was telling americans how dangerous the virus and being unvaccinated was the tensions simmered for months until a judge made the matter moot by saying the administration did not follow proper protocol in ending the order the white house has tried to downplay discord in its ranks in an interview homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas said rice brought objectivity to the issue because she remains relatively new to immigration he called her eager to dive into the work noting she immersed herself in the operational challenges of setting up new hhs shelters and the need to speed up reunifying migrant children with their qualified u s sponsors she just asks questions many what ifs said mayorkas and really quite frankly strengthens not only the development of policy but the implementation of policy another senior administration official however was more frank in an assessment of rice s role when permitted to speak anonymously if you asked me what the white house vision is for immigration and migration and the border i couldn t tell you the senior official said for rice it always comes back to punitive measures to deter migrants a white house official pushed back on that sentiment in a statement saying the president s robust affirmative immigration agenda from expanding legal migration channels to speeding up the asylum process and providing more opportunities for temporary workers speaks for itself rice the official said has been a great champion of all of it for all the high profile issues on which she s involved rice s biggest success to date may be in helping draft the long sought executive order that takes a step in addressing racism and police accountability the process began after negotiations over police reform blew up in congress rice authored the decision memo on the matter which was no easy lift she needed to craft something that would be amenable to law enforcement organizations civil rights groups and the families of people killed or injured by police it grew more complicated after an early draft leaked making the process 10 000 times harder as remus rice s partner in putting the deal together put it jim pasco the executive director for the fraternal order of police said his group was pretty upset since the leak was at odds with his group s understanding of what the executive orders would look like but rice called him on a sunday and asked for a restart with the promise of a tighter group of negotiators and a pledge they operate in the cone of silence you can say whatever you want you can spit on the document you can throw up on the document she told him to which pasco replied if they did their jobs they d both want to vomit on the damn order after biden signed the order in late may rice made sure her staff got a photo with the president and harris afterwards she invited aides to a small happy hour she planned on the second gentleman s balcony staff clamored to take another photo this one with rice herself it was a moment of celebration in an administration that has had few of late it was also for those involved validation of their work and of their boss approach at dpc blunt process heavy and determined to make progress even slightly i knew she was a real tough cookie and prickly at that i came into it expecting it s all going to be knock down and drag out pasco recalled but while she was every bit as tough a negotiator as i d ever heard she was i actually enjoyed the give and take with her because of her manner

commentary for years we have read that it s important for the federal reserve and the major central banks to push the limits of monetary policy to boost growth and jobs monetary policy stood at the forefront of all recovery plans in 2008 quantitative easing seemed enormous but the subsequent incremental plans have made that stimulus package virtually irrelevant since 2008 each new government spending plan had to be larger if it wasn t at least a couple trillion dollars it didn t even make the headlines as for monetary policy limits were surpassed almost every five years negative real and even nominal rates trillions in new money supply and different purchase programs that included private debt and even in the case of japan exchange traded funds etfs since the pandemic started in march 2020 until may 2020 central banks and governments had unveiled more than 15 trillion of stimulus equivalent to 17 percent of the global economy according to reuters in only three months it was called the monetary bazooka however once the reopening of the economy was fully in place most of these plans continued central banks alone added 9 trillion to their balance sheets to reach a combined 24 trillion size according to bloomberg this added to the fiscal response which mckinsey called the 10 trillion rescue made the already astronomical figure of combined fiscal and monetary stimulus mentioned before rocket to more than 20 trillion in barely nine months the monetary and fiscal bazooka has backfired massively it was so large that now policymakers are surprised at the aggressiveness of market reactions to small rate hikes but it is normal the leverage and excess built in portfolios and investors bets is enormous and most market participants see how growth estimates plummet and inflation expectations soar stagflation is now more than just a distant risk the world bank has clearly mentioned the risk of stagflation as global growth is expected to slump from 5 7 percent in 2021 to 2 9 percent in 2022 a figure that is massively below the 4 1 percent that the bank had anticipated in january it has slashed the expectations of u s gdp growth by 1 2 percent for 2022 and 0 2 percent in 2023 from their january prediction for the euro area it s even worse as the recovery was also slower with a slash in gdp growth expectations of 1 7 percent and 0 2 for 2023 from the january outlook as for inflation estimates just soared the percentage of countries with inflation above target rose to 90 percent in developed economies and 75 percent in emerging and developing economies according to the world bank s p ratings has also warned recently that the global food shock may last for years not months now after the largest stimulus plan was implemented the boomerang effect is evident higher inflation and weaker growth but neither central banks can normalize quickly enough due to the risks of a market and sovereign debt contagion nor do governments want to reduce spending so demand destruction is likely to be the only option to curb inflation in the united states demand destruction is now tangible real wages are falling in all income groups as jason furman professor of practice at harvard points out the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index fell sharply to a record low reading of 50 2 down from a may reading of 58 4 while consensus expected a 59 reading according to marketwatch it s too late now the damage to the global economy is too large and now mainstream economists are only finding ways to justify the disaster by blaming everything except the excess of government and central bank stimuli of 2020 this doesn t mean that some targeted measures shouldn t have been implemented as we mentioned in this column a supply shock should have been addressed with supply side measures lower taxes and specific programs for small businesses and low income families the enormity of the problem created will likely take months to solve governments don t want to cut spending and central banks rate hike plans still leave them significantly behind the curve and far from normalization so the demand correction is likely to come from the private sector starting with consumers losing wages in real terms and their savings with 8 percent inflation in the united states and europe workers with a salary are losing close to one month of wages every 12 months like all stimulus plans the backlash will be suffered by the middle class and the same families that governments aimed to protect with massive money printing monetary policy doesn t solve structural problems fiscal policy may have worsened them views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

with r r mm about multiple myeloma mm multiple myeloma is a deadly blood cancer that often infiltrates the bone marrow causing anemia kidney failure immune problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in remission most patients will inevitably enter the relapsed or refractory stage as there s currently no cure as a result there is a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the united states mm accounts for nearly 2 of all cancer cases and more than 2 of cancer related deaths according to frost sullivan the number of new mm cases in the united states rose from 30 300 in 2016 to 32 300 in 2020 and is expected to increase to 37 800 by 2025 additionally the total number of patients diagnosed with mm increased from 132 200 in 2016 to 144 900 in 2020 and is expected to rise to 162 300 by

food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and export bans have followed rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and rice a staple food in much of asia could be next industry watchers said the prices of many foods ranging from wheat and other grains to meat and oils have shot up that s been driven by a slew of factors including the rising cost of fertilizer and energy in the past year as well as the russia ukraine war food export bans or serious disruptions have included those from india wheat ukraine wheat oats and sugar among others and indonesia palm oil get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high according to the latest may data published last week to be sure rice production is still bountiful experts said but rising wheat prices and the generally higher costs of farming would make rice prices worth monitoring next we need to monitor rice prices going forward because rising wheat prices could lead to some substitution towards rice increasing demand and lowering existing stocks said sonal varma chief economist at japanese bank nomura risk of protectionism protectionist measures actually worsen price pressures at a global level for various reasons she told cnbc s street signs asia feed and fertilizer costs for farming are already rising and energy prices are adding to freight costs she added so there is a risk that we see more protectionism from countries said varma nevertheless she maintained that risks to rice are still low as global rice inventories are ample and harvests in india are expected to be good this summer russia s war on ukraine has driven up wheat prices both countries are major exporters of wheat and russia s invasion has disrupted farming and blocked grain exports from the country wheat prices have soared more than 50 since a year ago on monday of last week alone they jumped 4 after the russian military destroyed one of ukraine s largest grain exporting terminals according to reuters citing ukrainian authorities thailand and vietnam were in talks on a deal to increase the price of their rice exports according to a reuters report citing a thai government official in late may four exporters told reuters that rice traders have been buying more indian rice in the last two weeks according to a june 6 report right now i will be much more worried by india slapping an export ban on rice in the coming weeks as they were thinking about after wheat and sugar david laborde senior research fellow at the international food policy research institute told cnbc india and china are the world s top two producers of rice accounting for more than half of the global total according to the world economic forum vietnam is the fifth largest while thailand is in sixth place india imposed export bans on wheat in may citing a need to manage the overall food security of the country it also slapped restrictions on sugar just days after the wheat ban are price hikes preferable laborde said that a price increase would be far preferable to any export ban we should really differentiate between a price rise that compensates for higher costs and will benefit farmers and help them producing than an export ban that pushes prices up on world markets but pushes prices down on domestic markets he said nafees meah regional representative for south asia at the international rice research institute added that energy costs which have been rising globally are a big part of rice production costs so there is an argument to say if the market is indicating an increase in price then why shouldn t the farmers benefit from increased prices nafees told cnbc s squawk box asia but an increase in rice prices would badly affect many in asia which is the biggest consumer of the staple so in in the southeast asia pacific region countries like east timor laos cambodia and of course places like indonesia which very large population and many of whom are food insecure will be pretty badly affected if prices continue to rise and stay at these very high levels said nafees way above pre pandemic levels the u n s food price index showed prices are now 75 above pre pandemic levels said frederique carrier managing director and head of investment strategy for rbc wealth management pandemic related labor shortages and russia s invasion of ukraine have aggravated the situation by both curtailing food supply and pushing up energy prices even further she wrote in a june report about a third of food production costs are energy related carrier said fertilizer in particular is very energy intensive to produce and prices have soared since last year

washington a bipartisan group of senators said sunday that it has an agreement in principle on gun control legislation though the lawmakers did not provide specific and detailed legislation families are scared and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities a group of 20 senators said in a statement that outlined their plan ten of the signers were republicans the number needed to break a gop filibuster on the package the group said its plan increases needed mental health resources improves school safety and support for students and helps ensure dangerous criminals and those who are adjudicated as mentally ill can t purchase weapons lawmakers who have long sought to tighten the nation s gun laws redoubled their efforts after the recent mass killings at an elementary school in uvalde texas saturday protests we re angry thousands to rally against gun violence saturday in march for our lives protests corporate support ceos from more than 200 companies including levi strauss lululemon urge senate to pass gun safety legislation senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y called the agreement a good first step and added that we must move swiftly to advance this legislation because if a single life can be saved it is worth the effort the proposal is vastly more limited than changes pushed by president joe biden to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines add universal background checks and raise the minimum age to buy guns to 21 years old still he urged immediate passage in both chambers obviously it does not do everything that i think is needed biden said but it reflects important steps in the right direction and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to pass congress in decades biden on gun reform joe biden pressed by jimmy kimmel on gun control can t you issue an executive order biden s wish list biden wants action on guns even if he doesn t get everything he asked for white house senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky issued a tepid statement praising the work of negotiators but not specifically endorsing their proposal i continue to hope their discussions yield a bipartisan product that makes significant headway on key issues like mental health and school safety respects the second amendment earns broad support in the senate and makes a difference for our country he said the senators who signed the statement included the four who led the negotiations chris murphy d conn john cornyn r texas thom tillis r n c and kyrsten sinema d ariz the others are richard blumenthal d conn roy blunt r mo cory booker d n j richard burr r n c bill cassidy r la susan collins r maine chris coons d del lindsey graham r s c martin heinrich d n m mark kelly d ariz angus king i maine joe manchin d w va rob portman r ohio mitt romney r utah debbie stabenow d mich and pat toomey r pa there is reduced chance of political blowback for the republicans who signed the proposal four of the 10 gop senators are retiring this year another five are not up for re election until 2026 the 10th romney often goes his own way murphy an especially vocal proponent of new gun laws since the 2012 mass killings at an elementary school in his home state of connecticut called the deal a breakthrough agreement on gun violence the first in 30 years that will save lives what s in the gun legislation deal the group said its proposal includes support for state crisis intervention investment in children and family mental health services protections for victims of domestic violence funding for school based mental health and supportive services funding for school safety resources clarification of definition of federally licensed firearms dealer telehealth investments penalties for straw purchasing the plan also calls for an enhanced review process for young gun buyers for buyers under 21 years of age requires an investigative period to review juvenile and mental health records including checks with state databases and local law enforcement the statement said house action on gun bills house lawmakers voted last week to raise from 18 to 21 the minimum age to buy semi automatic rifles following a day of poignant testimony from survivors of mass shootings including a fourth grader a mother taking care of her wounded son and parents who lost a 10 year old daughter the house approved on a party line vote the age change as part of a package of gun reform measures that also would clamp down on gun trafficking ban bump stocks and require safe storage of firearms the bill known as the protecting our kids act heads to the senate where it s not expected to pass because republicans have enough votes to block gun legislation rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y told cnn s state of the union on sunday that all options on the table must be looked at closely regarding guns i think we need to really look at the text and once we look at that text i think we ll be able to see if this legislation has been responsibly put together and i hope it is my hope that it has been ocasio cortez said she hopes to vote yes on the gun legislation deal announced sunday from a group of senators rep chris jacobs r n y a longtime supporter of gun ownership is in favor of some gun controls including raising the minimum age to purchase guns he grew up in buffalo though he does not represent the city so i m going to do all i can i have to in my heart of hearts think all i can do to make sure that no other community has to experience what happened in my city and what happened with all those beautiful children down in uvalde he said reaction from both sides the national rifle association did not comment in detail saying in a statement that it does not take positions on frameworks and adding that we will make our position known when the full text of the bill is available for review the nra also said it will continue to oppose any effort to insert gun control policies initiatives that override constitutional due process protections and efforts to deprive law abiding citizens of their fundamental right to protect themselves and their loved ones into this or any other legislation vice president kamala harris praised the bipartisan group of senators who put the safety gun proposal together on sunday calling it an important step toward saving lives this gun safety proposal is an important step toward saving lives harris said while it does not reflect everything we need to do i applaud senator chris murphy and the bipartisan group of leaders who came together to put this forward enough is enough this is a huge step for gun safety aspen fain a kentucky students demand action volunteer said in a statement fain added that young people will keep fighting until this deal is done and look forward to the day we are celebrating in washington d c instead of begging our lawmakers to keep us safe contributing

donating time is a virtuous activity parishioners volunteer for church parents help with their kids school functions citizens clean up parks some state and local governments have monetized this by offering volunteering seniors a break on their property taxes while total elimination of this odious tax is the ultimate goal any reduction of it in the interim will do there are a few problems with such carve outs though one thing that enables us to volunteer is our prosperity despite declarations by some politicos things are shaky right now in addition to the eye watering price of gas tanking stock markets and other residual effects of government lockdowns we re experiencing continued labor shortages these property tax discounts exacerbate that problem in a recent interview one councilwoman here in san antonio asserted that their plan is aimed at those already volunteering they may as well get credit she said the official policy proposal implies otherwise citing isolation and loneliness studies it points to the benefits of getting seniors out of the house how it can stem cognitive decline among other negative effects associated with aging as a consequence they re lured away from the private sector where seniors like my father feel they still have more to give regardless of property tax credits respective sizes seniors could still possibly lose their home just like the rest of us if they re unable to pay the balance thousands are already more than two years late ponying up to the taxman it s distinctly possible that municipalities that seek to be an employer of choice fail to see this link it points to an underlying concern the disconnectedness that exists between governments and citizens when the vast majority of staff and elected representatives favor a more active government it s no surprise to see official documents tout that tax revenues performed well even though they weren t earned respect for individuals and independent wealth creators takes a backseat they can dictate the maximum number of participants and reduction they can receive protecting their own so as to not adversely impact operations the media add to this chorus by characterizing exemption savings to taxpayers as what the city loses but property tax systems essentially amount to little more than social engineering tools if programs like these work well governments reserve the power to determine other populations that may be vulnerable as public appraisers themselves point out property taxes are also an instrument for cronyism given the inequitable favoritism shown to commercial property the only time politicians extend such favor to homeowners is when their respective states compel them to ironically sometimes it s the state itself that permits levying this tax in the first place cracking that nut is another task altogether for the time being to paraphrase chris rock just because a municipality can do it doesn t mean it should alas we keep getting the will smith smackdown political openings do however occasionally present themselves politicians like to say that their vote is based on the needs of their constituents too often that s used to justify taking from some to give to others paid sick leave laws come to mind when they extend this belie f in representative government to pleas they re hearing for property tax relief voters should pounce these flexible principles and any newfound religion from meaningless savings of a 5 percent exemption to wanting to go big should be exploited to abolish this antiquated tax scheme for good people are more generous when they re more prosperous government bribes need not apply

mazdutide in each cohort achieved 10 weight loss and two 25 receiving mazdutide in each cohort achieved 15 weight loss during the study improvements in bmi waist circumference blood pressure lipid and serum uric acid were similar with those observed in the low dose cohorts mazdutide up titrated to 10 mg and 9 mg showed a similar safety profile with that of low dose cohorts no participant discontinued the study due to adverse events no dose adjustment of mazdutide was made no serious adverse event was reported professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated the obese population in china exceeded 100 million most patients failed to achieve weight loss goals by lifestyle intervention underlying the urgent need for safe and highly efficacious weight loss treatments we are delighted to see high dose mazdutide showed a similar safety profile as low dose mazdutide while demonstrated more robust weight loss efficacy as well as multiple benefits in metabolic parameters high dose mazdutide may offer bariatric surgery equivalent weight loss and potentially provides an encouraging treatment option for patients with severe obesity based on the current data and r d progress i believe that mazdutide has the full potential to become an innovative anti obesity drug buster i am also confident that mazdutide will achieve a great success in the phase iii clinical studies scheduled in the second half of this year i hope that mazdutide can be approved and launched to market and benefit patients in the foreseeable future dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent said high dose mazdutide showed favorable safety tolerability and robust efficacy on weight loss in chinese adults with overweight or obesity mazdutide is the only molecule that achieve a 12 week weight loss by more than 11 5 among single agent anti obesity molecules approved or under development this result demonstrates the superiority of glp 1 and glucagon receptor dual agonists over glp 1 receptor mono agonists in terms of weight loss efficacy meanwhile this study further validated the multiple metabolic benefits offered by mazdutide to patients with overweight or obesity we will continue to develop high dose mazdutide in overweight or obesity and other potential indications and expect more exciting results

by tommy wilkes and simon jessop london reuters leading uk and u s pension investors managing more than 1 trillion have launched a campaign to stop companies using dual class share structures that concentrate voting power in the hands of certain shareholders at the expense of others launched by british railways pensions scheme railpen and the non profit council of institutional investors cii others backing the investor coalition for equal votes icev include the new york city comptroller s office and the washington state investment board companies with dual class structures have two or more types of shares with different voting rights usually one with greater voting rights for founders or early investors and another for other shareholders with less voting power the imbalance means most investors have less control over how the company is run and can make it harder to collectively push back on issues such as executive pay and corporate strategy big fund managers have fought with little success against the arrangements for years arguing such structures often favoured by high growth technology firms erode shareholder rights and undermine long term corporate performance despite this policymakers in countries including the united states and britain have warmed to dual class structures as a way to attract new listings to their markets the group said it will lobby market participants and policymakers to make clear that proportionate shareholder voting is essential to effective stewardship and long term corporate performance voting is an important part of the stewardship toolkit but dual class share structures without automatic time based sunset clauses mean long term investors are trying to influence with one hand tied behind our backs caroline escott icev chair and senior investment manager at railpen said in the release the issue is fundamental to the ability to engage with and hold companies to account on material risks and opportunities and we hope that the work of icev will mark a turning point in the dual class share structure debate escott added amy borrus executive director of cii said the campaign would complement efforts by the group to push for legislative change in the united states where the group s draft legislation aims to curtail the use of dual share classes under the draft legislation national stock exchanges would be required to bar listings of new dual class companies unless they have seven year sunset provisions or both classes of voters approve the structure within seven years of listing reporting by tommy reggiori wilkes and simon jessop editing by david holmes

warning that inflation is unacceptably high and that it would remain above the 2 target over a three year forecast horizon the ecb on thursday flagged a first interest rate rise in more than 10 years next month after the end of new purchases on its long running bond buying programme from july 1 although ecb chief christine lagarde stressed that the central bank was committed to avoiding so called fragmentation of borrowing costs between euro zone members as bond buying ends financial markets were far from sure many investors doubt lagarde s developing approach to ecb policymaking which appears to give greater voice to national central banks and countries with a more hawkish monetary stance that those at the centre will allow the same sort of open ended commitment to rein in debt costs at the periphery as given by her predecessor mario draghi draghi s seminal whatever it takes comment in a london speech in 2012 was credited with ending the existential two year euro debt crisis back then now as italian prime minister he may have good reason to worry those words don t appear to be resonating as much with markets 10 years on italy s government bonds the second biggest euro

benchmark german equivalents ballooned as futures markets priced a whopping 1 2 percentage points of further ecb hikes between the pre announced july rise and year end italy s 10 year bond yield rose as much as 20 basis points on the day to its highest level since 2018 at 3 715 and just a whisker from eight year peaks it10yt rr spanish portuguese and greek yields all wobbled too as worrying the risk premium on italian 10 year bonds over germany s moved to 225 bps its highest since the onset of a pandemic that forced multiple fiscal rescues and pushed italy s debt to a record 160 of gross domestic product frightening fragmentation speaking at amundi s world investment forum in paris as the ecb met former international monetary fund chief economist olivier blanchard said he worried the ecb did not yet have the sort of tools that will convince investors fragmentation is manageable blanchard reckoned that the sort of monetary tightening the ecb was likely to need to control inflation was less than was required by the u s federal reserve as labour markets were much tighter in the united states and therefore ecb tightening shouldn t in theory be a problem for debt sustainability but he said bond investors still needed to be convinced of that because an outsize rise of long term borrowing costs could by itself change those sustainability metrics and create a self fulfilling problem the ecb would eventually need to address my main worry about the ecb is that in order to convince investors that the spread will remain low you have to convince them you will do whatever it takes said blanchard now a senior fellow at peterson institute for international economics if investors believe you will put a bit in but not enough they will still demand a higher spread blanchard said i m worried at this stage that the ecb doesn t have a process with which it can intervene sufficiently to address this and i suspect this is going to be an issue for the next year or two as the ecb announced the end of its asset purchase programme introduced in 2014 to avert potential deflation lagarde insisted the central bank had the flexibility to deal with any fragmentation that followed if it is necessary as we have amply demonstrated in the past we will deploy either existing adjusted instruments or new instruments that will be made available lagarde told a news conference but we are committed committed to proper transmission of our monetary policy but proper is a fuzzier concept when you are tightening underlying monetary policy unlike the 2012 14 period when easier and easier policy jibed with the underlying deflation picture similarly the objection in the ecb statement to unwarranted fragmentation remains ill defined in many eyes what s more ecb sources told reuters after the meeting that there was a large majority of policymakers against announcing a new fragmentation fighting tool this week the prospect of using the proceeds of coupons and or maturing bonds bought through the separate pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp in the event of any new stress also seems to be caveated by defining that stress as strictly pandemic related and not emanating from inflation driven tightening per se all in investment firms seem uncomfortable about the evolving consensus within the council if hawks are back at the top table and believe disagreement and hesitation could be costly the central bank will hope that it will not need to construct another programme to support italy said hetal mehta at legal general investment management higher ecb interest rates and italian borrowing costs call into question italian debt sustainability source reuters editing by susan fenton
by tommy wilkes and simon jessop london reuters leading uk and u s pension investors managing more than 1 trillion have launched a campaign to stop companies using dual class share structures that concentrate voting power in the hands of certain shareholders at the expense of others launched by british railways pensions scheme railpen and the non profit council of institutional investors cii others backing the investor coalition for equal votes icev include the new york city comptroller s office and the washington state investment board companies with dual class structures have two or more types of shares with different voting rights usually one with greater voting rights for founders or early investors and another for other shareholders with less voting power the imbalance means most investors have less control over how the company is run and can make it harder to collectively push back on issues such as executive pay and corporate strategy big fund managers have fought with little success against the arrangements for years arguing such structures often favoured by high growth technology firms erode shareholder rights and undermine long term corporate performance despite this policymakers in countries including the united states and britain have warmed to dual class structures as a way to attract new listings to their markets the group said it will lobby market participants and policymakers to make clear that proportionate shareholder voting is essential to effective stewardship and long term corporate performance voting is an important part of the stewardship toolkit but dual class share structures without automatic time based sunset clauses mean long term investors are trying to influence with one hand tied behind our backs caroline escott icev chair and senior investment manager at railpen said in the release the issue is fundamental to the ability to engage with and hold companies to account on material risks and opportunities and we hope that the work of icev will mark a turning point in the dual class share structure debate escott added amy borrus executive director of cii said the campaign would complement efforts by the group to push for legislative change in the united states where the group s draft legislation aims to curtail the use of dual share classes under the draft legislation national stock exchanges would be required to bar listings of new dual class companies unless they have seven year sunset provisions or both classes of voters approve the structure within seven years of listing reporting by tommy reggiori wilkes and simon jessop editing by david holmes

us economy will plunge into recession if a soft landing cannot be achieve cai meng china daily it seems that the united states is enjoying another economic boom its unemployment rate is at the lowest level since the 1970s wages and incomes are rising and the us dollar index has risen 6 5 percent compared with the beginning of the year president joe biden has even claimed that the us economic growth rate this year will exceed china s for the first time since 1976 however experts have warned the us economy faces the risk of recession a study by former us treasury secretary lawrence summers suggests that throughout the us history when the inflation rate is higher than 5 percent and employment rate is lower than 4 percent the possibility of a recession within a year is 100 percent in the first quarter the us inflation rate and joblessness rate reached these threshold levels the us government and the federal reserve believe the us economy can avoid a recession and achieve a soft landing it is true that reasonable macroeconomic policies especially fine tuning of some policies can help accomplish a soft landing but it is not easy to realize it the us only achieved a soft landing once in the mid 1990s there are three obstacles on the path to a soft landing first the high inflation rate the consumer price index of the us hit over 5 percent in may last year and it has kept rising since then reaching the mark of over 8 percent for two consecutive months in march and april to push down the inflation level to the 2 percent target the us needs to maintain the aggregate demand at levels significantly lower than the potential output for a long period which would likely trigger a recession second this round of inflation includes some cost push factors which have been driven by the price hikes of commodities caused by the russia ukraine conflict the pandemic induced disruptions to global supply chains as well as the increased tariffs on chinese products and the subsequent impact on supply chains to rein in the cost push inflation requires stronger measures to curtail market demand if costs cannot be lowered which will accelerate a recession third low interest rates and a loose monetary environment have brought excess liquidity to the us financial market when interest rates rise rapidly and monetary policy tightens the prices of financial assets may tumble and the turbulence in the financial market will worsen the recession of the real economy if the us can effectively bring down the costs from the supply side there remains a chance of a soft landing lower costs can drive inflation rates down steadily at a time when market demand shrinks slowly thus making it unnecessary to resort to a sharp rise in interest rates and monetary tightening however the biden administration faces many hindrances in lowering the costs one effective measure to bring down costs is tax reduction regrettably there is no such option in the biden administration s policy toolkit the us government which has already rolled out massive spending packages for covid 19 relief infrastructure building and assistance to ukraine has pledged to make up for the government deficit by increasing tax in the context of growing debt pressure caused by rising interest rates it is too difficult for the biden administration to make a u turn on its tax policy another solution is to bring down the prices of major global commodities if the us terminates its economic sanctions on russia and pushes for an end to the russia ukraine conflict the prices of commodities such as energy and food will drop remarkably but instead of seeking an end to the conflict the biden administration is prolonging it by providing military assistance to ukraine and increasing the sanctions on russia obviously the biden administration s priorities are political rather than economic the us could also ask opec members to increase output to rein in the runaway oil prices however high oil prices are in the interests of oil exporters in addition as the us influence on opec members is declining countries such as saudi arabia lack the willingness to increase adequate production there is yet another way for the us to reduce costs it should secure cost effective supply chains through international cooperation but the biden administration has halted the us cooperation with china in supply chains while seeking to rebuild the supply chains that moved out of the us the us is even attempting to establish backup supply chains to those it has already established with its allies and partners all of those measures are driving up costs for the biden administration maybe the most convenient way to keep down costs is to remove the excess tariffs the previous administration imposed on chinese goods as the biden administration is adjusting the previous government s misguided trade policies lifting the tariffs is in line with the incumbent administration s overall trade policy on china and will be beneficial to the us economy but if the us still tries to use the tariffs as a bargaining chip to gain more advantages for itself and extends the tariffs either in the hope of getting extra benefits from china or under political pressure from home the us economy will continue to suffer from the high inflation in a word if the us cannot get rid of this strategic burden of tariffs soon enough and seek to bring down costs through international cooperation the risk of demand contraction will grow and a soft landing will not be achieved once interest rates surge market demand contracts sharply and the financial market is plunged into turbulence the us economy will inevitably slide into recession the author is a senior fellow of the institute of world economics and

through his first four years as harvard president lawrence s bacow largely stayed out of trouble with the faculty of arts and sciences avoiding the sort of major controversies that brought down lawrence h summers presidency 16 years ago but despite mostly positive or neutral reviews from faculty members some say they are looking for someone from a different mold as harvard prepares to begin the selection process to find its 30th president bacow announced wednesday he plans to step down next year setting the stage for harvard s second presidential search in a decade in interviews after his announcement faculty members offered a wide range of hopes for harvard s next president some say they want someone from a different academic background and many others vie for a candidate who will use the perch of the university presidency to tackle global social issues we need a leader who can mobilize our core academic resources and influence to tackle the increasingly grave local national and global problems from deep economic disparities to growing social injustices to climate change dangers to increasing national polarization around the value of higher education itself suzanne p blier a professor of fine arts and african and african american studies wrote in an email some faculty members said they hope to see harvard s 30th president bolster the sciences and humanities i think the new president has an opportunity to link the 21st century skills creativity critical thinking collaboration communication to the humanities romance languages and literatures professor doris sommer wrote in an email looking for these skills should lead back to more opportunities to link the humanities with every other field bacow will step down next year after only five years in office tying summers for the shortest tenure since the civil war his departure announced in an email to harvard affiliates wednesday came as a surprise to some members of the fas aaas and harvard divinity school professor jacob k olupona said the news of bacow s retirement came as a big shock to him and other faculty members his retirement is a great loss not just for harvard but for higher education in the us added daniel e lieberman 86 a human evolutionary biology professor in an email advertisement bacow joins more than half a dozen leaders in higher education who plan to leave their positions this year or next blier wrote the challenges of the pandemic may have contributed to bacow s departure in light of covid and how well harvard managed this period perhaps the timing should not be such a surprise she wrote history professor philip j deloria wrote in an email that bacow has been a steady hand at a challenging time praising his leadership during the pandemic we ask a lot of our university presidents and there are all kinds of structural problems that can prevent them from fulfilling our many expectations he wrote i can t imagine anything less pleasant than guiding an institution through the last two years of pandemic but harvard has done so in a competent and reasonable way and we can chalk much of that up to president bacow s leadership faculty members also praised bacow for his attention to other global issues university professor stephen j greenblatt wrote that bacow was an effective advocate for students from abroad held hostage by irrational political forces of nativism in 2020 harvard sued the federal government over immigration rules that barred foreign students from staying in the u s if they were not taking in person classes prompting the trump administration to eventually change its guidance sommer lauded bacow s determination to confront the shameful history and legacy of slavery at harvard adding that his contributions inspire her in her own work harvard released a report in april that acknowledged the university s deep ties to the institution of slavery i am encouraged that his leadership through the public taking stock of harvard s involvement will inspire us to develop reparative projects in our particular disciplines she wrote in an email most faculty members declined to offer names of potential candidates but two pointed to current fas leaders advertisement university professor irwin i shapiro offered dean of science christopher w stubbs as a potential contender blier wrote that if harvard is looking internally fas dean claudine gay has done an extraordinary job and would be a terrific president other faculty members said they want to see a candidate who comes from a different academic background than bacow who holds degrees in three fields in the social sciences law public policy and economics abraham avi loeb a professor of science said harvard should put a scientist in charge who also understands the ethical issues that the humanities are needed to resolve james bryant conant class of 1914 who served in massachusetts hall from 1933 to 1953 was the last harvard president to come from a scientific background the future of the university should reflect the challenges that we have both in science and technology but at the same time combining the advances that we make in science and technology with new policies with new ways to cope with the challenges that come from the humanities loeb said there are ethical issues there are issues of how to regulate some of the abilities that we have jill e abramson 76 a senior lecturer in english who previously served as executive editor of the new york times said she hopes fundraising ability won t be the main prerequisite for the position instead she said harvard s 30th president should focus on bolstering the humanities i d like to see a president who values the humanities and might put some energy in trying to steer students into concentrations that are part of the humanities because i think the humanities a fundamental part of a good education she said bacow came to massachusetts hall from an inside track he served on the harvard corporation for seven years prior to his appointment as president and he stepped off the search committee that ultimately selected him in 2018 to be considered as a candidate for the job himself loeb said he hopes the search committee will prioritize someone outside its ranks advertisement what i really hope will happen now is that there will be attention to people from outside the search committee and attention to people who have vision and not just administrative experience he said staff writer ariel h kim can be reached at ariel kim thecrimson com follow her on twitter

food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and export bans have followed rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and rice a staple food in much of asia could be next industry watchers said the prices of many foods ranging from wheat and other grains to meat and oils have shot up that s been driven by a slew of factors including the rising cost of fertilizer and energy in the past year as well as the russia ukraine war food export bans or serious disruptions have included those from india wheat ukraine wheat oats and sugar among others and indonesia palm oil feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high according to the latest may data published last week to be sure rice production is still bountiful experts said but rising wheat prices and the generally higher costs of farming would make rice prices worth monitoring next we need to monitor rice prices going forward because rising wheat prices could lead to some substitution towards rice increasing demand and lowering existing stocks said sonal varma chief economist at japanese bank nomura risk of protectionism protectionist measures actually worsen price pressures at a global level for various reasons she told cnbc s street signs asia feed and fertilizer costs for farming are already rising and energy prices are adding to freight costs she added so there is a risk that we see more protectionism from countries said varma nevertheless she maintained that risks to rice are still low as global rice inventories are ample and harvests in india are expected to be good this summer russia s war on ukraine has driven up wheat prices both countries are major exporters of wheat and russia s invasion has disrupted farming and blocked grain exports from the country wheat prices have soared more than 50 since a year ago on monday of last week alone they jumped 4 after the russian military destroyed one of ukraine s largest grain exporting terminals according to reuters citing ukrainian authorities thailand and vietnam were in talks on a deal to increase the price of their rice exports according to a reuters report citing a thai government official in late may four exporters told reuters that rice traders have been buying more indian rice in the last two weeks according to a june 6 report right now i will be much more worried by india slapping an export ban on rice in the coming weeks as they were thinking about after wheat and sugar david laborde senior research fellow at the international food policy research institute told cnbc india and china are the world s top two producers of rice accounting for more than half of the global total according to the world economic forum vietnam is the fifth largest while thailand is in sixth place india imposed export bans on wheat in may citing a need to manage the overall food security of the country it also slapped restrictions on sugar just days after the wheat ban are price hikes preferable laborde said that a price increase would be far preferable to any export ban we should really differentiate between a price rise that compensates for higher costs and will benefit farmers and help them producing than an export ban that pushes prices up on world markets but pushes prices down on domestic markets he said nafees meah regional representative for south asia at the international rice research institute added that energy costs which have been rising globally are a big part of rice production costs so there is an argument to say if the market is indicating an increase in price then why shouldn t the farmers benefit from increased prices nafees told cnbc s squawk box asia but an increase in rice prices would badly affect many in asia which is the biggest consumer of the staple so in in the southeast asia pacific region countries like east timor laos cambodia and of course places like indonesia which very large population and many of whom are food insecure will be pretty badly affected if prices continue to rise and stay at these very high levels said nafees way above pre pandemic levels the u n s food price index showed prices are now 75 above pre pandemic levels said frederique carrier managing director and head of investment strategy for rbc wealth management pandemic related labor shortages and russia s invasion of ukraine have aggravated the situation by both curtailing food supply and pushing up energy prices even further she wrote in a june report about a third of food production costs are energy related carrier said fertilizer in particular is very energy intensive to produce and prices have soared since last year
the shark fins approach shark fin 1 counterparty risk the repo fins explained counterparty dysfunction explained the fed has been making daily loans into the reverse repo market to the skyrocketing tune of 2t a day shark fin 2 the shift from hysteria to fear today we are in an everything bubble from meme stocks inflated bonds and over priced housing to bloated art over paid celebrity chefs and pricy used cars shark fin 3 mbs toxic waste how a real estate bubble dies where to hide gold s bull cycle is just beginning still trust the fed trust hard facts such constructive default via crippling inflation is a way of defaulting without having to publicly i e politically confess default follow the fed volatility ahead as one who loves metaphor i can t help but notice the recent and varying range of metaphorical macro warnings jp morgan s jamie dimon for example is now predicting a market hurricane ahead which peter schiff has recently upgraded to a category 5 meanwhile the always blunt michael burry has compared the trajectory of our market economy and macro warnings to watching a plane crash in short the bull vs bear debate is behind us even the tbtf banks are now openly alarmed in fact current macro warnings are more suggestive of a market shark rather than bear and borrowing a line from speilberg s jaws we are all gonna need a bigger boat as these dorsal finned macro warnings begin circling in plain sight in short cue the john williams music as we ve argued ever since the september 2019 implosion of the reverse repo market this was a very big deal of course the corporate media and politicized fed tried to downplay the repo crisis as powell was losing control of the rates markets and banks were losing trust for each other and each other s collateral the financial leadership were hoping an intentionally confusing and complex reverse repo market would be too difficult for the average citizen investor to grasp thus the 2019 fed nervously whistled past that ticking timebomb as it dumped trillions of mouse click money into the repo morass but to make better sense of these repo markets let s keep things clean and simple the reverse repo market is a place where loans keep markets and banks greased in short term typically over night liquidity as liquidity i e borrowed money is the grease that makes our debt soaked over levered and counter party heavy markets go round given this important grease when the counterparties in the reverse repo markets lose trust in each other the wheels of the markets start to squeak shake rattle and roll off in september of 2019 tbtf bank 1 essentially stopped trusting tbtf bank 2 s balance sheet and thus wouldn t lend each other money at normal rates the distrusting banks chose instead to charge each other painful rates skyrocketing from the sub 2 range to the 10 range in one trading day once again and unbeknownst to just about everybody those days of dysfunctional liquidity marriages i e distrust have returned as of april 2021 please re read that last line the eye opening chart below looks a lot like a shark fin what ghastly data like the above chart boils down to is the fed is providing the money market with mind numbingly massive doses of daily liquidity to keep it alive they do this by swapping out treasuries for money market funds in what is the churning equivalent to treading water with fiat dollars some experts claim that this insane level of fed support is due to the tbtf banks off loading deposits from their balance sheets onto the fed s balance sheet in order to meet the basel 3 requirements a more likely scenario however boils down to counter party distrust and hence counter party risk among wall street s broken moving parts no wonder jamie dimon is so scared of hurricanes stated otherwise distrust in the system is rising like a shark fin and the money markets are now swimming toward a bigger boat namely the fed just saying markets no matter how artificially stimulated or can kicked move in cycles which are driven by the availability or unavailability of liquidity when cash is cheap i e when rates are low markets hysterically rip and when cash is expensive i e when rates rise markets fearfully tank ever since november of 2021 when powell forward guided a june 2022 tightening of liquidity markets have been slowly and fearfully tanking as tightening is just a fancy way of telegraphing a rate hike and as stated above rate hikes matter between 2006 and 2008 for example we saw a crappy credit housing market climb in euphoria and then tank in fear today as rates slowly rise into a powel 2022 taper equally and eerily reminiscent of the pre 2008 pivot from euphoria to fear is the teetering tech will save you meme which like cathie wood s arkk fund is tanking in real time despite her rising spin talk on primetime in short we are seeing signs all over the hype driven nasdaq and s p of a classic bear trap of which btc was just one among many what s far scarier today however is that the 2008 crisis bubble was limited to real estate and remember all bubbles pop despite what your broker central banker or 20 something financial journalist might tell you for those who remember 2008 then you also remember all those crappy mortgages packaged into mortgage backed securities mbs which wall street then syndicated to your broker like candy and which the rating agencies equated to magical beans you also know those mbs were toxic waste and as chernobyl reminds toxic waste doesn t just go away it lingers and festers in deep dark pits sadly the mbs waste of the 2008 era is still lingering and festering in the deep and dark pits of the fed s toxic and bloated balance sheet but now powell wants to unload that mbs waste great idea but who wants to buy toxic waste if powell sticks to his june unloading of unwanted mbs this will add more supply of an asset class for which there is no demand and as high school economics reminds such a over supply drying dynamic means tanking prices for those mbs radiation assets but again who will buy radiation assets sadly the big banks will which means they ll now have more older and crappier mbs added to their balance sheets of the newer less crappy loans which they float through freddie and fannie to turn into more mbs but given the increasing supply and tanking demand for these mbs their prices will go nowhere but south which means their yields and hence interest rates i e tomorrow s mortgages will have nowhere to go but north after all banks survive by lending at a risk premium as the fed slowly takes the fed funds rate from zero to 75 bps or more the mortgage rates must rise at a much greater pace and slope already climbing from 3 to 5 to date and that folks is how a housing bubble ends investors facing these macro warnings and shark fins need a bigger boat needless to say our view lies partially in gold which detractors will attribute to sell side bias rather than informed conviction private common sense or a basic understanding of math or history as we ve warned for years this slow collapse is already in play as the nasdaq s p tlt and even muni bonds have all seen near 20 losses thus far into 2022 meanwhile us boring gold investors are having to defend the only primary asset category that has kept its nose above the water level this year we are constantly asked why gold is not ripping when in fact it has already done a noble job of not tanking from its 2009 low to its high late last year but we believe the gold market s rise has not even begun in 1980 when gold topped an 8x move in just 3 years stocks were flat if anything the only bubble then was gold itself but until recently the only bubbles in sight were risk assets from junk bonds to junk tech which means gold s time to shine is ahead of us not behind us when considered in the larger backdrop of a commodities cycle such confidence is an evolution rather than bias the recent uptrend in the bloomberg commodities index for example is admirable but does not even compare to the highs it reached in 2011 and prior as for interim price action in gold we are not promising a straight line when risk asset markets tank gold can temporarily follow as seen in october of 2008 or march of 2020 but just after joining those tanking markets gold then divorced the tantrum trend and skyrocketed north we see an inevitable gold surge in the tumultuous years ahead and as investors rather than speculators time is clearly on our side of course there are still those who will trust the fed and the magical money theories mmt of the so called experts as the great janet yellen sits down with powell and biden this week i wonder if anyone in that oval office will remind yellen that she had described inflation as transitory throughout 2021 though now it has reached 40 year highs i wonder if anyone will remind her that for the entire first half of her term as fed chair she kept rates stapled to zero and then took 2 more years just to reach 1 15 thereby adding low rate fuel to the current inflationary fire that always follows cheap debt paid for with mouse klick money despite her continued promises that there was no risk of a housing bubble nor any damage to the broader economy has janet forgotten 2008 but if the politico s wish to pretend and shirk we at least can be blunt and direct in the last 200 years 98 of all countries with a debt to gdp ratio of 130 have defaulted via inflation currency devaluation restructuring or pure default reinhart rogoff sadly the problem for the u s based on the global centric nature of usd structures means the entire world has a sovereign debt problem as i have written and spoken many times it s my belief that debt soaked sovereigns will publicly decry inflation while privately seeking more of it as a main street crushing strategy to inflate away their sovereign debt big brother crushing main street no shocker there and god knows politicians like yellen et al never admit to any faults furthermore given that natural supply and demand driven price discovery along with basic capitalism died years ago in what is now a central bank driven market the only signal headwind or tailwind left for tracking future market direction is based upon central bank policy in general and powell s fed in particular i mean let s be honest it s a rigged fed market not a stock market so what will powell do will he 1 tighten qe into a topping market and thus create an historical market blow off and global meltdown or 2 pivot reverse course and start creating more fiat money faster than a bat out of hell no one of course can know for certain meanwhile powell biden and yellen can meet to plan a strategy which in my mind is akin to mickey mouse sitting down with tweedle dee and tweedle dumb to diffuse a timebomb all three know that the economic data ahead is getting worse not bettergiven political preferences for re election self interest over the public good or personal accountability it s hard to imagine any of these political parties actually confessing a recession with a mid term election on the horizon the u s administration is already pre telegraphing weaker economic data for the coming months preparing the masses for more pain while pointing fingers at putin or bat made man made virus rather than assuming one iota of personal accountability in this backdrop it is possible that the three stooges above may allow markets to tank by sticking to powell s qt schedule and hence fight money supply driven inflation with a tanking market price driven deflation even if this desperate option is taken my guess and it s only a guess based on human political nature and centuries of historical patterns is that the fed will then pivot and crank out the money printing once markets spiral into qt in short i see lots of inflationary deflationary and then again inflationary forces ahead all screaming volatility ahead in short amidst these clear macro warnings i think we re all gonna need a bigger boat and mine will have a golden rudder

patients who have relapsed after receiving prior car t therapy this has meaningful clinical value and is worthy of further exploration in the clinic to potentially bring forth new hope to patients with r r mm about multiple myeloma mm multiple myeloma is a deadly blood cancer that often infiltrates the bone marrow causing anemia kidney failure immune problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in remission most patients will inevitably enter the relapsed or refractory stage as there s currently no cure as a result there is a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the united states mm accounts for nearly 2 of all cancer cases and more than 2 of cancer related deaths according to frost sullivan the number of new mm cases in the united states rose from 30 300 in 2016 to 32 300 in

central nervous system tumors braf wild type fusions are the most common cancer causing genomic alterations in pediatric low grade gliomas these genomic alterations are also found in several adult and pediatric solid tumors currently approved braf inhibitors are only active in tumors harboring braf v600 mutations exhibit limited activity in brain tumors and cannot be used in patients harboring braf fusions pediatric low grade glioma can impact a child s health in many ways depending on tumor size and location including vision loss and motor dysfunction there are no approved therapies for plgg and current treatment approaches are associated with significant acute and life long adverse effects while most children with plgg survive their cancer children who do not achieve remission following surgery may face years of increasingly aggressive therapies that can have lasting effects on learning cognition and quality of life due to the indolent nature of plgg patients receive multiple years

as u s china competition in the region heats up pacific island nations want to ensure engagement with both powers is on their own terms in late may as president biden was wrapping up his visit to asia china s foreign minister wang yi launched a 10 day tour of the pacific islands almost immediately news broke that wang had unexpectedly proposed a sweeping multilateral agreement to deepen beijing s security and economic ties with the region then quickly withdrew it due to lack of support from the pacific island countries this followed a controversial solomon islands china security pact signed in april that set off alarm bells in the united states and australia over china s efforts to establish a security presence in the pacific islands region amid a raft of asia centered u s diplomatic initiatives in recent months wang s lengthy visit represents beijing s determination to increase its influence and counter the biden administration s efforts in the indo pacific region wang visited eight countries the solomon islands kiribati samoa fiji tonga vanuatu papua new guinea and timor leste held virtual meetings with three additional nations cook islands niue and the federated states of micronesia and hosted the second round of the china pacific island countries foreign ministers meeting in fiji advertisement wang s withdrawal of the proposed agreement and several pacific island countries tepid response to it dominated headlines during wang s trip but the visit illuminated four other key developments that will shape china s future engagement and influence in the region 1 wang s trip did not accomplish all of china s goals but beijing remains committed to expanding its influence in the pacific islands although the initial proposal stalled beijing made clear that it still hopes to reach agreement on the common development vision and five year action plan as the parties build more consensus before wang s trip began china s foreign ministry published a factsheet to highlight ongoing cooperation between china and the pacific island countries and once the proposed plan was withdrawn china quickly issued a position paper on mutual respect and common development with pacific island countries which offers 15 visions and proposals for deepening china s engagement in the region notably this paper focuses largely on political and economic issues with only brief mention of the security issues that had sparked the most controversy wang s trip succeeded in strengthening many of china s direct state to state relationships across the pacific as evidenced by the signing of 52 bilateral agreements advertisement at every opportunity wang stressed china s commitment to the pacific islands region and beijing s intent to remain engaged over the long term secretary general of the chinese communist party xi jinping also pledged china s continued support in his written remarks at the china pacific island countries foreign ministers meeting which wang attended in fiji chinese s state media reported that xi s address offered assurances that china will always be a good friend brother and partner of pacific island countries sharing common goals and standing together with them despite changes in the international landscape china sees both symbolic and strategic benefits to strengthening its relationships with pacific island countries beijing wants to increase its presence in the region to ensure the united states does not establish unchallenged influence and to frustrate u s military power projection in a potential conflict over taiwan economically beijing seeks access to the region s fisheries and other maritime resources as well as its trade and shipping routes the region also offers china diplomatic leverage stronger relations in the pacific help beijing further isolate taiwan gain votes of support in the united nations advance its belt and road initiative and enhance its image as a reliable partner and viable alternative to other major powers in the region 2 many pacific island countries remain wary of china s intentions especially related to security issues wang s first stop was in the solomon islands which was still reeling from the bilateral security agreement signed on april 1 prime minister sogavare s support for beijing remains controversial and his critics worry that china is now in a position to prop up an unpopular regime and undermine the democratic process in the name of maintaining social order opposition leader matthew wale observed it s clear to me that the vast majority of ordinary solomon islanders do not want a base here or even this deal a majority do not want china here at all in the first place advertisement beijing also encountered other stumbling blocks along the way just before wang arrived in fiji fijian president frank bainimarama announced that his country would become a founding member of the u s led indo pacific economic framework which china opposes in kiribati domestic public opinion remains wary of closer ties with beijing following rumors last year that china planned to upgrade a world war ii airstrip in the country which would damage the country s already strained fish stocks there the opposition leader warned our democratic system in fact our very sovereignty is under attack and we need support to ensure our survival as a democratic nation the president of the federated states of micronesia david panuelo offered the most vocal opposition to china s proposed regional plan calling china s plan the single most game changing proposed agreement in the pacific in any of our lifetimes panuelo implored his fellow pacific island leaders to reject the offer he further predicted that the proposal would draw the region very close into beijing s orbit intrinsically tying the whole of our economies and societies to and warned that chinese control over our communications infrastructure our ocean territory and the resources within them and our security space aside from impacts on our sovereignty increases the chances of china getting into conflict with australia japan the united states and new zealand throughout the tour local populations expressed frustration with the lack of transparency around the visits in many places china restricted the number of foreign journalists allowed at the press conferences and prohibited them from directing any questions to wang the media association of the solomon islands went so far as to issue a boycott notice to its members urging them to skip the press event to protest the restrictions china had placed on local reporters 3 china s aggressive moves likely inspired the united states australia and new zealand to expedite and strengthen their outreach to the region and to better coordinate their engagement the united states february 2022 indo pacific strategy emphasizes the importance of the pacific islands to the united states and the biden administration has taken several steps to deepen u s engagement in the region including at the presidential and secretary of state levels with more high level outreach expected in the months ahead the newly elected australian government also took immediate steps to reinforce canberra s commitment to its pacific island neighbors through high level visits and a neighborhood first policy as wang weaved his way through the region australian foreign minister penny wong conducted her own visits to fiji samoa and tonga and on may 31 new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern and president biden issued a joint statement that highlighted their shared commitment to the pacific islands note with concern the security agreement that china and the solomon islands signed on april 1 and warned against the establishment of a persistent military presence in the pacific by a state that does not share our values or security interest the pacific island countries want closer and sustained ties with the united states australia and new zealand but they want those relationships to focus on the needs and priorities of the countries in the region not on countering china all three countries had already taken steps to reenergize their engagement in the region but china s ambitious push has emphasized the need to better coordinate their efforts in the weeks and months ahead 4 although the region refused to be rushed into a multilateral deal pacific island countries are still very open to china s engagement but on their terms the pacific island countries did not embrace china s proposed common development vision and action plan but neither did they definitively reject it rather they said they needed more time to consider it and wanted to discuss it as a group at the pacific islands forum pif in july we have not made a decision as we did not have enough time to look at it samoa s prime minister explained however it is unclear that even after a deeper look the pacific island nations will accept china s proposal the pif prefers making decisions deliberatively and based on consensus which could spell trouble for china s plan australia and new zealand are members of the pif as are the republic of the marshall islands palau tuvalu and nauru all of whom have formal diplomatic ties with taiwan instead of beijing and they may not be supportive of the agreement but pacific island countries remain very open to stronger bilateral ties with china especially in the economic realm china has the immediate appeal of being able to bring much needed investment infrastructure trade and covid related assistance as these countries all contend with headwinds from a weakening global economy and try to recover from the pandemic s many negative impacts with china the united states australia new zealand and others all seeking to increase their engagement the pacific island countries have more options and more negotiating power to press for arrangements that best address their needs in a 2019 speech examining china s increased engagement in the region then secretary general of the pacific islands forum dame meg taylor rejected the notion that states should choose sides between the united states and its allies and partners and china instead she noted that in general forum members view china s increased actions in the region as a positive development one that offers greater options for financing and development opportunities both directly in partnership with china and indirectly through the increased competition in our region ultimately pacific island countries want to know that the powers vying for their attention and offering cooperation understand their concerns and are willing to help them address the issues that are most important for their own populations as fiji s bainimarama put it geopolitical point scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas whose job is being lost to the pandemic or whose family is impacted by the rapid rise in the price of commodities and just in case the foreign officials jet setting around the region hadn t heard the message loud and clear he reiterated our greatest concern isn t geopolitics it s climate change source usip url author dr jennifer staats is the director of east and southeast asia programs at the u s institute of peace she joined usip in 2016 as the director of

stock image photo by pheelings media istock getty images plus st george news contributed content recent research shows fasting can be a profound way to quickly and dramatically improve your immune gut and brain health in our clinics we have many of our hashimoto s patients undergo different types of fasts because we ve found it s one of the surest ways to swiftly relieve their symptoms humans are actually built to withstand regular periods without food the human body is not really equipped to cope with high carbohydrate foods sugars unlimited supplies of food processed foods industrial oils sedentary lifestyles and other facets of everyday life for many americans and westerners in general five ways fasting improves your health when you have hashimoto s hundreds of studies point to the benefits of fasting five of these benefits include the following improved insulin sensitivity many if not most of our hashimoto s patients have chronically high blood sugar high blood sugar comes from eating a standard american diet which is high in processed carbohydrates bread white rice white potatoes pasta pastries etc and sugars high blood sugar eventually leads to insulin resistance a condition in which the body s cells refuse to receive insulin insulin carries glucose into the cells to be used to make energy however when you eat a diet high in carbohydrates and sugars this overwhelms the cellular insulin receptors this not only creates fatigue after meals but also dysregulates numerous metabolic pathways promotes inflammation and autoimmunity and speeds up degeneration of the brain insulin resistance is also a stepping stone to type 2 diabetes including periods of fasting into your daily routine has been shown to help cells become more insulin sensitive for instance one study found restricting eating to a window of only eight hours each day significantly improved insulin resistance this in turn dampens the inflammation metabolic imbalances and brain degeneration caused by insulin resistance improved immune function intermittent fasting fasting for 12 18 hours each day has been shown to improve immune function by reducing inflammation and the damage from inflammation it also regulates immune function which is great for autoimmune diseases like hashimoto s regenerates immune cells and can even lower the risk of cancer improved brain function fasting and intermittent fasting can dramatically improve brain function one way it does this is by boosting a chemical called brain derived neurotrophic factor brain derived neurotrophic factor protects your brain from neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer s and parkinson s by supporting neuronal health fasting also supports autophagy or the removal of dead and dying cells in the brain this is essentially like cleaning house and helps your brain function more efficiently fasting also reduces brain inflammation and supports brain repair improved cardiovascular function regular fasting can decrease low density lipoprotein commonly known as bad cholesterol people with hashimoto s often struggle with elevated levels of ldl and fasting is another tool to help lower it improved gut function many of our patients have leaky gut and poor gut immunity along with hashimoto s regular fasting helps them quickly and dramatically recover their gut health fasting has been shown to lower inflammation in the gut and create a healthier composition of gut bacteria fasting works its wonders by switching the body from burning glucose for fuel to burning ketones which are stored in body fat being in ketosis in general appears to reduce inflammation support regeneration and regulate metabolism these are all areas where people with hashimoto s can be supported by fasting fasting is not for everyone before i explain the different types of fasts we use with our patients i need to caution you that fasting is not for everyone although it can be an adjustment at first fasting should make you feel better not worse you should be able to perform your usual daily activities below are some situations in which fasting can make you worse instead of better chronically low blood sugar if you have chronically low blood sugar don t try to fast until you can stabilize it this means you may need to eat a healthy protein breakfast first thing in the morning and eat every two to three hours you also need to avoid sweets processed carbs fruits fruit juices fruit smoothies honey and other sweeteners no matter how natural once your blood sugar is stable and you can go for longer periods without symptoms you may be able to handle fasting safely symptoms of low blood sugar include waking up at 3 4 a m feeling anxious this happens because your blood sugar crashes during the night and your body releases stress hormones to keep the brain fueled waking up nauseous or repelled by the idea of food low blood sugar dysregulates appetite centers in the brain and the stress hormones released during the night to keep your brain fueled cause nausea feeling lightheaded weak nauseous or irritable between meals or if you go too long without eating this happens because your body cannot sustain your blood sugar levels craving sugar constantly sugar provides energy something people with low blood sugar crave feeling more energetic after eating eating should not give you more or less energy your energy should be consistent throughout the day feeling energetic after meals means your blood sugar was low adrenal autoimmunity some people aren t able to regulate their low blood sugar no matter how hard they try we find these patients often test positive for adrenal autoimmunity the adrenal glands release stress hormones and are instrumental in preventing blood sugar crashes if they re being damaged by an autoimmune disorder you may not have success overcoming low blood sugar symptoms in this case it s not advised to fast you can test for adrenal autoimmunity with a 21 hydroxylase antibody test some brain disorders although fasting and ketogenic diets have ample amounts of research showing they are very restorative to brain health in his kharrazian institute neuroinflammation course dr datis kharrazian presented a case in which a brain trauma consumes so much of the patient s energy that they re not able to fast without crashing and experiencing a flare up of symptoms if you have had a past brain injury or are struggling with brain health you may need to use trial and error to see whether this is an issue for you fasting shouldn t flare up your inflammation or your symptoms or cause a general worsening of health it should make you feel better diabetes medication if you re on medication for diabetes fasting could cause your blood sugar to go too low you should consult with your doctor if you want to try fasting history of eating disorders people with a history of eating disorders or disordered eating typically have a history of starving themselves for extended periods and may find fasting triggers them into bingeing obsessive thinking about food and other unhealthy behaviors although fasting has been shown to reduce cravings and appetite human studies have been largely short term observational and done on overweight middle aged people if the six to eight hour feeding windows turn into uncontrollable feeding frenzies or if fasting for one or more days is followed by days of bingeing fasting is not healthy for you pregnant or trying to become pregnant fasting is not recommended during pregnancy as the demands of pregnancy on the body are so great six different types of fasting that can help improve your autoimmunity gut function and brain health a variety of different methods of fasting exist today below i will go over six different fasting strategies that have been shown to be beneficial fasting once a week in our office we suggest our hashimoto s patients fast once a week for 24 hours drinking water with some himalayan sea salt in it this will help with adrenal function and electrolyte balance fasting once a month if our patients are able to do so comfortably we then ask them to fast once a month for 36 48 hours again we suggest our patients use himalayan sea salt in their water fasting part of each day or intermittent fasting perhaps the most popular form of fasting is called intermittent fasting this entails fasting for 12 18 hours each day starting in the evening and ending the following day around lunchtime the different types of intermittent fasting are as follows 5 2 fasting this is one of the more popular intermittent fasting methods eat normally for five days and then eat 500 calories for women or 600 calories for men on the two other days of the week choose whichever days you like to fast but try and choose days where you won t be overly active or stressed time restricted fasting fast for 12 18 hours each day some experts suggest women do not fast for more than 14 hours this typically involves skipping breakfast and eating an early dinner most of your time fasting is while you re asleep even fasting only 12 hours overnight can you give benefits although they won t be as significant as longer fasts alternate day fasting every other day eat 25 of your calorie needs or about 500 calories on the other days eat normally to learn more about our services and to schedule a free

central nervous system tumors braf wild type fusions are the most common cancer causing genomic alterations in pediatric low grade gliomas these genomic alterations are also found in several adult and pediatric solid tumors currently approved braf inhibitors are only active in tumors harboring braf v600 mutations exhibit limited activity in brain tumors and cannot be used in patients harboring braf fusions pediatric low grade glioma can impact a child s health in many ways depending on tumor size and location including vision loss and motor dysfunction there are no approved therapies for plgg and current treatment approaches are associated with significant acute and life long adverse effects while most children with plgg survive their cancer children who do not achieve remission following surgery may face years of increasingly aggressive therapies that can have lasting effects on learning cognition and quality of life due to the indolent nature of plgg patients receive multiple years

us economy will plunge into recession if a soft landing cannot be achieve cai meng china daily it seems that the united states is enjoying another economic boom its unemployment rate is at the lowest level since the 1970s wages and incomes are rising and the us dollar index has risen 6 5 percent compared with the beginning of the year president joe biden has even claimed that the us economic growth rate this year will exceed china s for the first time since 1976 however experts have warned the us economy faces the risk of recession a study by former us treasury secretary lawrence summers suggests that throughout the us history when the inflation rate is higher than 5 percent and employment rate is lower than 4 percent the possibility of a recession within a year is 100 percent in the first quarter the us inflation rate and joblessness rate reached these threshold levels the us government and the federal reserve believe the us economy can avoid a recession and achieve a soft landing it is true that reasonable macroeconomic policies especially fine tuning of some policies can help accomplish a soft landing but it is not easy to realize it the us only achieved a soft landing once in the mid 1990s there are three obstacles on the path to a soft landing first the high inflation rate the consumer price index of the us hit over 5 percent in may last year and it has kept rising since then reaching the mark of over 8 percent for two consecutive months in march and april to push down the inflation level to the 2 percent target the us needs to maintain the aggregate demand at levels significantly lower than the potential output for a long period which would likely trigger a recession second this round of inflation includes some cost push factors which have been driven by the price hikes of commodities caused by the russia ukraine conflict the pandemic induced disruptions to global supply chains as well as the increased tariffs on chinese products and the subsequent impact on supply chains to rein in the cost push inflation requires stronger measures to curtail market demand if costs cannot be lowered which will accelerate a recession third low interest rates and a loose monetary environment have brought excess liquidity to the us financial market when interest rates rise rapidly and monetary policy tightens the prices of financial assets may tumble and the turbulence in the financial market will worsen the recession of the real economy if the us can effectively bring down the costs from the supply side there remains a chance of a soft landing lower costs can drive inflation rates down steadily at a time when market demand shrinks slowly thus making it unnecessary to resort to a sharp rise in interest rates and monetary tightening however the biden administration faces many hindrances in lowering the costs one effective measure to bring down costs is tax reduction regrettably there is no such option in the biden administration s policy toolkit the us government which has already rolled out massive spending packages for covid 19 relief infrastructure building and assistance to ukraine has pledged to make up for the government deficit by increasing tax in the context of growing debt pressure caused by rising interest rates it is too difficult for the biden administration to make a u turn on its tax policy another solution is to bring down the prices of major global commodities if the us terminates its economic sanctions on russia and pushes for an end to the russia ukraine conflict the prices of commodities such as energy and food will drop remarkably but instead of seeking an end to the conflict the biden administration is prolonging it by providing military assistance to ukraine and increasing the sanctions on russia obviously the biden administration s priorities are political rather than economic the us could also ask opec members to increase output to rein in the runaway oil prices however high oil prices are in the interests of oil exporters in addition as the us influence on opec members is declining countries such as saudi arabia lack the willingness to increase adequate production there is yet another way for the us to reduce costs it should secure cost effective supply chains through international cooperation but the biden administration has halted the us cooperation with china in supply chains while seeking to rebuild the supply chains that moved out of the us the us is even attempting to establish backup supply chains to those it has already established with its allies and partners all of those measures are driving up costs for the biden administration maybe the most convenient way to keep down costs is to remove the excess tariffs the previous administration imposed on chinese goods as the biden administration is adjusting the previous government s misguided trade policies lifting the tariffs is in line with the incumbent administration s overall trade policy on china and will be beneficial to the us economy but if the us still tries to use the tariffs as a bargaining chip to gain more advantages for itself and extends the tariffs either in the hope of getting extra benefits from china or under political pressure from home the us economy will continue to suffer from the high inflation in a word if the us cannot get rid of this strategic burden of tariffs soon enough and seek to bring down costs through international cooperation the risk of demand contraction will grow and a soft landing will not be achieved once interest rates surge market demand contracts sharply and the financial market is plunged into turbulence the us economy will inevitably slide into recession the author is a senior fellow of the institute of world economics and

as if the thimble riggers at the fed didn t have enough to worry about the dollar turned rabid last week threatening to transform america s still undeclared recession into a downturn for the history books the greenback s rally pushed the price of u s goods even higher for foreigners while increasing the cost of fuel that they pay for mostly in dollars in theory the dollar s strength should have alleviated pain at the pump for u s consumers unfortunately however with the cost of gas and diesel fuel thrusting to mind numbing new highs each week the effect has been so muted as to be barely noticeable wall street has noticed the gathering storm however and is doing everything possible to distribute stock to the rubes before pulling the plug last week for instance amazon was trading down around 110 a share following a 20 for one stock split the idea that stock splits are bullish is a pernicious lie that has gained currency because most investors tend to think that more of anything is better now widows and pensioners who owned just a few shares of amzn at 2000 plus per now have twenty times as many shares how fabulous is that they naturally expect those shares to rise eventually to their pre split price which would not be unusual in a prolonged bull market but we are quite possibly in a bear market now and the outcome may not be so felicitous as amzn s peanut gallery might imagine whatever the case you can count on insiders to unload as much of the stock as they can now that shares have become affordable for the masses

matsui kensetsu kk s inking device for use at construction sites is treated as a treasure of the matsui family provided by matsui kensetsu kk at least 37 550 enterprises in japan passed the century mark in being in business in march far more than in any other nation an expert noted the nation has the most centenarian corporations likely due to japanese entrepreneurs eagerness to work with regional communities and pass down businesses to their descendants in lieu of only seeking profits the united states came in second with 19 497 firms in the category according to data compiled in 2019 by teikoku databank ltd and bureau van dijk sweden ranked third at 13 997 japan s confirmed oldest corporation kongogumi co is a construction firm in osaka said to date to 578 its representatives

yokan traditional jelly also boasts a long history it was founded during the muromachi period 1336 1573 records show that toraya confectionery provided sweets under the 1586 1611 reign of emperor goyozei while candy catalogs wooden molds for confectionery making and other historical items remain at the corporation family businesses the reason what factors helped japanese enterprises survive for so long an official at teikoku databank s information analysis department cited the fact that family owned firms accounted for 51 percent of all the companies listed on tokyo stock exchange s former first section the official said such a trait while typical of japanese enterprises is rarely found outside the country the number of businesses listed on the first section and lasting 100 years or longer in japan reached 589 a huge number reported nowhere else in the world the official said matsui kensetsu kk in tokyo is japan s oldest listed company founded in 1586 next is sumitomo metal mining co founded in 1590 followed by watahan co which dates to 1598 then yomeishu seizo co which started in 1602 according to teikoku databank s accounts matsui kensetsu opened in the azuchi momoyama period 1568 1600 only four years following the honnoji incident where renowned warlord oda nobunaga 1534 1582 was killed by a retainer maeda toshinaga 1562 1614 the second lord of the kaga domain commissioned its first head matsui kakuemon to build ecchu moriyama castle in what is now toyama prefecture leading to the formation of the company successive heads of the self owned business assumed

important cultural property the donjon of odawara castle in kanagawa prefecture kanazawa castle s ishikawa gate kumamoto castle s inui turret and a palace in the core zone of nagoya castle among others we deem handing down our traditional techniques nurtured since our founding as part of our social mission said yukio matsuda chief of the general affairs department of matsui kensetsu we will continue going forward with confidence and pride to make sure matsui will keep on living up to its name as a temple and shrine contractor secrets behind longevity teikoku databank said long established enterprises tactics unique to japan is known as a growth ring model established family run businesses work harder to preserve the clans enterprises and traditions for future generations

mindset heavily affects the ways successors are selected presidents are often chosen from the founding families members while excellent staffers at times marry the previous heads daughters so they can take over more recently the wives of presidents sons take leadership depending on the trend of the times various methods have been adopted to select exceptional heads in many cases isagai pointed to long lasting family companies that frequently opt to form reciprocal relationships with nearby communities so they can flourish with local towns by creating regional brands shumai steamed dumpling

the bowmore arc 52 decanter stretches the limits of design bowmore almost two years since aston martin and bowmore revealed their debut collaboration the partnership has hit new heights with the release of arc 52 the highly aged whisky one of the oldest ever released by bowmore is the first in a new series and is presented in a decanter that pushes the limits of bottle design the 52 year old is not just one of the oldest ever released by bowmore but one of the most expensive each decanter will be priced at 75 000 and that is excluding local taxes but with just 100 available demand will far outstrip supply there is in fact evidence to suggest that 75 000 is cheap the original collaboration the black bowmore db5 originally sold for 65 000 but was soon going for almost double that at auction today you can buy one from a luxury london retailer for wait for it 260 000 how s that for a rate of return even so bowmore and aston martin have left nothing to chance with arc 52 this project is two years in the making and both luxury brands have pulled out all the stops to ensure buyers get value for money first the decanter designed by aston martin using the latest 3d printing technology it is better described as a vessel inspired by the idea of moving forward it has been designed to look as if it is in perpetual motion the man behind the decanter aston martin s chief creative officer marek reichman told elite traveler think of a sprinter on the blocks they re neither rocking backward or moving forward they re perfectly poised on their fingertips and the tips of their toes related the whole point of this shape is balance it shows the liquid and it shows the amount of time that it takes to make something and one of the greatest things about producing a car or a great whisky is its time it takes time to create what we would call perfection in beauty and bowmore would call perfection in taste view all newsletters sign up to our newsletter latest in luxury by the elite traveler team sign up here the striking top is made from high grade aluminum and can only be removed with a bespoke magnetic key which activates a complex mechanism and reveals a novel bottleneck the glass crystal was considered too reactive for this whisky is hand blown and has indentations underneath to allow the owner to hold and pour it with precision reichman said there s a beauty in the first time you open a bottle of whisky when it s got its cork in there and its foil wrap over the top you take the foil wrap off and you ve opened the bottle you can tell here you open the bottle then you seal the bottle you seal a lock afterward however if you look at it from certain angles you wouldn t know whether it s been opened or not bowmore arc 52 tasting notes aston martin went to such lengths with the vessel because they knew they were getting something special from bowmore speaking at a discreet launch at aston martin s silverstone hq master blender ron welsh revealed this expression is made from the oldest casks in bowmore s stocks that were not already designated for future releases arc 52 is a marriage of two cask styles one refill european oak one refill american oak both aged for at least 52 years and bottled at 42 3 there is nothing unusual about that combination but what is rare is a whisky that reaches such an age whilst retaining its vibrancy and freshness that is what sets arc 52 apart welsh said with arc 52 the complexity of this single malt is unquestionable and to achieve such perfect balance not only defines its physical form but unites beautifully in every drop of this stunning whisky working with aston martin remains hugely rewarding and fascinating for me it continues to inspire and show us a different way of working with absolute precision and has allowed us to create what in my opinion is the best bowmore over 50 years old that i ve ever tasted here s what we thought appearance a deep gold nose orchard fruits and mandarin with just a hint of smoke and sea salt a bit of time in the glass reveals those elusive minty notes reserved for only the oldest of fine and rare whiskies palate remarkably fresh a fruity start with green grapes and clementine coming through alongside bowmore s signature light peat style the wood influence begins to take over with notes of hazelnuts and walnuts finish the medicinal finish comes through right at the end as the fresh fruit fades and evolves into something more indulgent like butterscotch verdict we know not many of these bottles will be opened in the near future this will be an investment for some artwork for others only a small fraction of those will buy it to drink but it will inevitably be consumed one day and those lucky individuals will enjoy a whisky that has been aged to perfection so often whiskies of this age can be overwhelmed by the wood but this has kept a remarkable level of vibrancy whilst absorbing the best characteristics of an excellent aged whisky bowmore arc 52 will be available in the uk germany netherlands usa canada china singapore and global travel retail for 75 000 ex vat duty from late summer 2022 bowmore com

videothe arrest of the patriot front in idaho on june 11 has sparked widespread skepticism for some reason few seem to believe what is being presented on the news perhaps the whitmer kidnapping plot in which the undercover feds outnumbered the clueless real participants by a ratio of about 2 to 1 might be a factor in this skepticism or could it also have been caused when the fbi declined to answer whether ray epps was an undercover fed when senator ted cruz asked about this or could it also have been due to the fact that the january 6

food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and export bans have followed rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and rice a staple food in much of asia could be next industry watchers said the prices of many foods ranging from wheat and other grains to meat and oils have shot up that s been driven by a slew of factors including the rising cost of fertilizer and energy in the past year as well as the russia ukraine war food export bans or serious disruptions have included those from india wheat ukraine wheat oats and sugar among others and indonesia palm oil get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high according to the latest may data published last week to be sure rice production is still bountiful experts said but rising wheat prices and the generally higher costs of farming would make rice prices worth monitoring next we need to monitor rice prices going forward because rising wheat prices could lead to some substitution towards rice increasing demand and lowering existing stocks said sonal varma chief economist at japanese bank nomura risk of protectionism protectionist measures actually worsen price pressures at a global level for various reasons she told cnbc s street signs asia feed and fertilizer costs for farming are already rising and energy prices are adding to freight costs she added so there is a risk that we see more protectionism from countries said varma nevertheless she maintained that risks to rice are still low as global rice inventories are ample and harvests in india are expected to be good this summer russia s war on ukraine has driven up wheat prices both countries are major exporters of wheat and russia s invasion has disrupted farming and blocked grain exports from the country wheat prices have soared more than 50 since a year ago on monday of last week alone they jumped 4 after the russian military destroyed one of ukraine s largest grain exporting terminals according to reuters citing ukrainian authorities thailand and vietnam were in talks on a deal to increase the price of their rice exports according to a reuters report citing a thai government official in late may four exporters told reuters that rice traders have been buying more indian rice in the last two weeks according to a june 6 report right now i will be much more worried by india slapping an export ban on rice in the coming weeks as they were thinking about after wheat and sugar david laborde senior research fellow at the international food policy research institute told cnbc india and china are the world s top two producers of rice accounting for more than half of the global total according to the world economic forum vietnam is the fifth largest while thailand is in sixth place india imposed export bans on wheat in may citing a need to manage the overall food security of the country it also slapped restrictions on sugar just days after the wheat ban are price hikes preferable laborde said that a price increase would be far preferable to any export ban we should really differentiate between a price rise that compensates for higher costs and will benefit farmers and help them producing than an export ban that pushes prices up on world markets but pushes prices down on domestic markets he said nafees meah regional representative for south asia at the international rice research institute added that energy costs which have been rising globally are a big part of rice production costs so there is an argument to say if the market is indicating an increase in price then why shouldn t the farmers benefit from increased prices nafees told cnbc s squawk box asia but an increase in rice prices would badly affect many in asia which is the biggest consumer of the staple so in in the southeast asia pacific region countries like east timor laos cambodia and of course places like indonesia which very large population and many of whom are food insecure will be pretty badly affected if prices continue to rise and stay at these very high levels said nafees way above pre pandemic levels the u n s food price index showed prices are now 75 above pre pandemic levels said frederique carrier managing director and head of investment strategy for rbc wealth management pandemic related labor shortages and russia s invasion of ukraine have aggravated the situation by both curtailing food supply and pushing up energy prices even further she wrote in a june report about a third of food production costs are energy related carrier said fertilizer in particular is very energy intensive to produce and prices have soared since last year

the subjects tested anti drug antibody ada positive after equecabtagene autoleucel infusion among them 1 3 1 79 tested ada positive before equecabtagene autoleucel infusion and 2 5 2 79 tested ada positive within three months chimeric antigen receptor car t cell therapy is a revolutionary new pillar in cancer treatment in our previous studies equecabtagene autoleucel has shown excellent efficacy and manageable safety profiles its car structure contains fully human single chain fragment variables scfvs to bypass potential anti car immunogenicity of the host while retaining antitumor activity at the 27th eha conference we updated the data on the efficacy and safety of equecabtagene autoleucel in r r mm patients with longer median follow up extended to 9 0 months the cr scr deepened to 68 4 compared with the cr scr of 58 2 with a median follow up of 7 0 months which were released at 63rd ash conference in 2021 the updated data showed long lasting safety and deepening efficacy of equecabtagene autoleucel we are glad that equecabtagene autoleucel also shows favorable efficacy on patients who have relapsed after receiving prior car t therapy this has meaningful clinical value and is worthy of further exploration in the clinic to potentially bring forth new hope to patients with r r mm prof chunrui li md phd from tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science technology about multiple myeloma mm multiple myeloma is a deadly blood cancer that often infiltrates the bone marrow causing anemia kidney failure immune problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in remission most patients will inevitably enter the relapsed or refractory stage as there s currently no cure as a result there is a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the

the u s economy is already in the process of entering a recession according to an economist who specializes in how sentiment affects markets peter atwater predicted that a large amount of malinvested capital will be wiped out and areas of the economy that have historically been resistant to crises may not be so this time his research indicates that the economy is under the influence of confidence cycles and when consumer sentiment shifts toward the expectation of a recession the market will actually enter one i think the cake has been baked from the sentiment perspective where people are now acting on the assumption that a recession is coming and remember it s that action that actually causes a recession to come atwater a former hedge fund manager who s now a lecturer at the college of william mary in virginia said during a recent wealthion interview atwater says thousands of companies have fudged their earnings with easy cash because of the ultra low interest rates set by the federal reserve with free money the ability to financially engineer your earnings results is unlimited he said the federal reserve building in washington on jan 26 2022 joshua roberts reuters now that rates are going up such companies will start having trouble rolling over their loans it s sucking the air out of the room he said anticipating that thousands of such companies may go under as credit gets tighter a lot of dream ventures will prove to be unfeasible and fail he predicted noting that overconfidence in the market has caused investors to buy promises of even the most ridiculous things there was so much capital irresponsibly deployed to capture dreams that the volume of equity destruction is going to be massive the financial elite is so far failing to appreciate the direness of the situation because their lifestyle has become extraordinarily insulated from a commoner s reality he said calling it work from home blindness the financial elite are spending so much time sequestered away from the real world that i think they ve lost sight of the fact that the folks who are delivering things to them who live in the real world have to buy gas during previous recessions some parts of the economy were usually spared major losses and could thus serve as safe havens for investors those would include government bonds and businesses serving high end clientele such as luxury goods producers in recent years big tech companies have also been treated as safe bets a trucker gets in the cab of his truck after he fueled up at the love s truck stop in springville utah on dec 1 2021 george frey afp via getty images all of those however may get pummeled this time too according to atwater what i don t think investors quite appreciate is we re having an unwinding in both fixed income and equity simultaneously here and there s not going to be any place to hide in that businesses serving the rich meanwhile may find that their clientele is in worse financial shape than expected in recent years there are indicators that the rich have taken on large amounts of debt following the mantra of don t sell it borrow against it in order to avoid taxes atwater said it s a masterful tax strategy but it is completely devoid of a connection to reality as a result he noted nobody has contemplated that the biggest potential losses could be among the customers that have heretofore been the safest he has also noticed an unusual phenomenon in which market actors are getting worn down by prolonged market instability without actually hitting a bottom everybody they sort of feel like are we there yet is it done people are tired it s not fear it s fatigue and i ve never seen a market bottom on whining in the sense that we re just all tired of it

food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and export bans have followed rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high food prices have been on the rise in the past few months and rice a staple food in much of asia could be next industry watchers said the prices of many foods ranging from wheat and other grains to meat and oils have shot up that s been driven by a slew of factors including the rising cost of fertilizer and energy in the past year as well as the russia ukraine war food export bans or serious disruptions have included those from india wheat ukraine wheat oats and sugar among others and indonesia palm oil get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters rice could be next in line the united nations food and agriculture organization food price index already shows international rice prices creeping up for the fifth straight month to reach a 12 month high according to the latest may data published last week to be sure rice production is still bountiful experts said but rising wheat prices and the generally higher costs of farming would make rice prices worth monitoring next we need to monitor rice prices going forward because rising wheat prices could lead to some substitution towards rice increasing demand and lowering existing stocks said sonal varma chief economist at japanese bank nomura risk of protectionism protectionist measures actually worsen price pressures at a global level for various reasons she told cnbc s street signs asia feed and fertilizer costs for farming are already rising and energy prices are adding to freight costs she added so there is a risk that we see more protectionism from countries said varma nevertheless she maintained that risks to rice are still low as global rice inventories are ample and harvests in india are expected to be good this summer russia s war on ukraine has driven up wheat prices both countries are major exporters of wheat and russia s invasion has disrupted farming and blocked grain exports from the country wheat prices have soared more than 50 since a year ago on monday of last week alone they jumped 4 after the russian military destroyed one of ukraine s largest grain exporting terminals according to reuters citing ukrainian authorities thailand and vietnam were in talks on a deal to increase the price of their rice exports according to a reuters report citing a thai government official in late may four exporters told reuters that rice traders have been buying more indian rice in the last two weeks according to a june 6 report right now i will be much more worried by india slapping an export ban on rice in the coming weeks as they were thinking about after wheat and sugar david laborde senior research fellow at the international food policy research institute told cnbc india and china are the world s top two producers of rice accounting for more than half of the global total according to the world economic forum vietnam is the fifth largest while thailand is in sixth place india imposed export bans on wheat in may citing a need to manage the overall food security of the country it also slapped restrictions on sugar just days after the wheat ban are price hikes preferable laborde said that a price increase would be far preferable to any export ban we should really differentiate between a price rise that compensates for higher costs and will benefit farmers and help them producing than an export ban that pushes prices up on world markets but pushes prices down on domestic markets he said nafees meah regional representative for south asia at the international rice research institute added that energy costs which have been rising globally are a big part of rice production costs so there is an argument to say if the market is indicating an increase in price then why shouldn t the farmers benefit from increased prices nafees told cnbc s squawk box asia but an increase in rice prices would badly affect many in asia which is the biggest consumer of the staple so in in the southeast asia pacific region countries like east timor laos cambodia and of course places like indonesia which very large population and many of whom are food insecure will be pretty badly affected if prices continue to rise and stay at these very high levels said nafees way above pre pandemic levels the u n s food price index showed prices are now 75 above pre pandemic levels said frederique carrier managing director and head of investment strategy for rbc wealth management pandemic related labor shortages and russia s invasion of ukraine have aggravated the situation by both curtailing food supply and pushing up energy prices even further she wrote in a june report about a third of food production costs

by william hennelly in new york china daily global updated 2022 06 13 10 33 people fuel vehicles at a gas station in the brooklyn borough of new york us on june 10 2022 the most recent us inflation numbers came in high again and the federal reserve bank which is forecast to raise interest rates this week appears to be playing catch up the central bank s federal open market committee meets on tuesday for a two day meeting at the conclusion of which wednesday it is expected to raise the federal funds rate by 0 5 percent or 50 basis points which would still put the benchmark only around 1 5 percent another 50 basis point increase is expected in july too some economists at barclays and jefferies are speculating that it could be a 75 basis point hike next month although that is not the majority view dean croushore an economist at the fed s philadelphia regional bank for 14 years told the financial times that the fed may have to raise its key rate to 5 percent because it had waited far too long to start raising it s always tough to bring inflation down once you let it out of the bottle said croushore who now teaches at the university of richmond in virginia if they would just accelerate the rate increases a little bit more it might cause a little financial volatility in the short run but they might be better off by not having to do as much later on friday us bureau of labor statistics data showed that the consumer price index rose 8 6 percent in may compared with last year the bureau said that last month s inflation rate saw the largest annual increase since december 1981 in april the cpi was up 8 3 percent slightly lower than a 40 year high of 8 5 percent in march economists had expected inflation to rise 8 2 percent in may while core inflation which doesn t include food and energy was expected to slow further energy and food prices rose significantly in the latest reading the energy index jumped 34 6 percent the largest 12 month increase since september 2005 milk was up 15 9 percent chicken prices rose by 17 4 percent and egg prices increased by 32 2 percent i ve become more pessimistic about the opportunity of stabilizing inflation at an acceptable level without a recession jpmorgan chase co chief economist bruce kasman told bloomberg com a new survey by the financial times of london conducted with the initiative on global markets at the university of chicago s booth school of business showed that 70 percent of leading academic economists polled see the us entering a recession next year nearly 40 percent expect inflation to persist if the fed doesn t raise interest rates to 2 8 percent by the end of this year policy rate hikes will need to be relentlessly aggressive until inflation finally starts to fade even if the economy is struggling principal global investors chief strategist seema shah said in a note reported yahoo finance the personal consumption expenditures price index which is the inflation gauge preferred by the fed rose 6 3 percent in april which is more than three times the bank s target level of 2 percent the stock market wants some clear and convincing evidence that the fed can pull this off without starting a recession said lori calvasina head of us equity strategy at rbc capital markets cnbc reported allianz chief economic adviser mohamed el erian said sunday that he believes inflation will worsen he said that in a period of stagflation which is low economic growth and high prices inflation may reach 9 percent i was very puzzled when a year ago so many people were so confident that inflation was transitory he told cbs news face the nation there was so much we didn t understand about the post covid inflation that humility would have been a good idea he also noted the impact that inflation has on vulnerable communities this inflation is hurting all americans and it s hurting the poor particularly hard that we know for sure second the longer it lasts the more it s going to create demand destruction meaning that the average american not only gets hit by higher prices but they will start worrying about their income and that is not a situation that we really want to be in he said one area where many working americans are experiencing economic stress is at the gas station the national average price of gasoline in the us exceeded 5 per gallon on thursday for the first time according to fuel price tracking website gasbuddy us gasoline inventories have fallen by more than 25 million barrels equal to over 1 billion gallons since the start of march amid a global decline in refining capacity due to the covid 19 pandemic and surging demand heading into the busy summer season gasbuddy com reported us refining capacity also has fallen by some 1 million barrels daily over the last three years patrick de haan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy said it s a perfect storm of factors all aligning to create a rare environment of rapid price hikes the situation could become even worse should there be any unexpected issues at the nation s refineries or a major hurricane that impacts oil production or refineries this summer he said prices also are rising because demand doesn t seem to be responding to the surge in gas prices the price of diesel fuel averaging 5 31 according to aaa used by trucks that deliver goods to stores also has soared that increase will ultimately be reflected in the prices that the consumer pays and that s part of the increase in the cost of food and everything else bob ramorino president of roadstar trucking in northern california told cbs news
us economy will plunge into recession if a soft landing cannot be achieve cai meng china daily it seems that the united states is enjoying another economic boom its unemployment rate is at the lowest level since the 1970s wages and incomes are rising and the us dollar index has risen 6 5 percent compared with the beginning of the year president joe biden has even claimed that the us economic growth rate this year will exceed china s for the first time since 1976 however experts have warned the us economy faces the risk of recession a study by former us treasury secretary lawrence summers suggests that throughout the us history when the inflation rate is higher than 5 percent and employment rate is lower than 4 percent the possibility of a recession within a year is 100 percent in the first quarter the us inflation rate and joblessness rate reached these threshold levels the us government and the federal reserve believe the us economy can avoid a recession and achieve a soft landing it is true that reasonable macroeconomic policies especially fine tuning of some policies can help accomplish a soft landing but it is not easy to realize it the us only achieved a soft landing once in the mid 1990s there are three obstacles on the path to a soft landing first the high inflation rate the consumer price index of the us hit over 5 percent in may last year and it has kept rising since then reaching the mark of over 8 percent for two consecutive months in march and april to push down the inflation level to the 2 percent target the us needs to maintain the aggregate demand at levels significantly lower than the potential output for a long period which would likely trigger a recession second this round of inflation includes some cost push factors which have been driven by the price hikes of commodities caused by the russia ukraine conflict the pandemic induced disruptions to global supply chains as well as the increased tariffs on chinese products and the subsequent impact on supply chains to rein in the cost push inflation requires stronger measures to curtail market demand if costs cannot be lowered which will accelerate a recession third low interest rates and a loose monetary environment have brought excess liquidity to the us financial market when interest rates rise rapidly and monetary policy tightens the prices of financial assets may tumble and the turbulence in the financial market will worsen the recession of the real economy if the us can effectively bring down the costs from the supply side there remains a chance of a soft landing lower costs can drive inflation rates down steadily at a time when market demand shrinks slowly thus making it unnecessary to resort to a sharp rise in interest rates and monetary tightening however the biden administration faces many hindrances in lowering the costs one effective measure to bring down costs is tax reduction regrettably there is no such option in the biden administration s policy toolkit the us government which has already rolled out massive spending packages for covid 19 relief infrastructure building and assistance to ukraine has pledged to make up for the government deficit by increasing tax in the context of growing debt pressure caused by rising interest rates it is too difficult for the biden administration to make a u turn on its tax policy another solution is to bring down the prices of major global commodities if the us terminates its economic sanctions on russia and pushes for an end to the russia ukraine conflict the prices of commodities such as energy and food will drop remarkably but instead of seeking an end to the conflict the biden administration is prolonging it by providing military assistance to ukraine and increasing the sanctions on russia obviously the biden administration s priorities are political rather than economic the us could also ask opec members to increase output to rein in the runaway oil prices however high oil prices are in the interests of oil exporters in addition as the us influence on opec members is declining countries such as saudi arabia lack the willingness to increase adequate production there is yet another way for the us to reduce costs it should secure cost effective supply chains through international cooperation but the biden administration has halted the us cooperation with china in supply chains while seeking to rebuild the supply chains that moved out of the us the us is even attempting to establish backup supply chains to those it has already established with its allies and partners all of those measures are driving up costs for the biden administration maybe the most convenient way to keep down costs is to remove the excess tariffs the previous administration imposed on chinese goods as the biden administration is adjusting the previous government s misguided trade policies lifting the tariffs is in line with the incumbent administration s overall trade policy on china and will be beneficial to the us economy but if the us still tries to use the tariffs as a bargaining chip to gain more advantages for itself and extends the tariffs either in the hope of getting extra benefits from china or under political pressure from home the us economy will continue to suffer from the high inflation in a word if the us cannot get rid of this strategic burden of tariffs soon enough and seek to bring down costs through international cooperation the risk of demand contraction will grow and a soft landing will not be achieved once interest rates surge market demand contracts sharply and the financial market is plunged into turbulence the us economy will inevitably slide into recession the author is a senior fellow of the institute of world economics and

the grandiose promises johnson makes to survive paul mason writes rely on a state like those in the european union cowed by the voters substitution of cap subsidies by lower domestic ones may shift farmers views in one of two imminent by elections the tories are expected to lose conservative party cc by nc nd 2 0 boris johnson has survived but only just the 148 conservative mps who voted no confidence in the prime minister on june 6th represented 41 per cent of the party in parliament and 58 per cent of the british people as polled by yougov the tories voted to spare themselves a leadership contest not just because there is no clear alternative leader but because all the potential leaders represent rival factions with serious political differences grotesque lawbreaking first there are the hard brexiters who want to rip up the northern ireland protocol begin a trade war with europe and set about the radical deregulation of the british economy their most iconic leader is the former defence secretary penny mordaunt then there are the patrician social welfare conservatives in the one nation tradition of the 19th century party leader and prime minister benjamin disraeli their view was summed up by the senior backbench mp jesse norman who told johnson that his claim to be vindicated by an official s report on lawbreaking associated with serial soirées at no 10 downing street was grotesque norman complained that the policies and practices of johnson s government were at odds with a decent proper conservatism with effective teamwork careful reform a sense of integrity respect for the rule of law and a long term focus on the public good a third faction contains the remnants of the soft brexit advocates one of their prominent members on the eve of the vote called openly for a return to the european single market probably tipping some rebels back to johnson become a social europe member support independent publishing and progressive ideas by becoming a social europe member for less than 5 euro per month your support makes all the difference click here to become a member because none of these groups can command a majority nor outline any kind of common prospectus johnson remains in office but norman s letter summed up the indictment the government seems to lack a sense of mission it has a large majority but no long term plan rather you are simply seeking to campaign to keep changing the subject and to create political and cultural dividing lines mainly for your advantage at a time when the economy is struggling inflation is soaring and growth is anaemic at best the day after the vote the organisation for economic co operation and development confirmed that it expected the united kingdom economy to flatline next year brexit effects that is johnson s problem the uk economy is suffering the cumulative effects of brexit trade disruption shortages of labour and commodities inflation at 9 per cent and rising amid economic stagnation long queues at european airports for travellers returning to the uk are becoming the visual symbol of the malaise meanwhile airport chaos at home triggered by the absence of east european and other migrant workers tells the story nobody in the conservative party wants to hear brexit is failing far from solving the problems it was supposed to assuage low growth low wages low skills it has exacerbated them or in the case of skills exposed the structural flaws britain constructed the most neoliberal economy in the advanced world boosting gross domestic product by adding workers much as soviet managers used to when ordered to increase production it voluntarily destroyed its industrial base under margaret thatcher in the 1980s and even now allows the finance sector to siphon off talented graduates in computing mathematics and the hard sciences its transport and infrastructure remain substantially unmodernised and even were the public investment made available there are not enough skilled workers since thatcher s dismantling of a statutory sectoral training system based on social partnership to carry out the task pledges and slogans in short despite all johnson s bluster very little happens his first two and a half years have been pledges and slogans he promised to level up the depressed ex industrial towns of northern england but the most visible signifier of this is the erection of tall speculative apartment blocks in big cities he promised to make britain a science and technology superpower but had to intervene last month simply to prevent its last major silicon wafer fabricator falling into chinese ownership and though johnson and his ministers are always ready to pose as the saviours of ukraine the ajax programme a critical plan to modernise the army s reconnaissance regiments with 21st century kit has spent 5 billion over 12 years without a single vehicle being put into service due to technical defects causing health issues among soldiers at the root of all this is a void in the political philosophy of modern conservatism its instinct is to prefer the small state slow cautious and prudential change leaving the market and organic society to achieve progress while refusing to specify any utopian goal in practice the conservatives have created a fiscally bloated state amassing 2 trillion in debt the response to all crises being to throw money at the problem not moving the chancellor rishi sunak responded to the rising cost of living with a 10 billion tax giveaway in march and a further 15 billion show of largesse in may it s like putting petrol into a broken down car and revving the engine eventually there s no more room in the tank and while the engine s smoking the car s not moving this is precisely where the uk economy has ended up less than two years into brexit meanwhile financial markets are beginning to quantify the dysfunction sterling has fallen 13 per cent against the dollar over the past 12 months and though all central banks are being forced to raise interest rates amid slowing growth the bank of america strategist kamal sharma noted the challenges facing the b o e are unique along with a supply dynamic that it remains wholly unwilling to discuss brexit this has resulted in a confusing communication strategy hiking rates against a sharply slowing economy is never a good look for any currency the refusal to confront the problems brexit has created for trade and sterling and the determination to go on throwing fiscal firepower at short term remedies led sharma to warn that sterling was becoming seen as a currency with emerging market characteristics beneath the clowning with the pandemic the energy crisis and the dawning realisation that climate chaos is looming governments all over the world have taken on a new public purpose and while all forms of conservatism have struggled to adapt british conservatism could have been in the lead johnson instinctively is a big state dirigiste but he has struggled to make the machinery of state and the anaemic market economy work effectively to deliver results in part because he rejects the very institutions that make this happen in the european union s successful economies social partnership bodies industrial planning on regional and national scales state incentives to invest even on electric vehicles where johnson trumpeted the creation of gigafactories to produce battery packs investment in auto assembly is flowing into continental europe where britain cannot compete with the 6 billion of subsidies promised to kickstart the industry to be a dirigiste who can t do dirigisme is bad to be so alongside a continental scale economy whose institutions are geared up for dirigisme is doubly bad to cut yourself off from that continent without any feasible plan is triple bad news this ultimately is what will lead to johnson s ejection voters are beginning to see beneath the bluster and the clowning an abundance of drift and an absence of mastery this is a joint publication by social europe and ips journal

interest rates and global economic troubles caused by russia s invasion of ukraine and it s understandable why people may not be feeling great about the economy despite a still strong job market so if you re looking for ways to protect yourself financially while also making the most of what you have here are some options to consider lock in a new job nowwith ultra low unemployment and plenty of job openings it s still a job seeker s market right now but if there s a recession that could change quickly so make hay while you can if you are not working or are looking for a better position now would be a good time to take advantage of the very strong job market and lock in a position said florida based certified financial planner mari adam to help in your search here are some resume dos and don ts to keep in mind cash in on the housing boomif you ve been on the fence about selling your home now might be the time to make the leap the housing market has been on a tear with year over year home prices up nearly 15 in april and rents nearly 17 higher meanwhile mortgage rates are now about 2 percentage points higher than they were at the start of this year which makes buying a home much more expensive and that may dampen demand i would suggest that anyone planning to put their house on the market do so right away said adam home loans lock in fixed rates nowif you re close to buying a home or refinancing one lock in the lowest fixed rate available to you as soon as possible that said don t jump into a large purchase that isn t right for you just because interest rates might go up rushing into the purchase of a big ticket item like a house or car that doesn t fit in your budget is a recipe for trouble regardless of what interest rates do in the future said texas based certified financial planner lacy rogers if you already have a variable rate home equity line of credit and you used part of it to do a home improvement project ask your lender if they would be willing to fix the rate on your outstanding balance effectively creating a fixed rate home equity loan suggested greg mcbride bankrate com s chief financial analyst if that s not possible consider paying off that balance by taking out a heloc with another lender at a lower promotional rate mcbride said cover your near term cash needshaving liquid assets to cover you in emergencies or severe market downturns is always a good idea but it s especially crucial when facing big events beyond your control including layoffs which typically increase during recessions that means having enough money set aside in cash money market funds or short term fixed income instruments to cover several months of living expenses emergencies or any big anticipated expense e g a down payment or college tuition this is also advisable if you are near or in retirement in that case you may want to set aside a year or more of living expenses that you would ordinarily pay for with withdrawals from your portfolio said rob williams managing director of financial planning retirement income and wealth management at charles schwab this should be the amount you would need to supplement your fixed income payments such as social security or a private pension in addition williams suggests having two to four years in lower volatility investments like a short term bond fund that will help you ride out any market downturns and give your investments time to recover credit cards minimize the biteif you re carrying balances on your credit cards which typically have high variable interest rates consider transferring them to a zero rate balance transfer card that locks in a zero rate for between 12 and 21 months mcbride suggested that insulates you from rate hikes over the next year and a half and it gives you a clear runway to pay off your debt once and for all he said less debt and more savings will enable you to better weather rising interest rates and is especially valuable if the economy sours if you don t transfer to a zero rate balance card another option might be to get a relatively low fixed rate personal loan in any case the best advice is to make every effort to pay down your balances quickly rebalance your portfolio if neededit s easy to say you have a high tolerance for risk when stocks are soaring but you have to be able to stomach the volatility that inevitably comes with investing over time so review your holdings to make sure they still align with your risk tolerance for a potentially rockier road ahead and while you re at it rebalance your portfolio if after years of stock gains you find yourself overweight in any one area for instance if you re now too heavily weighted in growth stocks adam suggested maybe reallocating some money into slower growing dividend paying value stocks through a mutual fund also check to see that you have at least some exposure to bonds while inflation has resulted in the worst quarterly return in high quality bonds in 40 years don t count them out should a recession result from the fed s aggressive interest rate hikes to quell inflation bonds are likely to do well recessions tend to be far kinder to high quality bonds than they are to stocks bennyhoff said figure out what it means to you to lose moneyif you re keeping money in a savings account or cd any interest you re earning is likely being outpaced by inflation so while you preserve your principal you lose buying power over time then again if it s more important to preserve principal over a year or two than risk losing any of it which could happen when you invest in stocks that inflation based loss may be worth it to you because you re getting what bennyhoff calls a sleep easy return but for longer term goals figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains over time you re better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth adam said stay cool do your best then let go rapid fire news reports about higher gas and food prices or talk of a potential world war are unnerving but don t trade on the news building financial security over time requires a cool steady hand don t let your feelings about the economy or the markets sabotage your long term growth stay invested stay disciplined history shows that what people or even experts think about the

us economy will plunge into recession if a soft landing cannot be achieve cai meng china daily it seems that the united states is enjoying another economic boom its unemployment rate is at the lowest level since the 1970s wages and incomes are rising and the us dollar index has risen 6 5 percent compared with the beginning of the year president joe biden has even claimed that the us economic growth rate this year will exceed china s for the first time since 1976 however experts have warned the us economy faces the risk of recession a study by former us treasury secretary lawrence summers suggests that throughout the us history when the inflation rate is higher than 5 percent and employment rate is lower than 4 percent the possibility of a recession within a year is 100 percent in the first quarter the us inflation rate and joblessness rate reached these threshold levels the us government and the federal reserve believe the us economy can avoid a recession and achieve a soft landing it is true that reasonable macroeconomic policies especially fine tuning of some policies can help accomplish a soft landing but it is not easy to realize it the us only achieved a soft landing once in the mid 1990s there are three obstacles on the path to a soft landing first the high inflation rate the consumer price index of the us hit over 5 percent in may last year and it has kept rising since then reaching the mark of over 8 percent for two consecutive months in march and april to push down the inflation level to the 2 percent target the us needs to maintain the aggregate demand at levels significantly lower than the potential output for a long period which would likely trigger a recession second this round of inflation includes some cost push factors which have been driven by the price hikes of commodities caused by the russia ukraine conflict the pandemic induced disruptions to global supply chains as well as the increased tariffs on chinese products and the subsequent impact on supply chains to rein in the cost push inflation requires stronger measures to curtail market demand if costs cannot be lowered which will accelerate a recession third low interest rates and a loose monetary environment have brought excess liquidity to the us financial market when interest rates rise rapidly and monetary policy tightens the prices of financial assets may tumble and the turbulence in the financial market will worsen the recession of the real economy if the us can effectively bring down the costs from the supply side there remains a chance of a soft landing lower costs can drive inflation rates down steadily at a time when market demand shrinks slowly thus making it unnecessary to resort to a sharp rise in interest rates and monetary tightening however the biden administration faces many hindrances in lowering the costs one effective measure to bring down costs is tax reduction regrettably there is no such option in the biden administration s policy toolkit the us government which has already rolled out massive spending packages for covid 19 relief infrastructure building and assistance to ukraine has pledged to make up for the government deficit by increasing tax in the context of growing debt pressure caused by rising interest rates it is too difficult for the biden administration to make a u turn on its tax policy another solution is to bring down the prices of major global commodities if the us terminates its economic sanctions on russia and pushes for an end to the russia ukraine conflict the prices of commodities such as energy and food will drop remarkably but instead of seeking an end to the conflict the biden administration is prolonging it by providing military assistance to ukraine and increasing the sanctions on russia obviously the biden administration s priorities are political rather than economic the us could also ask opec members to increase output to rein in the runaway oil prices however high oil prices are in the interests of oil exporters in addition as the us influence on opec members is declining countries such as saudi arabia lack the willingness to increase adequate production there is yet another way for the us to reduce costs it should secure cost effective supply chains through international cooperation but the biden administration has halted the us cooperation with china in supply chains while seeking to rebuild the supply chains that moved out of the us the us is even attempting to establish backup supply chains to those it has already established with its allies and partners all of those measures are driving up costs for the biden administration maybe the most convenient way to keep down costs is to remove the excess tariffs the previous administration imposed on chinese goods as the biden administration is adjusting the previous government s misguided trade policies lifting the tariffs is in line with the incumbent administration s overall trade policy on china and will be beneficial to the us economy but if the us still tries to use the tariffs as a bargaining chip to gain more advantages for itself and extends the tariffs either in the hope of getting extra benefits from china or under political pressure from home the us economy will continue to suffer from the high inflation in a word if the us cannot get rid of this strategic burden of tariffs soon enough and seek to bring down costs through international cooperation the risk of demand contraction will grow and a soft landing will not be achieved once interest rates surge market demand contracts sharply and the financial market is plunged into turbulence the us economy will inevitably slide into recession the author is a senior fellow of the institute of world economics and
