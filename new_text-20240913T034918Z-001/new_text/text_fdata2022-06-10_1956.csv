uvalde parents children and a doctor as well as people who lost loved ones in a mass shooting at a grocery store in a predominately black neighborhood in buffalo n y 10 days before the robb elementary school shooting shared emotional and at times graphic testimony with u s house lawmakers during a wednesday hearing on recent mass shootings in the u s on wednesday night the house also passed a gun control measure but it s unlikely that legislation will make it out of the senate that package of proposals includes raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy semiautomatic guns like an ar 15 as well as outlawing large capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and banning bump stocks said joseph morton a congressional reporter for the dallas morning news it s a whole kind of suite of gun control measures that will go over to the senate where the near certain expectation is that it s dead on arrival morton said instead what the senate is working on with a group of bipartisan folks led by chris murphy from connecticut on the democrat side and john cornyn from texas on the republican side they are looking at a much more modest package of bills morton said the senate measure is likely to contain some sort of boost to school security and some more resources for mental health and on the gun control side probably some tweaking to the background check system potentially adding juvenile records maybe adding some supports for states to do red flag laws that are designed to get guns out of the hands of people who are disturbed before they actually commit these terrible acts morton said these debates are coming as prime time congressional hearings on the jan 6 2021 capitol insurrection begin thursday night and there is fear among democrats and gun control advocates these hearings could start to overshadow congressional response to the latest mass shootings in the u s we have the january 6th commission kicking off we are likely to get an abortion ruling from the supreme court in the near future you can go down a long list of things we expect to happen in june that s going to start pushing these shootings off the front pages and out of the newscast so i think democrats feel like they re kind of racing against the clock morton said

dover del ap the state house on thursday approved a bill banning the sale or possession of a wide variety of semiautomatic firearms in delaware the bill passed on a 22 19 vote just seven days after it was introduced and now goes to the senate which is also controlled by democrats the bill is part of a package of gun restrictions that gov john carney and fellow democrats are pushing to pass by the end of this month in the wake of recent mass shootings in other states the ban on what the bill describes as assault weapons targets more than 60 specific models of semiautomatic rifles pistols and shotguns as well as copycat weapons before the vote house majority leader valerie longhurst amended her bill to expand the types of copycat weapons that would be prohibited and to increase the penalty for violating the ban the previous definition of a copycat weapon included a semiautomatic rifle that can accept a detachable magazine and has at least two other features such as a folding stock flash suppressor or a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon the amended version requires only one additional feature to make a firearm subject to the ban and significantly expands the number and types of such features to include some commonly found on semiautomatic pistols the revised bill also increases the penalty for violating the bill s prohibitions from a felony punishable by up to three years in prison to one punishable by up to eight years behind bars democrats rejected a republican amendment to exempt holders of concealed carry permits from the bill s prohibitions longhurst a democrat from bear said her bill is one piece of a comprehensive approach to address gun violence that includes better mental health supports and school safety measures the intention of this legislation is simple and clear to make sure the next uvalde the next buffalo the next sandy hook does not take place in the state of delaware she said rep bryan shupe a milford republican suggested that supporters of the bill were being both disingenuous and divisive i am seeing reactionary policy a pattern of reactionary policy he said i don t think this is seriously going to address either the violence in our schools or the violence in our communities shupe noted that republicans introduced a bill in 2018 to spend 65 million on school safety measures such as security cameras bullet resistant glass and key card entry and exit devices the bill never made it out of committee in the democrat controlled general assembly instead the legislature approved a school safety fund that received only 10 million over two years amounting to about 22 000 per school shupe said since then no money has gone into those safety funds for our schools he said shupe also questioned the state s commitment to addressing gun violence noting that delaware s statistical analysis center which researches and analyzes criminal justice issues was unable to tell him how many crimes have been committed with guns in delaware over the past five years or how many of the guns were obtained illegally how can we say that we are serious and say this bill is anything but reactionary when we don t consistently fund we don t consistently create policy or even measure gun violence in the state of delaware he asked this is not a bill that is part of a serious plan to reduce gun violence but a reactionary policy to limit constitutional rights of the citizens of delaware in response longhurst said she was willing to work to improve funding for school safety she also suggested that shupe should introduce a resolution to improve the funding or resources available to the statistical analysis center if it will help lawmakers get the information they need i think we need to be proactive instead of reactive she said

and good morning everyone thank you for joining us on our call today in the second quarter we made continued progress in executing our powerhouse business strategy before i get into the results for the quarter always like to provide a brief overview of the company as shown on slide 3 in summary what we do is decarbonized power and produce hydrogen we do this as a leader in manufacturing stationary fuelcell platforms that leverage our proprietary technologies we operate across three continents and as we previously stated we are focused on targeting new opportunities in new markets across the globe in fact just this week we announced a collaboration opportunity in north africa our manufacturing locations are currently located in the united states canada and germany which we believe positions fuelcell energy for local content requirements and efficient distribution which is increasingly important given global supply chain constraints and clog shipping ways we have 95 platforms in commercial operation which we believe demonstrate the commercial feasibility of our products in fiscal year 2021 our revenue of nearly 70 million came from three revenue categories servicing licenses advanced technologies and generation all of which represent diversified sources of recurring revenue under multiyear contracts over the past two fiscal years we have had no revenue from product sales however product sales returned to our revenue mix in the first quarter of this year with an initial order for 12 replacement modules to service posco energy s existing installations in korea six of which were delivered in the first quarter of this year we expect to deliver additional modules from the initial order in the third quarter of this year and pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement with posco energy we expect korea fuelcell to place a non cancelable order for eight additional modules by june 30 2022 we continue to target delivery of all 20 modules by the end of fiscal year 2022 with the asian market once again open to us as a result of that agreement we are optimistic that in the future we will see revenues from new product sales in korea in addition to other asian markets as well as select countries in europe the middle east africa latin america and north america where we have made it a priority to target product sales on slide 4 you will see our purpose as a company we are committed to our purpose of enabling a world empowered by clean energy today and in the future every industry and company will be impacted by the transition to net zero and we believe our technology is well positioned the world will always need reliable power created in an environmentally responsible manner therefore when it comes to what we do we believe fuelcell energy is uniquely positioned to assist customers on a safe secure and practical path to carbon zero we believe we can do this by decarbonizing power and producing hydrogen we believe we have the only technology that can capture co2 while producing power and hydrogen and produce hydrogen power and water simultaneously fuelcell energy s technologies provide localized solutions for clean energy that deliver real time benefits to the communities in which our platforms operate while reducing scope one and two emissions we do this in a manner which supports high standards of living and economic growth while protecting the environment minimizing land use when compared to wind and solar projects avoiding costly transmission build outs and adapting to new resource challenges this purpose drives our strategic focus and the work we are passionate about doing now i will move on to the key messages for the second quarter beginning on slide 5 we continue to make steady progress advancing our strategic agenda executing against our backlog and working toward commercialization of new technologies at the 7 4 megawatt project at the u s navy submarine base in groton connecticut we have completed the commissioning process of one of the two platforms installed on site the second platform requires additional component work and when that s complete we will then resume the final stage of commissioning we expect the project to be commercially operational this summer at which time it will be added to our generation portfolio when fully operational the platforms incorporation into the microgrid is expected to demonstrate the capacity of fuelcell energy s platforms to increase grid stability and resilience it will support the u s military s efforts to fortify its base energy supply while demonstrating the u s navy s commitment to clean reliable power with microgrid capabilities another key project is the 2 3 megawatt tri generation platform we are constructing for toyota at the port of long beach that will produce electricity hydrogen and water fuelcell platform equipment has been built and delivered to the site and civil construction work has significantly advanced we are nearing the completion of the construction phase of the project with the remaining project activity anticipated to be completed in late 2022 or early 2023 as a result while we have made substantial progress we do anticipate that commercial operations will be delayed beyond june 30 2022 and we will need to request and receive from toyota an extension to the hydrogen power purchase agreement when the project achieve commercial operations this energy platform will deliver carbon neutral electricity green hydrogen and water in a region experiencing extreme drought conditions and we expect our product to improve the air quality in long beach california an area hampered by poor air quality the hydrogen produced from our platform will provide the fuel needed to power the transportation sector in both passenger vehicles and class 8 heavy duty trucks once completed this project is expected to be a real world example of how distributed green hydrogen can be deployed to repower and refuel the transportation sector including maritime aviation rail bussing and more during the quarter we continued to invest capital in our internal r d much of which is focused on driving commercialization of our patented solid oxide platform to deliver power generation electrolysis and energy storage additionally we are making progress in optimizing capacity for the carbonate platform with the goal of achieving 100 megawatts of annualized integrated onsite manufacturing and conditioning capacity the latter being a key recent development that is expected to lower costs while increasing throughput second we are also continuing to focus on the advancement of carbon capture and carbon separation technology toward commercialization following the achievement of our critical technical milestone associated with our differentiated carbon capture application under the joint development agreement with exxonmobil technology and engineering company or emtec we entered into an extension of our collaborative development agreement enabling our companies to continue working to advance fuelcell carbon capture and storage technology additionally we are also conducting a joint market study to define application opportunities and commercialization strategies and identify partners for potential pilot or demonstration projects as we pursue carbon capture across a broad landscape of industrial applications during our recent investor day presentation and our 8 k filed with the sec on march 21 2022 we highlighted that we believe the combined cumulative market for carbon capture leveraging our technology is approximately 1 trillion through 2030 we are also making progress with our first generation carbon capture and storage technologies this includes our work in the united kingdom with drax one of the largest biomass power plants in the world to capture carbon and canadian national resource limited a consortium of oil sand companies and some supporting canadian government entities my third key message is that we are continuing to build our path forward in asia we continue to build our commercial organization in korea in support of our efforts to build new opportunities in the broader asian market we believe that in korea fuelcell energy s differentiated technology is a highly desirable choice for utility scale projects given its high quality thermal attributes that support the district heating requirements in the country the korean government previously announced an aggressive hydrogen economy roadmap which should create exciting opportunities in this market in addition japan has also announced goals to expand hydrogen usage cost and supply targets we look forward to bringing our unique distributed generation and distributed hydrogen platform to the asian market as asia looks to lead in the hydrogen transition additionally recall that last quarter we reached a settlement agreement with posco energy which called for 20 replacement modules to be ordered during fiscal year 2022 to service its existing installed base six modules were delivered last quarter and while none were delivered this quarter we continue to target delivery of all 20 modules by the end of fiscal year 2022 and now i will turn it over to mike to discuss the quarter financial results in more detail mike mike bishop executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you jason and thanks to those that have joined our call today now i d like to spend a few minutes providing some details on our financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2022 beginning on slide 7 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 we reported revenues of 16 4 million compared to 14 million in the second quarter of fiscal 21 an increase of approximately 17 looking at revenues by category consistent with our expectations there were no product revenues in the second quarter as there were no modules delivered we do expect product revenues in the third quarter as we expect to deliver additional modules from the 12 module order we received from a subsidiary of posco energy in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 additionally pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement with posco energy we expect a subsidiary of posco energy to place a non cancelable order by june 30 2022 for eight additional modules we are targeting delivery of all 20 modules of which six were delivered in the first quarter by the end of our fiscal year service agreements revenues increased 300 to 2 6 million from 700 000 the increase in revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 is primarily due to the fact there was a refurbished module exchange and non routine maintenance activities during the quarter generation revenues increased 46 to 9 1 million from 6 2 million primarily due to the completion of the long island power authority or lipa yaphank project during the three months ended january 31 2022 and the higher operating output of the generation fleet portfolio as a result of module replacements during the last six months of fiscal year 2021 advanced technologies contract revenues decreased 34 to 4 7 million from 7 1 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 advanced technology contract revenues recognized under the joint development agreement with exxonmobil technology and engineering company or emtec formerly known as exxonmobil research and engineering company were approximately 3 2 million lower during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 offset by an increase in revenue recognized under government and other contracts of 900 000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 gross loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled 7 3 million compared to a gross loss of 4 8 million in the comparable prior year quarter the increase in gross loss was driven by higher manufacturing variances 4 8 million of non recoverable costs related to the construction of the toyota project and lower advanced technologies margin partially offset by reduced generation gross loss excluding the impact of the non recoverable costs related to the construction of toyota project and reduced service gross loss operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 20 9 million from 12 6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 administrative and selling expenses increased due to higher sales marketing and consulting costs as the company is investing in rebranding and accelerating its sales and commercialization efforts including increasing the size of its sales and marketing teams which resulted in an increase in compensation expenses research and development expenses were 7 7 million during the second quarter up from 3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 reflecting increased spending on the company s hydrogen commercialization initiatives namely acceleration of our commercial development efforts related to our solid oxide platform net loss was 30 1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to a net loss of 18 9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 driven by a higher gross loss and higher operating expenses additionally interest expense was higher in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year period adjusted ebitda totaled negative 21 2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to adjusted ebitda of negative 11 3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 please see the discussion of non gaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda in the appendix at the end of our earnings release the net loss attributable to common stockholders in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 31 million or 0 08 per basic and diluted share compared to 19 7 million or 0 06 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the higher net loss per common share is primarily due to the higher net loss attributable to common stockholders partially offset by the higher number of weighted average shares outstanding due to share issuances since april 30 2021 next please turn to slide 8 for additional details on our financial performance and backlog the chart at the left hand side graphically shows certain of the numbers we just reviewed for the second quarters of fiscal years 21 and 22 looking at the right hand side of the slide we finished the quarter with a backlog that was up slightly year over year to 1 33 billion primarily as a result of the addition of product sales backlog partially offset by a reduction of service and advanced technologies backlog and reflecting the continued execution of backlog and adjustments to generation backlog specifically changes to backlog reflect the addition of product sales backlog from the module order received from a subsidiary of posco energy and module exchanges in our generation portfolio that are expected to contribute to higher future output and revenues our advanced technologies backlog reflects new contracts from the u s department of energy partially offset by work performed under our joint development agreement with emtec turning to slide 9 i would like to give an update on enhanced liquidity and the ongoing investment in our project assets as of april 30 2022 we had total cash restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately 489 6 million this includes approximately 467 8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents represented by the darker blue bar on the chart in the center of the slide and 21 8 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents represented by the lighter blue bar about a year ago in june of 2021 to strengthen our liquidity and financial flexibility we commenced an at the market offering program with jefferies and barclays capital to offer up to 500 million of our common stock in the third and fourth quarters of last fiscal year we sold approximately 44 million shares under the program generating net proceeds to the company of approximately 369 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 we sold an additional 19 9 million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 118 3 million looking at the right hand side of the slide there is a chart illustrating our total project assets which make up our company owned generation portfolio we intend to continue to develop construct and grow our portfolio of project assets investments to date reflect capital spent on completed operating projects as well as capital spent on projects currently in development and under construction at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022 our gross project assets totaled approximately 264 1 million which excludes accumulated depreciation as detailed on slide 19 in the appendix of this presentation our generation portfolio totaled 76 3 megawatts of assets as of april 30 2022 this includes 41 4 megawatts of operating assets and 34 9 megawatts of projects in process as projects in process begin commercial operation they are expected to contribute higher revenue additionally as these projects in process reach mechanical completion and or achieve commercial operation we expect to seek additional long term tax equity financing as well as back leverage debt transactions to further reinvest capital back into the business please turn to slide 10 as we previously shared during our investor day in march and in our public filings we are targeting investments in three primary areas capital expenditures research and development and continued build out of our generation portfolio capital spending will be in the areas of increased capacity expansion additional test and laboratory facilities and upgrades to and expansion of our business systems we are decreasing our estimated full year capex to a range of 30 million to 40 million from an earlier estimate of 40 million to 50 million due to timing of certain investments that we now expect will be made in fiscal year 2023 rather than 2022 looking at research and development our r d efforts are focused on commercialization of our hydrogen technologies including long duration energy storage we are decreasing our estimated full year r d expenses to a range of 30 million to 40 million from an earlier estimate of 45 million to 55 million we are committed to continuing the build out of our generation portfolio which should benefit from the growth in recurring revenues as projects begin operation under power purchase agreements as of april 30 2022 the company had 34 9 megawatts of projects under development and construction some of which are expected to generate operating cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2022 to build out this portfolio as of april 30 2022 we estimate the remaining investment in project assets to be approximately 89 million for fiscal year 2022 we forecast project asset expenditures to be in the range of 40 million to 60 million we expect these investments to result in growth for the company and we believe that fuelcell energy is well positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition as discussed in our investor day we have established targets for revenue in excess of 300 million by the end of fiscal year 2025 and in excess of 1 billion by the end of fiscal year 2030 in closing we are pleased with the continued progress being made at this time while we recognize that there are some sectors that have the potential to be negatively impacted in the coming months our current view is that the combination of our substantial backlog recurring revenue from our fleet and continued sales focus will keep us well positioned for the future i will now turn the call back over to jason jason jason few president and chief executive officer thanks mike on slide 12 i want to reiterate the highlights of our powerhouse business strategy which is our guiding strategy for our journey toward long term growth the first tenet is growth we want to pursue growth in markets and customer segments where we see significant opportunities for our technology the second is scale to achieve growth we plan to scale our existing platform by investing in extending and deepening our leadership in total human capital across the organization and third innovate we believe that our continued focus on innovation will enable our participation in the growth of the hydrogen economy and carbon capture markets two opportunities where we believe the combined cumulative market through 2030 is greater than 1 5 trillion and we expect will help us deliver on our purpose our powerhouse business strategy has evolved over the past couple of years to focus on growth the energy transition is happening at an accelerated pace and we believe our technologies will play an important role in helping society achieve our global sustainability goals we are moving forward with investments in capacity capability and global talent which we believe will enhance our ability to capture more of the market opportunity over the coming years and deliver enhanced shareholder returns over the long run on slide 13 we have provided more detail on how we are working to achieve growth by pursuing global opportunities i am proud of the progress we are making as an organization and how we are growing our sales team and capabilities with the goal of achieving the long term targets shared at our recent investor day part of this is optimizing our business by which we mean capitalizing on our core technology strengths in key product markets just one example is the module cells to korea fuelcell that we discussed today these product sales utilize our existing technology and manufacturing processes to add meaningful revenue growth one of our important goals has been to drive commercial excellence and support of this i am very happy to have mark feasel recently joined our team as executive vice president and chief commercial officer i look forward to his leadership in helping to strengthen our customer centric relationships and further build our sales opportunities across applications customer segments and geographic markets to expand geographically and by market we are focused on targeting opportunities in korea and across asia europe as well as the united states and geographies across rest of the world we have made significant progress in building our sales force in asia with the goal of increasing our sales opportunities in that region we also added palmer as svp chief corporate development officer as we pursue our multi pronged growth strategy and john torrance svp solid oxide manufacturing as we commercialize and scale solid oxide in february we published our first sustainability report and i want to highlight that our dedication to achieving net zero remains in the forefront we are committed to achieving net zero on scope one and scope two emissions by 2030 and scope three emissions by 2050 we are aligned with the leading standard organizations and the un climate action goals that we can impact beyond our environmental commitments we are equally focused on our teammates the people and the communities in which we work and live and be in a diverse equitable and inclusive organization this commitment is shared across our company and our board in every aspect of our business finally to conclude my remarks on slide 15 we have executed several strategic actions to strengthen our balance sheet enhance liquidity and reduce our cost of borrowing which we believe have positioned the company to execute on our growth strategy we have well established relationships with financing providers we continue to expand our source of liquidity as evidenced by our tax equity transactions we discussed today and the liquidity provides the company with the flexibility to scale our operations and make investments in commercializing technologies as well as sales and marketing we have 1 3 billion of backlog with recurring revenues from long term contracts we believe that our technologies have a key role to play in the global goals of decarbonizing the grid developing the hydrogen economy and supporting existing energy and industrial infrastructure investments with differentiated carbon capture solutions finally we intend to be a leader in sustainability and environmental stewardship through the technology we deliver and the full lifecycle of our platforms i will now turn it over to the operator to begin q a questions answers operator our first question comes from colin rusch from oppenheimer company please go ahead your line is open colin rusch oppenheimer and company analyst thanks so much guys can we get an update on your plans to monetize the carbon capture technology beyond the development agreement i m just curious how things are emerging in a little bit more concrete way as you continue to make a lot of progress there jason few president and chief executive officer sure colin as we announced we extended the agreement with exxon through the balance of this year and one of the things that s different than what we ve talked about previously is that this agreement also the extension includes developing a joint marketing and commercialization plan around the technology and so that work is being done to really think about the customer segments and geographies that we can go after kind of as phase one if you will of the technology to demonstrate the capability for us to effectively capture carbon against industrial applications as our first target and so that will cut across when we talk about industrial applications that really thinks about boiler applications for example like the project we re doing in canada where we re capturing carbon from a process upgrade boiler where it might be a refining or petrochemical kind of application or boilers that are used in other manufacturing processes so that s the focus of that effort and we ll really look to try to likely demonstrate the technology against a couple of different geographies as well as against a couple of different kind of market segment types and that and we ll look to include as part of that kind of a full on solution set so not just the carbon capture but what s the infrastructure to actually move co2 to a point of sequestration for an example what s the subsurface kind of worker technology that we re going to use to actually execute against the sequestration so it will be a full wholesome plan around how we re going to commercialize the technology and move it forward colin rusch oppenheimer and company analyst and then now that you ve got some additional sales resources working on few geographies can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics and where you guys are competing well where you might need to make some changes in terms of growing that business on the product side and really driving some sell rate revenue jason few president and chief executive officer yes sure so when we look at our business and if i just kind of break the world into two and i say the u s and rest of the world we see about 40 of our opportunity really across the u s and about 60 across markets inclusive of the eu mid east africa latam asia as an example and then when you look at the particular applications we see utility opportunities across all of those markets we see food and beverage when you think about our opportunity to deliver co2 from a utilization standpoint so not just sequestration i mean if you look at just today in the financial times for example it was reported that cf industries is shutting down one of its fertilizer plants and cheshire that s going to have an impact on not only fertilizer and food supply but on co2 for meat processing we think those kind of applications represent great opportunities for us and we re seeing that across the globe in terms of opportunities that we look at in the u s we see more focus around microgrid grid resilience and reliability and we think that we compete quite effectively there and we have a number of demonstrated applications and we also see biofuels as an opportunity that s going to continue to be strong for us given some of the uniqueness of our capabilities and particularly on the carbonate side and then when we look to international markets and we talk about markets like for example like korea we definitely see district heating and cooling as a big opportunity because that s a big part of the market there and then we see strong interest in distributed hydrogen and distributed hydrogen for multiple ways of producing hydrogen so even outside of the u s kind of hub concept that s coming out of the infrastructure package we see distributed hydrogen demand being produced from fuel and so we think as we demonstrate the toyota project we re seeing strong port interest as a ship to shore resource as well as distributed hydrogen for goods movement at a port level and we re seeing that not only in the u s but other parts of the world and then of course a lot of strong interest in electrolysis and that s the project we just announced or mau in north africa that s all around leveraging our technology around electrolysis and then being able to leverage great sun coverage in north africa and pipelines to move that hydrogen back into italy and the eu markets as an example operator our next question comes from laurence alexander from jefferies please go ahead your line is open unknown speaker hey good morning this is actually kevin on for laurence alexander so my first question is sort of broad and has to do with green and blue hydrogen i guess a bit of the toyota project i guess i m just curious to hear how long you think it would take to build out further green hydrogen capacity and i guess that s something you thought you might be interested in and my second question has to do with gross margins basically when do you expect them to turn positive and any commentary there would be helpful jason few president and chief executive officer yes so when we think about green hydrogen or blue hydrogen or pink hydrogen you kind of pick a color we really try to think about it more from a carbon intensity standpoint because we think that s really a better way to think about hydrogen and the hydrogen that s going to be delivered for particular applications or use cases in the case of the toyota project because we re leveraging r d we re delivering green hydrogen we re delivering carbon neutral power and water on that project and we think that those kind of projects are going to continue to be real opportunities for us both domestically and internationally and so we think there s an opportunity to maybe move those projects forward more rapidly versus some of the pure green electrolysis hydrogen projects because one of the things that s still a bit of a challenge you have there is infrastructure for moving that hydrogen without putting it in a tube trailer and putting it on a truck and moving it and so there s work that still needs to be done there but we think our ability to do distributed hydrogen even leveraging fuel and delivered green hydrogen in that application will be a strong opportunity for us and yes we are very interested in more of those opportunities and expanding that both domestically and internationally and maybe i ll let mike talk a little bit about the margin profile mike bishop executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer sure thanks jason so from a margin perspective maybe i ll just walk through line items on our p l and give you my perspective there so this quarter consistent with our expectations we did not have any product revenue recall last quarter we had 18 million of product revenue from a subsidiary of posco energy that generated about 18 margins we do expect the balance of that order that was a 60 million order we expect the balance of that to be delivered by the end of our fiscal year so you ll see additional revenue and margin coming from that line item service revenue this quarter about 2 6 million that was negative margin service is variable as the fleet expands we do expect positive margins from service generation you ll typically see margins negative to flat what s coming through generation is really two things we have depreciation and then we ve also been expensing project costs related to the toyota project in that line item so how the company thinks about generation is really on an ebitda basis typically we re targeting ebitda margins in the 40 to 50 and if you back out those two line items that i just mentioned that brings you ebitda margins around 42 for the quarter and then finally advanced technologies you ve consistently seen positive margins from advanced technologies that advanced technologies is a combination of our work with emtec or exxonmobil and this quarter you saw margins in the range of 25 coming through advanced technologies operator our next question comes from noel parks from tuohy brothers please go ahead your line is open noel parks tuohy brothers analyst hi good morning i have a couple of things one is that there was a mention earlier about module exchanges in the generation portfolio and how much visibility do you have into the timing of those mike bishop executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer this is mike i ll take that one so the way to think about our generation portfolio these are typically 20 year assets these are assets held by the company on balance sheet and the reason why the company has retained a generation portfolio is to benefit from the long term recurring cash flows and you ve seen revenues from our generation portfolio increased in recent quarters as projects have come online for example the lipa yaphank project came online in the first quarter and that s why you re seeing higher revenues coming through so what the way that we kind of think about this is will as we continue to build out the fleet you ll see higher revenues coming through from this portfolio noel parks tuohy brothers analyst and the module exchanges that those are sort of predictable mike bishop executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i m sorry just to follow on to the module exchanges the so over the course of the power purchase agreement you we will replace modules and the way our technology works is the current lifecycle of modules that we re deploying today is around seven years so we have visibility to be able to plan out those module exchanges and when they occur that will lead to higher revenue because the module essentially degrades about 10 over its life so you re seeing slight reductions in revenue over time and then when the new module comes online that s what leads to the revenue increase sorry i wasn t clear in my first answer there noel parks tuohy brothers analyst no problem at all and i just wanted to touch on the toyota project you ve mentioned a couple of times about the booking of cost for that and just looking ahead of it is there a shift in how the costs get represented upon or approaching final commissioning that we ll see in the future mike bishop executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so the toyota project we the way to think about that project we have not yet secured a renewable natural gas contract for that project so as a result we re not able to fully estimate the project economics so what we ve been doing from an accounting perspective and going back several quarters which has been disclosed we re capitalizing recoverable costs which is essentially the power plant and expensing site work and what we re calling non recoverable costs as we get closer to commissioning the company is working on securing that renewable natural gas source economics will become clearer and there might be an opportunity to capitalize additional costs going forward but that really is dependent on the future economics of the project the project we do expect to be cash flow positive as or ebitda positive in the range that i talked about for our other projects but as i mentioned we are expensing part of the capital cost of that project noel parks tuohy brothers analyst great and i just wonder sort of as a general topic we have been hearing more i guess over the past six months or one year about hydrogen hub projects many of them sort of independently financed there is also potential support from the infrastructure bill in the mix and i just wonder as you see those developing across different regions just where those trends might fit in with what you foresee for hydrogen adoption overall and whether those would have an influence on your own business jason few president and chief executive officer yes noel this is jason few look we think the hydrogen hubs for an exciting opportunity if you look at the infrastructure package that was actually signed by president biden there s about 9 5 billion allocated toward hydrogen related items everything from these hydrogen hubs which is roughly about 8 billion and then you ve got another 1 5 billion between infrastructure and additional r d kind of allocated out of that total 1 trillion plus infrastructure package the original intent or what was described by the doe was to do four hydrogen hubs around the country kind of conventional wisdom right now is that s probably going to be at least 8 and what you ve seen are a number of states and or entities kind of pair up to actually be in a position to submit programs or proposals to the doe to win those hydrogen hub opportunities so as an example we are participating in a number of those but just to give an example in connecticut we re part of one that includes connecticut new jersey new york and massachusetts as an example and so if you consider that the northeast corridor the plan is to put together a program that will be compelling for the doe to want to support that project and there ll be funding from the doe there ll be funding from the companies in the states to try to make those projects successful in demonstrating hydrogen production and utilization and one of the things as you think about the doe what they ve indicated that they want to do is show hydrogen production from a multitude of sources so just to give you a perspective for our company we can demonstrate as we re doing with toyota the ability to produce hydrogen utilizing fuel so that might be one way that the doe is interested in showing distributed hydrogen being produced via fuel perhaps for transportation application or some other use for that hydrogen they also want to be able to show hydrogen production from renewable energy like wind and solar so that s where technology that we re working to commercialize like our electrolysis platform could be utilized to demonstrate converting renewable energy and water into hydrogen and then using that hydrogen potentially for power production or using that hydrogen as a potential replacement fuel for manufacturing steel or using it in gas blending applications to bring down the carbon intensity on that gas so a number of different ways we think these hubs are going to come together we re participating in a number of those the doe s rfp if you will has not come out yet so everyone is waiting on that and that really will kick off the process in earnest operator our next question comes from eric stine from craig hallum please go ahead your line is open eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst everyone thanks for taking the questions so maybe just sticking with toyota could you just go into a little more detail i know you said you re almost done with construction but there are a few more steps left and you need to get an extension on the ppa i mean do you anticipate any challenges on that or what are kind of the next things we should look for going forward jason few president and chief executive officer yes eric this is jason and maybe i ll just start and then i ll turn it over to mike to maybe michael lisowski to maybe talk about the project itself we are making very solid progress in the project and as we indicated we re close to on the mechanical side we believe that toyota remains very committed to this project and this is part of the process in these projects to work through extensions or those types of things i mean if you think about this project and you go back to the very beginning as you may recall we were initially delayed as a result of some issues with the utility wanting to challenge the puc so we had to work through those issues that really began the initial delay in this project and so i think both toyota and fuelcell have worked through extensions previously in this and we think that we ll get through this as well and we think that they remain very committed to the project and in fact i mean if you were to actually be at the port of long beach right now you would see a pretty impressive view of the platform that s there and so i think they re excited as are we mike i don t know if you want to talk about the project some more mike lisowski executive vice president and chief operating officer yes thank you jason and thank you eric for the question this is mike lisowski chief operating officer i m quite proud of the advancement and progress made on execution of this project just to unpack it a little bit the design of the platform is complete all of the engineered equipment and skids have been fabricated and built and have been delivered to the site as jason highlighted the site civil construction is that element of execution is nearing completion and all of the mechanical equipment is being assembled and connected together we ve launched the electrical assembly portion of the work and then the way to think about the remaining steps is we will once complete through mechanical completion we ll then engage and launch the commissioning process and that s work that we ll thoughtfully work through bringing the plant up and commissioning the plant and bringing it to commercial operation as indicated later this calendar year into the perhaps the beginning of next calendar year but as jason highlighted the progress on the site is very visible quite impressive and we re continuing to march forward very collaboratively with toyota on the project and looking ahead to commercial operation eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst and in terms of i mean i know there s a lot of activity going on in renewable natural gas i mean also a lot of competition for those volumes but i would is it safe to say that you re not all that worried about an rng contract to feed the facility jason few president and chief executive officer no look we think that getting rng is not going to be a challenge for the facility just given the volumes that are there the number of projects that are going on in california we think that there s going to be continued development around rng and i mean the other thing that you re seeing which we think is a positive as you re seeing the major integrated is getting into the rng space in a major way and we believe that they re going to participate in this area at large volumes because that s what they do and so we feel pretty good about that eric stine craig hallum capital group analyst yes absolutely ok well then maybe last for me just on the product side i know you ve you re certainly focused on that you ve got the agreement or the amended agreement with posco but just curious i mean you re clearly more positive but anything you can maybe give in terms of detail around quoting levels or the pipeline and i m not sure if you re willing to make a prediction on timing of when you might see some product momentum outside of the replacement modules jason few president and chief executive officer yes here s what i would say about that and as you know we don t give forecast on that but what i would say is we think the sales cycle is a 12 month 18 month kind of sales cycle although we terminated our agreement for example with posco in it was june of 2021 or something like that we 2020 we still had that overhang out there between the dispute that we had going and now that that s resolved i would tell you the engagement level from prospective customers as well as existing is much stronger now that that cloud has lifted and so we feel really good about that and then just in general our focus in growing our sales team and having a focus in broader markets around the world which tend to be more product purchase markets than ppa markets as has been our traditional experience in the eu we would expect that to continue and we would certainly expect to see that in other parts of the world where we re expanding the business operator we have no further questions in queue i d like to turn the call back over to jason few for closing remarks jason few president and chief executive officer julianne thank you very much i appreciate that and really want to thank everyone for joining the call

hello everyone thank you for joining nio s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker in the first quarter of 2022 we delivered 25 768 premium smart electric vehicles another record quarter with a growth of 37 6 year over year william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker since the second half of march new wave of coronavirus outbreaks in certain regions in china has impacted our vehicle production and deliveries in april and may we delivered 5 074 and 7 024 vehicles respectively starting from june while the supply chain and the vehicle production have basically returned to normal our vehicle deliveries have also gotten back on track in shanghai and several other important markets we will continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to further improve the overall supply chain production capacity and accelerate vehicle delivery we expect the total delivery in the second quarter of 2022 to be between 23 000 to 25 000 units william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker despite the outbreak our products have continued to witness a robust demand our order intake stayed strong especially for et7 and reached a new high in may we believe the launch of new products will drive continuous order growth in the meantime governments at all levels in china have also introduced a positive policies to encourage vehicle consumption and purchase of electric vehicles this will further promote the up trading and new purchase of premium smart electric vehicles going forward we will further increase the overall supply chain production capacity and we are confident of ramping up of our deliveries at a much faster pace in the second half of this year william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker in terms of vehicle gross margin the whole industry is faced with the rising cost of batteries raw materials and chips which has also affected our vehicle margin in the first quarter our vehicle margin stood at 18 1 as the battery cost continued to surge and peaked in april the vehicle margin in the second quarter will be under even higher pressure to mitigate the impact of the rising material costs we have taken a series of countermeasures such as adjusting product prices with the deliveries of new products higher revenue per vehicle and increasing production output we expect the vehicle margin to start bouncing back from the third quarter william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker on may 20 2022 nio was listed on the main board of the singapore exchange which marks another important milestone of nio with that we have further enhanced our footing in the global capital markets which led us to better connect with the investors and serve investors from around the world it is also of great significance for our global business development william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker in addition according to the announcement made by the hang seng indexes co limited nio will be included in the hang seng tech index and the hang seng composite index starting from june 13 william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker next i would like to share with you some updates on our recent operations and r d william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker research and development of new products and core technologies has been one of nio s long term strategic focuses we have been making positive progresses on various related fronts william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker on march 28 we started to deliver et7 with extraordinary handling and the riding experience has been well recognized by the users and the media since the delivery of et7 we have made fast iterations and released more smart features via phone updates on a continuous basis we have introduced over 200 new features on the nt2 0 platform with the next generation voice interaction and emotion engine technologies nomi s interactive experience is comprehensively upgraded the driver assistance system powered by nio s full stack in house algorithm has achieved outstanding performance in external reviews and the build tech in the third quarter we will release nop plus based on the hd map co developed with our partner enabled by the powerful software and hardware platform full stack in house algorithm and end to end pursuit data collection and operations capabilities nt2 0 is capable of fast iteration and upgrades laying a solid foundation for releasing nev services in more scenarios and providing the autonomous driving experience beyond expectations william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker on april 29 the first et5 tooling trial builds roll off the production line in f2 at neopark the team is working toward the final stage of mass production of et5 and the delivery is expected to start this september william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker this month we will unveil es7 a brand new mid to large five seater suv based on the nt2 0 and we ll start the delivery in late august william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker we will continue to step up our investments in battery related too as of now we have over 400 employees working on battery related technologies including battery materials cell and pack design battery management systems and manufacturing processes we aim to build and enhance our comprehensive battery r d and industrialization capabilities to improve the competitiveness and the profitability of our products in the long run william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker with regards to production f1 has fully resumed capacity to the level before the recent outbreak in addition we will further ramp up the production output on a gradual basis to support the mass production of the new products nio f2 and neopark has completed the production line installation and tooling and has entered into the production validation phase it will be put into operation from the third quarter this year it only took us 12 months from kicking off construction to rolling off the first tooling trial build in f2 which is a record construction speed in the industry william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker in terms of the sales and service network we now have 381 new houses and new spaces in 152 cities as well as 247 new

over to steven to provide the financial details for the quarter steven please go ahead steven feng chief financial officer thank you william i will now go over our key financial results for the first quarter of 2022 and to be mindful of the length of this call i will refer to rmb only in my discussion today i encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release which is posted online for additional details our total revenues in the first quarter were rmb 9 9 billion representing increase of 24 2 year over year and remained stable quarter over quarter our total revenues are made of two parts vehicle sales and other sales vehicles sales in the first quarter were rmb 9 2 billion representing an increase of 24 8 year over year and remained relatively stable quarter over quarter increase in vehicle sales year over year was mainly attributed to higher delivery other sales in the first quarter were rmb 0 7 billion representing an increase of 15 6 year over year and remained relatively stable quarter over quarter the increase in other sales year over year was mainly attributed to the increased sales of service and energy packages and others in line with the incremental vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2022 which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from battery upgrade services gross margin in the first quarter was 14 6 compared with 19 5 in the first quarter of 2021 and 17 2 in the fourth quarter of 2021 the decrease of gross margin year over year was mainly attributed to the decrease of vehicle margin and reduction in other sales margins resulting from expanded investment in our service network the decrease of gross margin quarter over quarter was mainly attributed to the decrease of vehicle margin more specifically vehicle margin in the first quarter was 18 1 compared with 21 2 in the first quarter of 2021 and 20 9 in the fourth quarter of 2021 the decrease of vehicle margin year over year was mainly driven by the lower average selling price due to changes in our product mix the decrease of vehicle margin quarter over quarter was mainly attributed to the increased battery cost per unit r d expenses in the first quarter were rmb 1 76 billion representing an increase of 156 year over year and remained stable quarter over quarter the increase of r d expenses year over year was mainly attributed to the increased personnel costs in research and development functions as well as for incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies g a expenses in the first quarter were rmb 2 01 billion an increase of 68 3 year over year and a decrease of 14 6 quarter over quarter the increase in sg a expenses year over year was primarily due to the increase in personnel costs in sales and service functions and costs related to the sales and service network expansion the decrease in sg a expenses quarter over quarter are attributed to the decrease of marketing and promotion expenses decrease marketing and promotion expenses incurred from the hosting of nio day in december 2021 as well as decrease of professional services expenses loss from operations in the first quarter was rmb 2 19 billion representing an increase of 639 7 year over year and decrease of 10 5 quarter over quarter net loss in the first quarter was rmb 1 78 billion representing an increase of 295 3 year over year and decrease of 16 8 quarter over quarter net loss attributable to nio s ordinary shareholders in the first quarter was rmb 1 83 billion representing a decrease of 62 6 year over year and a decrease of 16 3 quarter over quarter our balance of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and short term investment was rmb 53 3 billion as of march 31 2022 now this concludes our prepared remarks i will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our q a session questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of jeff chung from citi please ask your questions jeff chung citi analyst so i have two questions one is the second quarter gp margin outlook so it looked like the high margin products as a percentage of sales in the second quarter could reach about 37 versus 17 in the first quarter i think this is one of the positives that may potentially lift up the gp margin trend and secondly is that there has been some msrp hike recently and we would like to know how much of the sales volume from the second quarter has been a price hike versus the first quarter obviously this is the first question and the second question is that our new model cycle suggests that our current aging products three products is going to turn into 6 new products into the next 6 to 12 months so my question is whether the third quarter production capacity can reach above 48 000 units since by referring to tesla we saw a strong week on week and month on month recovery from the past weeks and my understanding is that a lot of our supply auto part suppliers are overlapped with the tesla so if tesla recover fast would that mean that we are going to enjoy the similar pace into june and the third quarter thank you william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker thank you for your question jeff starting from april we actually updated our agreement with our battery supplier catl and right now our battery cost is connected with the raw material indexes so basically it means that if in the second quarter we can see the battery cost is going to significantly increase compared with that of the first quarter and this is going to affect of vehicle gross margin performance but there s going to be some latencies the battery prices increase in the prior month is going to be reflected in the battery cost of the later months and this is going to incorporate it into our bigger gross margin performance according to the current forecast and the market trend we can see the battery cost is going down a little bit starting from may and we have also taken some measures for example increasing our product prices this is going to help us improve our performance in the third quarter right now we are still delivering vehicles without the price adjustment and we expect to start to deliver the vehicles with the price adjustment starting from the third quarter because our business model is made to order or order to delivery so just now you have also mentioned that our products with higher gross margin is also going to kick in in terms of the performance of the vehicle gross margin just as the et7 that is launched in the second quarter and we expect the production of et7 is going to gradually ramp up starting from june and then starting from the third quarter is going to maintain at a normal level overall speaking we believe our vehicle gross margin is going to face a higher pressure in the second quarter so this is mainly due to the battery cost impact the vehicle gross margin of the second quarter is going to be lower compared with that of the first quarter but with the price adjustment we expect we are going to start to deliver the vehicles with higher prices starting from the third quarter which is going to contribute to our vehicle gross margin william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker with the production capacity expansion in the f1 we expect that this is going to start to improve the overall production output starting from june of course it will need some time to gradually ramp up the production but we believe the vehicle production is not going to be a bottleneck and the demand is not an issue for us the main challenges that we re facing right now is the supply chain especially in terms of the chipset and also the production capacity of our suppliers we are very confident of our delivery performance starting from the third quarter william li founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tim hsiao from morgan stanley please ask your questions tim hsiao morgan stanley analyst so let me translate my questions the first question is about orders so could you please provide further details the order et7 dominate the current order intake while the demand for incumbent suv are falling more meaningful and are we going to have the current suv model any time soon and you mentioned the record order book does that include the orders of et5 my second question is about batteries because during the presentation i think william mentioned nio now has more than 400 related battery related technology covering cell pack bms and more will nio consider involving more in battery production over time or seek for fashionable battery oems vendors help to produce the battery base on nio s home patents and the technology so those are my two questions thank you william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker thank you tim for your question regarding your first question for order basically in may our order growth is quite significant and this actually includes the order intake for the existing es8 es6 and ec6 the overall order intake performance of the existing es8 es6 and ec6 is quite steady and we have witnessed certain growth you have also mentioned whether we are planning for some upgrades of our very existing models we are planning for incorporating some smart hardware and some new software features for the upgraded version of the existing models william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker after we launched the et5 in last year s nio day we have witnessed the steady growth of the order intake recently because of the auto shows and exhibitions we have witnessed a very positive order performance of et5 william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker just now for the 400 this is actually about the r d teams focusing on the battery technologies we have over 400 employees for this we plan to leverage our r d capabilities in terms of the battery to launch an 800 volt high voltage battery pack which will also support the battery swapping technologies in 2024 we understand that this is going to bring many innovative technologies and revolutional solutions we believe that this unified pack concept is going to redefine the battery technologies in terms of the battery cost and the battery safety our plan right now is to start the production of these new next generation battery pack in the second half of 2024 our long term battery strategy is going to be a combination of in house production and also outsourcing we believe that this long term strategy is going to benefit the overall competitiveness and the vehicle gross margin as well as the profitability of nio s products this is also going to be of william li founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you tim operator thank you our next question comes from bin wang from credit suisse please ask your question bin wang credit suisse analyst i actually want to quantify the margin because you actually said that second quarter will be a low margin can you say what s the level of the decline in margin because you actually raised the price for current gross by around rmb 10 000 can assume that is the decline in the gross profit margin gross profit just rmb 10 000 you also mentioned that in the third quarter we re back to normal what s the back to normal are you referring to you referred to 18 gross margin in the first quarter or an after peak level of around 21 meanwhile i suppose you will further increase the price for the upcoming battery semiconductor intention corporate version of content product is that going to be another increase in the gross margin thank you william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker thank you bin for your question regarding the price increases for our products previously i have also explained that this is going to be reflected in our vehicle gross margin in the third quarter because right now we are still delivering vehicles without the adjusted price for the second quarter the battery cost is higher than that of the first quarter but the impact of this is still uncertain specifically we believe it s going to be higher than the rmb 10 000 you have just mentioned but we believe there s still many uncertainties that we need to weigh out a little bit because just like i mentioned right now the battery cost of products is actually based on the raw material trends and the index so it means that for the third quarter we will probably see some trends of the raw material cost going down a little bit and with our vehicle gross margin improvement based on the nio technology platform 2 0 the vehicle gross margin in the third quarter we believe it s going to bounce back but there are still many uncertainties because the battery cost is very difficult to forecast and to determine at this moment william li founder chairman and chief executive officer operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ming hsun lee from bank of america please go ahead ming hsun lee bank of america merrill lynch analyst my first question could you also give us some guidance regarding your potential product pipeline for 2023 especially for the a66 will you consider to launch the new generation in next year second question is regarding your services others business first on the revenue side it decline q on q is it because of covid impact and secondly the gross margin over this business is also not very good for the quarter it s also is this because of the lower utilization when you build a new battery swap station and what do we expect the margin improvement for this business william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker thank you ming for your question of course for the existing models including the es8 es6 and the ec6 our plan is to upgrade all those models to the platform in the next year stanley qu vice president finance ming this is stanley the other operating loss mainly because the increase in depreciation and also operating expenses related to our power swap stations and in this year we will continue to build the battery charging and swapping network which can bring the unique experience to our users and can benefit the further improvement of our user satisfaction and also brand image so from a short term i think the other loss will increase along with the expansion of the network and from the long run the numbers of the delivery and also users grow we will make our charging service charging and swapping services more efficient the losses arising from the charging and swapping service will gradually narrow down and our innovative business models including nio life and also adas can also bring extra gross profit and booked in this account thanks ming operator thank you the next question comes from nick lai from j p morgan please ask your question nick lai j p morgan analyst let me explain very quickly my two questions first is regarding supply chain can you give us an update on supply condition in june as well as second half and as well as the pricing with battery supplier has recent price hike reflect the cost increase in the first half and will battery cost continue to rise in the second half are we going to revise our price again in the second half as well so and second a quick update on our mid market brand strategy thank you william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker yes thank you for your question there are many uncertainties in terms of the chip supply because in our vehicle we probably have over 1 000 chips and the chip shortage situation for those 1 000 chips may vary from time to time and this is totally depends on the upstream suppliers of the tier 1 suppliers of nio many of the chip shortage is actually caused by the basic chipsets used by those tier 1 suppliers or the upstream suppliers of those tier 1 suppliers for example like ti and infineon they provide various kind of chips to oems and it s very difficult to actually identify specific risky chips that we are going to face the shortage that is why we do have a risky chip list normally it includes probably around 1 to 20 different kind of chips and this list may change month to month of course we will try to mitigate all those risks with different kind of measures previously our plan is to expand our production capacity starting from the second half of this year so that s why starting from last year we have already started to work closely with all our suppliers to make sure we can secure sufficient supplies for our products we have some risks in terms of the chip supply but we believe this is actually manageable and is under control for the production capacity of the in the month of june this is actually not specifically related to the chip shortage or other supply chain risk this is just a part of the normal ramp up process for the production capacity expansion william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker regarding the second question of the battery starting from april our battery cost is linked together with the raw materials of the batteries in the market we can see the raw material costs actually picked in april and we started to see some trend of going down specifically for the lithium carbonate in china we have already started to see there are more resources for the lithium and there are some companies trying to mine the lithium to make sure they can supply to the market and meet the demand so i believe the general consensus of the industry is already peaked in april so it s going to gradually go down but of course people have a different forecast in terms of what is going to be the final cost of those raw materials some people may think that the lithium carbonate is going to go down to around probably rmb 30 000 per ton this means that we are going to reduce the cost of the lithium carbonate by 20 to 30 and we also have a similar forecast for the nickel material as well so we believe the general trend is the cost of those battery materials is going down but and it s not going to go up again william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker the next question is about the mass market brand our plan is to start the delivery of the products of the mass market brand starting from the second half of 2024 this product is going to be based on the nio technology platform 3 0 and we believe the mainstream products of the mass market brand is going to be at the price range from rmb 200 000 to rmb 300 000 of course the mass market brand products will also support battery swapping and we are going to use our in house development and manufacture the batteries for the mass market brand product william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker of course this plan is going to support high voltage technologies and we believe with all those advanced technologies and the competitive pricing those products under the mass market brands are going to be very competitive william li founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from paul gong from ubs please ask your question paul gong ubs analyst let me translate my questions the first question is related to es7 why from unveiling launch until delivery it seems to be a lot faster than the previous et7 or et5 and how do you think about the cannibalization versus es8 es6 and ec6 given they are all kind of suvs of similar size my second question is regarding the supply chain preparation for the nt 2 platform currently it seems that the et7 production remains to be relatively slow in terms of ramp up with pretty long waiting period in view we are going to have an et5 with major volume and es7 in the pipeline have we done enough work to secure the key components supply to enable the ramp up of the overall nt 2 platform models thank you william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker thank you paul for your question regarding the first question we have always been working on the development of our new products and we have been working on the development of the es7 for some time and the launch time of the es7 is actually already planned when we were developing the product main things right now is very close to the delivery of the es7 but previously our plan is to launch the es7 earlier due to the impact of the covid 19 we delayed a little bit that is why it seems that the it s much closer to the actual delivery of the es7 but everything is actually going forward according to our plan es7 is going to be based on the nio technology platform 2 0 which is going to be offering higher and smarter technologies compared with the current nt 2 nt 1 technology platform so and the current es8 es6 and ec6 are actually based on the nt 1 technology platforms there will also be some price differences the price positioning of the es7 is going to be between that of the es8 and es6 we believe that there is not going to be cannibalizations between the es7 and the existing models because we have different positioning and pricing strategies for those products for example the es8 is mainly focusing on the six seater and seven seater markets and the es7 is positioned as a mid to large five seater suv which has higher pricing compared with that of the es6 for the second question of course we have already and actually started at a very early stage to plan for the production ramp up of the products based on the nt 2 platform and we have already done this for some time of course there are going to be some risks but because we have planned ahead we believe it is still manageable william li founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you paul operator thank you our next question comes from yuqian ding from hsbc please go ahead yuqian ding hsbc analyst so i ve got two questions first is to ask about whether our price hike in may is enough to cover the cost headwind from the battery side aluminum body and also the chip alignment in the channel and what s the management thoughts about the actual cost and also the pricing strategy going forward and second question is to ask about et5 volume and margin conviction we know there s a bit of auto business splash on the entry luxury which is the currently et7 has been located within the segment and also previously we have designed 20 above margin but back in time we haven t considered we might not consider the cost headwind coming from the commodity side might persist longer william li founder chairman and chief executive officer stanley qu vice president finance hi yuqian this is stanley for cost increase of battery i think william has give us a lot of guidance and regarding the price increase of other material and also chip cost i think we have absorbed through close cooperation with our partners and also internal efficiency improvements and also as william introduced the whole market for the key raw materials are quite dynamic at this moment we cannot give the precise like estimation of the following months or quarters the trend so for the second question william william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker for the et5 because we have already accumulated a significant amount of reservation orders so if we consider the production of the et5 we believe for this year the production of et5 will only be sufficient to meet the backlog for the et5 orders so this price increase of the et5 is not going to have any impact of our vehicle gross margin performance this year operator thank you our next question comes from vijay rakesh from mizuho please ask your questions vijay rakesh mizuho securities analyst yeah hi i have quick two questions on the on your in house capacity with hefei you have talked about 240 000 annual capacity do you think you get to that 20 000 a month run rate by end of q3 of this year q3 22 and the second question is on the neopark that obviously has an incremental additional 300 000 per year capacity you talked about ramp starting that in q3 can you walk through how that ramp should look will it be like 10 000 a month exiting this year and then gradually increase next year that s it thank you very much william li founder chairman and chief executive officer steven feng chief financial officer ok so vijay thanks for your question for the production capacity of our first plant with jac nio as we have mentioned we will continue to ramp up its production capacity in q3 i think probably at least in the second half of the year our overall plant capacity should reach 20 000 units per month it can be it s not probably too hard for us to see when and then for the f2 ramp up pace actually first we will kick off the delivery of et5 from this plant in q3 so it will start production in q3 and that we try to reach 10 000 units within quite a short period probably three four months i think that s our plan of course next year as we introduce more models into this factory the overall production volume of f2 will continue to rise operator all right thank you our next question comes from jane chang from cicc please ask your question unknown speaker my first question is about it was reported that in may that we have relevant recruitment information in the united states so can you share more details about it how do you see the breakthroughs in overseas market which potential market we think have more potential for us to deployment and what are the difficulties and my second question is about nad can you share more details about its current testing progress thank you william li founder chairman and chief executive officer steven feng chief financial officer ok jane thank you for tour question so first with regard to the u s market the short answer is we ll definitely enter the u s market and actually we ve started a comprehensive study of the u s market and have a dedicated team in charge of the plan for the market we re talking to the u s market with innovative manner but now it s still in the study phase so we ll share more information when it s appropriate and also then for the difficulties or difference in the larger european market first i agree with a lot of commonalities between china and the european market from the business model to the aspiration for green smart ev products the norwegian users also enjoy the concept of smart ev and even the price but if we do need to name some difference of course first the culture and also the cost structure so in europe surely the delivery cost would be higher and also we need to be accumulate enough understanding of the local culture and get integrated into the local community william back to you william li founder chairman and chief executive officer unknown speaker for the second question regarding nad the current adas functions and features based on the nio technology platform 2 0 is actually derived from the full stack technologies developed in house by our own ad teams we have a comprehensive full stack capabilities starting from sensing algorithm and control strategy starting from the delivery of the et7 on march 28 we have witnessed the data close group management and collection which has helped us to achieve a very fast iteration and upgrades of the vehicle autonomous driving or adas experiences based on the nt 2 so for us we have witnessed many improvements in the last two months because we can collect our data and we can actually see all those data we can see that the performance of the nt 2 is actually several times better than that of the nt 1 because after we collect all those data we can use the data to train our algorithm and our adas and ad technologies so i have also just mentioned that we re going to release the nop plus we are very confident with the performance of the nop plus this nop plus is going to be based on the high definition map developed together by ourselves together with tencent and this is going to be an in house high definition map we are going to integrate all those different technologies including the high definition map with our ad and adas close loop data management so we are going to use the same kind of technology stack to improve our autonomous driving and adas features that is why we are very confident with the nad performance in the long run based on our sensing capabilities that go through data management and also fast iterations and the systematic capabilities operator thank you very much for all your questions we have reached the end of the question and answer session i ll now turn the call back to the management team for closing remarks eve tang investor relations thank you once again for joining us today if you have further questions please feel free to contact nio s investor relations team through the contact information provided on our website this concludes the conference call you may now disconnect your lines thank you operator duration 90 minutes call participants eve

oil dri corporation recaptures lost margin price hikes on the way we ve liked oil dri corporation of america nyse odc as a small cap dividend payer for a long time and the value has only gotten better the company s margins took a hit over the past year that helped drive the share price to the lowest level in 7 years and margins are on the mend on top of that the company is still reporting volume growth and additional price increases to come so we see a positive bias in the outlook oil dri corporation will never be a large or even a mid cap name but it s a solid company with an established business that we see paying dividends for many more years to come at the current price levels the stock is trading about 18x its adjusted earnings and pays a yield near 4 4 and the distribution is growing get our activist investing case study get the full activist investing study in pdf q1 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more oil dri corporation has stunning quarter oil dri corporation reported 85 76 million in consolidated revenue which is not much on its own the crucial details are that this revenue is up 12 5 from last year 32 sequentially and a company record the revenue was driven by an increase in b2b and wholesale retail with increases reported across all major product lines the company says pricing played a large role in the increase but there was also volume growth as well on the retail wholesale end of the business cat litter and sporting applications were the largest contributors to growth while cat litter should remain steady if not strong the sporting applications should underpin growth over the next few quarters as outdoor sporting events ramp up moving down to the bottom line the news is mixed but that is the worst we can say the company posted a gaap loss and negative earnings but a one off factor is at play the company logged a non cash goodwill impairment related to the wholesale retail carrying value that shaved more than 5 million off of the bottom line margin when adjusted for this factor the margin grew on a yoy basis and earnings expanded on an adjusted basis the operating margin expanded by 480 basis points to 29 5 to drive a substantial increase in yoy earnings the adjusted eps comes in at around 0 34 using 7 53 million shares which is up 240 from last year the company did not give any formal guidance for the coming quarter but did give an optimistic outlook sales are expected to remain strong over the summer and further pricing increases are on the way this opens the door not only for sequential growth and an acceleration of yoy growth but for widening margins as well in our view that is nothing but good news for the dividend payment oil dri corporation has ammo for dividend hikes oil dri corporation is a healthy dividend payer with not only a 4 4 yield but an outlook for dividend growth and share repurchases the balance sheet is net debt but the leverage is low and cash flow is ample so there are no red flags to be worried about the cash level came down 7 million to 23 million over the past year but 4 3 of that was used to buy shares in q3 as for the dividend the company has been raising the payout for the last 8 years and is due for an increase with the next declaration the technical outlook short covering in oil dri the downtrend in oil dri is driven in part by short selling but it looks like the short sellers are starting to cover the price action going into the report suggests a bottom is in play and price action is moving higher now assuming a bottom is in play resistance is likely at the 26 level this may hold price action down in the nearer term but we would expect to see it wear down fairly quickly if the market can get above the 26 level we see a move up to the 28 to 30 region coming next if not this stock may be range bound at current levels for the next quarter or so should you invest 1 000 in oil dri co of america right now before you consider oil dri co of america you ll want to hear this marketbeat keeps track of wall street s top rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis marketbeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on and oil dri co of america wasn t on the list while oil dri co of america currently has a n a rating among analysts top rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys article by thomas hughes marketbeat

progress the german philosopher walter benjamin once wrote is a storm the winds that propel us forward also uproot and tear apart what we leave behind the modern world is a world of progress and it leaves in its wake the ruins of the old world progress then is indistinguishable from destruction creative positive and necessary destruction perhaps but destruction nevertheless culture in the modern world has its own tales of progress mass production of the novel in the 19th century the arrival and domination of cinema in the 20th the omnipresence of the digital in this century these all have propelled us forward newer and more progressive whims and approaches result in the ascendance of newer and more progressive authors and genres and they also reproduce battered remains of literary forms and genres of the yesteryear or so it may seem this essay concerns a literary genre that should by all accounts be dead and buried a coarse primitive genre that from the perspective of our unstoppably advancing tastes and proclivities should have no place in the current pantheon of literary refinement and accomplishment but this genre continues to haunt the contemporary its ghoulish spectre manifests an incorrigible undead spirit its menace threatens the narrative of unimpeded cultural progress the genre i speak of is the genre of the dead and the undead of monsters and malevolence of spectres and sinister spirits it is the genre of horror fiction horror boom and bust the so called horror boom is behind us this term refers to a period in us popular entertainment during which horror fiction nearly dominated the publishing and associated cultural landscapes horror had been present in one form or another in the literary imaginary of the western world from the onset of modernity at least since matthew lewis s satanic monk died a slow agonising death and mary shelley s deranged genius fashioned a body out of corpses read more frankenstein at 200 and why mary shelley was far more than the sum of her monster s parts in the united states horror fiction had prodigious subcultural roots dating back to the singular figures of edgar allan poe and h p lovecraft but it was not until the late 1960s that the genre reached hitherto unforeseen levels of mainstream cultural prestige and commercial profitability the horror boom which has also been described perhaps more aptly as the horror craze owed a great deal to the writers who came immediately before it these included lovecraft s protege robert bloch whose 1959 novel psycho added the modern serial killer to the rogues gallery of gothic monsters and the scandalous short stories of the deviously talented shirley jackson whose novel the haunting of hill house also published in 1959 placed a team of thoroughly modern american youths in a properly spooky old mansion it was not until the publication of three monstrously successful bestsellers ira levin s rosemary s baby 1967 thomas tryon s the other 1971 and william peter blatty s the exorcist 1971 that horror fiction transcended its hitherto underground youth oriented readership and for a period captured the imagination and aesthetics of wider american society accounting for the horror boom could provide an account of its eventual demise the dizzying commercial success of the boom s most recognisable protagonist stephen king led to equally high levels of overproduction at the height of his cultural power king would publish no fewer than three novels per year a feat he achieved in 1983 1984 and 1987 even the most optimistic view of the demand for horror fiction could not miss the obvious perils of excessive supply king was not the only hyper commercial hyper productive horror writer of the period the late anne rice released three novels in 1985 alone while dean koontz published 17 novels during the 1980s this oversaturation was not helped by the film industry s opportunism the extraordinary profitability of low budget slasher films spawned franchises of increasingly formulaic sequels this contributed significantly to the growing perception of the genre as a series of predictable cliches devoid of the capacity to truly deliver the aesthetic affects suspense thrills and terrors emblematic of the genre read more stephen king a master of horror who finds terror in the everyday ideals and ideology the decline in the aesthetic and commercial values of the genre only partially explains the somewhat abrupt bursting of the horror bubble in the 1990s more important to both the rise and fall of the genre s popularity and indeed premising this popularity were the fluctuations and mutations in the dominant ideology and ideals in the us during this period as king noted in his non fiction book danse macabre 1981 fear of the ultimate triumph of soviet communism portended by the shockingly successful launch and voyage of sputnik one transformed the young would be author from a sci fi aficionado into one of the future purveyors of horror fear of communism merged with the economic crises of the late 1960s and early 1970s which marked the end of the decades of relative postwar prosperity these crises were accompanied by acute anxieties about social disintegration the spreading of cults drug use and sexual permissiveness as the securities of the new deal gave way to the dreads and inequalities of neoliberalism a frightened american population and its youth in particular found solace in the cathartic reflection of their fears in the broken mirrors of horror fiction they turned to the horrifically shattered dreams of the owners of a monstrous upmarket property in anne rivers siddons the house next door 1978 and to the vengeful ghost of a woman killed in 1929 soon after the wall street crash whose murderous return in peter straub s ghost story 1979 augers however indirectly the fear of another catastrophe comparable to the great depression by the 1990s such fears had subsided western capitalism seemed to have survived the dangers of the previous decades and indeed emerged from them in an upbeat spirit communism had been apparently defeated the middle and working classes had become enchanted with the euphoric promises of global financial capitalism patrick bateman the protagonist of bret easton ellis s american psycho 1991 may appear to be related to robert bloch s seminal serial killer norman bates he expresses an explicit albeit ham fisted critique of neoliberalism but his atrocities are so hyperbolic so absurd that despite the moral panic accompanying the novel s release none of the horrors in ellis s novel can be taken sufficiently seriously to induce fear or suspense and thus constitute horror poppy z brite now billy martin also committed herself to an ever expansive desperately eroticised catalogue of bodily grotesquerie and visceral depredation only to struggle to find a publisher for her final horror novel exquisite corpse 1996 the most promising writer of the late horror boom clive barker would disappoint his dwindling fans and dedicate himself to fantasy and young adult fiction by the end of the 1990s the decade s most successful horror product was the movie adaptation of thomas harris s novel the silence of the lambs 1991 despite the blatantly evil presence of hannibal the cannibal it was the foretaste of the kind of dark and bloody crime fiction that would soon displace horror in many bookshops and on most movie and television screens read more nosferatu at 100 how the seminal vampire film shaped the horror genre a twist of noir that so called nordic or scandi noir incorporates many of the macabre motifs of the horror genre seems obvious indeed the swedish novel that launched the global popularity of scandinavian genre writing in the first decade of the new century was ostensibly a work of horror fiction john ajvide linqvist s låt den ratte komma in 2004 translated as let the right one in but linqvist s novel also signifies a major shift in speculative fiction readership in this period from the concerns of adult readers towards an unabashed moralism centred on the experiences and expectations of adolescent and young adult protagonists this shift is not surprising given the major trend in commercial genre publishing in both global and anglophone cultures was now determined by the phenomenal success of the harry potter and twilight franchises these works created fictional universes that made use of many aspects associated with horror fiction the supernatural the gothic without aiming to unnerve let alone horrify their young readers this aesthetic shift coincided with the popularisation of the internet the threats posed by the digital medium to print publishing compelled many publishers to downsize and terminate the publication of authors and genres that were not immediately easily and hugely saleable with very few exceptions such as king himself many of the most popular horror writers of the boom period were either unceremoniously dropped or moved to digital only lists e books despite optimistic industry forecasts proved unprofitable authors who had swallowed their pride and acquiesced to seeing their works removed from physical bookshops and confined to computer and tablet screens found it hard to compete with the abundance of free online content by the first decade of the new millennium therefore horror was well and truly dethroned horror writers when not dropped by publishers and left struggling to stay afloat amid the flux of digital whirlpools or trying their hand at writing crime or young adult fiction had to relabel and revise their works as chillers and supernatural thrillers horror came to be seen as culturally unpalatable and ideologically unacceptable always controversial and transgressive the entire genre when viewed through the prism of the progressive neoliberalism of the age of globalisation was deemed guilty of cruelty misanthropy misogyny racism homophobia and transphobia the rediscovery of lovecraft s racism instigated online petitions and some commentators even asked whether horror novels are bad for the brain read more six of the scariest horror comics the eclipse of horror a visit to almost any bookshop in melbourne where i live would seem to confirm the view that horror fiction is a thing of the past most have no horror section to speak of and the very few horror titles kept in stock almost all by king are scattered among crime fantasy and sci fi and when one does stumble on a horror novel it is often hard to recognise the work s genre the current edition of king s it 1986 does not feature the word horror anywhere on the book s cover which classifies it as epic thriller the silence of the lambs is available as a psychological thriller richard matheson s i am legend 1954 remains in print as part of a sci fi series several years ago deciding to revive my youthful interest in the literary genre that had so affected my imagination during my formative years as a writer i walked into the nearest bookshop which at that point in my life happened to be in dubai and asked for new horror fiction the bookseller handed me a vampire novel which she had personally read and enjoyed and which had received positive reviews in mainstream press the novel left me unimpressed not only was it overwritten overlong and truth be told overpriced it was also positively not horror but a rather moralistic dystopian novel about reckless science featuring one motif a bloodsucker in one scene associated with the horror genre more recently i was again compelled to ask a bookseller for a new horror recommendation this time i was back in melbourne and i was in luck the bookseller recommended paul tremblay s a head full of ghosts 2015 here was a novel by a contemporary author that not only paid tribute to horror classics of the past which it did in a rather self conscious manner via the figures of demonically possessed teenagers who explicitly evoked the exorcist but insisted on the currency of the genre the bedevilled family of this novel were beset by supernatural evil as well as the terrors inflicted by the global financial crisis such as unemployment immiseration and their resulting social and familial cracks and catastrophes best of all a head full of ghosts was genuinely engrossing and wonderfully unnerving it did not sermonise about the ills of the world it did not exploit gothic tropes solely to create atmosphere and it was not written for children it was in short a proper horror novel tremblay is one of the main figures in what may be described as a contemporary resurgence of horror fiction his recent acquisition by publisher william morrow could be seen as an indication the genre is making a comeback although it is worth noting that his forthcoming novel has been labelled a psychological thriller that tremblay has been deemed worthy of investment by global publishing powers is exceptional in the contemporary context most of his peers publish with small independent presses or self publish it remains to be seen whether tremblay and those few horror authors picked up by publishing giants will resist the pressure and or temptation to move on to more commercially and ideologically desirable genres such as young adult dystopian fiction or indeed the psychological thriller a stronger sign of horror s survival and revival may be found in the fact the genre s industrial demise has not resulted in artistic decline the horror novels written and released since the 1990s have been among the genre s best mark z danielewski s immense house of leaves 2000 may be irritating pretentious and for some simply unreadable but it is also quite possibly the most ambitious most astonishing american novel of the current century sara gran s come closer 2003 is as creepy a tale of supernatural possession as one could wish for it has also received belated praise from no less a mainstream outlet than the guardian for its striking capacity to probe female passions and frustrations dathan auerbach s penpal 2012 which began life as a series of stories on the news aggregation and discussion website reddit is a horrifying page turner as well as a most ingenuously structured narrative catriona ward s the last house on the needless street 2021 is as the stephen king blurb on its cover would have it a true nerve shredder it features the most effective most devastating peripetia or plot reversal i have read in a work by a living author online resurgence i found out about the last two titles via the facebook group books of horror with more than 21 000 members it provides a space for fans of the genre to recommend read and discuss their favourite books it also provides a crucial channel for the genre s current practitioners to make their works known to a readership excluded from mainstream literary scenes as someone who has hitherto worked within the confines of official literary publishing with its preoccupations with literary reputations awards sales reviews moral pretences and the like i have been entranced by the books of horror members passion for new unknown independent writers the members have an unapologetic love for the simple and sophisticated pleasures of reading they are utterly uninterested in ideological postures and culture wars that characterise so much of today s highbrow literary trends their staggering erudition and knowledge of genre writing outshines many a university professor s claim to popular culture expertise books of horror is one among many online phenomena that have transformed the digital milieu from one of the causes of the genre s decline in the 1990s to one of the sources of its revival today a more fundamental reason for horror s resurrection however is to be found in the state of our world the 2008 global financial crisis ruptured the narrative of global capitalism s invincibility it ushered in the contemporary period of economic political and social instability the crises of global warming and the coronavirus pandemic have only intensified our fears about the trajectory of human civilisation in addition to the contemporary works i have already noted most other horror works of the current period testify to the fears and dangers of life in a shaken precarious and frightened world hex 2013 by dutch novelist thomas olde heuvelt is set in a fictional village under total digital surveillance where a contemporary high tech big brother tries and fails to protect the business interests of the local petty bourgeoisie from a brutal supernatural curse in canadian writer gemma files experimental film 2015 a struggling film scholar and her rivals faced with economic austerity and professional insecurity resort to excavating a work from the silent era to safeguard their livelihoods only to discover that the obscured film evokes ancient cosmological evils in franco moroccan writer leïla slimani s chanson douce 2016 variously translated into english as the perfect nanny and lullaby a disenfranchised working class woman from a poor outer suburb of paris is employed as a nanny by a professional middle class family in the affluent heart of the french capital with horrific consequences these works are only a very small indication of the international reach of horror writing today the boom of the 1960s 1990s period was primarily a us cultural phenomenon the concurrent popularity of the genre in other regions including the united kingdom and japan was premised on the fortunes of the genre in its us core today s revival seems less us centric even australia a country whose literature has long been subsumed within us literary production and consumption is showing signs of a native horror fiction scene evident in the work of committed horror authors such as kaaron warren alan baxter kirsten mcdermott and greg chapman among many others there has also been a horror turn in the work of more literary authors such as the late andrew mcgahan whose final novel the rich man s house 2019 features a domineering american mountaineer who gets his comeuppance courtesy of supernatural terrors unleashed by a mountain i don t know whether all this will amount to a second horror boom any time soon it is very hard to imagine that in the age of cancel culture trigger warnings and sensitivity readers a genre that is categorically dedicated to shocking its readers could again rise to mainstream ideological prominence it is equally difficult to imagine that the ultra commercial publishers that backed the likes of king during the early years of his career would offer such support to a burgeoning writer of the genre at a time when bestseller lists are dominated by young adult crime self help and celebrity memoirs horror authors will continue to find it hard to overcome current commercial and cultural obstacles but great horror novels continue to be written and they are being read and appreciated by informed passionate readers of the genre horror is far from dead author ali alizadeh senior lecturer in literary studies and creative writing monash university

experts from the world bank finally admitted that the risk of stagflation is getting bigger and more real for gold however that s pretty good news better late than never first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you and finally you win indeed several months ago pundits were dismissing the possibility of stagflation the possibility that i was emphasizing almost from the very beginning of the pandemic related economic crisis and the subsequent jump in inflation in the summary of the gold market overview for april 2021 i wrote q1 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more the us economy is likely to shift from an economic recovery to stagflation in the upcoming months even the fed itself admits that inflation will jump this year of course the central banks are trying to convince us that inflation will be only transitory but it s possible that they underestimate the inflationary risk and overestimate their ability to deal with it this is exactly where we are right now after months of saying inflation was temporary and laughing at warnings of stagflation this time is different in its latest report global economic prospects the world bank admitted that stagflation risks are rising amid a sharp slowdown in growth the institution reduced its global growth forecast from 5 7 percent in 2021 to 2 9 percent in 2022 which is significantly lower than the 4 1 percent that was predicted in january what s really disturbing is that between 2021 and 2024 global growth is projected to have slowed by 2 7 percentage points more than twice the deceleration between 1976 and 1979 oops houston we have a problem indeed as world bank president david malpass said in the foreword to the report the risk of stagflation is likely now amid the war in ukraine surging inflation and rising interest rates global economic growth is expected to slump in 2022 several years of above average inflation and below average growth are now likely with potentially destabilizing consequences for low and middle income economies it s a phenomenon stagflation that the world has not seen since the 1970s the danger of stagflation is considerable today subdued growth will likely persist throughout the decade because of weak investment in most of the world with inflation now running at multidecade highs in many countries and supply expected to grow slowly there is a risk that inflation will remain higher for longer than currently anticipated treasury secretary janet yellen also admitted this month that she was wrong a year ago when she said she anticipated inflation would be a small risk manageable and not a problem in an interview for cnn she said i was wrong about the path inflation would take as i mentioned there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that affected our economy so badly that i didn t at the time fully understand rumors have it that yellen has educated herself a bit recently implications for gold what does it all mean for the economy and the gold market well policymakers usually don t admit that they were wrong if they do it s only because they know how bad it s about to get the fact that the world bank openly predicts stagflation is another indication that the economic situation is turning sour you see to combat high inflation in the 1970s the fed was forced to hike interest rates so steeply that it triggered a global recession as the chart below shows the nominal 10 year treasury yields have just briefly surpassed 3 which is a relatively high level in recent times but it s nothing similar to the levels seen in the 1970s and 1980s what s particularly disturbing here is that the debt levels are much higher today than during the great stagflation so the fed s tightening cycle could be potentially even more harmful now stagflation should be positive for the gold bulls the sample is small because there has only been one stagflation in the past which overlapped with the end of the gold standard and the liberalization of the gold market but still a recession should make gold rally the danger for gold is rising real interest rates but the current path of monetary tightening is probably already priced in well by the markets so only a more aggressive stance than the markets expect right now could harm the yellow metal as the chart above shows gold prices continue to trade around the 1 850 level and it seems that gold is waiting for something to decide which path to take next week s fed monetary policy meeting

few investors are happy when a company announces a new stock issue what happened few investors wanted to experiment with owning core laboratories clb stock on thursday that s because the oil reservoir services company is digging for new financing and those investors aren t happy about this as a result core labs stock closed a bit more than 10 lower on the day so what core labs said thursday that it had launched an at the market atm stock offering under this initiative the company will sell up to 60 million worth of its common stock to the public it will be aided in this effort by wells fargo and bank of america securities both of which are to operate under an equity distribution agreement with the company in discussing the utilization of its share of the proceeds core labs used the typical stock issuer boilerplate language citing general corporate purposes it added that these could include product technology development debt retirement and possible acquisitions according to data compiled by yahoo finance the specialty oil services company currently has slightly over 46 3 million shares outstanding at the current stock price that 60 million shakes out to roughly 2 2 million shares now what 2 2 million shares being added to a bucket of more than 46 million isn t particularly dilutive so on that basis alone investors seem to be over reacting to core labs news but if we zoom out a bit on the company we can see that there is some concern about how quickly its business is going to develop in the short to mid term investors also might be worried about a coming decline in the current high oil price a dynamic that doesn t favor a reservoir services provider like core labs
an analyst s take on may sales was hardly encouraging nor was an article on a u s chip manufacturing bill what happened apple aapl 2 19 wouldn t have become the tech industry megalith it is today without widespread investor love for its stock that affection was barely visible on thursday however as the company s shares tumbled by almost 4 against the 2 4 slide of the s p 500 index a disquieting analysis of monthly sales and an apparently stalling effort at gaining support for domestic chipmaking were the main culprits behind this so what in a new note to clients brandon nispel an analyst at keycorp s key 1 23 keybanc revealed that payment card data from customers of the bank showed that spending on apple products declined notably in may on a month over month basis this fall was 8 quite a contrast to the three year monthly average increase of 6 nispel added that the drop was the weakest may showing even taking into account the pre pandemic era in nispel s estimation this indicates weakening demand for apple goods throughout the u s in spite of this recent data based on his estimates portending continued growth the prognosticator is maintaining his overweight buy recommendation on apple stock nispel is also keeping his 191 per share price target meanwhile an article published just before market open on thursday by bloomberg said that the biden administration s effort to support domestic chip manufacturing could be stalling the financial news agency said that although a bill strengthening american producers competitiveness against chinese rivals is a priority for the white house some legislators think the administration is not particularly engaged with it additionally some republican lawmakers seem determined not to give the democrat in the oval office a big victory in the run up to the november midterm elections now what both items are concerning for apple as product revenue is still by far the bulk of its overall take and it has lately pushed into chipmaking in a major way i still feel the company is very strong in both areas although it s certainly worth monitoring both monthly sales and that chip manufacturer bill for signs of potentially stiff headwinds

another analyst trims her price target on the fintech s stock what happened brazil based fintech stoneco stne 2 79 left investors cold on thursday the company s shares took a nasty nearly 15 hit to their price on the day this appears to be due to a combination of a post earnings sell off and a price target cut from an analyst following the stock so what the cutting party was multinational banking group hsbc whose analyst neha agarwala gave her stoneco price target a haircut she reduced this to 13 per share from the previous 15 while maintaining her hold recommendation on the stock the reasons behind agarwala s move weren t immediately clear we do know that it wasn t trailblazing last friday bank of america securities prognosticator mario perry acted similarly he lowered his price target to 14 per share from the preceding 17 and like his hsbc peer he kept his neutral hold recommendation both analysts were a bit out of step with the market which collectively had been very bullish on stoneco since the company reported its first quarter earnings after market hours this past thursday that was to be expected as the south american fintech more than doubled its revenue on a year over year basis while its net income margin ballooned to over 6 from the first quarter 2021 level of less than 2 now what as sometimes happens in instances when a growth company delivers a strong earnings report stoneco s stock popped and now it s obeying gravity as certain investors take profits and move on mix that in with an analyst target price cut or two and you ve got the fairly common situation stoneco stock found itself in on thursday as the stock s movement was largely due to these factors the drop shouldn t change anyone s view of the brazilian company s fundamentals or prospects

rentals silver sands and miss kitty s fishing getaways vtrips believes that employees are the lifeblood of these companies and we are doing everything possible to create a positive environment for them as certain large national buyers operate more like strip miners in our industry we are encountering more and more sellers who want a buyer that will hire all their staff take care of their brand and legacy and allow them to live proudly in their community milo said we tell sellers that certain large national buyers are an option if they intend to move to another state or country and change their cell phone some sellers think this is funny i always have a lot of good stories to share when i meet sellers in person milo added most sellers dedicated their lives to building a legacy and making great memories for their guests and employees and they want a buyer who shares their same values milo said that vtrips is well positioned to compete for the industry lead in the resort vacation

2022 some companies and ceos care passionately about the future of the industry and some are just industry outsiders concerned about getting a quick exit from this industry before their operational issues implode on them milo said adding that the once sleepy vacation rental industry is rapidly transforming with these changes some vacation rental owners are deciding to take chips off the table and the company they choose to sell to may be the 1 factor about vtrips founded in 2002 by industry visionary steve milo vtrips is a growing and innovative property management company headquartered in

districts in 2020 republican u s rep mike garcia won a narrow victory in a democratic leaning district north of los angeles the former navy fighter pilot was endorsed by trump that year then joined house republicans who rejected electoral votes from arizona and pennsylvania and opposed trump s impeachment after the capitol insurrection that record will be a focus for democrat christy smith who earned a chance for a rematch with garcia after losing two years ago in a democratic tilting district in the state s central valley farm belt republican rep david valadao is highlighting an independent streak while contending with gop fallout for his vote to impeach trump over the jan 6 insurrection early returns showed him holding an edge over republican chris mathys who made valadao s

believe palazzo a military veteran who serves on the appropriations and homeland security committees abused his office by misspending campaign funds doing favors for his brother and enlisting staff for political and personal errands his then spokesperson colleen kennedy said the probe was based on politically motivated false allegations in another mississippi district u s rep michael guest will face former navy pilot michael cassidy in a district that cuts through parts of central mississippi cassidy criticized guest for being in the minority of republicans who voted to create an outside commission to investigate the jan 6 2021 attack on the u s capitol a group that would have been separate from the congressional committee now conducting the investigation cassidy also says on his

population and zinke an interior department secretary under trump is one of five republicans on the primary ballot for the open seat zinke s rivals have been drawing attention to his troubled tenure

in his hometown he s faced a smear campaign over his military service from the extreme right wing of his party and questions about his residency following revelations that his wife declared a house in california as her primary residence zinke a former navy seal and former montana congressman was in a tight race wednesday against former state sen al doc olszewski an orthopedic surgeon and hard line

counties that typically lean republican the new district includes several counties in southern iowa known to turn out strongly for republicans increasing the pressure on axne to drive up her numbers

and republican tom kean jr won their primaries setting up a rematch of their closely contested 2020 race malinowski a state department official in the obama administration is seeking a third term as his party faces headwinds heading into the general election his district added more republican leaning towns during redistricting making his reelection bid potentially more difficult another

inventiva three poster presentations showing the beneficial effects of lanifibranor on markers of cardiometabolic health in patients with non cirrhotic nash fibrosis independent of weight gain observed the reduction of the fast tm score in association with the beneficial effects of lanifibranor on liver histology and biologically relevant biomarkers in patients with nash and f2 f3 fibrosis the identification of biomarkers of histological response in patients with non cirrhotic nash treated with lanifibranor daix france long island city new york united states june 9 2022 inventiva euronext paris and nasdaq iva a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis nash and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs today announced that three abstracts have been selected for poster presentation at the upcoming international liver congress 2022 hosted by the european association for the study of the liver easl on june 22 26 2022 in london uk the first abstract focuses on the beneficial effects of lanifibranor on markers of cardiometabolic health in patients with nash showing that they are independent of weight change based on the results of inventiva s native phase iib clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in nash the authors of the abstract analysed markers of cardiometabolic health in relation with the weight variation observed in patients treated with lanifibranor or on placebo the treatment with lanifibranor showed beneficial effects on biomarkers of cardiometabolic health including markers of lipid and glucose metabolism insulin resistance and inflammation independent of weight change these beneficial effects occurred in parallel with an increase of adiponectin levels demonstrating an improvement in adipose tissue health these results provide further evidence that pparγ induced weight gain is associated with improved insulin sensitivity i e is metabolically healthy and thus distinct from lifestyle related weight gain advertisement the second abstract evaluates the beneficial effect of lanifibranor treatment on the fibroscan aspartate aminotransferase fasttm score a promising non invasive test nit for active nash with significant fibrosis based on the data of the native trial the authors evaluated the effect of treatment with lanifibranor on the fasttm score the correlation between the histological and biomarker responses observed in patients with nash and fibrosis f2 f3 the data showed that the treatment with lanifibranor induced a significant reduction of the fasttm score compared to placebo this reduction under lanifibranor is associated with the histological endpoint resolution of nash and improvement of fibrosis and with the improvement in triglycerides apo c3 and ferritin levels these results highlight the potential of the fasttm score as a nit to monitor disease progression and response to therapy the third abstract focuses on the identification of biomarkers of histological response in patients with non cirrhotic nash treated with lanifibranor the authors conducted an assessment of serum based biomarkers from the inventiva s native phase iib clinical trial in order to identify biological signatures of the liver histological endpoints the authors identified four biomarkers baseline levels of adiponectin and ferritin relative changes of mmp9 and transferrin at end of treatment which combined into a score could predict the nash resolution and fibrosis improvement with a sensitivity of 70 and specificity of 95 four different biomarkers were identified as being predictive of the histological endpoint nash resolution without worsening of fibrosis baseline ck18 m65 absolute change of hyaluronate relative changes of fructosamine and alt at end of treatment with a sensitivity of 79 and specificity of 89 this exploratory assessment demonstrates that the combination of biomarker signatures allowed a non invasive identification of histological response under lanifibranor treatment in nash with a good diagnostic performance the details of the various presentations are as

rentals silver sands and miss kitty s fishing getaways vtrips believes that employees are the lifeblood of these companies and we are doing everything possible to create a positive environment for them as certain large national buyers operate more like strip miners in our industry we are encountering more and more sellers who want a buyer that will hire all their staff take care of their brand and legacy and allow them to live proudly in their community milo said we tell sellers that certain large national buyers are an option if they intend to move to another state or country and change their cell phone some sellers think this is funny i always have a lot of good stories to share when i meet sellers in person milo added most sellers dedicated their lives to building a legacy and making great memories for their guests and employees and they want a buyer who shares their same values milo said that vtrips is well positioned to compete for the industry lead in the resort vacation rental market in north america as a company headquartered in business friendly florida with a founder and owner still in charge and who supports the industry in advocacy and volunteer work vtrips is

florida professional vacation rental coalition which raised more than 250 000 over the past two years he is also a member of the vrma advocacy committee which has so far raised more than 470 000 in 2022 some companies and ceos care passionately about the future of the industry and some are just industry outsiders concerned about getting a quick exit from this industry before their operational issues implode on them milo said adding that the once sleepy vacation rental industry is rapidly transforming with these changes some vacation rental owners are deciding to take chips off the table and the company they choose to sell to may be the 1 factor about vtrips founded in 2002 by industry visionary steve milo vtrips is a growing and innovative property management company headquartered in ponte vedra fla the vtrips family of brands consists of more than a dozen locally managed companies in alabama florida georgia hawaii maryland new mexico north carolina south carolina tennessee and

steadily to 2 398 by 2021 according to the u s bureau of economic analysis advertisement article continues below this ad while households have historically shown a greater likelihood of investing in their homes during periods of rising property values a number of factors specific to the covid 19 pandemic encouraged more homeowners to do the work themselves as diy projects data from the farnsworth

because of health or safety reasons and upwards of 20 because contractors weren t available more recently the rising cost of labor and materials could further incentivize homeowners to take on

cancer this includes a new cyclotron solid target platform which increases gallium 68 production and access a radioisotope used in molecular imaging for prostate cancer diagnosis staging and monitoring the company also celebrates its 500th ge healthcare cyclotron installation a type of compact particle accelerator that produces radioisotopes for use in diagnostic tracers like fluorine 18 and gallium 68 which can be imaged using positron emission tomography pet and nuclear medicine systems to identify cancer and other diseases chicago vancouver british columbia business wire ge healthcare is proud to provide cutting edge molecular imaging solutions that enable and increase access to precision health and theranostics to help improve patient outcomes across care areas including prostate cancer the most prevalent cancer in men and the third most prevalent cancer overalli where most medical therapies are designed with the average patient in mind theranostics brings together diagnoses and treatment in one application providing a more targeted and personalized therapy than ever before clinicians and patients are especially seeing much success with theranostics in prostate cancer a highly manageable disease but one that is difficult to treat when diagnosed at a late stage claiming more than 1 4 million lives annuallyii during the covid 19 pandemic clinical adoption of theranostics slowed due to a delay in elective procedures and the increased risk posed to its often immunocompromised patients however a surge in demand for theranostics infrastructureiii is now anticipated following the u s federal drug administration s fda approval of several new drugs and therapies this includes the diagnostic tracer gallium 68 psma 11 and therapy drug lutetium 177 psma 617 which are key to applying theranostics in prostate cancer healthcare is timely and personal and its delivery should be too explains jean luc procaccini president ceo molecular imaging computed tomography ge healthcare theranostics has the potential to transform care from a look at the average patient to a precise look at each individual already it is providing hope to late stage prostate cancer patients by aiding with the diagnosis of the disease the accurate quantification of its progression and the delivery of targeted personalized therapies all in the same session and soon we hope to see it adopted earlier in the disease care pathway and across oncology to benefit more patients around the world to prepare for the creation of dedicated theranostics centers snmmi and related international molecular imaging societies recently published a new guide for healthcare systems globallyiii focusing on safety protocols and operational procedures the guide provides a framework that highlights best practices that can be applied across care areas nuclear medicine is entering a new age of precision theranostics in which next generation alpha and beta labeled radiotherapeutics are tailored to individual cancer patients using the latest diagnostic pet radiopharmaceuticals explains dr peter scott associate professor of radiology division director of nuclear medicine university of michigan with the fda approval of a new psma agent for treatment of prostate cancer the future is here patients their families and referring physicians are all demanding access to theranostics creating an unprecedented demand for higher and higher amounts of radioactive metals the only way to meet the global need for pet radionuclides like gallium 68 and copper 64 is through commercial solid target solutions suitable for routine use as the industry prepares to usher in this new era of precision health and personalized medicine ge healthcare is proud to offer innovative molecular imaging solutions to healthcare systems around the world discovery with the molecule journey enabling precision health the enablement of theranostics in prostate cancer care begins with the production of radioisotopes for use in diagnostic tracers namely gallium 68 psma 11 which is administered to the patient attaches to specific cancer cells and releases radioactive emissions to provide detailed molecular information unique to each patient however shortages of the generators that produce gallium 68 historically have created serious challenges for clinicians and limited patient access in response ge healthcare is proud to introduce a new solid target platform for its pettrace cyclotron which in combination with its fastlab 2 new edition platform can produce 100x the amount of gallium compared to a generator for increased theranostics capabilities and access in prostate cancer patient careiv while solid targets have been around for some time they have traditionally been viewed as research tools and required complicated infrastructure and highly trained operators now with ge healthcare s tracercenter solutions and new pettrace solid target platform healthcare systems can more easily access the equipment tracers and staff training necessary to deliver a more cost effective personalized solution diagnosis accurately staging quantifying disease to read the emissions released by the gallium 68 psma 11 tracer the patient must be imaged using a highly sensitive pet ct scanner this technology provides the clinician detailed information that is used to better

paris boulder colo business wire regulatory news spineguard fr0011464452 alsgd paris alsgd an innovative company that deploys its dsg dynamic surgical guidance sensing technology to secure and streamline the placement of bone implants announces the launch of a new three year collaboration program with two labs of sorbonne university cnrs and inserm the isir institute for intelligent systems and robotics and lib laboratory for biomedical imaging dsg is based on the local measurement of electrical conductivity of tissues in real time without x ray imaging with a sensor located at the tip of the drilling instrument its efficacy was proven by more than 90 000 surgeries across the globe and 19 scientific publications spineguard has entered in 2017 a collaboration with isir for the application of dsg to surgical robots and the enhancement of their safety accuracy and autonomy spineguard and isir capitalize on first order outcomes published so far at the close of a first collaboration phase spineguard announced sub millimetric accuracy experimental outcomes in bone boundary detection and automatic stop of a vertebral drilling performed by a robot using the dsg technology these impressive outcomes were presented as they were produced successively at the hamlyn medical robotics conference in london in may 2019 receiving the first price for best scientific paper then in plenary session at the smiss minimally invasive spine surgery smiss in las vegas in november 2021 and lastly during the cras conference in naples in april 2022 and join forces with the lib laboratory in order to add ultrasound to the project encouraged by this success the research and development teams wish to go even further in surgical robots advancement the guidance technologies that allow the robot to position itself properly relative to the patient to find the drilling entry point rely today on x ray imaging dangerous for health in combination with space consuming optical registration spineguard has long explored the possibility to use ultrasound complementarily to dsg for this preliminary step before the tool is penetrating bone and was granted two families of international patents on that topic the lib laboratory who features an international level expertise in the field of ultrasound imaging answered with enthusiasm the invitation to join the project spineguard isir and lib thus start a new 3 year collaboration that is expected to produce breakthrough results in the field stéphane bette co founder and deputy ceo of spineguard said we are happy to launch this partnership that will allow us to go even further in improving surgical robots in orthopedics this new phase of the project aims at enabling robots to perform bone drilling and cutting as well as implant placement in a secured and more autonomous manner in the human skeleton our goal is to implement first class collaboration between french research and industry and trigger commercial ventures in the orthopedic field via strategic agreements with industry partners guillaume morel professor at sorbonne university and isir director and brahim tamadazte researcher at cnrs and member of isir added we are delighted to continue the close and dynamic collaboration initiated in 2017 with spineguard the entry of robotics and associated new technologies in operating room is no doubt one of the biggest medical advances of the last twenty years robotic approaches often allow the surgical gesture to be less invasive more accurate safe and intuitive in numerous surgical procedures the first outcomes from the previous collaboration gave us more visibility on the clinical added value that a robot with original and effective sensors can bring to orthopedic surgery in general and spine in particular this new collaboration will be about ultrasonic sensors coupled with robotics this original and promising association will allow the surgeon to define the entry point and the pedicle screw trajectory accurately and non invasively without relying on ionizing or costly preoperative imaging scanner mri the association of two prestigious labs of sorbonne university isir and lib whose competencies are highly complementary to spineguard s industrial vision constitute a stimulating work environment favorable to innovation the journey with spineguard goes on for three more years with a target of several technologic and scientific innovations to serve patients and care providers quentin grimal professor at sorbonne university and manager of the team ultrasound and imaging for bone quality characterization at lib concludes using ultrasound to position a surgical tool is particularly relevant ultrasounds are danger free and provide real time information about interfaces bone anatomy even bone mechanical quality the use of an ultrasound probe should allow to position the robotic arm in an optimal manner to place pedicle screws in general echography does not allow to see beyond the bone surfaces because ultrasounds are strongly reflected at the surface and strongly attenuated when propagating in bone low amplitude signals coming from inside bone can however be exploited through specific treatments which are a specialty of our team our team pioneer in ultrasound utilization to probe bone has introduced several approaches that offer an alternative to x rays for characterization of trabecular or cortical bone health for our team this partnership with spineguard and isir is a great fit it will accelerate methodology and instrument developments for a broader utilization of ultrasound in orthopedic surgery we are very happy to participate in this innovation rich project about spineguard founded in 2009 in france and the usa by pierre jérôme and

when we order takeout from a neighborhood restaurant we are less and less likely to call the restaurant directly instead we might order through uber eats or doordash which take a cut of the sale and charge us a delivery fee when summer hits and we go online to find new swimsuits and stock up on sunscreen we might go to amazon which now relies for the majority of its retail sales on independent vendors that use its e commerce platform even when we try to buy directly from the manufacturer internet empowered middlemen still play a big role the 2000s wave of direct to consumer companies for example ended up paying massive amounts to facebook and others for the targeted ads they depended on to reach new customers this isn t what was supposed to happen the internet people such as bill gates insisted would be a disruptive force that shifted power into the hands of makers and consumers in his 1995 book the road ahead the microsoft co founder predicted that the internet would become the universal middleman and that often the only humans involved in a transaction will be the actual buyer and seller in other words why pay a middleman to help you find what you needed when you could find it yourself the internet has swept away some intermediaries the number of travel agents dwindled as americans got used to booking their own flights hotels and rental cars online but travel agents fate is the exception not the rule far more common are the persistence of middlemen whom technology should have rendered obsolete and the rise of new types of middlemen draining yet more money and power from creators and their customers surprisingly some long established middlemen whose role seems comparable to travel agents have found ways to persist traditionally buyers needed real estate agents to help them identify available houses sellers relied on their knowledge of recent sales to know how to price their home all of this information is now readily available online yet both buyers and sellers continue to use full service real estate agents and continue to pay very high fees an average of about 5 percent of the value of the home sold because real estate not stock is the primary store of wealth for the typical family the internet s failure to render these expensive middlemen obsolete is a genuine loss for the american middle class meanwhile the internet has transformed some classic intermediary industries most notably retail in ways that empower a small number of supersize middlemen more online shoppers start their search on amazon than on any other website including google amazon which started out as just a virtual version of the classic bookstore has evolved into a middleman among middlemen rather than set up their own e commerce systems smaller producers and resellers sell on amazon but doing so costs them according to the institute for local self reliance amazon s cut of third party sales increased from 19 percent in 2014 to 34 percent last year yet the number of sellers that use amazon also continues to grow

washington the u s house on thursday passed a red flag gun control bill that would allow federal courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others in a 224 202 nearly party line vote the house passed georgia democratic rep lucy mcbath s bill known as the federal extreme risk protection order act five republicans voted with democrats including brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania fred upton of michigan and anthony gonzalez of ohio one democrat voted against the bill jared golden of maine we vote today to provide law enforcement and family members the tools that they need to prevent these mass shootings mcbath said currently the district of columbia and 19 states have red flag laws meant to be used to prevent gun violence the legislation likely won t get far in the evenly divided senate where a bipartisan group continued thursday to negotiate compromise gun control measures but its passage represented a years long gun safety goal for mcbath who became an advocate after her 17 year old son jordan davis was murdered at a florida gas station in 2012 jordan was shot by a white man who was angry about the loud music being played by the black teenager and his friends that s why in the decade since my son was taken from me by a man with a gun simply for playing loud music in his car that i made a promise to jordan and to my community and to the american people mcbath said on the house floor a promise that i will continue to fight this battle for the rest of my life mcbath recently won a primary election against democratic colleague rep carolyn bourdeaux in a new congressional district after georgia republicans redrew the state s congressional district map turning mcbath s district into a republican stronghold in the weeks leading up to the primary the gun control group everytown for gun safety spent 1 million in tv ads promoting mcbath mcbath has said that during her time in congress she has turned the pain of her son s death into action we voted to save the lives of our children to protect our families and to do what is right mcbath said in a statement mass shootings horrific mass shootings in recent weeks in buffalo new york and uvalde texas have propelled the white house and democrats to make a new push for gun control legislation despite pessimism anything can move ahead in a polarized congress on may 14 a white supremacist who had written about his belief in a racist conspiracy theory known as the great replacement traveled to a grocery store in a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo and killed 10 black people on may 24 a gunman at robb elementary school in uvalde murdered 19 children and two teachers in reaction the house on wednesday passed 223 204 a package of eight bills relating to gun control that would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things the house oversight and reform committee also heard from the victims of gun violence including survivors of the buffalo and uvalde mass shootings during the thursday floor debate on mcbath s bill republican opponents argued that red flag laws were unconstitutional mcbath s bill would authorize and establish procedures for federal courts to issue federal extreme risk protection orders according to its description a federal extreme risk protection would block a person from purchasing possessing or receiving a firearm or ammunition a family or household member or a law enforcement officer could petition for a federal extreme risk protection order for an individual who poses a risk to themselves or others gop reps debbie lesko of arizona and lisa mcclain of michigan accused democrats of taking away their guns democrats want to take away my right to protect my grandchildren lesko said rep jim jordan an ohio republican said the bill would allow the government to take away an individual s gun when you didn t commit any crime rep brenda lawrence a michigan democrat said that her party had no intention of taking away your right to own a gun but use common sense the american people are calling on us to protect their community she said rep madeline dean a pennsylvania democrat said that congress has a duty to intervene when someone is at risk to themselves or another we do not have to live this way she said rep jerry nadler a new york democrat and the chair of the house judiciary committee said that the bill provides a sensible means so that someone exhibiting dangerous behavior can be prevented from possessing or purchasing firearms before a tragedy strikes he added that every court that has considered red flag laws has found them constitutional house speaker nancy pelosi a california democrat added that red flag laws also help prevent deaths by suicide doing so will not only protect from mass shootings but also from the quiet daily massacre by suicide and gun crimes pelosi said senate negotiations continue in gun control talks in the senate senate majority leader chuck schumer said thursday morning that democrats top negotiator connecticut sen chris murphy reported the group is making good progress and they hope to get something real done very soon as soon as the bipartisan group comes to agreement i want to bring a measure to the floor for a vote as quickly as possible schumer said the overwhelming consensus of our caucus of gun safety advocates and of the american people is that getting something real done on gun violence is worth pursuing even if we cannot get everything we know we need schumer continued the work of curing our nation of mass shootings will continue well after this debate concludes but at this moment we have a moral obligation to try for real progress because taking tangible steps to reduce gun violence is critically important schumer said texas sen john cornyn republicans lead negotiator said thursday that reaching a framework by the end of this week was aspirational but noted bipartisan talks will continue through the weekend the great thing about everybody having text messaging is that there s a lot of communication cornyn said the former senate republican whip who stepped down after reaching his term limit said he s already started thinking about how to get a large number of his gop colleagues to vote for a possible bipartisan bill if all 50 democrats back an eventual package to address guns mental health and school safety just 10 republicans would need to support the measure but cornyn said he wants a more significant show of bipartisan support for a possible deal right now i feel like there seems to be a critical mass of support for doing something and that s huge because around here sometimes people really don t have the will to accomplish a result but they want the issue for political purposes or the like cornyn said

nevadans like the rest of the country are grappling with record high gas prices and a baby formula shortage crises that u s senate candidate adam laxalt r says will motivate voters to replace democrat leadership in november the reality is like every other crisis we re facing right now it doesn t matter that the mainstream media is ignoring it and that they re covering for biden because nevadans are living it they re experiencing it laxalt told breitbart news daily host editor in chief alex marlow on thursday they understand that in my state democrats are in charge of everything and obviously at the federal level democrats are in charge of everything which is why we are due for a massive red wave in november former nevada attorney general laxalt pointed to nevada s gas prices which day over day continue to reach record highs on thursday the silver state s highest recorded average gas price reached 5 59 according to the american automobile association aaa a june 6 report by npr revealed that nevada has the second highest average gas prices in the united states behind california listen things are as bad as they ve ever been when it comes to gas and we called out sen catherine cortez masto d nv day one when this all started happening for her to call out her president and break from her party on far left and green new deal and moving us away from american energy independence he said they re all selling putin s price hike they re selling greedy oil executives it s all a lie he continued we all know the reason gas prices have gone up is directly because this administration has targeted the industry that was so successful in the trump era and gave us 2 gas in the state of nevada instead of 5 50 laxalt described how skyrocketing gas prices are a punitive tax on nevadans especially those living in rural areas a lot of people don t realize in the west coast we drive everywhere every single time you get in your car you re driving some distance and especially when you get into rural nevada daily commutes can be 60 to a 100 miles he said and so this is a punitive tax on people that simply cannot afford laxalt said the baby formula crisis is no different with nevadans seeing one of the worst shortages in the country a late may report from the nevada independent detailed how the state is among hardest hit by baby formula shortage experiencing at least a 50 percent decrease in formula supply we are on the top of every single bad list and the baby formula crisis is no different we are in the top three for shortages in las vegas it s a huge deal laxalt said despite the large swaths of evidence pointing to a crumbling economy establishment media outlets have attempted to paint a rosy picture marlow pointed out just this week axios ran a story called america s hidden boom arguing that the u s economy is doing extraordinarily well oh yeah they re just like don t believe your lying eyes right just absolutely amazing that this is their plan laxalt replied i hate that we re going through this the only upside is that we can finally show nevadans and the american public there s no divided government here there s no one else to blame they can t blame trump they can t point the finger at someone else although they re trying he said nevada democrats are particularly vulnerable this election with both cortez masto and gov steve sisolak d up for reelection democrats nationally have been trying to distance themselves from president joe biden as his tanking agenda makes him and those around him increasingly unpopular particularly within nevada democrats prioritization of radical leftist policies is projected to be particularly unpopular with hispanic voters a demographic key to securing a victory in the state this is the 51st u s senate seat this is the seat that s going to decide who has the majority of the u s senate laxalt explained and we must take back the senate in addition to the house to put full breaks on the biden administration for the final two years until we hopefully get them out and replace them laxalt is hoping to swipe incumbent cortez masto s seat in the november general election but he must first blow out his competition in the republican primary on june 14 with less than a week of campaigning to go the senate hopeful is leading in his party by double digits his next closest competitor sam brown trailing 26 points behind in recent polling laxalt has benefited from several high profile endorsements including from former president donald trump besides the support of conservative heavy weights laxalt points to his fighter mentality and past leadership as reasons for voters to have confidence in his ability to take on cortez masto the bottom line is that when i got elected at age 36 my first and ever run for office for attorney general in the state of nevada we were a revolutionary conservative ag office we set up the first ever federalism unit which woke up every single day trying to defend our constitutional liberties from then president obama he said they know who i am they know my principles they know my values and they understand at the moment of time we re in right now in this country with what the left is doing we need fighters laxalt contrasted himself with sam brown noting that his opponent moved to nevada three years ago only to make an unsuccessful debut in state politics and now he s running for u s senate and he felt he was supposed to be the top republican in our state after only moving here a few years ago he said as far as the head to head general match up this election is going be about law enforcement it s going to be about borders and me being a former attorney general running against another democrat former attorney general for me to have stolen all of the law enforcement endorsements is a big deal he continued it should tell everybody that we are ready for this general breitbart news daily airs monday through friday from 6 00 a m to 9 00 a m

plenty of jobs are still available and in some industries workers remain harder to find as the summer hiring season kicks into high gear with the summer break high schoolers college students and recent graduates in the upstate should have no trouble finding temporary work according to job experts there are still lots of jobs but not enough people to fill them said ann angermeier executive director of the upstate workforce investment board if students or high school graduates want to work this summer they certainly should have no problem finding a job falling jobless rate in sc south carolina s unemployment rate in april was just 3 3 down from 3 4 in march and 3 5 in february that s below the national rate of 3 6 in april in spartanburg the jobless rate was just 2 6 in april down from 3 2 in march and 4 in february greenville anderson mauldin s rate was even lower at just 2 3 in april down from 2 9 in march and 3 6 in february strong job prospects while the jobless rate is not quite as low as it was before the onset of the pandemic it is a low figure historically and reflects very strong economic conditions said bryan grady labor market division director for sc works job prospects for recent college graduates are incredibly good right now grady said because there are so many openings and so few people currently unemployed any new entrants into the labor force have a wide array of options available wages have increased substantially in most industries and locations though the high inflation rate is eating into those gains grady added while the challenges businesses are facing in hiring are clearly an issue there is a flip side that truly represents a success story for the economy hiring stays strong hiring stays strong unemployment is flat but is a slowdown coming here s what may s job report shows many employers already began advertising for summer help months ago we are all hired said kristen guilfoos of the spartanburg county parks department our process started in the early spring from summer camp counselors to temporary maintenance workers she said 108 summer positions were filled fifteen employees are new this year the others are a mix of college and high school students returning she said summer jobs advertised locally range from camp counselors and lifeguards to seasonal sales associates at retail stores many businesses are also advertising for summer interns statewide the top five occupations by supply are fast food and counter workers retail salespersons cashiers customer service representatives and laborers freight and stock movers according to sc works the top five occupations by demand are home health aides physician assistants nurse practitioners statisticians and personal care aides not enough workers according to state department of employment and workforce executive director dan ellzey the top challenge for employers is not being able to find enough workers the second most common difficulty is that young people entering the workforce do not have adequate soft skills ellzey stated in his may 20 statement on the april employment situation to address that the state workforce development board offers a certificate course to teach soft skills such as professionalism motivation and attitude as well as more complex skills such as digital literacy and problem solving it is a great time for young people to build their soft skills to better prepare for success when they enter the workforce ellzey stated near pre covid job numbers us economy on brink of recovering pre covid 19 job numbers grady said although employers are having a harder time filling jobs that doesn t mean there aren t enough potential workers south carolina has a labor force participation rate of 57 3 which is fifth lowest in the country he said this means that a relatively low share of people eligible to work are working or looking for work in many cases these people may want to work but have some sort of barrier to entry such as the lack of reliable transportation or a disability working your way up through networking angermeier said recent college graduates may have to start with an entry level job and work their way up if a college graduate does not have work experience that makes it tougher to land a job that isn t more entry level she said those with in demand degrees or certifications will most likely find a job she said networking is still the best way to land a job interview making sure their resume is clear and complete is very important she said having a linkedin account that is kept up to date is a bonus sc works offers help with resume writing and with setting up a lindedin page meanwhile angermeier said many local businesses are looking to fill permanent positions many of them are not temporary positions but are used for permanent jobs she said some use the employment firms to try people out for a few months prior to them going on the company payroll some companies will hire as a

new york recent conversations about the global economy and markets have been defined by a set of recurring questions while there are many moving parts that are difficult to capture in a single clear picture it is worth attempting to bring some of the biggest issues into better focus the first question is straightforward is a recession looming with authoritative growth forecasts like those from the international monetary fund having been revised significantly downward and likely to be downgraded further there is good reason to worry but a global recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth remains unlikely though a major shock such as a dramatic expansion of conflict or a sudden and significant disruption in a key market like energy could change this outlook some economies however certainly will contract russia s gdp will surely shrink even with higher oil and gas prices as a result of severe and most likely prolonged western sanctions europe too is likely to experience a recession owing to high energy prices heavy dependence on fossil fuel imports and the costly imperative of rapidly weaning itself from russian supplies and many lower income countries for which soaring food and energy prices are compounding the effects of the pandemic are facing harder times while the united states appears increasingly likely to face a major economic slowdown a recession is not the most likely scenario similarly china normally a powerful engine of global growth is set to experience low single digit growth for at least a year owing to the combined effects of covid 19 lockdowns low vaccination uptake among the elderly some loss of investor confidence in high growth tech sectors and a real estate sector beset by high debts and falling prices the second key question relates to the trajectory of inflation the proximate cause of recent price increases is supply chain blockages and imbalances between supply and demand the war in ukraine has intensified upward pressure on energy commodities and food prices some of this will be transitory though it will last longer than initially expected but inflation is also being fueled by secular trends that are not set to fade anytime soon populations representing about 75 per cent of the global economy are aging labor force participation is declining and productivity growth is trending downward moreover unused productive capacity in developing economies a key source of deflationary pressure in the past is smaller than it used to be and what there is remains unused add to that a coming policy driven diversification of supply and demand linkages a response to myriad shocks from the pandemic and climate change to geopolitical tensions and conflict and an extended period of supply constrained growth with embedded inflationary pressures seems likely the third recurring question is what is next for the tech sector and the digital transformation it is propelling lockdowns and other public health measures spurred an acceleration in adoption of digital technologies during the pandemic but contrary to market expectations this trend is likely to slow as pandemic restrictions are removed amid overly optimistic growth projections equity markets produced valuations that would have been unrealistic in the best of times at a time of surging inflation monetary tightening and falling growth projections markets have begun correcting not surprisingly growth stocks whose value is derived from expected future cash flows and which tend to be concentrated in the tech sector have fallen particularly sharply these market gyrations do not mean that the digital energy and biomedical transformations that are underway lack substance or that they will not have long lasting economic effects markets naturally tend to be more volatile than the underlying economic reality they are supposed to mirror momentum incentives cause overshoots in both directions higher market volatility will have important short run consequences because venture capital and private equity funding which plays a vital role in supporting innovative potentially high growth companies is not insulated from it during upswings valuations are rich and some companies with dubious claims to durable growth dynamics are funded during downswings private valuations lag behind market adjustments by about 6 9 months experts estimate partly because both investors and companies resist adjusting valuations downward until the need to raise additional capital forces the issue even now growth companies are being urged to cut costs and conserve capital during this period deal prices are out of line with realistic longer term values making funding difficult and impeding growth and innovation a final question that seems to be preoccupying minds lately is whether the war in ukraine europe s resolve to reduce its dependence on russian oil and gas and sky high fossil fuel prices will derail the low carbon transition fortunately there are good reasons to think that it might not at least not in a lasting way for starters high fossil fuel prices create a strong incentive for countries and consumers to boost energy efficiency and invest in sustainable energy solutions in this sense they go some way toward offsetting the failure to establish an effective global carbon pricing scheme high fossil fuel prices will have adverse distributional effects within and across countries resembling the impact of a regressive tax but these effects can be mitigated ideally through some form of income redistribution what governments should not do is subsidise fossil fuels by regulating final prices below market levels as this would weaken the incentive to pursue more sustainable options there is a good argument for stabilising energy prices to encourage investment in alternatives but that does not mean cutting off the peaks while leaving the troughs in place geopolitics is also bolstering the clean energy incentive unlike fossil fuels renewables largely do not create external dependencies the green transition is thus a powerful mechanism for increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability to the weaponisation of energy supplies ultimately the green transition is a multidecade process during which the energy mix shifts gradually from fossil fuels to clean alternatives in the near term economies especially europe might resort to dirty energy including coal to meet their needs but this need not spell disaster for the energy transition let alone the global sustainability agenda

the retired investor natural gas prices fall but for how long only recently have investors focus shifted from 120 a barrel of oil to the soaring price of natural gas given the many uses of natural gas from heating and cooling and generating electricity to the production of plastics and petrochemicals the direction of prices could be critical to our economic well being on wednesday june 8 2022 natural gas prices fell over 10 percent after a fire at a texas liquified natural gas lng export terminal shut down the freeport lng facility for at least three weeks the terminal accounts for 16 percent of u s export capacity gas prices fell because for a brief time that gas will flow into the domestic market depressing prices in the short term thus far in 2022 henry hub natural gas futures are trading at 8 23 metric million british thermal unit mmbtu down from 9 44 mmbtu but still up 10 percent which is a fourteen year high many analysts believe the present price rise is unsustainable but summer heat export demand and a robust hurricane season may continue to pressure prices higher the federal energy regulatory commission ferc estimated that u s demand for natural gas would outpace supply this summer ferc expects that u s demand for natural gas production will increase by 3 4 percent over the summer compared to a projected 4 8 percent increase in consumption during that same period overall a drop in the u s supply of natural gas in storage is driving the price gains and the prospect for storage gains is dismal at best how did the u s end up in this predicament blame the pandemic or regulation or both there was a large decline in production in 2020 when extraction of gas oil and most fossil fuels fell off a cliff many small gas producers went out of business during that period while larger companies trailed off production to protect profit margins government regulations did their part as well wall street bankers also wanted more dividends and stock buybacks and less production from the gas companies that survived the downturn as supply dwindled demand for u s exports of liquefied natural gas lng continued to increase to record levels this year 2022 the u s has become the world s largest exporter of lng however the majority of the world s lng supply is sold under contract many of these contracts are decades long as a result most of the u s lng supply is already spoken for no one counted on the ukraine war as russia invaded ukraine the price of natural gas in europe exploded higher traders initially thought europe s price hikes would have an impact on this side of the pond but over time higher european prices had only a minor impact on the price of natural gas here in north america as gas markets go the u s is an isolated market the u s natural gas market produces 97 billion cubic feet per day bcfd of natural gas which is just enough for domestic consumption with another 12 bcfd available for lng exports however president joe biden has since promised to supply more natural gas to europe to replace russian fossil fuels the problem with this pledge is that no one knows where the additional supplies are going to come from there is little lng available and even if there were it is extremely difficult to re route lng from one region to another one might think that with rising prices why not simply increase production that is easier said than done labor and material shortages in addition to a more cautious approach to drilling as a result of finance and regulation have conspired to bring on some production but at a much slower rate in february 2022 monthly production hit 115 2 bcfd but that was down from 118 7 bcfd in december 2021 since then we have seen a steady decline average gas production output in the lower 48 states fell to 94 7 bcfd in june 2022 from 95 1 bcfd in may 2022 as a result storage levels are 18 percent lower than last year and 16 percent lower than the five year average the way gas storage works some storage historically is left unused in preparation for the winter when more gas is normally consumed that is not happening this year and all the above supply constraints could be exasperated by climate change the national weather service is already warning of another summer season of record breaking heat waves in the southern states that wave has already commenced in places like texas oklahoma and louisiana the nation s utilities which are charged with supplying the electricity necessary to run all those air conditioners have switched in times past to coal for power but coal is now even more expensive than gas we have not even spoken about this year s hurricane season june 1 to november 30 2022 historically major hurricanes have disrupted both oil and gas production refining and delivery in many areas of the u s noaa s climate prediction center a division of the national weather service is predicting above average activity this year with between 14 to 21 named storms on the horizon at the very least i would suspect that down the road we will all be paying higher utility bills as utilities grapple with higher natural gas costs it will take some time to pass the costs through to the consumers depending on how tropical the summer gets those higher monthly bills could persist well into the winter
