veteran prop master neal w zoromski turned down work on the movie rust citing a series of red flags about the production neal w zoromski has spent three decades in hollywood working on movies big and small but never on a western so he was thrilled last month when he was asked to join the crew of an alec baldwin film in new mexico the veteran prop master immediately told rust production managers that he was interested in the job that would give him responsibility for the accoutrements of the old west pistols rifles wagons saddles and flour sacks were needed to re create 1880s kansas for baldwin who was playing a grizzled outlaw named harland rust but during four days of informal discussions with film managers zoromski said he got a bad feeling advertisement there were massive red flags he said in an interview sunday with the times he said he felt that rust was too much of a slapdash production one with an overriding focus on saving money instead of a concern for people s safety production managers didn t seem to value experience and were brushing off his questions he said zoromski ultimately told rust production managers that he would take a pass after i pressed send on that last email i felt in the pit of my stomach that is an accident waiting to happen he said last thursday baldwin fatally shot 42 year old cinematographer halyna hutchins in the chest with a prop gun while rehearsing a gunfight scene inside a wooden church at the bonanza creek ranch movie set near santa fe n m baldwin who also is a producer on the film was practicing removing his revolver from its holster and aiming it toward the camera rust director joel souza who also was injured told a santa fe county sheriff s detective that he heard what sounded like a whip and then a loud pop hutchins a rising star in the industry crumpled over and fellow crew members struggled to treat her wound she was later airlifted about 50 miles away to an albuquerque hospital where she was pronounced dead she left behind a husband and 9 year old son production has been shut down and santa fe county sheriff s deputies and the new mexico occupational health and safety bureau are investigating the accident advertisement tensions were boiling on set on thursday the 12th day of a 21 day production union camera operators and their assistants had walked off the job to protest working conditions nonunion camera operators were brought in and the switch put the director behind schedule the assistant director had yelled at the script supervisor during lunch according to a copy of the 911 recording days earlier a camera operator had reported two accidental gun discharges during a rehearsal in a cabin this is super unsafe the camera operator wrote in a text message to the production manager the times reported friday the tragedy occurred amid a boisterous debate within zoromski s union the international alliance of theatrical stage employees over whether to go on strike to seek better pay and improved conditions on film and tv sets the rust producers late last week released a statement the safety of our cast and crew is the top priority of rust productions and everyone associated with the company though we were not made aware of any official complaints concerning weapon or prop safety on set we will be conducting an internal review of our procedures while production is shut down we will continue to cooperate with the santa fe authorities in their investigation and offer mental health services to the cast and crew during this tragic time now zoromski who lives in los angeles is haunted by hutchins death he believes that had he accepted the rust job things would have turned out differently i take my job incredibly seriously he said as the prop master you have to be concerned about safety i m the guy who hands the guns to the people on set advertisement zoromski 57 didn t grow up wanting to be in the movie business born in new zealand he traveled around the world with his adopted parents before moving at age 5 with his mother to rhode island he graduated from boston college with a biochemistry degree he had planned a career in the pharmaceutical industry but he was in need of a job he worked at a restaurant in l a in retail and then at a cutthroat commercial real estate brokerage on the west side finally a friend steered him to roger corman s b movie studio where he was hired to work as an art department assistant his first day on the job he was sent to a horse barn where they were shooting the 1990 film the haunting of morella the barn was dilapidated and tiny cracks between wall timbers allowed sunlight to seep in and ruin the camera lighting an art director ordered zoromski to stuff hay into the cracks to block out the sun he spent the day meticulously gluing hay strands to fill the seams between the boards the art director was impressed with his diligence and he was hired zoromski then worked on tv movies and music videos with paula abdul madonna and guns n roses before moving to feature films he s worked on several major productions including in the props department on roland emmerich s 2004 day after tomorrow with jake gyllenhaal and dennis quaid he was prop master for jason reitman s 2005 film thank you for smoking advertisement it was 9 p m sept 20 when the rust production manager row walters reached out to see if zoromski was interested in becoming the props master for the film an hour later zoromski replied via email that he was very interested the two sides engaged in conversations throughout that week but zoromski later changed his mind citing several concerns he said he felt that rust production managers were being evasive when he asked about specific terms of his potential employment the budget estimated at about 7 million seemed too small for the type of film the producers were attempting to make he couldn t get an answer on the budget for his kit industry jargon for his cache of props needed to stock the set he said he also became alarmed because it was just two weeks before rust was set to begin filming in new mexico and the producers hadn t yet hired a prop master typically those decisions are made weeks even months before the cameras roll in the movies the prep is everything you also need time to clean inspect and repair guns he said you need time to fix old clocks in period films you are sometimes using antiques but here there was absolutely no time to prepare and that gave me a bad feeling neal w zoromski is a veteran prop master who turned down an offer to work on the movie rust myung j chun los angeles times and the deal breaker zoromski said he initially asked for a department of five technicians he was told that rust was a low budget production and that plans were to use items from a local prop house he modified his request to have at least two experienced crew members one to serve as an assistant prop master and the other as an armorer or gun wrangler dedicated to making sure the weapons were safe oiled and functioning properly advertisement but the rust producers insisted that only one person was needed to handle both tasks you never have a prop assistant double as the armorer zoromski said those are two really big jobs walters the production manager sent zoromski an email sept 24 that read we d really like one of the assistants to be the armorer that can push up on the gunfights and heavy armor days according to a copy of the email shared with the times walters did not respond to requests for comment zoromski replied unfortunately i have to pass on this opportunity i am grateful for your interest and wish nothing but the very best for you your crew and the show three days later 24 year old hannah gutierrez reed announced on facebook that she had a new gig on a film in santa fe according to a screen shot of a recent social media post which was shared with the times she d landed the job as the property key assistant armorer on rust according to the production notes now questions are being raised about gutierrez reed s experience and her performance on the job gutierrez reed had worked as head armorer on only one other production before rust according to search warrants she left three weapons on a rolling cart outside the church setting at midday thursday souza the film s director told a santa fe county sheriff s office investigator that multiple people had been handling the guns and that he wasn t sure whether anyone had checked them for safety after the group came back from lunch advertisement

cnn by tami luhby cnn racing to find alternate ways to pay for their massive budget reconciliation package congressional democrats are now targeting the wealth of the very richest americans oregon sen ron wyden chair of the senate finance committee released on wednesday the details of the complicated and controversial plan that he s been working on for at least two years the proposal would tax billionaires on the gain in value of certain assets every year instead of only at the time of sale as is currently done the rich often borrow against these holdings to build more wealth and fund their lifestyles while avoiding adding to their annual income tax tab it would only hit those at the very very top of the wealth ladder roughly 700 people those with more than 1 billion in assets or with reported income of more than 100 million for three consecutive years people like amazon founder jeff bezos and tesla ceo elon musk related how to tax elon musk and jeff bezos for tradable assets such as stocks billionaires would pay capital gains tax currently 23 8 on the increase in value and take deductions for losses annually they d be able to carry forward the losses to offset future taxable income and capital gains and in certain circumstances to carry back losses for three years the senator also devised a novel approach to handle non tradable assets such as real estate and interest in businesses which make up much of the wealthy s net worth but are harder to value year to year these assets would not be taxed annually instead billionaires would pay capital gains tax plus an interest charge when they sell the holding the charge would be the amount of interest due on the levy had the asset been subject to annual capital gains tax and that tax had been deferred the rate would be the applicable federal short term rate plus one point which would total 1 22 currently to transition to the new marked to market system billionaires could elect to pay the first tax levy over five years and they could choose to treat up to 1 billion in tradable stock in a single corporation as a non tradable asset which is aimed at allowing those who found successful companies to maintain their controlling interest the billionaires income tax would ensure billionaires pay tax every year just like working americans wyden said we have a historic opportunity with the billionaires income tax to restore fairness to our tax code and fund critical investments in american families funding the budget reconciliation package lawmakers are trying to swiftly cobble together the ways to pay for their sweeping social spending package which would also include imposing a 15 minimum tax on corporations so they can release it in the coming days but it s unclear if all democrats are on board with the billionaires tax particularly in the house where some are raising concerns about whether the levy is a workable solution democratic sens joe manchin of west virginia and mark warner of virginia one of the wealthiest members of congress are also voicing resistance related democrats want to tax the very rich here s who they are the billionaire tax plan could bring in as much as 250 billion in revenue house speaker nancy pelosi told cnn s jake tapper on sunday but additional tax and revenue measures would be required to cover the cost of the budget reconciliation package which has an estimated price tag of around 2 trillion democrats are in this position because they ve been blocked from raising the corporate tax rate and top marginal individual income tax rate to levels at or closer to where they were before republicans slashed taxes in 2017 arizona sen kyrsten sinema has refused to support these measures and democrats need the votes of all 50 members to pass the budget reconciliation measure in the senate it s a process of elimination said howard gleckman senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center after everyone has rejected everything else this is kind of what s left taxing wealth though many democrats have long wanted to tap into the wealth held by those at the top to pay for social programs and address income inequality they have generally failed to do so sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren proposed levying a tax on the net worth of the ultra wealthy during their recent presidential campaigns and warren unveiled the ultra millionaire tax act earlier this year president joe biden has floated proposals to tax wealthy americans unrealized capital gains at death separate from the existing estate tax and to require their heirs to pay tax on the full increase in value of the asset when they sell it not just the gain from the time they inherited it closing the step up loophole but none of these measures made it into last month s house budget reconciliation proposal which largely depended on raising tax rates until sinema made her opposition clear soaring wealth the proposal to tax unrealized capital gains comes at a time when better off americans have seen their net worth skyrocket thanks to soaring stock prices and real estate values during the pandemic us household wealth hit a record 141 7 trillion in the second quarter up 21 during the pandemic according to an oxford economics analysis of federal reserve bank data the gains continue to be heavily skewed with those in the top income quintile accounting for 73 and those in the top 1 enjoying 36 of the increase respectively meanwhile americans in the bottom income quintile saw their household net worth grow by just 1 during the pandemic according to the analysis complicated proposal in addition to encountering deep pocketed opposition from powerful interests taxes on wealth and unrealized capital gains could be very complicated to administer experts said publicly traded assets such as stocks would not be as difficult to handle investors now have to determine the value of their capital gain or loss when they sell the assets and report it on their tax returns but one issue that had long been a sticking point was annually valuing non tradable assets including private companies entrepreneurial ventures mansions artwork and other collections even under wyden s plan billionaires would likely have to hire appraisers to determine the annual change in worth which could spark years long battles with the internal revenue service and like a tax on wealth the levy on unrealized gains could be subject to legal challenge threats of which are already percolating it s one reason why wyden is framing his proposal as an income tax but legal scholars are already battling over whether the measure would withstand a court battle democrats have a dozen ways to tax the rich that raise no serious constitutional issues including higher rates and a lower estate tax exemption tweeted daniel hemel university of chicago law school professor why do the one thing for which constitutionality actually isn t super clear he tweeted the constitution gives congress the power to levy taxes such as tariffs on commerce however it places limitations on so called direct taxes though the definition of these has long been unclear the 16th amendment which was ratified in 1913 established congress right to impose a federal income tax also an early 20th century supreme court ruling upheld the ability of congress to levy an estate tax other issues billionaires who have lots of assets but little cash on hand would have to find the money to pay the tax the rich would likely also take steps to avoid the tax reducing the amount of revenue it would raise adding such a tax would increase the pressure on the irs which already struggles with its workload and on the treasury department said garrett watson senior policy analyst at the tax foundation a right leaning think tank it would be easier for policy makers politically and from a policy perspective to raise tax rates rather than make very complicated untested changes to the tax base like this watson said they come with their own set of risks this story has been updated with additional information the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s

opinion freshness is nice familiarity is too but the capture of social media by so called progressives has subjected americans to a torrent of outlandish images and words informing them that the arc of history demands they abandon the way of life they hold dear now returns donald trump to the public eye with his signature appeal to not only hold fast but push back the competition among media outlets for attention is already stiff but if mr trump is determined to mount a counterbalance to the lethal left he is welcome back to the fray last week the former president announced his start up of the trump media technology group which includes truth social a media network meant for his followers and other freethinkers who reject the ideological guardrails of trendy media bosses truth media is expected to debut in november with the launch of an app he said and he promised to add woke free entertainment content later i created truth social and tmtg to stand up to the tyranny of big tech said mr trump in a statement we live in a world where the taliban has a huge presence on twitter yet your favorite american president has been silenced this is unacceptable i am excited to send out my first truth on truth social very soon indeed the former president was unceremoniously banned from twitter for life following the jan 6 capitol riot while afghan terror mongers are free to tweet their depredations to a global audience facebook suspended him for two years and youtube indefinitely it doesn t take a dipstick to gauge that media mavens like twitter ceo jack dorsey are in the tank for the content which fueled the anti american left s campaign to expel mr trump from power the creeping influence of various cyber platforms has hooked americans on an addictive blend of gossip and pseudo news that most loathe but few can refuse an nbc poll earlier this year found 66 percent of respondents said they check their social media accounts at least once a day glaringly 64 percent admitted that daily use of social media has more ill effects upon society than good clearly the digital atmosphere of envy and spite is poisonous to social well being will truth social prove a healthier choice predictions are risky but there seems to be a market for a trump brand of countervailing political perspective digital world acquisition corp a company that is taking his digital platform public saw its stock price enjoy an 800 plus percent spike at least temporarily during post announcement trading it is long past time to return to reliance on media platforms committed to balanced news like the washington times if donald trump wishes to challenge the crowded field of left loving social media there is always room on the right for patriots whose hearts are tattooed with the right white and blue
washington the democrats idea for a new billionaires tax to help pay for president joe biden s social services and climate change plan quickly ran into criticism as too cumbersome with some lawmakers preferring the original plan of simply raising the top tax rates on corporations and the wealthy biden said monday he s hopeful the talks with congress can wrap up overall agreement on the package this week it s tallying at least 1 75 trillion and could still be more biden said it would be very very positive to get it done before he departs for two overseas global summits recommended videos that s my hope the president said before leaving his home state of delaware for a trip to new jersey to highlight the child care proposals in the package and a related infrastructure measure with the grace of god and the goodwill of the neighbors resolving the revenue side is key as the democrats scale back what had been a 3 5 trillion plan insisting all the new spending will be fully paid for and not pile onto the debt biden vows any new taxes would hit only the wealthy those earning more than 400 000 a year or 450 000 for couples the white house had to rethink its tax strategy after one key democrat sen kyrsten sinema d ariz objected to her party s initial proposal to raise tax rates on wealthy americans by undoing the trump era tax cuts on those earning beyond 400 000 sinema also opposed lifting the 21 corporate tax rate with a 50 50 senate biden has no votes to spare in his party instead to win over sinema and others the white house has been floating a new idea of taxing the assets of billionaires and another that would require corporations to pay a 15 minimum tax regardless of if they show any profits those both appear to be gaining traction with another pivotal democrat sen joe manchin d w va who told reporters he supported new ways to ensure the wealthy to pay their fair share democrats on the senate finance committee led by sen ron wyden of oregon are prepared to roll out the tax revenue plan in a matter of days it is likely to include other revenue raising tax measures including a plan to beef up the irs to go after tax scofflaws here s the heart of it americans read over the last few months that billionaires were paying little or no taxes for years on end wyden said at the capitol the billionaires tax is being modeled on a 2019 bill from wyden to treat assets as income another idea up to a 3 ultra rich surtax has been proposed by sen elizabeth warren d mass under wyden s emerging plan the billionaires tax would hit the wealthiest of americans fewer than 1 000 people it would require those with assets of more than 1 billion or three years consecutive income of 100 million to pay taxes on the gains of stocks and other tradeable assets rather than waiting until holdings are sold a similar billionaire s tax would be applied to non tradeable assets including real estate but it would be deferred with the tax not assessed until the asset was sold overall the billionaires tax rate has not been set but it is expected to be at least the 20 capital gains rate democrats have said it could raise 200 billion in revenue that could help fund biden s package over 10 years senate republican leader mitch mcconnell called it a hare brained scheme and warned of revenue drying up during downturns some republicans indicated such a tax plan could be challenged in court but key fellow democrats are also raising concerns saying the idea of simply undoing the 2017 tax cuts by hiking top rates was more straightforward and transparent under the house s bill from the ways and means committee the top individual income tax rate would rise from 37 to 39 6 on those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for couples the corporate rate would increase from 21 to 26 5 the bill also proposed a 3 surtax on wealthier americans with adjusted income beyond 5 million a year the panel s chairman rep richard neal d mass said he told wyden in a discussion monday that the implementation of the senator s proposed billionaire s plan is a bit more challenging neal suggested that the house s proposal was off the table despite sinema s objections in fact he said our plan looks better every day once democrats agree to the tax proposals they can assess how much is funding available for biden s overall package to expand health care child care and other climate change programs democrats were hoping biden could cite major accomplishments to world leaders later this week they are also facing an oct 31 deadline to pass a related 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package of roads broadband and other public works before routine federal transportation funds expire we need to get this done biden said in remarks at a new jersey transit center after months of start and stop negotiations biden s overall package is now being eyed as at least 1 75 trillion but it could still climb considerably higher according to a second person who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks biden huddled with the conservative west virginia democrat manchin and senate majority leader chuck schumer at the president s delaware home on sunday as they work on resolving the disputes between centrists and progressives that have stalled the bill disputes remain over far reaching investments including plans to expand medicare coverage with dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors child care assistance free pre kindergarten and a new program of four weeks paid family leave house speaker nancy pelosi said expected an agreement by week s end paving the way for a house vote on the 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill the senate had approved that over the summer but the measure stalled during deliberations on the broader biden bill but rep pramila jayapal d wash the chair of the congressional progressive caucus whose support will be crucial for both bills said lawmakers want more than just a framework for biden s plan before they give their votes for the smaller infrastructure package we want the whole bill jayapal told the associated press we want to vote on both bills at the same time ___ associated press writers farnoush amiri hope yen and colleen long contributed to this report ___ this story has been corrected to show rep richard neal is from massachusetts not new jersey

automaker s total market value to just over 1 trillion the wealth of ceo elon musk the richest person in the world grew 11 4 percent to 255 8 billion according to forbes in his interview with the ap fields made clear his belief that electric vehicles are increasingly moving into the mainstream and that hertz intends to be a leading provider of evs to rental customers he pointed to surveys showing that over the past five years consumer interest in electric vehicles has grown dramatically more are willing to try and buy he said it s pretty stunning fields said that hertz which is based in estero florida is in discussions with other automakers too about buying additional electric vehicles as it expands its ev fleet as more models enter the marketplace hertz also is investing in its own charging network fields said it has plans for 3 000 chargers in 65 locations across the united states by the end of 2022 and 4 000 by the end of 2023 many of the sites will be at hertz locations such as airports he said while others will be in suburban areas advertisement customers also would be able to use tesla s own large charging network for a fee fields said the company has a network of about 25 000 chargers worldwide fields declined to say how much hertz will charge to rent the teslas or whether they would be more expensive for customers than gas powered vehicles daniel ives a technology analyst at wedbush securities wrote in a note monday to investors that hertz s order represents a major feather in the cap for tesla and shows that a broad adoption of electric vehicles is under way as part of this oncoming green tidal wave hitting the u s china and europe have been ahead of the u s on vehicle electrification but demand in the united states is accelerating ives noted with tesla leading the way followed by startup lucid motors general motors ford and others that are chasing a potential 5 trillion market opportunity over the next decade in an interview ives said he expected other rental car companies to follow hertz s lead it s a wake up call for the rest of the industry as well he said advertisement ives suggested that the deal will help tesla and other manufacturers by giving thousands of consumers the experience of driving electric vehicles who might not otherwise have done so it s the ultimate test drive he said for a company that doesn t normally market this is the best brand and marketing deal they ve ever struck he said of tesla hertz s order may also help alleviate a nationwide shortage of rental cars he said automakers have slashed production and sales to rental car companies because of a global shortage of computer chips still ives said he doesn t expect hertz to receive significant numbers of teslas until the automaker s new factory near austin texas starts producing late next year hertz likely will charge customers more to rent the model 3s compared with conventional vehicles with combustion engines ives noted hertz global holdings inc filed for bankruptcy protection in may 2020 two months after the coronavirus erupted across the country it was among the first major corporations to be felled by the pandemic as infections surged and shut down travel on a global scale for both companies and vacationers in october hertz named fields a former ford motor co ceo as its interim chief executive shortly after hertz s announcement monday the national transportation safety board released a letter from its chairwoman chastising tesla for failing to respond to recommendations that emerged from several fatal crash investigations involving

congressional democrats are trying to muscle through a deal on the white house s multitrillion dollar social welfare bill before president biden leaves town but some key moderates are calling for still more cuts to be made in exchange for their support congressional leaders hope to have an agreement on the 10 year package s top line figures by wednesday before mr biden departs the next day for the global climate summit in scotland administration allies say mr biden wants to arrive at the summit with a major climate policy in place to showcase washington s commitment to combating global warming and to pressure other countries like china russia and india to offer bolder cuts next week is a critical week for president biden and for our leadership on the world stage as a country said sen chris coons delaware democrat and a close confidant of the president to to have him go and say well we re still working out the details and then work out the detail a week later would be an enormous missed opportunity despite the looming time crunch democrats are still far away from agreeing on a final version of the massive bill whose fate is tied to a separate 1 2 trillion physical infrastructure bill democrats also want to pass the white house initially wanted the bill to run upward of 3 5 trillion over 10 years and include long sought liberal priorities such as free community college amnesty for immigrants who are in the u s illegally and more climate change regulations paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations but after two moderate democrats sens joe manchin iii of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona raised objections the white house was forced to retreat the moderates influence stems from the fact that democrats plan to pass the spending bill using budget reconciliation the special legislative procedure allows some spending bills to avoid the senate 60 vote filibuster threshold and pass by a simple majority of 51 votes since the senate is currently split 50 50 between both parties any single lawmaker can exert significant influence over the negotiations at the moment mr manchin and ms sinema have done exactly forcing mr biden to scale back the price tag of the bill from 3 5 trillion to about 2 2 trillion the figure might not be low enough however mr manchin told reporters that while a broad agreement was possible by the end of the week his ceiling for the bill was still at 1 5 trillion we re all working in good faith said mr manchin i ve been talking to everybody as you know i think we ve got a good understanding of each other better than we ever have it remains to be seen how progressives will respond to further attempts to pare down the bill some like sen bernard sanders have long argued that the 3 5 trillion initially proposed by mr biden was already enough of a compromise anybody who believes we can create the meaningful change this country needs without standing up to the greed and corruption of the ruling class is sorely mistaken said mr sanders an independent from vermont who caucuses with the democrats already dropped by the wayside has been mr biden s proposal to grant two free years of community college regardless of citizenship also out is a tax credit plan that many hoped would force electric utility companies to abandon coal and natural gas in favor of wind and solar power the deal still includes money for a universal pre kindergarten program and child care subsidies although both are likely to be limited to lower earning families money is also earmarked for transitioning the federal fleet of vehicles to electricity a further 3 5 billion would be spent on creating a civilian climate corps program to employ young people to plant trees mr biden has been forced to further limit his ambitions when it comes to the child tax credit and paid family leave the package is now only likely to include four weeks of paid leave rather than the 12 originally floated by the white house similarly the expansion of the child tax credit will only be extended for another year the white house initially proposed to make the credit permanent which gives parents with children under the age of 6 approximately 3 600 in direct payments annually i ve always said that i believe that government should be your best partner but it shouldn t be your provider said mr manchin we have a moral obligation to provide to those who have incapacities such as physical or mental but everyone else should be able to help and chip in and all that there is also disagreement among democrats over how to fund the bill ms sinema has already signaled her opposition to raising the corporate taxes and the income rate on top earners that resistance has forced democrats to find other ways to pay for all of the new funding being proposed at the moment the top alternative is a wealth tax which would tax billionaires annually on the increased value of their assets like stocks and real estate also up for consideration is a 15 global minimum tax on corporations which would apply to overseas profits while mr manchin has said he is open to considering both ideas ms sinema has remained silent requests for comment by both mr manchin and ms sinema were not returned mr biden s climate summit is not the only looming deadline democrats face over the next week at the end of the month federal funding for highways and roads is set to run out democrats hope that instead of passing a short term funding measure they can move forward with the 1 2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill the measure which has been sitting idle in the house since passing the senate over the summer has been linked to the reconciliation package left wing democrats have explicitly pledged to tank the infrastructure bill unless moderates agree to support the social welfare bill as well no one ever said passing transformational legislation like this would be easy but we are on track to get this done said senate majority leader charles e schumer a new york democrat haris alic can be reached at halic washingtontimes com

nwe earnings call for the period ending september 30 2021 northwestern corporation nwe 0 47 q3 2021 earnings call 3 30 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer continue to be under recovery of electric supply costs and you see that impact reflected in 106 9 million increase overall year to date in electric supply or overall energy supply costs and you can see the breakout at the bottom between electric and natural gas from a quarter perspective that s about a 20 million continuing trend as we think about it year to date slide 10 the non gaap earnings slide i would point you to a couple of things here again we ve already talked about the impact ongoing of favorable weather and you will see for the quarter 0 05 of favorable weather that we remove that compares to 0 01 of unfavorable weather in the prior quarter the other item i would mention here is again that mark to market of the qf liability adjustment there with 0 02 so when you look at the quarter of 0 68 on a diluted eps basis adjusted to 0 65 on a non gaap basis compared to the prior period of 0 58 of earnings adjusted to 0 59 so that s 0 65 on a non gaap basis compared to 0 59 again driven by margin improvement offset by some higher operating costs slide 11 i would mention that the quarter again was in line with our expectations i ll remind you that in q2 we narrowed in our guidance a bit we had a wider range at the beginning here of 0 20 we narrowed that down to 0 15 and have reaffirmed our guidance for 21 at 3 43 to 3 58 per diluted share and q2 we also discussed that we expect proceeds of 200 million in 21 from our equity offering and that s driven by higher capital but also remind you we had delayed equity from 2020 and in 21 are executing on that we are on track for 450 million of capital in 2021 which is a higher number than we ve been at in prior years so with that expect to stay consistent with our guidance for 2021 and then broadly we re close to eei here in a couple of weeks and with that we re looking forward to discussing with you our plans in 2022 including both guidance capital program and also where we will be going from an equity needs perspective so bob back to you 10 stocks we like better than northwestern when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and northwestern wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 robert c rowe chief executive officer crystal it sounded like you were selling tickets to eei good job a couple of regulatory items first concerning the power cost credit adjustment mechanism we had requested we requested approval to increase the base forecast given that the existing pcam really is energy driven not capacity driven we implemented an interim of about 17 million of loss replacer pardon me anyways we implemented the interim subsequently then the consumer council filed a motion arguing that the pcam can only be adjusted in a general rate case we were disappointed that the commission granted that motion to dismiss however we have not seen a written order when we do see that we will evaluate and certainly have the opportunity to request reconsideration our view is that under the tariff the pcam base may be reset outside of a rate case second concerning our decoupling mechanism as you know we requested that that be suspended early on in covid as the disparate direction of the residential and c i sectors really highlighted that the mechanism was a mismatch to its intended purpose and the commission voted to grant our request to suspend we consider that a real positive the consumer council had requested reconsideration and that was denied so that s a very good outcome and then finally i know we ll come back and talk about this on may 19 we had filed a request for approval of three capacity resources including our laurel plant and we withdrew that request simply to manage the supply chain issues and we re very much going ahead with the laurel plant brian will come back and talk about that a couple other regulatory matters really below the radar ferc has initiated a routine audit covering the years 2018 to present we responded to quite a few data requests haven t yet received a report but that is expected within the next six months can t really speak to the outcome of that and then just a couple of weeks ago wecc western electricity coordinating council initiated one of their audits brian and our vice president for transmission mike cashell and i all participated in the kick off with our wecc audit team we consider those to be constructive and important processes and we re looking forward to the results there and now moving on to the capital plan as crystal mentioned we will be updating our plans and discussing that with you at eei but as is reflected here we currently have a 2 1 billion overall capital plan over the next five years which we expect to finance with cash flows from operations first mortgage bonds and equity issuances then as always financing plans are subject to change two important highlights to this current plan first of all the plan as depicted here does include about 60 million for 30 to 40 megawatt flexible generating plant near aberdeen and we decided to discontinue our plans there as a result of significant increases in estimated construction costs and the overall supply chain challenges we will obviously continue to monitor our customers needs in south dakota and make appropriate decisions to address those on the other hand these projections do not include about 275 million of anticipated investment in the 175 megawatt generation facility to be constructed near laurel so this overall level of capital is anticipated to result in an annualized rate base growth of 4 to 5 and with the acceleration of the laurel project and the discontinuation of the aberdeen project we anticipate we do anticipate providing an update at eei coming up in just a few weeks and i ll now turn it over to chief operating officer brian bird for an update on the generation portfolio and also to report our progress on esg matters brian b bird president and chief operating officer thanks bob as bob pointed out obviously we withdrew our filing associated with the laurel project but we are certainly moving ahead with the project in fact we want to take advantage of the fixed price contract and protect our customers from rising costs that everyone is seeing and also to get moving as quickly as we can on the project in case unforeseen supply chain issues arise in addition to that the beartooth battery contract since the time period to build that facility is much much shorter than the laurel plant we do plan to bring that in front of the commission as a stand alone pre approval filing and in fact we plan to file that relatively soon in addition to that the powerex contract which will actually go in effects in early 2022 will be available to provide protection to our customers coming up in the coming winter season in regards to south dakota we are in construction of a 16 megawatt plant and it s going relatively well with covid and some other supply chain issues it has been pushed out to early 22 but we re excited about seeing that come online here relatively soon as we pointed out as bob pointed out in terms of the aberdeen plant we looked at the rising costs we did not have an opportunity to lock in prices associated to that project we are still in the development phase and we are negotiating those prices but it was we saw those prices go up we picked the prudent thing and talked with the south dakota commission and talked about the expected increase in the price of that project and collectively agreed with folks we discussed the matter decided to put a hold to the project and come back at what we hope is a more reasonable pricing and then possibly with different alternatives sometime down the road moving on to esg i guess i would say one of the big advantages of being a member of nasdaq is they have services one of which is onereport it s a tool that we can track all of our esg related information we ve certainly used that tool in the first half of the year recorded everything that we can capture today and loaded it into one report we ve now disseminated that information to those folks that rate us from an esg perspective and we also dovetailed that into the release of our brand new web page which is you will see that esg is very very prominent in that we re already seeing some improvement in some of our scores and we expect to see a bit more as people continue their process of looking at our information and with that i ll send it back to bob robert c rowe chief executive officer okay and with that we are ready for your questions questions and answers travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thank you bob and team looks like we have our first question in the queue from ryan greenwald of bofa ryan ryan is your line unmuted ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey can you hear me travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yeah now we can ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst awesome appreciate the time good afternoon everyone travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer hey ryan ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst can you talk a bit about latest conversations with the rating agencies following withdrawal of the pre approval application and the pcam order out of the commission i know it sounds like we re going to get some more information at eei here but anything preliminary you can say just in terms of potential equity needs end of 22 and the initial thoughts around timing and cadence whether it d be a block or another atm crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer ryan crystal here thanks for the question first i ll take the first part of your questions we did speak with each of the rating agencies as we made the decision to move forward with the laurel project and the importance of that given as brian alluded to having fixed price contracts on the table being able to progress quickly and be able to execute on that from a customer perspective i think the ratings agencies understand the perspective of that side of it moving forward from a business side of it we also understand the other piece of that is you re looking for us to get recovery on rates and that ll be chief of mind for us as to how we progress with the montana commission and work together to accomplish that with your question with regard to 22 happy to talk about that at eei and looking forward to it robert c rowe chief executive officer one footnote on the ratings agencies just a couple of weeks ago moody s did an excellent presentation to the montana commission laying the foundation for what the ratings agencies do how they look specifically utilities and then how they evaluate northwestern energy that was really well received by the commission lot of good discussion it s the presentation at least the video is available online south dakota commission is very interested in having a similar presentation of course our view is the more our regulators understand the better for all ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thank you and then can you help quantify the magnitude of inflationary pressures you guys saw with aberdeen before opting not to move forward with the project was the balance sheet a limiting factor at all or was were the concerns really just oriented around elevated rates with the higher costs brian b bird president and chief operating officer no i think we were seeing prices upwards of 50 higher than we originally seen and that s why based upon that news that we thought it made sense to sit down and chat and collectively made a good decision we believe the balance sheet certainly obviously we want to invest much capital as we need but that was not the factor as to why we decided not to move forward ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thank you and then maybe just lastly i know you alluded earlier in terms of the fixed costs for laurel here but is there anything that s open in terms of that contract in terms of the 275 million that could be subject to price movement brian b bird president and chief operating officer not that i can think of ryan ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst great i ll leave it there thank you guys thanks ryan crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer thank you travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer we ll take our next call from jamieson or as his friends call him james ward from guggenheim james james ward guggenheim partners analyst you guys have tripled the mute i think here can you hear me now travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer now i can james ward guggenheim partners analyst perfect i had i dialed star 6 i hit the unmute button on the screen and then another one popped up in the bottom corner travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer it s like three factor authentication i guess james ward guggenheim partners analyst i love it it s extra cyber security is a big robert c rowe chief executive officer we had an extra layer of security for equity analysts brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah james ward guggenheim partners analyst i love it what i was saying there to travis comment i said well i count you among those front so feel free to call me as you wish so the question on aberdeen was already asked and answered 50 higher is very clear 2022 eps guidance i understand capex and presumably how you re going to finance that in some way shape or form will be part of the discussion at eei will 2022 eps guidance come at the same time or will that come later crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer absolutely we will be talking about both 22 eps guidance along with capital plans obviously with things shifting with both laurel accelerating and aberdeen moving we ll be updating capital eps and all financing plans james ward guggenheim partners analyst beautiful robert c rowe chief executive officer so you ve got to be there james ward guggenheim partners analyst well certainly will be the final question that i have is on laurel you mentioned in the release that toward the end of last week there was an unfortunately other lawsuit filed and mentioned the potential for that to delay construction how should we think about the timing on when you could start construction how this could impact well maybe i ll just start at there how good this is about timing and then start date end date financing etc robert c rowe chief executive officer i will say a couple of things and turn it over to our coo obviously we were disappointed by the litigation it seem to be untimely in terms of the administrative process followed we were encouraged to hear today from the governor that we will be side by side with the department in defending the lawsuit but obviously this is monday we received that just several days ago so our legal team is evaluating brian brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah what i would add is the biggest time factor at this point in time is getting the engines manufactured and from a site preparation standpoint and permitting there are certain things that we re working on we ll continue to work on that during this process but it s the and that will take time and so i think there ll be on a time that can transpire if you will the lawsuit that we can be working at some other things james ward guggenheim partners analyst got you well it sounds like you ve got some good allies there which is very nice to hear the last question would be just on those the construction of those engines where would that be taking place some rice units are european in origin others rather than just assuming and figure out i d just ask the question where would brian b bird president and chief operating officer we have had engines in the past for pggs so produced in germany and shipped and we ll be doing the same here for laurel james ward guggenheim partners analyst beautiful thank you very much guys look forward to seeing you at eei travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks james we ll take our next question from the line of jonathon reeder at wells fargo jonathan don t forget the triple unmute jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst all right can you hear me now robert c rowe chief executive officer yes travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yeah sure can jonathan jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst yeah it takes a while for that unmute button pop ups so apologies for that just kind of piggybacking on that last question just to be clear you ve given i guess the contractors for laurel the notice to proceed then right where we re definitely moving forward it s not that you intend to do it before sometime in the future when you have to execute on the fixed price brian b bird president and chief operating officer we are on the final stages on final notice to proceed i ll leave it at that jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst and then another front around the capex refresh but it sounds like despite this environmental lawsuit you are going to be rolling that laurel plant then into the forecast even though i guess that has the potential to derail it brian b bird president and chief operating officer absolutely jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay is it safe to assume these global supply chains and inflationary pressures are also impacting kind of the base capex budget thus if you want to accomplish the same amount of work as contemplated in the current budget it might cost more to do so brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah it s a good question matter of fact a question that was raised by the board yesterday when we got the capital budget approved i would say in two ways at the time of capital budgets put together in july and we considered increasing cost from an inflationary standpoint but i d argue that since july even we re seeing a bit more change there so it s something that we certainly want to keep our eyes on i think what might be an offsetting factor to some increased cost is concerns about supply chain concerns about other things that could slow construction too so we kind of felt that we probably will end up about where we planned initially jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst you re saying where you planned initially from a dollar perspective but not necessarily brian b bird president and chief operating officer from a dollar perspective from a dollar perspective jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay okay and then i guess in terms of though like getting certain amount of work actually done going forward you ll have to look at what it s going to cost to get that done balanced out against your i guess expected rate impacts and figure out what the sweet spot is there brian b bird president and chief operating officer correct jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay and then robert c rowe chief executive officer the other comment on supply chain is the board management is paying a lot of attention to supply chain issues both sides cost and availability as is the entire industry and we re participating in the industry effort to manage through this certainly the challenges don t same transitory in the sense that they will evaporate in a period of weeks or months brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah and again just to be a bit more clear from my perspective obviously the supply chain issues and other issues that could cause work to slow things could i don t think it s an essence of cutting projects as much as pushing projects out into the future jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst got you well that makes sense and then actually i m trying to think i had a follow up on that and i lost my train of thought just two kind of housekeeping items the 2 7 million pre tax reversal of the previously written offline collectible accounts was that anticipated in the 21 guidance or was that kind of an upside surprise crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer i would say that was within line with our expectations jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay all right well thanks i ll leave it there appreciate the time travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks jonathan and with that we i think our monday morning call has no we did just have one come into the queue here it is the last four digits 3425 eric peterson millennium management analyst hey guys can you hear me travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yes we can who do we have eric peterson millennium management analyst hey this is eric peterson from millennium travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer hey eric eric peterson millennium management analyst i appreciate you taking my question hey just real quick on the project up in aberdeen can you give us any flavor on whether the capacity need will still be there in the next iteration of the irp next year brian b bird president and chief operating officer absolutely eric peterson millennium management analyst and then part two oh go ahead brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah i think i m sorry i didn t interrupt if you had a further question i ll pause and let s keep going eric peterson millennium management analyst okay yeah just separately was that charge off adjusted out in your non gaap earnings this quarter brian b bird president and chief operating officer no i ll let the cfo answer that question i ll take the first question i think the capacity need still exists in south dakota i think we just want we will continue to manage that and these other means to close that gap in the short term but continue to evaluate what we want to do longer term there and again understanding what pricing has done in the future come back at some point in time in the next irp and make a decision there crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer and eric this is crystal the second part of your question is was the charge off that s related to those initial cost at aberdeen non gaap ed out it was not it is in our earnings eric peterson millennium management analyst got it okay thank you guys very much travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks eric it looks like we have one more question in the queue that we re trying to get through here we ll see if this works it s from the line of matt davis i believe matt we just allowed you to speak if you matthew davis coann capital analyst hi guys can you hear me travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yeah we can matthew davis coann capital analyst so i just had a question on the aberdeen project i mean i understand that pricing has gone up roughly 50 but what based on what you re seeing in the energy market as well as in the capacity market in your region with the extreme cost as well as i believe the project was expected to come online sometime in 2024 so a little bit later in the the planning horizon why go ahead and make that decision now and how do you and is this the 50 increase in the project cost enough to kind of outweigh what you re seeing in the energy and capacity markets brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah i think the main thing was when you sit down with the commission and tell you want to give them a heads up that if we move forward this project at this point in time this is what we expect to see and we talked about alternatives and then we collectively agreed it probably makes sense to wait and we had asked if there is certain other things we can do in the short term we did say we had alternatives and we would collectively look at that in the next irp if you might remember we initially aberdeen was something it didn t necessarily contemplate in the first irp but we thought from an expeditious standpoint we could forge ahead with that and we were certainly planning to head that direction but again the dialog we have with the commission it just was a collective decision to not move forward matthew davis coann capital analyst and then just one other one in terms of thinking about the moving pieces around the capital program i get that your base plan probably has some inflationary measures but is it just as simply as thinking about at putting in laurel and subtracting out aberdeen or are there other pieces to the puzzle robert c rowe chief executive officer we ll be discussing the updated capital plan in great detail at eei honestly excited about the good and important work ahead of us so it s not a simple matter of trading out one for one matthew davis coann capital analyst okay thank you brian b bird president and chief operating officer thanks matt travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks matt it looks like we have one more question in the queue from andy levi andy we re opening your line andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst unmute okay does that work travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer that works andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst oh look at that see i am the old guy and i can figure it out quicker than the other guys robert c rowe chief executive officer you re technologically adept andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst yeah i can push a button how are you guys are doing all right everything good robert c rowe chief executive officer very good andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst everything good yes ok good okay so just two questions first just on natural gas in general if i remember it correctly right you guys made several acquisitions on the natural gas side as far as resources is that correct robert c rowe chief executive officer correct andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst and are those still flowing gas are those still flowing gas robert c rowe chief executive officer yes andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay and so could you just i have a couple of questions around that but could you kind of just explain how significant that is as far as helping you this winter on supply and i mean that price wise robert c rowe chief executive officer i ll say a couple of things and turn it over to again brian our coo in montana in particular think about the integrated system that does have some owned supply that has a lot of storage and transmission and storage at both ends of the system so that gives us flexibility in terms of bringing gas in several points on the system storing purchasing and storing gas in the off season when prices are relatively more attractive than moving the gas around the system so that puts us in i think a much better position than if we were simply a local delivery system so that s a real positive brian brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah i would say two things first of all we thought that buying gas reserves made sense some rules were changed at the commission that made difficult for us to do more of that we would like to have done more particularly for events like this with higher prices but i would say about 10 to 15 of that purchase gas is available to us at this point in time and the nice thing bob mentioned stores that we have in our system we re able to use that storage and fill it up and save it for peak periods in the winter season and that provides about 50 of the gas that we use so we certainly that s a nice advantage of our system andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst when you say 10 to 15 that s your total supply not what you re using from the reserves that you have is that correct brian b bird president and chief operating officer total supply total supply andy andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst right okay and how i know it s been a while since we discussed this what do you have as far as reserves like what s the total amount that you have or that you actually produce on an annual basis brian b bird president and chief operating officer andy years ago we used to have those slides in our deck and we re talking about andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst i know okay okay so ok so that s fine you don t have it right now that s fine we can discuss at eei and then i ve like a bigger picture question about that i understand it s a rate base type of product project product okay at the same time you need equity and obviously equity affects our rates and affects the customer as well are there any thoughts again that s kind of paying its dividends this year but also the price of gas has gone up so dramatically and the price for assets has gone up so dramatically that have you ever thought of monetizing those assets in lieu of doing equity robert c rowe chief executive officer that would be a no andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay fair enough stuff that pops in my head robert c rowe chief executive officer no it s good we always appreciate your ideas andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay well some people do i don t know about my family for that it depends on the family member and then the last question robert c rowe chief executive officer no one is a hero at home andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst that s true and then the last question i have is just again around the amount of equity that you need not the actual dollar amount but just again you re thinking on because i truly believe that the atm has affected your stock price on a relative basis and so any thoughts kind of around that versus just someone like myself or other people just kind of buying the shares from you all at once and then taking that pressure off the stock since it doesn t trade that much volume same question i ask to you every quarter robert c rowe chief executive officer crystal crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer andy we appreciate your resounding interest in our stock we think it s a good holding through we hear you on that the comments on technical execution would be the only thing i have to say about that we hear you brian b bird president and chief operating officer i ll help you out andy on your previous question you asked the amount of bcf and if my math serves me kind of in that 10 to 15 i d argue it s about 3 bcf andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay that s great guys i see brian b bird president and chief operating officer andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay i see you guys soon in florida look forward to seeing you in person can you hear me crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer yes robert c rowe chief executive officer yes thank you andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay see you guys thank you bye travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer looks like we have another call coming in from the line of paul patterson paul we re opening up your line now paul patterson analyst yeah can you hear me travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yeah paul patterson analyst okay robert c rowe chief executive officer yeah we lost you now paul patterson analyst can you hear me robert c rowe chief executive officer barely paul patterson analyst i ll send you a text travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yes we can hear you now crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer we can hear you paul patterson analyst okay my question is basically with the aberdeen increase of 50 it sounds a little like hyperinflation was there any specific driver or drivers or can you just give a little more color on i apologize i missed it brian b bird president and chief operating officer no i didn t give any specific drivers thinking about the total cost it wasn t just one particular component but from a total cost perspective it was upwards of 50 increase all in paul patterson analyst okay okay so it s just everything just pretty much came together is that it this seems so big brian b bird president and chief operating officer yep it does paul patterson analyst okay thanks so much i really appreciate it robert c rowe chief executive officer thank you brian b bird president and chief operating officer thanks paul travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer all right with that i think we have now exhausted our queue i ll hand it back to bob for close robert c rowe chief executive officer okay thank you all for your interest and a very good discussion and the theme here is we re all going

the california apartment association caa is urging santa ana california residents to revoke a recently approved rent control ordinance before it goes into effect on nov 19 on oct 19 the city became the first in orange county to approve a rent control ordinance at a city council meeting with a 4 3 vote the law would prevent landlords from raising rent by more than 3 percent annually the california apartment association and a coalition of business groups local housing providers and residents believe the city council rushed to impose these laws without any meaningful outreach to the community analysis or understanding of their impacts on the city s finances of housing stock caa senior vice president of local public affairs victor cao said in a statement before the ordinance goes into effect petitioners must gather 12 500 signatures from registered voters to potentially send the ordinance to a public referendum once the signatures are collected and valid the city council can choose to either revoke the rent control policies or put them on the ballot for residents to vote on the referendum will allow santa ana voters to have a community conversation and decide whether they want a multi million dollar bureaucracy to regulate the housing market forced on the city by four council members cao said santa ana s rent control is seen to be stricter than those throughout the state as rent increases are capped at 80 percent of the local inflation rate according to caa the ordinance will also require the district attorney to assist with evictions due to criminal activity mayor vincente sarmiento applauded the ordinance for its promise to halt unnecessary rent hikes the adoption of the rent stabilization and just cause eviction ordinances will finally address the long standing plea from so many of our rent burdened working families in santa ana sarmiento said in a statement these new ordinances will stabilize our neighborhoods and prevent the trauma of being displaced by excessive rent hikes and unjustified evictions landlords and property owners will continue to have the ability to responsibly manage and generate a reasonable return on their investment a spokesperson from the city of santa ana didn t respond to a request for comment by press time

provision for credit losses of 3 1 million reflected net charge offs of 2 3 million in provisions for the loan growth during the third quarter we expect the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter as a result of the expected loan growth in the fourth quarter turning to slide 12 total average deposits increased by 517 2 million or 12 6 annualized during the third quarter of 2021 we were especially pleased by the 233 million increase or 25 6 annualized in average demand deposits during the third quarter compared to the second quarter average time deposit decreased by 152 6 million or 10 1 annualized due mainly to the run off of broker cds we repurchased 942 613 shares of our stock at an average cost of 39 40 totaling 37 1 million in the third quarter of 2021 there is 98 6 million remaining under our september 2021 125 million stock buyback program we continue to work on the integration and conversion plan for our purchase of the 10 branches in select west coast loans and deposits from hsbc this transaction will broaden the reach of our northern and southern california branch network in addition to acquiring 1 billion in low cost deposits and 800 million in residential mortgages the transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2022 i will now turn the floor over to our executive vice president and chief financial officer heng chen to discuss the third quarter 2021 financial results in more detail heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you chang and good afternoon everyone for the third quarter of 2021 net income decreased by 4 8 million or 6 2 to 72 4 million compared to second quarter of 2021 the decrease was primarily attributable to a provision for credit losses of 3 million in the third quarter as compared to 9 million reversal of provision for credit losses in the second quarter our net interest margin was 3 22 in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 3 24 in the second quarter of 2021 in the third quarter of 2021 interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 4 basis points to the net interest margin as compared to 3 basis points for the second quarter of 2021 there were 3 1 billion of loans at the floor rate as of september 30 2021 approximately 1 4 billion of our cds mature during the fourth quarter 2021 with a average rate of 0 68 we are targeting renewing retail cds in the 40 to 50 basis point range given the results of the third quarter of 2021 we continue to expect our net interest margin for 2021 to be between 3 2 to 3 3 non interest income during the third quarter of 2021 decreased by 360 000 to 12 2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to a one time boli income of 1 2 million in the second quarter non interest expense increased by 2 5 million or 3 6 to 72 2 million in the third quarter of 2021 when compared to 69 7 million in the second quarter of 2021 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 1 7 million in amortization in low income housing and solar tax credit funds including a 3 2 million catch up adjustment for 2020 low income housing losses resulting from the receipt of 2020 tier 1s and an increase of 0 7 million in salary and employee benefits mainly from higher bonus accruals the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 19 1 as compared to 22 7 for the second quarter of 2021 the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from a 1 7 million catch up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2021 for 2020 solar tax credits for higher 2020 solar tax credits resulting from the receipt of 2020 tail wins we expect the full year 2021 effective tax rate to be between 21 5 and 22 solar tax credit amortization was 1 4 million in third quarter of 2021 and is expected to be 1 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 as of september 30 2021 our tier 1 leverage capital ratio decreased to 10 67 as compared to 10 35 as of june 30 2021 our tier 1 risk based capital ratio decreased to 13 29 from 13 77 as of september 30 2021 and our total risk based capital ratio decreased to 14 93 from 15 47 as of june 30 2021 georgia lo assistant secretary and investor relations thank you heng we will now proceed to the question and answer portion of the call questions and answers operator for our first question we have brandon king from truist securities brandon your line is open brandon king truist securities analyst hey good afternoon chang m liu president and chief executive officer hi brandon brandon king truist securities analyst hey so loan growth was pretty strong in the quarter kind of ahead of guidance of 3 to 5 how do you think that will shake out going into 2022 when do you think you re kind of on a sustainable trajectory when it comes on loan growth especially on the commercial side chang m liu president and chief executive officer so far we re looking at fourth quarter pipelines and fourth quarter pipelines are pretty strong so i think we re kind of staying on our sort of the target growth range in the 5 range for 2021 as far as 2022 i think it really comes down to a lot has to do with sort of the economic recovery some of the shipping and freight delay costs and what s going on at the ports i think our commercial growth c i growth on the third quarter was pretty strong at 73 million range we re in talking to some of our clients we believe that 2022 will hopefully show a strong growth as well but not completely certain where some of that growth will come from and in which segment whether that s c i side or the commercial real estate side heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah well brandon we ll give formal guidance in january when we report the fourth quarter earnings but i want to also add that we think in 2022 the residential mortgage loan portfolio will start to increase faster because with higher interest rates we think the prepayments on that portfolio will be much lower so it will have a higher growth rate in 2022 but once again we ll update in january brandon king truist securities analyst okay thanks for that and then on the liabilities side with deposit repricing could you tell us or give us an update on running off those broker deposits and what do you expect from the ceding pricing picture in 4q and potentially early 1q 22 heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we have probably 200 million of wholesale deposits that we will be running off in the fourth quarter of that 100 million will be fairly late it will be in late december so we won t see the full quarter effect and in q1 2022 we ll probably have another 150 million of brokerage cd run off but as we get into 2022 if our loan growth resumes to be stronger than it has been in 2021 we may even start to have to renew some brokered cds and then lastly as interest rates are increasing we are buying more securities given that the yields are more attractive so i know those are some of the background on how we re thinking there brandon king truist securities analyst okay and for those broker deposits if you do renew those what would be the delta in the cost based on what they are today and what you will renew heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i m telling you this from memory i think that probably about 50 basis points and then we have a brokered money market deposit that s only 1 basis point i talked about that in the past so that s going to mature in december brandon king truist securities analyst okay thanks for answering all my questions heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah thank you operator for our next question we have david chiaverini from wedbush securities david your line is open david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst thanks for taking the questions the first one is on deposit growth how are you guys thinking about deposit flows here it s been pretty decent chang m liu president and chief executive officer for us we re seeing accumulation of deposit balances from our customers we re also kind of making a shift away from cds and focusing more on business operating accounts as much as we can some of that cd balances may have transitioned over to money market balances as we ve seen that in our quarter over quarter results but for the most part we re driving toward lower cost of deposits and lower cost of funds david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst great thanks for that and you mentioned about roughly 100 million remaining on your buyback authorization i was curious about your appetite for additional purchases from here heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i think we ll still be in the market compared to our peers our price to tangible book is somewhat lower and our capital levels are pretty strong so we ll we won t be in the market but at some point we may taper back on that depending on the stock price david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst yes that makes sense thanks very much chang m liu president and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator for our next question we have chris mcgratty from kbw chris your line is open chris mcgratty kbw analyst hey good afternoon heng i was wondering if you could repeat the numbers for the branches i think you said 1 billion of deposits 850 million of loans i m wondering associated expenses from that transaction and also just kind of help with the expense guide on your transaction heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer chris i think this we said it the hsbc deals got 2 accretive in terms of expenses it s roughly slightly over 10 million and the revenues are the low 20 million but we re waiting to get all of this information is as of march 2021 and we re waiting for hsbc to give us updated balances and then when we announced in january we ll probably we ll update that chris mcgratty kbw analyst okay so those are annual numbers the 10 million and 20 million ok heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah and then for your modelling there is going to be one time expenses maybe in 3 8 million i don t know how finally you do there as probably 2 million to 3 million and then we have the day one cecl charge for those acquired loans you might want to use 50 basis points on quite loan balance it is ultimately we still think it s going to be 2 accretive chris mcgratty kbw analyst okay that s great and then maybe if i could my follow up the little bit of tax on the solar and low income i think you said 1 5 million for the solar what was the low income that we should be modeling for next quarter heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer probably 7 million yeah in q3 we had this catch up adjustment as i mentioned of 3 2 million but in q4 it s going to be 7 million chris mcgratty kbw analyst great thank you heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah thank you operator for our next question we have gerry tenner from d a davidson jerry your line is open gerry tenner d a davidson analyst hi good afternoon just wanted to actually clarify on the catch up adjustment you said it was 3 2 million or i thought i heard 2 2 million and then what was the associated tax impact on that catch up adjustment heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer can you repeat the question jerry are you talking about the low income housing gerry tenner d a davidson analyst yeah the catch up adjustment on the amortization i had written down 2 2 million was it 3 2 million or 2 2 million heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer it was 3 2 million on the low income housing gerry tenner d a davidson analyst okay and then the associated tax impact because of the catch up heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer there was none gerry tenner d a davidson analyst there was none okay heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer and we have a 1 6 million tax benefit from the solar catch up gerry tenner d a davidson analyst okay okay great and then just follow up in terms of the core loan yields by my math down about 12 basis points to 4 or 4 01 simply just the kind of pull down effect of new production yields being below portfolio yields i think you d highlighted the prepayment benefit which is really unchanged versus last quarter heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we you want to cover that chang m liu president and chief executive officer you re asking about the origination yields versus the portfolio yields heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah chang m liu president and chief executive officer gerry gerry tenner d a davidson analyst yeah effectively yes chang m liu president and chief executive officer yeah so for the residential mortgage originations third quarter we re probably around 3 82 compared to the weighted average portfolio of about 4 03 on the commercial real estate q3 origination we re at about 3 57 compared to the weighted average portfolio at about 4 23 and on the new c i loans our current originations are close to 5 versus the weighted q3 portfolio you had about 3 61 gerry tenner d a davidson analyst great thank you chang m liu president and chief executive officer of course operator at this time there are no questions in the queue thank you for your participation i will now turn back the call over to cathay general bancorp s management for closing remarks chang m liu president and chief executive officer i want to thank everyone for joining us on our call today we look forward to speaking with you at our next quarterly earnings release call operator duration

tesla s mega deal with hertz has widened the gap between the us car maker and the rest of the industry the order for 100 000 cars is the single biggest order of electric cars to date and could be worth as much as us4 4 billion 5 9b to tesla according to reports the brand whose value recently topped us1 trillion is now more valuable than the next nine biggest carmakers the valuation is remarkable given the fact that tesla makes a fraction of the cars made by its two closest rivals toyota valued at 280b and volkswagen 160b each make an estimated 10 million vehicles each year tesla is on track to build about a tenth of this number after having delivered roughly 250 000 vehicles in the past quarter the tesla model 3 was the best selling car in europe in september a sizeable chunk of tesla s profit comes from the sale of regulatory credits which totalled about 280m in the previous quarter and more than 500m in the first quarter of this year a regulatory credit is handed out to carmakers to help promote the development low or zero emissions vehicles car makers are given the credits by governments for producing a certain amount of zero emissions vehicles each year car makers are required to have a certain amount of regulatory credits each year and if they can t reach their required number they can buy them off other car makers or suffer significant penalties enter tesla which only sells zero emissions vehicles so has an excess of credits which it then sells to other companies boosting its profit at no extra cost to itself it has been reported that stellantis which owns fiat chrysler and jeep brands among others bought more than 2b worth of credits from tesla between 2019 and 2021 tesla s perceived dependence on the sales of these credits to remain profitable has been one of the reasons the company has been heavily shorted as more and more car makers go electric the sales of these credits will dry up car rental company hertz has ordered 100 000 teslas but the company may be in a position shortly where it no longer needs the sales of credits as its production capacity and popularity continue to ramp up it is in the process of building two new massive factories to make cars and batteries in texas and germany the latest european car sales figures prove tesla s growing dominance in september for the first time the tesla model 3 was the best selling car in europe beating the volkswagen golf according to uk publication autocar tesla is now valued at more than one trillion dollars second hand car shoppers are set to benefit too as the price of used teslas should drop when the rental companies renew their fleets in a few years and sell the current stock tesla keeps its sales in australia secret but data revealed by the electric vehicle council in august this year showed the brand s growing popularity down under the report showed aussies bought 7248 electric cars in the first six months of 2021 car sales figures by the federal chamber of automotive industries showed every other car maker sold 2188 electric cars in the same period meaning 5031 teslas found a new home this shows tesla outsells all rivals combined by more than two to one if these figures continue tesla is on track for 10 000 sales this year in australia this would put it above established luxury brands such as lexus and volvo originally published as tesla is worth more than the next nine most valuable car makers

margin expansion on the bottom line likewise if we compare our performance this quarter to the same pre pandemic period from 2019 number one today s results show a dramatic 45 increase in net revenue to a record 264 million number two our adjusted ebitda is 50 higher at 36 million and number 3 our q3 ebitda margin has expanded by 55 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019 to almost 14 each of our three segments executive search heidrick consulting and on demand talent contributed to another record breaking quarter and the agility of the heidrick team plus the value of our differentiated products and services coupled with positive macro trends led to our impressive results our outlook for q4 is robust and we expect to finish the year strong today i ll start with a few thoughts on our strategic priorities then discuss the important drivers in the quarter and close noting a promising initiative we have underway that we believe is building the heidrick brand and laying the foundation for long term shareholder value creation on the firm s continuing strategic focus we feel very good about the business we ve been building and expanding at heidrick and we re positive about the future as we look ahead we remain intent on increasing the scale and impact of our executive search consulting and new on demand talent business to deliver a unique set of premium services and offerings to our clients as we drive forward our integrated go to market approach our teams across all three of our businesses are collaborating to deepen our client relationships and deliver the best of heidrick in terms of recruitment talent market insights advisory solutions targeting important human capital opportunities and on demand talent all to help our clients navigate the many complexities they face in ensuring their leaders teams and organizations are future ready and we will soon include broader tech enabled digital offering in our expanding and powerful portfolio here s a snapshot of the drivers of our business growth in q3 the results we released today show the impact of our strategic focus and the resiliency and professionalism of the heidrick team all in the midst of an environment where demand for our services and offerings is rebounding our net revenue over the last nine months alone of 717 million exceeded the firm s prior annual full year record net revenue figures set in 2018 which bodes well for the rest of the year and for continued momentum in 2022 in search our net revenue grew by 33 in the third quarter compared to pre pandemic third quarter 2019 all regions and all industry sector practices showed increases the executive search business is robust for us at heidrick with the number of confirmations increasing 33 this quarter versus the same quarter in 2019 for a couple of quarters now in 2021 our productivity per consultant has reached a remarkable and historic pinnacle of 2 4 million per consultant this compares very favorably with our previous peak search productivity per consultant of 1 9 million in 2018 and 1 7 million in 2019 balancing our past trends with our current pace we see our productivity potentially reverting back to still impressive levels of around 2 million per consultant on average over the long run as we will continue to promote from within and higher strategically in the meantime i m very proud of the amazing agility and capacity of the heidrick team the high volume of business in search is the result of a number of key factors where change is creating strong demand from our clients and a more diversified revenue stream we continue to see lots of change at the top of organizations no matter if new leadership is needed due to dramatically different business conditions or business model transformation multiple factors are driving the search for leadership not only for ceos but also across the c suite heidrick is seeking and winning the assignments to fill these roles many searches are underway due to the huge demand for diverse talent as i mentioned on our last call our u s diverse placements were tracking at over 50 of our total search work and we re seeing that trajectory continue at the board level globally that figure is over 60 our sustainability and esg work continues to grow worldwide as boards and companies face ongoing pressure from stakeholders to focus on issues like climate change sustainability and other forward looking concerns our search consultants are engaged in filling important positions with highly sought after experienced professionals including cio and data analytic roles chief financial officers and supply chain executives for example we have 3 to 4 times the number of supply chain executive search assignments this year versus last year and we are increasingly being asked to place more than one director at a time on corporate boards in fact approximately one quarter of all our board engagements include placing more than one board member for heidrick consulting net revenue for the quarter increased by 14 versus the pre pandemic third quarter of 2019 initial projects are developing into longer term initiatives as our consulting clients define assess and develop future ready leaders organizations and cultures we have a unique ability to serve clients in all facets of their human capital journey and key assignments reflect growing corporate needs in four primary areas first with the recognition that top talent is an imperative for success we have strong demand from clients for heidrick s guidance on matters of leadership assessment and development and follow on support and organization design this is especially resonating in the americas europe and the middle east for senior and high potential leaders second culture culture assessments and culture shaping are more important than ever as companies manage through hybrid and return to work environment and begin to reenergize and realign their teams third is around de i clients are seeking help defining and aligning on diversity strategies and embedding new ways of working that are equitable and inclusive and forth with broad investor expectations increasing not only for operational success but also on the esg front our consulting teams are advising boards of directors on overall strategy and effectiveness turning to our third business segment you ll remember that on april 1st of this year we acquired business talent group or btg forming the basis of our move into the compelling adjacency of on demand talent with the leading pioneer in this space with this move heidrick mccain not only the first but also the only global leadership advisory firm to offer on demand talent solutions at scale alongside our search and consulting services we are excited about the 24 million contribution to revenue from on demand in q3 which exceeded our expectations in addition to the appeal of our unique high end offering external tailwinds such as macroeconomic growth pent up demand and talent shortages contributed to our success in the quarter we saw particular strength from on demand clients in financial services consumer goods and healthcare and life sciences while it is still early days we view this segment as a key driver to our long term value creation the total addressable market for on demand referrals is large and growing as clients see the need for fast flexible talent get more comfortable with filling their interim human capital and short term project needs with remote or independent professionals critically once our clients recognize the power of on demand offering they keep coming back to us to expand their use of on demand to fill more roles we believe we will continue to see strong growth in this sector the outstanding effort and acumen exhibited by our heidrick colleagues plus their disciplined attention to implementing our go to market strategy drove our excellent results again this quarter in addition the dynamic world of work and other external factors such as new and emerging trends around leadership and culture plus the massive disruption from covid have created an imperative for our clients to reimagine themselves and find new ways of working and in turn these demands are driving our growth and success as our clients continue to seek quality diverse and forward thinking talent we re there every step of the way with our integrated suite of offerings before i turn the call over to mark for more detail on the quarter i want to share some background on the start of a new relationship that will help us expand our technology adjacencies and the heidrick brand over the long term at heidrick as i ve said in the past we re intensively focused on pursuing technological innovation not only to leverage the way in which we work but also to differentiate and provide leading edge offerings to our clients we re at the start of a multi year digital journey with a long term vision that expands heidrick s suite of

afternoon everyone thank you for joining our call today let me echo krishnan s comments in that our go to market strategy productivity and focus on innovation together with the favorable external trends have translated into solid financial performance in the third quarter for heidrick we ve been able to continue our top line while expanding margins and we contributed increasingly more absolute dollars to ebitda net income and earnings per share so far in 2021 all setting new annual records let alone nine month ending ones further heidrick s performance continues to remain strong into the fourth quarter which i m excited to share with you today as has been a past practice i ll start this afternoon with a run through on our third quarter results with most of my comments around sequential trends given the dislocation from the covid period in the third quarter of 2020 i ll make further comments on a few balance sheet items that conclude with our fourth quarter outlook following that we ll be happy to take your questions you ll recall last quarter we celebrated the milestone of crossing over 200 million quarterly net revenue mark for the first time in heidrick s history and i m proud to say that not only did we do that again but we added to it our third quarter net revenue of 263 8 million which was 83 8 higher than last year s third quarter and 1 5 above the previous quarter in 2021 is a new record for the company even more interestingly is that for just the nine months ended september 30 2021 we had cumulative revenue of 717 5 million which is more than any annual achievement in the history of heidrick with three more months to go it s truly an exciting time in our growth cycle which we see continuing into the near future let me give you some insights on the performance by turning to our three business segments executive search net revenue was 221 6 million in the third quarter of 2021 just slightly lower by 2 5 million or 1 1 when compared to the second quarter of this year looking at our search results geographically the americas region was up by about 1 with modest downside contraction to about 5 in europe and asia when compared to the previous quarter none of those contractions run expected due to the summer holidays and restrictions around the covid delta variant and other factors but the results in those regions were still very strong when compared to previous years to give you some perspective when we look at the americas europe and asia executive search performance in the third quarter and compare that to the average of the third quarters in 2018 and 2019 which were record periods for us we saw increases in revenue of 38 2 percent 18 1 and 18 4 in each region respectively please remember those were not covid periods but prior historical highs and we are growing that much more thus you can see why we believe the third quarter is an exceptional one for heidrick we ve had astonishing performance in 2021 further along the top line growth we have achieved new records and adjusted operating margins in executive search which held near 21 in the third quarter we have seen these margins continue to stay at those high levels in both the first and second quarters of this year this is the result of continuing strong productivity numbers at 2 4 million per consultant this quarter while this achievement is extraordinary than appears to be industry leading it s important to remember that this isn t likely to be sustainable given the promotions new hires and work life balance we expect to achieve in 2022 therefore we would expect this to modulate around 2 million per consultant in the near future which is still better than our previous historical levels and shows what the new normal is shaping up to be for heidrick consulting third quarter net revenue rose to 17 9 million up 4 5 sequentially consulting continues to benefit from collaboration within the company with nearly 50 of assignments in the first nine months of the year coming from leads through the executive search team in addition to new leads and engagements that are sold directly by the consulting team the number of consultants was roughly flat at 66 and consulting confirmation value was up meaningfully year over year by almost 60 but this declined 12 sequentially this was due to lower confirmation values in europe and asia as a result of seasonality such as august vacations in europe so like in executive search it s important to note that the second quarter was a record confirmation value quarter for heidrick consulting so being off on those highs is expected but we re seeing continued strength at the end of the third quarter in terms of revenue backlog projects our newest on demand segment was exceeding expectations yet again with revenue of 24 3 million in the third quarter this is more than double last year when btg was a stand alone company and almost 30 higher than what was reported in the previous quarter we saw a high number of value engagements with higher average initial project value and more engagement extensions extending beyond their initial agreement timing now let me turn to our expenses with record setting third quarter net revenue and higher volume of work naturally this comes with higher compensation and other variable costs for example we saw consolidated salaries and benefit expense of 185 9 million in the quarter essentially flat with the previous quarter lower fixed compensation expenses largely offset by variable compensation increases due to the growth of our business when we look at general and administrative expenses we saw 29 2 million in the third quarter an increase of 6 6 from the previous quarter s results this increase of 1 8 million stem from some return to travel build out cost for our new strategic digital capability and other expansion cost to sustain our growth aspirations finally we saw our cost of service expense increase to 18 7 million in the third quarter compared to 14 7 million in the previous quarter which was primarily due to the revenue growth in our on demand talent business segment you will see the company recorded a restructuring credit of 3 3 million in the third quarter which related to the early termination of our new york lease this is beneficial for us given our old lease had a tale of another two plus years and now we re completely released from that financial obligation without the real estate credit adjusted operating income was 30 1 million in the third quarter leading to adjusted operating margin of 11 4 lower than 12 3 margin we had in the previous quarter this was the result of very strong revenue achievement in our on demand talent business where this segment has near breakeven margins given the stage of growth cycle that we re in and higher overall g a from the growth of our business that being said we like what we see in our long term trends expanding margins where we look at our trailing 12 month consolidated adjusted operating margin which is at an all time high now except for last year s disruption due to covid since 2014 our margins have been building steadily over the last 30 quarters an achievement we are very proud of at heidrick this has all translated to adjusted ebitda of 36 1 million in the quarter or 102 6 million for the nine month period ended which has already surpassed any previous annual adjusted ebitda performance in fact in 2018 our previous record for heidrick we saw annual adjusted ebitda of 90 7 million so we are 13 1 ahead with still one more quarter to add to it the adjusted ebitda margin was 14 3 year to date compared to the previous high of 12 7 in 2018 demonstrating the value we deliver to our shareholders this year we finished the quarter with an effective tax rate of 27 helping us deliver net income of 24 5 million up 18 from the previous quarter and diluted earnings per share was 1 21 from 1 03 last quarter again when looking at our nine months diluted earnings per share of 2 97 you will see that this is already an annual record with another quarter to go before turning to our balance sheet i wanted to take a moment just to sum up our financial performance through september 2021 and that we re seeing unprecedented record levels of aggregate dollars and our bottom line achievement with margin expansion around the same i believe these achievements and continued success will translate to more shareholder value as we continue to drive the business of heidrick and that becomes understood by the market given our historical ebitda and eps achievements which our legacy business are valued on in the market coupled with our revenue growth in the on demand talent business where there industry is valued on a revenue multiple due to the growth cycle we believe this will lead us to increase shareholder value in the future on a sum of the parts basis 2021 has truly become a pivotal year for heidrick and we believe that can continue into 2022 now let me turn to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 348 3 million which is 110 7 million more than the same quarter last year as we discussed before the company s cash position typically build throughout the year as employee bonuses are accrued and are traditionally paid down in the first quarter of the following year our balance sheet coupled with the renewed and expanded heidrick s credit facility of 200 million moves our liquidity to over 0 5 billion clearly our strong balance sheet puts us in a position of considerable strength to pursue the continued growth objectives that krishnan discussed earlier on our call finally let me turn to our fourth quarter guidance given the strong performance we are seeing in our markets and looking at our models despite some anticipated and typical holiday slowdown in our business we believe our first quarter net revenue will be in the range of 255 to 265 million closing out 2021 very strong of course this can change materially depending on whether we see covid spikes how governments and companies respond as well as impacts on macro and acute business events such as supply chain storages inflation and other unforeseen matters time will tell but suffice it to say that we expect to set another quarterly record for the fourth quarter results in conclusion as krishnan noted at the outset we re very pleased with our performance showing tremendous growth year over year and sustaining or building momentum sequentially our strategic initiatives implemented to drive growth in our legacy search and consulting businesses plus expansion from our recent on demand talent acquisition and early days of our eightfold ai partnership are creating springboards for heidrick s continued success with that krishnan and i would be happy to take your questions operator over to you questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of josh vogel from sidoti company your line is now open josh vogel sidoti company analyst thank you good afternoon krishnan and mark certainly impressive results i have a couple of questions to start kind of around consultant headcount i m curious expectations for new consultant hires and promotions from within i guess over the balance of this year and maybe even in early read on next year and just kind of building off that i m curious which industries or geographies do you find yourself perhaps sitting with a headcount level that s a little bit lighter than where you want to be today given the end market demand you re seeing krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer hey josh thanks for that question look i think we re going to have a strong promotion cycle we ve got great talent and we re expecting to promote from within as usual we re in the midst of going through all of that so i don t have all the details on that but great class and strong strong performances here by everybody so i think it will be a good promotion cycle for us i think if we take a step back there obviously our needs in europe and asia is what i would say where we might be a bit lighter than where we d like to be so we hope to address some of those needs through that but look the americas is just strong and strong performance everywhere and we ll reward those individuals as well through the cycle josh vogel sidoti company analyst i appreciate those insights and i guess just thinking about the competitive landscape can you talk about any challenges or successes you re seeing in bringing talents aboard basically are there any notable structural shifts you re seeing in the marketplace whether it s comp structures for the consultants or anything with regard to the physical locations given the enablement to be remote just curious general thoughts on that krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes mark feel free to add to this with what you see as well look i don t think i see in the competitive landscape too many what i would say structural things we have a lot of conversations going and i think the conversations that we ve got going are around the platform that we re building the culture that we ve got in place here how we collaborate and how we re tightly focused on still working at the executive levels at the top end and driving that success and that resonates with a lot of people in some different platforms as well so that s what i think is creating those conversations i haven t seen anything yet structurally out there that is different that are new things others are doing that drives that more than these things that i m saying so it s about our success and our culture that i see out there josh vogel sidoti company analyst great thank you and you talked about maybe some compression in consultant productivity understandable whether it s coming from promotions or new hires but given the tech enablement of the business model and you re growing digital capabilities in general do you think there is long term upside to that 1 million number on a long term basis kind of at the levels you re at today do you think that could be a new base longer term once you re leveraging all the tech enablement in digital capabilities mark harris chief financial officer hey josh it s mark let me try to answer that for you and i think in the prepared remarks which you re going to what i discussed was being at 2 4 million today really kind of transitioning itself back to around the 2 million which is obviously ahead from last year pre covid 2019 of 1 7 million so the answer is it s in there but as you and i both know the law of average is always going to play out right so the market needs to be there the hires that we use which impact our denominator will have an impact on that number as well as just general global expansion where we think we need to add talent and where that is it will probably be outside of america or the u s at least in particular which will mean typically lower retainers and that potentially could get productivity in a good way even though the numbers may look like they re averaging down i think the revenue expansion will be well worth it so i think when you look at all those factors in play that s really why it drives itself down we don t internalize that as we re not getting those efficiencies we are but sometimes when we mix it altogether it can be hard to see and we ll try to give you clarity as we go through the process josh vogel sidoti company analyst i appreciate those insights i just wanted to switch gears maybe this is for you as well mark looking around the on demand talent business obviously really strong result we re seeing pent up demand talent shortages there when we is that a good quarterly base for us to assume that the business can grow off of another another way i guess to ask it is what s baked into your is that q3 rate baked into your q4 guidance and i guess it s also a good time to remind me of what the norm if the seasonality is in the on demand talent business thank you mark harris chief financial officer no absolutely look the average of the two quarters that we ve been public is around that 20 million 21 million revenue number we have built into our q4 guidance obviously them continuing their trend but really it s not going to continue into q4 there definitely is some seasonality holiday season approaching is obviously in terms of how they bill and their revenue recognition etc is going to be marginally impacted by that i think the real question is we look at 2022 we still have an expectation that is a growth business and so that s the aspirations we have is to continue the general growth model but again and i think you hit it right on which is it s really a function of as the market continues in our opinion to move toward to gig economy and again project interim based work etc and doing more of that which is both the clients as well as the talent wish to continue to explore those types of possibilities it will be really interesting to see where this growth cycle goes so a lot of optimism on our side regarding on how that s going to grow and it s being executed by an outstanding team over on that side so i think the team over on the on demand space is just really doing a good job of hitting the market very very well and you re seeing that come through in the numbers josh vogel sidoti company analyst really helpful and i just would love to sneak in one more if i may it s nice to see the operating loss rapidly narrowing at heidrick consulting given the tech enablement and the digitization of the overall business have you kind of reset what you think the quarterly run rate you need to get to for that business to get back into the black mark harris chief financial officer it s a great question so i know we shouldn t have shown that for sure josh you re going to push me on that one and my opinion is still very strong that around that 80 million to 85 million annual mark is where you re going to see the breakeven and better and i don t believe anything is changing that landscape there might be some investment opportunities that will certainly give you those numbers as we kind of go through it in terms of our future and so you can kind of pro forma those some costs out but just generally speaking in terms of what they re doing today and where they want to grow their business that is still a very very safe bet so my comment is kind of around if you want a quarterly do that number it would be about 21 million 22 million a quarter we should start to really get an expectation of seeing some interesting breakeven analytics and then hopefully again as that continues up its trend which we made comments on as well we should be able to see margins to the business josh vogel sidoti company analyst that s great well thank you so much for taking my questions and great to see the business performing so well krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer thanks mark harris chief financial officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of tobey sommer from truist securities your line is now open tobey sommer truist securities analyst if you could elaborate on the digital journey and transformation and maybe help me understand what about the business model and income statement whether its margins or growth that may change if you re successfully able to do what you want to do over the next several years what are the outward signs we would see of that success krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes and tobey it s krishnan i didn t catch the first part of were you speaking about our new digital relationship or were you speaking more broadly than that tobey sommer truist securities analyst more broadly and then i m going to have a follow up about the specific recent relationships krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer okay great yes so if we continue on the tech enablement of all of our current businesses ok and it s a journey that we re committed to and we re driving hard and you re going to see that again as you ve already seen with our ability to take on this productivity that we ve been able to do from the past i think you ll see that with stickiness of client relationships our ability to build out accounts you ll be able to see that there and over time that s going to translate to margin as well so you re going to be able to see that i think on the existing technology journey that we re on with our new relationships and what we re trying to do here if i just summarize that i think we re in a world today where i kind of say talent if you want to call it human capital is the capital that s now most in demand if you go and i believe if you go in i believe if you go to any survey at the end of this year on from ceos and others you re going to see that pop its head so there s going to be this emerging and there already is expectation that data and insights on talents and executive talent should be as readily available as we have on other business dimensions so we think that with our ip insights the platform and solutions that we re going to build with a company like eightfold ai we can bridge that gap and lead the transformation of leadership as well so that s something that i think that we re headed down the path tobey sommer truist securities analyst krishnan let me just ask does it mean the business becomes more profitable because less is done less processes have human intervention what are the financial outcomes that your strategy will achieve krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes so yes i think that strategy will create new service offerings and new line of business so you re going to see we re answering some new problems that have been previously solved in bespoke fashion by a myriad of companies okay so i think it s a whole new revenue stream that we believe is going to be higher margin as well just given how one addresses those that solutions head as well so you ll see both tobey sommer truist securities analyst okay and then as productivity per consultant revenue per job eventually perhaps comes down to this 2 million figure will your other smaller businesses that are sub scale and therefore sub it s sort of an ongoing goal of profitability will those be able to drive sufficient margin such that margin won t have to come down as productivity is coming down or should we think of margin kind of tracking that productivity at some point mark harris chief financial officer well everything is and tobey it s mark everything is a function of scale right so i think the answer is on a set of service basis on what we re seeing in the prior quarter if our productivity were to come down and by definition yes we d see some margin creep into that having said that remember when the productivity comes down which means the revenue comes down and people not going through the tiers no way that we do kind of our payment so to speak those would obviously in sync also come down so it s not exactly a one to one ratio having said that and again as we look at other markets those are going to be very different profitabilities depending on we ve got the u s versus let s say parts of latin america etc which actually can drive even higher margins so to speak because the cost is very different in terms of the revenue cost distribution so it s always hard to answer that question because it s really a function of where it s coming from it s not necessarily i would tell you is unless focused on that and i m not focused on i m less focused on that what i like to see is how it trans all the way down to the bottom line where again our equity shareholders are seeing again nearly 3 eps year to date we typically were 2 50 all in for the year before that and that s really where i think you re going to see that accretive value come in because what we re able to achieve is more net income without additional equity and that shareholder dilution so to speak is not there and the more we can execute on the strategy that krishnan was rightly pointing out in terms of potential other products and services we ll continue that path so i think it s still very very accretive for the shareholders in terms of what we re doing less so again about the operating margin side of it from my perspective tobey sommer truist securities analyst okay and then krishnan i had promised you a follow up on the specific new relationships that you ve that you press released and discussed in your prepared remarks i know you re laying down some breadcrumbs as to exactly what that is but could you maybe give us an example of what that will solves for our customer thanks krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes look i m going to be pretty high level on this just given where we are and some of the breadcrumbs and what we re trying to build over here but i think when i think about complex problems that are bespoke that executives also face visibility into their de i pipelines etc and things like that these are real problems that are occurring in today s world and how do we create that and how do they understand that so that just would be an example okay but let s just say a small example and part and parcel to a larger solutions that we could drive there would be things like that tobey sommer truist securities analyst okay and then i had just a broad market question and i ll get back in the queue does how is the ability to do remote work at all levels within an organization all the way up to how is that influencing wage rates and therefore fee levels because i guess it could go both ways where you can get some more expensive people to do work remote in different locations but potentially it could go the other way too how is that working in the business krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes let me start off with that and mark you probably have some numbers behind our searches so i think on the executive search side we don t really see it having a huge impact right now okay our retainers and our average fee for search etc are all very very strong and we do see balancing that perhaps on the on demand talent side a desire to be able to leverage talent in a different way and driven by the ability to work remotely and talent to be residing remotely as well so we see another avenue opening up over there as well and all kind of being driven by the same thing so i still kind of see it currently as a net positive for us mark harris chief financial officer yes i ll just a little bit on the math side of it what we re starting to see in terms of average retainers and our engagements is trending back toward the kind of work pre covid maybe a little bit higher but i would say meaningfully obviously it s the volume of work that s generating a lot of revenue value but having said that we are seeing uptick on certain engagement come in strong again not so much obviously i would say in the ceo board side of it but there are other aspects that we re starting to see a little bit of the war on talent kind of creeping itself in but for the most part tobey what i d tell you is clearly the the pure demand side of it is really what s driving those results for the most part tobey sommer truist securities analyst thank you very much operator your next question comes the line of kevin steinke of barrington research your line is now open kevin steinke barrington research analyst hey good afternoon so we ve obviously been talking a lot here about the digitization and tech enablement of your business model with specifically with regard to search have you kind of dove in in terms of productivity metrics and besides annualized revenue per consultant and how maybe those are changing and how sustainable maybe some of those changes are i m thinking of to speed at which you can complete an executive search or the number of searches per consultant maybe how much that has improved or could improve given digitization in tech enablement so i guess any commentary on those specific metrics or any others you might be monitoring would be helpful mark harris chief financial officer sure let me try to give you some color on that i think the first one is on your question on the closure rate and the speed at which we re transacting obviously it has been accelerated through covid without people needing to travel on planes and go through their interview process we ve seen our days to close pre covid to even today fall of about 20 in terms of the average days to close we re starting to see a very slight uptick in that and for the most part its spanning is up pretty well and we would expect again with zoom and other technologies that our digital assessment ability etc would hopefully roll into the fact that we can keep that pretty constant and that should obviously help us in terms and that s obviously been quite efficient i think the other element kind of what you re thinking through kevin is when we look at the g a right so we thought g a fall away to 11 as a percentage of revenue where it used to be 18 and almost nearly 25 at its peak before that i don t see us playing in that space in terms of 18 19 i think it will be somewhere in the midpoint between the two long term or at least medium term i should say versus long term because we do not see the return back to people flying all over the place and or again candidates etc and again in terms of our business development etc everything has been pretty unanimously accepted by doing things by assume it still requires a touch point so we will see a bit of decline and that s why i m using the midpoint of the g a side of it but we ll see some of that come back but not nearly to what it used to be and i think that is what i would call the permanent leverage side of it and then as we go through the way that we want to digitally transcend ourselves in search and heidrick consulting and on demand talent as well that s where it s really going to be very very interesting in terms of what we re able to achieve as we kind of go through that in the next 12 24 months in terms of the platforms that we re trying to create over here and really seeing what that can generate in terms of efficiencies on our core business as well as our potential new business lines that we re thinking through kevin steinke barrington research analyst okay great that s helpful appreciate that and when you re you ve been talking about the normalization to more of the 2 million revenue per consultant level i believe you said you see that happening in the near term are we just kind of thinking about should we think about the next promotion cycle kind of first quarter 2022 we start to normalize to that level or i guess it depends on what s happening with revenue and demand as well but just how are you thinking about it in your planning mark harris chief financial officer we don t see in terms of kind of the current market conditions at least what we re experiencing at heidrick a big drop off we still talk to our clients we re still getting a lot of that showing that it still seems to be full court press obviously we gave a guidance number i think that s assuming we come out within our range and that s still showing very very good strength in the q4 and we ll see obviously it s always hard to predict this market if you wanted to but we do think that will continue its pace yes the promotional side of it will impact the denominator in the trailing 12 months so it s not necessarily spike down it will average back down on its own even if we kept to those levels but i think what we re really trying to say is look as you assume this kind of normalizes if i can use that word q4 next year that s really where i think again if i did the math it would kind of come down to that 2 million and potentially really hold at that level again because of the efficiencies and the way that we do our searches days to close and ability to help people do more without obviously over taxing them is really what we re trying to achieve kevin steinke barrington research analyst okay yes great that s helpful i guess just lastly you ve touched on it quite a bit but just you mentioned there that the demand is still strong i mean what and some of the factors you see going on here in terms of the demand picture leadership changes a lot of leadership changes in the c suite esg diversity and inclusion are you thinking about these as having some real kind of multiyear legs in terms of the growth in demand cycle or i guess are you feeling like we re in the earlier or later innings of some of these things that are krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes kevin it s krishnan here yes i still think we are in the early innings of that ok sustainability very early innings ok we ve made some nice progress on on de i but it s still the early innings on that there s still digital transformation that s occurring in many industries still there s lots of private equity capital that s still sitting out on the sidelines so there s a lot of things going on in their new trends out there as well that we can capture so i think this is there are trend lines out there that will continue for a bit kevin steinke barrington research analyst okay that s helpful thanks a lot for taking the questions congratulations on the results mark harris chief financial officer thanks krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i ll now turn the conference back to mr rajagopalan for closing remarks krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer thank you for joining us clearly look the results we announced today were outstanding we re working very hard to continue to deliver growth and value to heidrick clients into our shareholders all within the framework of our strategic pillars that we ve spoken to before first growing the scale and impact of both our search and consulting lines of business and delivering that premium services experience second expanding the development of leadership solutions and capabilities to address new and ongoing client imperatives such as the on demand talent space and third investing in new product development and strategic expansion into adjacent and complementary areas with innovative tech driven offerings as well we look forward to updating you again next quarter until then thank you all so much and take care operator duration 50 minutes call participants krishnan

our most recent annual report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission let me now introduce our newly appointed ceo and president matt hulett matt matt hulett president and chief executive officer thanks bruce good morning and thank you for joining us my name is matt hulett i m the new ceo petmed i m incredibly honored and enthusiastic to join this iconic company and i m excited to be on this earnings call today i would like to begin by thanking bruce rosenbloom for acting as interim chief executive officer prior to my arrival before we update you on our progress in q2 i would like to first share my personal thoughts and motivations regarding why i m so optimistic about petmeds in our future first i d like to introduce you to my dog harry who was featured on this slide he is the latest addition to our family and he is also a puppy in fact harry s is the first thought to my family our family had no idea what we are getting ourselves into it s like having a new newborn again and as many of you fellow pet parents now parties can be challenging we also can t imagine not having harry in our lives and we think of him as a member of our family personally it is fulfilling to be involved in an organization where you can spend your time and energy on a business that has positive social impacts on society while you re focused on generating returns for shareholders now that we ve established my personal connection to the business i d like to spend some time walking through the rationale as to why i believe petmeds is a great long term investment having a large addressable market is important it enables us more optionality for new brands and products to be developed it provides more opportunity to develop a myriad of go to market strategies target at different cohorts of customer segments this also means that there is room for more market participants and for those market participants to co exist and flourish the pet industry s total addressable market is very large and it is growing currently it is over 100 billion and the service addressable pet medication market where we participated today is approximately 10 billion we are one of the leading pet pharmacies today and as such i see a future where we can extend our already sizable customer reach combined with our widely respected and known brand into additional segments of the total pet care market as our future vision comes fully into focus in addition to the benefits of participating in a large market the market timing is also considerably favorable pet ownership has always been high in the united states but we have seen an increase in pet ownership especially due to the macro effects of covid 19 pet ownership has surged to record heights and now 7 out of 10 us households own a pet those new and existing pet parents will need more pet medications and other related healthcare services for their pet family members as we have seen in other digital e commerce verticals the adoption curve of the digitization of retail is a favorable tailwind this pull forward of digital based retail experiences has now given customers a taste of the future and has created new buying habits of purchasing more products and services online today our addressable market is largely dominated by offline sales and we see the trend to purchase online is clearly very favorable to us pet parents see their pets as an extension of their own family and they are increasingly demanding more healthy pet care options for their furry friends we see this as a positive trend for petmeds and an opportunity for example we have increased the number of products that we carry and have started to include specialty dog food and higher end wellness products which we believe have contributed to the increase in our average customer order value lastly just like we ve seen in the human healthcare market covid 19 accelerated the increasing trend for the digitization of healthcare in fact in the pet market for the first time regulations related to in person veterinary visits and prescription fulfillment were temporarily waived and moved online in unprecedented ways we think this opens the door to the acceleration of digital based telehealth services as i look at the business there are several key competitive advantages that we can leverage in the future first our brand is widely known and trusted having a strong brand takes years to develop and our customers look to petmeds as their trusted pharmacy and as their pet medication experts second we have strong operational and quality efficiency as a pharmacy our customer care integration with our pharmacy is world class which ensures that customers get their products delivered quickly but also accurately and our vet partners receive high quality fulfillment and service delivered through our vet platform our deep experience with the vet community is a latent competitive advantage we currently have one of the largest direct to consumer vet networks in the online retail space petmeds has a large network of over 70 000 veterinarians that we have worked with over the company s history our online vet portal currently has 17 000 veterinarians and vet clinics this is a core capability and asset because it enables us to expand our fulfillment capability as we scale our business our prescription medication authorization rates are the highest they have ever been which speaks volumes the level of veterinary and cooperation we receive our pet pharmaceutical category expertise is something that i view as a unique strength being a differentiated provider allows petmeds to focus our offering especially if the market continues to get even more competitive again more to come on where we see our brand and business growing in the coming months petmeds has long enjoyed close bonds with many of our supplier partners those relationships have developed over time to become even more strategic today we have direct relationships with all of our major suppliers and we partner with them to market their products to our customer base our customer service and overall customer centricity ethos permeates our culture and our team i personally sat in on hours of phone calls between our customers and our service agents and i ve never experienced such a tightly integrated and empathetic customer centric organization in my entire career we don t just have a transactional interaction with our customers we have built trusted relationships before we comment on our earnings performance i would like to reiterate several compelling reasons to invest and to continue to invest in petmeds petmeds has several core fundamentals that are compelling including a strong balance sheet we do not have debt we have over 100 million in cash and we are cash flow positive we have a long history of providing shareholder returns throughout a dividend and a strong return on equity that has been historically over 30 we have started to build a recurring subscription base to our customers with a program which we just recently launched in july of this year through our new autoship save program where we are building higher lifetime value and recurring relationships with our customers in september approximately 20 of our customers signed up in order via our autoship save subscription program and that number continues to rise our customers responded very positively and enrollment in autoship save has increased steadily throughout the quarter we expect many of our reorder sales to eventually transition to autoship save by the end of our fiscal year which will only continue to strengthen our relationship with our customers we also continue to have a large a base of returning customers which is an indication of the quality of service and the value that we deliver to our customers so to sum up the core company s strengths we have over 25 years of experience as a pure play pet pharmacy fully licensed in 50 states delivering fantastic service and value which is recognized by our customers and continues to be rewarded with their loyalty our nps score is over 80 which puts us in the upper quartile along with some of the most beloved brands in the world we are a direct to consumer brand with a rapidly growing addressable market and we have successfully serviced more than 2 million active customers over the last two years now i would like to have bruce rosenbloom our chief financial officer to review our financials for the quarter bruce s rosenbloom chief financial officer thanks matt now we ll review the financial results we will compare our second fiscal quarter ended on september 30 2021 to last year s quarter ended on september 30 2020 and in some cases we ll refer back to september 30 2019 similar to the quarter ended june 30 2021 we faced a unique situation comparing two totally different environments between 2020 pandemic and 2021 post pandemic we were coming off a strong september quarter last year which was primarily driven by increased e commerce demand as a result of the pandemic which caused many retail stores to close and many veterinarians to be unavailable however during the most recent quarter while the pandemic was abating and retail stores and veterinarians were open for business the advertising market continue to surge with increased demand dramatically driving up cpc and cpm rates by more than 30 as a result we spent approximately 33 less in advertising due to these cost increases for the second fiscal quarter ended on september 30 2021 sales were 67 4 million compared to sales of 75 4 million for the same period the prior year a decrease of 10 7 but sales were only down 3 6 versus the quarter ended september 30 2019 prior to the pandemic the decrease in sales was due to decreases in both new order and reorder sales our sales were negatively impacted by a much more competitive market and credit advertising space with substantially higher costs compared to the same quarter last year in addition during the past six months there was a dramatic increase in veterinary visits by both pet owners who were unable to visit their veterinarian during the pandemic we believe the increase in veterinary visits was primarily due to pet owners needing to visit their veterinarians for their pet exams and to renew their prescriptions since some pet owners purchase medications directly from their vets during the visit the company believes that has negatively impacted sales and especially reorder sales during the quarter we were disappointed with our sales results during the quarter however sales were trending more positive in the month of august and september 2021 when you compare them to august and september 2019 reorder sales decreased by 8 5 to 62 million for the quarter compared to reorder sales of 67 8 million for the same quarter last year while for the quarter ended september 30 2019 our reorder sales were 61 9 million encouragingly reorder sales in the most recent quarter was down versus a year ago were up slightly compared to 2019 pre pandemic we would expect to see stronger reorder sales in the back half of fiscal 2022 as we anticipate more prescriptions being renewed a positive trend to highlight for the quarter was the continued increase in our average order size our average order value was approximately 92 for the quarter compared to 87 for the same quarter last year and 85 for the quarter ended september 30 2019 the increase in aov can be attributed to a shift in our product mix to more prescription items and less over the counter items with prescription items having a higher gross margin profile in comparison to over the counter items as i mentioned earlier during the quarter ended september 30 2021 the advertising market was extremely competitive and this increased demand drove our bad prices dramatically as a result our advertising spending was less efficient than usual and delivered fewer impressions than in prior years because of this we believe our advertising spending was less effective in the most recent quarter and its ability to attract new customers new order sales decreased by 30 to 5 4 million for the quarter compared to 37 7 million for the same quarter of the prior year we acquired approximately 65 000 new customers in our second fiscal quarter compared to 96 000 for the same period the prior year however we anticipate that advertising prices should revert back to more normal levels as the pandemic further subsidies which should help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our media spending and thereby continue to help us gain more new customers in the future we are also in the process of reevaluating many of our current marketing relationships which has resulted in changing some of our marketing partners with the expectation of improved marketing efficiency and results for the second fiscal quarter net income was 6 3 million or 0 31 diluted per share compared to 8 4 million or 0 42 diluted per share for the same quarter last year a decrease to net income of 25 for the second fiscal quarter our gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28 5 compared to 30 5 for the same period a year ago the percentage decrease for the quarter can be attributed to some of the major manufacturers shifting their funding from discounting product costs to cooperative marketing rebates there may be an opportunity to improve gross margins in the second half of fiscal year 2022 if the shift to prescription medications continue we had 106 6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 90 7 million in inventory with no debt as of september 30 2021 the board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 0 30 per share on the company s common stock the dividend will be payable on november 19 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on november 8 2021 the company continues to be committed to returning capital to our stockholders however the declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the board of directors each quarter following its review of the company s financial performance this ends the financial review operator we are now ready to take questions questions and answers operator we will be conducting a question and answer session and our first question is from anthony lebiedzinski from sidoti please proceed with your questions anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst yes good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions so welcome matt welcome back bruce so as far as new order sales i mean obviously you guys did have certainly felt the impact of the advertising market being lower but kind of what gives you confidence that things will bounce back in the back half of the fiscal year just curious as to what s driving that ad maybe perhaps are you seeing some good results better results so far in the current quarter just wondering about your confidence level about your ability to bounce back with the new order sales matt hulett president and chief executive officer anthony this is matt and thanks for the question great to hear from you again and then bruce feel free to chime in a couple of things about that one is i would say that we re taking a small bites too fast approach to looking at our new customer acquisition we basically have rewired our entire marketing partnerships and agencies in the last i would say i ve been here two months so we ve done that in the last four weeks and now we ll be rolling out very soon so we re looking at our capital allocation spend to where we spend i think we ve been spending too aggressively in some channels where we haven t seen the return and we haven t been taking advantage of new sources of traffic where we actually think we have a lot of advantage that s one two is we re spending a lot more time rewiring our system and databases around tracking our customers better and really focusing on reengagement and for rates in general we are seeing some changes to the rates out there i think some of the channels like facebook have obviously got more expensive due to the loss of first party data due to the apple s idfa decisions so those are some channels that obviously i think are just still getting hotter in terms of increased cpms and cpcs but in others we re seeing favorable trends so it depends on the channel but for us we re really looking at each channel and seeing how we get the incrementality of each channel which is different than what we did in the past anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst okay got it okay and then in terms of your gross margins now you did mention that you have been shipping more items like specialty dog which obviously is much heavier than typical pet medications so as we look to refine our models here like how should we think about as you on the one hand it sounds like you re doing a good job of increasing your aov but how is the margin gross margin impact going to be because of that bruce s rosenbloom chief financial officer yeah anthony i m going to take that question if you don t mind as far as our margins for the past quarter we have as we may be spoken offline before but our vendors shifted funding to our co op marketing in lieu of discounting products and this negatively impacted our gross margins during the quarter and it will probably be like that going forward where instead of getting price discounts off the price of the items or the inventory these rebates and these promotions are going to be below the line as they are in the advertising line item so as far as moving forward with gross margins you ll see that that s an overriding factor but however as we ve also seen our shift moving back to more prescription than otc we do expect a positive trend of margins moving forward because of that going back to some semblance of normalcy pandemic versus post pandemic when it comes to our mix shift of items anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst okay got it and then in terms of the capital allocation just curious to get your thoughts matt as far as looking at pets for years the company has been a company with a lot of cash and growing the dividend and sort of maintaining a very healthy cash position just wanted to get your thoughts about that how should think about that especially the dividend what are your thoughts there matt hulett president and chief executive officer yeah i think there are several things to unpack there it s a great question and i ve been a long listener of pets earnings calls as well so i ll try to give a slightly different answer i would say with the dividend we re always looking at that and it s always subject to change but we ve been pretty consistent with the dividend and nothing to announce here obviously but to your cash question with over 100 million in cash with interest rates being so low there i think there s a lot of opportunities in this space to deploy cash and allocate capital more efficiently to get higher returns there is also a lot of businesses in the pet ecosystem that fortunately in this market different than other verticals there s a lot of ways to partner a lot of ways to look at m a as well so we re certainly going to be looking at those in the future since we do have such a large cash position and lastly it s a little early for me to articulate the strategy i ve been around for two months i think the first four weeks felt like six months because there was a lot to do and learn and now i m kind of selling in and feeling better about things but yeah i think there s a lot of opportunity to deploy capital differently especially given the tailwinds in pet ownership so that s kind of a non answer answer anthony other than i think we re taking a fresher look at that and i would expect that we will make some decisions in the coming quarters that we ll obviously update everyone on anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst got it okay well thanks and best of luck going forward matt hulett president and chief executive officer thanks anthony operator and our next question is from steph wissink with jefferies please proceed with your questions steph wissink jefferies analyst hi everybody thanks for taking our questions and the first is i wanted to just go back to some of the comments in your prepared remarks around vet visits and i think i head you correctly that there is an inverse correlation meaning when vet visits go up you tend to see vets sell prescription and otc directly and so your business feels that impact is that the right way to think about it or is there a net second derivative wherein follow up to those primary prescriptions you ll start to see some of the secondary prescription refills in your business bruce s rosenbloom chief financial officer hi steph this is bruce now let me address that question really the vet visits inform there really to try to give an understanding of what we were seeing last year versus this year last year during the pandemic virtually all the vet offices were closed and there really wasn t many alternatives where our pet owners can turn to for medications and many were trying online pet medications for the first time and so that was definitely something that we welcomed last year this year all those clinics were open for business and they re making up for lost time so they re making sure if they haven t seen that pet in a 12 month period they re enforcing and making sure that pet owner is coming into their clinic so it s almost a resetting of the prescription cycle and many of the pet owners are going to vet buying there and then we re in line for the refill and we can sort of through our data we know when it s time for a reorder and we ll go ahead and market for that reorder subsequent reorder and we expect to see that in the second half of this fiscal year is what i was referring to earlier in the call steph wissink jefferies analyst okay got it and then my second question is on ad spend i think you mentioned both that you expect advertising prices to revert i m curious if you could just give us a sense of do you expect them to go back to pre pandemic levels on a purchasing price basis or do you still expect there to be a bit of inflation post pandemic and related to that i think you also used the word words less efficient can you maybe talk a little bit about what you re doing to tweak your marketing mix or your marketing plans out over the next couple of quarters to try to improve some of the efficiency even if the costs remain a little bit elevated matt hulett president and chief executive officer yeah and i ll take your second question first a couple of things i would say overall the way in which we ve been purchasing media is going to change significantly we re looking at new and have actually implemented new marketing partners to help us with that that specialize in specific areas of media i won t get into the channels themselves but obviously google facebook connected tv there is a lot of options out there and i think the way we ve configured media spend to date needed a fresh pair of eyes so that s one two is just adding more data around the decisions that we re making around our media buys with another i would say quick win that we ve implemented and then lastly to your first question media rates have been dancing around quite a bit i was in the language learning space prior to this with rosetta stone and we took advantage of favorable rate during the pandemic because advertisers were leaving things like brand advertising to performance i would say going into the holiday season it s too early to tell since it s a very competitive time to be buying advertising but i would say that i m a little bit more optimistic about rates than i was when i started two months ago steph wissink jefferies analyst okay that s great thank you for the help matt hulett president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from ben rose with battle road research please proceed with your question ben rose battle road research analyst yes good afternoon and i know we haven t had a chance to meet matt but i look forward to meeting you post call a couple of questions with regard to pet health advice on your slides matt you talked about the growth in the telehealth market and i was just curious to know what thoughts you have with regard to the ask the vet service that you offer now and whether you envision that being expanded in some way or perhaps being monetized in some way in the future matt hulett president and chief executive officer hey ben and looking forward to catching up in subsequent conversations yeah i m really excited about the pet telehealth space there has been a lot of innovation in this space there is a lot of different start ups that i had talked to personally in the space to get some advice i think the way i d start is i always try to evaluate businesses not only on the tam and the timing and the kind of the fundamentals but also the customer relationships an inordinate amount of our customers are wanting additional services from us they almost they are giving us permission to give them more advice than we are today because prescriptions are in a way the milk of the back of the proverbial store with the customer because they see petmeds as the expert in pet healthcare it just so happens as the customer is leading the store we re not providing a lot of expert experience yet and so i see pet telehealth is us being very well positioned to add additional services that we don t do today because customers really view as that specialty pharmacies they re not viewing it as the mega retailer with lots of different services we re not known for selling food we re not selling known for selling dog toys we re known for providing expert advice and so for pet telehealth while the market is really small i see it as an opportunity to engage with our autoship customers in really unique ways and then sell them additional services so nothing to announce but we re certainly going to be doing a lot of testing even this quarter on this which i hope hopefully be able to talk to you about next time ben rose battle road research analyst okay great and with regard to the company s relationships with the veterinarian community and vet clinics this is the first time that i heard you quantify the number of veterinarians in clinics that you work with and find that to be an intriguing opportunity was curious to know plans that you have to perhaps reduce friction with the veterinarians or to improve relationships with them matt hulett president and chief executive officer yeah ben thanks for noticing that and it was intentional to put that in there because i was quite surprised when i first started the company we have a vet portal that s used today i ve seen other competitors in this space quote numbers and i think still might be surprised that we have a larger network than most i think our relationship with vets has been a little confrontation to be honest over the span of the company when we first started because we are the pioneers in this space i think when we we would go to the veterinary conferences we are probably the least likely to be welcomed and i think now there is other players in this space and we ve kind of opened the door for them and i think we re kind of seen as a more friendly player in this space to be honest our vet verification rates are as high as they ve ever been i think there s a lot of things we could do in our vet portal to make the veterinarians life easy we re very sympathetic to veterinarians they are overworked they have some of the highest suicide rates of any profession and i think that there is a lot we can do to be a better friend of the vet and our vet portal i think has a great start but i think there s a lot of opportunity to automate what they do in their clinics and we re going to be pro vet in terms of how we approach the market our intent is not to be anti vet ben rose battle road research analyst okay thank you very much matt hulett president and chief executive officer thanks ben operator and our questions and answers portion of the call has ended i would now like to turn the call back to matt hulett the company s ceo for his concluding remarks matt hulett president and chief executive officer thank you i want to reiterate what bruce just covered in his financial highlights section we are disappointed with our sales results for the quarter but after my two months on the job i m confident there is much we can do and will do to improve our business growth to be clear in a market that s growing petmeds needs to be make the necessary changes to our operating playbook to take advantage of the market trends in my first weeks here i ve listened in on countless customer service calls engaged with over 20 pet industry leaders brief research analysts and engaged with our own main pharmaceutical partners i ve already seen a lot of core areas that we can and have already begun to improve in this business and these include the following using more data insights to acquire and retain customers better segmentation of our customer base in order to drive more mass personalization of our offers and services improved new customer acquisitions through a different allocation of variable marketing spend expanded product and services that are already being demanded by our customers since i ve only been with petmeds for a short period of time i m not ready on today s call to provide a comprehensive future strategy or capital allocation plan for the business and that would be premature however i do have a 90 day 180 day plan that i presented to our board of directors and i ll be sharing more about our vision and strategy with you during our q3 earnings call but i will say this today we firmly believe that we can take advantage of the large market tailwinds leverage the main core strengths we highlighted today and execute on a broader strategic vision for the company we look forward to briefing you in the coming quarters on our strategy and our progress thank you for listening in operator this ends the conference call operator duration 34 minutes call participants bruce s rosenbloom chief financial officer matt hulett president and chief executive officer anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst steph

right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 with the required preliminaries out of the way i ll begin with a review of our results for the quarter and then turn the call over to joe craft our chairman president and chief executive officer for his comments the exceptional performance delivered by alliance through the first half of the year continued into the 2021 quarter as we reported earlier this morning arlp again posted sequential increases to total revenues net income ebitda and free cash flow strong performance from both our coal operations and our royalty segments led total revenues higher by 53 million to 414 4 million with net increase income increasing 13 5 million to 57 5 million or 0 44 per unit and ebitda climbing 17 3 million to 135 9 million free cash flow also rose during the 2021 quarter increasing 40 3 million to 119 7 million arlp s strong cash flow performance during the 2021 quarter allowed us to return 12 7 million to unitholders through the quarterly distribution we paid in august and further improved our balance sheet as total leverage fell to 0 95 times a 12 reduction from the sequential quarter and liquidity increased 102 1 million to 602 6 million arlp s financial and operating results for the 2021 quarter and the first nine months of 2021 were also much improved compared to the 2020 quarter end period compared to the 2020 quarter total revenues increased 16 8 as a result of higher coal sales volumes and significantly higher oil and gas prices while net income jumped 111 4 and ebitda climbed 14 4 compared to the 2020 period coal sales volumes increased 15 during the 2021 period driving total revenues higher by 14 to 1 1 billion coal production volumes also increased during the 2021 period jumping 20 1 to 23 5 million tons compared to 20 1 million tons during the 2020 period increased coal production and the benefits of ongoing cost control and efficiency initiatives at our mining operations drove segment adjusted ebitda expense per ton sold lower by 11 1 to 28 82 per ton during the 2021 period compared to 32 43 per ton for the 2020 period net income increased 290 5 million to 126 3 million reflecting higher revenues and lower depreciation in the 2021 period and 157 million of non cash impairment charges in the 2020 period excluding these impairment charges net income of 126 3 million for the 2021 period compares to an adjusted net loss of 7 2 million for the pandemic impacted 2020 period ebitda for the 2021 period increased 31 5 to 348 9 million compared to adjusted ebitda of 265 3 million in the 2020 period turning from our consolidated results let s now take a closer look at the performance of arlp s business segments reflecting strong coal demand which led to higher sales tons and price realizations at our coal operations coal sales revenues rose 11 1 to 362 3 million during the 2021 quarter compared to the sequential quarter segment adjusted ebitda expense increased modestly to 28 95 per ton sold as inflationary pressures are beginning to impact our coal operations increased revenues more than offset higher per ton operating expenses driving segment adjusted ebitda for our coal operations up by 10 9 to 126 3 million arlp s royalty businesses also performed well during the 2021 quarter for our oil and gas royalties segment adjusted ebitda during the 2021 quarter rose 24 1 to 19 1 million as sales volumes and price realizations improved compared to the sequential quarter benefitting from increased revenues and royalty tons sold during the 2021 quarter arlp s coal business coal royalties business delivered 9 2 million of segment adjusted ebitda an increase of 35 6 compared to the sequential quarter the strong performance of both of these businesses resulted in arlp s total royalty segment posting a record 28 3 million of segment adjusted ebitda during the 2021 quarter and with that i ll now turn the call over to joe for his comments joe joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer thank you brian and welcome everyone since our last earnings call fossil fuel prices have increased dramatically around the world as supply has fallen woefully short of demand since the beginning of this year worldwide lng prices have escalated fourfold in asia and europe the api 2 index for thermal coal prices has more than doubled as weather impacted unreliable renewable power generation did not show up at expected levels and utilities increasingly turn to coal in response to high natural gas prices in the united states natural gas prices had nearly doubled causing coal fired generation and arlp s primary markets to jump 23 year over year coal generation could have been even higher however supply has been limited due to numerous issues almost none of which should be attributed to the producers of america s most abundant low cost fuel coal looking forward the biden administration s domestic energy policy agenda combined with esg obsessions in europe and the united states will most likely continue to restrict growth in fossil fuel production absent any significant global demand destruction we expect fossil fuel prices will remain at elevated levels through next year and into 2023 we have benefited from the market uplift this year as reflected in our updated full year 2021 coal sales guidance assuming no delivery delays through the end of this year coal sales volumes will be 15 higher than the pandemic impacted 2020 levels as natural gas prices are projected to remain favorable for coal generation next year and coal stocks for our customers are at critically low levels we are currently targeting a 6 to 12 increase in coal sales volumes in 2022 over 2021 levels to help meet the needs of the marketplace arlp has responded to rising coal demand our employees are working extra hours to increase current production and our mining operations are focused on retaining arlp s exceptional workforce and attracting new employees to further increase coal production arlp s customers are rewarding us for our efforts to meet their needs during this critical time providing new commitments during the 2021 quarter for the delivery of 2 1 million tons over the balance of this year arlp is now sold out for 2021 and as a result of recent contract pricing we are increasing our estimated full year coal price realization by 1 10 per ton sold for this year during the 2021 quarter we also strengthened our long term coal contract book entering into new contracts for the delivery of another 13 2 million tons over the 2022 through 2024 time frame and since the end of the 2021 quarter securing new agreements for the delivery of an additional 10 7 million tons over the same three year period as of today we have 29 9 million tons committed and priced for 2022 of which 2 4 million tons are committed to the thermal export market for delivery next year arlp has secured commitments for approximately 4 million tons of export sales in 2021 including 440 000 tons of metallurgical coal we expect strong international demand for both thermal and metallurgical coal will continue into 2022 providing arlp with the opportunity to place similar volumes if not more in the equity markets at attractive prices next year in 2023 we have price commitments for 15 8 million tons all in the domestic market market fundamentals for arlp s royalty segment are also favorable for our oil and gas royalties business commodity prices have increased significantly since the beginning of the year and the forward price curve for oil natural gas and gas liquids remains very favorable production from our existing acreage continues to improve from pandemic lows we expect that trend to continue as e p operators modestly increase drilling and completion activity and we anticipate the contribution from oil and gas royalties to arlp s consolidated results will also increase as a result of our recent acquisition of approximately 1 500 net royalty acres in the delaware portion of the permian basin with the active development already underway and a significant inventory of wells to be ultimately compete completed on the acquired acreage this transaction should provide a long term uplift to the performance of our oil and gas royalties business we also anticipate steady growth from our coal royalties business as increased coal sales volumes and prices from arlp s mining operations should benefit this part of our business as well as a result we expect the contribution of our total royalty segment to arlp s consolidated results will continue to increase in the future in closing i want to address our thoughts on setting unitholder distributions after suspending unitholder distributions in response to the challenges and uncertainties created by the pandemic arlp s performance and outlook had improved to the point that we were pleased to reinstate unitholder distributions earlier this year targeting an annualized distribution level at approximately 30 of anticipated full year free cash flow at the time arlp s performance since then has obviously been exceptional well above our expectations and the positive future outlook for energy market fundamentals contributed to the board s decision this quarter to double the distribution to our unitholders compared to the sequential quarter as i just mentioned coal oil and natural gas market fundamentals appear to be extremely favorable for the next several years and with our long life low cost strategically located assets arlp is well positioned to deliver solid results for the foreseeable future we continue to believe we are well positioned to provide attractive cash returns to our unitholders and provide arlp with the flexibility to pursue long term growth opportunities while maintaining a conservative balance sheet while arlp is aggressively pursuing opportunities to benefit from current market conditions we are also aware that significant uncertainties remain the same market environment that is so favorable to arlp business today should also serve as a wake up call to politicians regulators financial institutions utilities and customers or consumers as they contemplate the future policies favoring a rapid movement away from reliable baseload generating capacity to an ever increasing premature reliance on intermittent power sources have already resulted in power disruptions in the united states an energy crisis in europe and power shortages in china and india we are hopeful that as the energy transition continues to devolve it will do so in a way that not only continues to push new technologies and innovation but also with an honest recognition of the pace at which this can be deployed this requires an acknowledgment by these policymakers of the importance of coal fired power generation in order to maintain access to low cost reliable power until the transition is completed sometime over the next several decades as the future of energy continues to evolve arlp intends to be there for our customers providing the fuel essentials to meeting their needs today and profitably investing in opportunities that will help them keep the lights on in the future that concludes our prepared comments and i ll now ask the operator to open the call for questions questions answers operator our first questions come from the line of nathan martin with the benchmark company please proceed with your questions nathan martin the benchmark company analyst thank you good morning joe brian congrats on the quarter brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks nate appreciate it joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer thank you nathan martin the benchmark company analyst coal production i d say came in a little lighter than expected i m guessing that s driven the decrease in full year shipment guidance you know given the strong market we re seeing as you guys pointed out you most probably weren t expecting a downward revision obviously even the revised guidance looks like it would imply a very strong fourth quarter on both the production and shipment side could you guys maybe talk about the factors leading to that change is labor a factor at all there you also mentioned some issues maybe with delivery delays affecting that maybe a little color there and then kind of looking ahead to 2022 i think i caught you guys said that the shipments should be up about 6 to 12 year over year can you give us an idea how you plan to increase tons there thank you joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer sure yes we have had you know shipments were definitely impacted by some supply chain issues from the transportation sector to where we had sev you know we had some plant shipments that did not occur because of the unavailability of transportation equipment you know we continue to see that as a challenge going forward we do expect to hit our guidance with fourth quarter shipments assuming that transportation shows up you know at this time we have commitments that that will happen but you know we ll have to wait and see on that as far as our production covid still has impacted our operations so we did have quite a few employees that were off this past quarter that impacted production somewhat not significantly but it did account for some of that shortfall you know we re working extra time this quarter to try to make sure that we can achieve our objectives for the year so we are working out extra days on the weekends to try to meet that objective in addition starting next week we ve added a unit of production at our nc mining operation in appalachia that will be fully staffed and producing some additional tons in the fourth quarter going into next year so we are looking at adding some production next year that will be driven primarily by again working extra hours and extra days as well as maybe adding a few units so that 6 to 12 will be largely dependent on labor force and supply chain you know we feel good about having the equipment based on what we have within our operations that s going to be an availability issue for most people but not for us as far as the equipment availability i m just speaking of labor we re feeling good about our ability to attract labor since we have commitments that are starting to grow over the next three years and strong support from our domestic customers that have given us sufficient signals to provide the confidence to try to bring on a unit or two that growth right now is probably two thirds mostly in the illinois basin is basically where the growth is except for the nc mining that i spoke of earlier i think that answers your questions unless there s a follow up nathan martin the benchmark company analyst yes yes joe no i appreciate the color there absolutely if i may kind of shifting over to the pricing side of the equation it looks like here in this year in 21 you guys are nearly a million tons pretty strong pricing levels obviously your full year guidance moved up by looks like about 1 60 at the midpoint you know if you look at 2022 it looks like you basically doubled your committed and priced tons there obviously you guys had such a significant portion of 2022 locked in can you give us any idea how pricing looks like for 22 joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer well given the we have it s hard to give you a price target i d say that there s still uncertainties there the prices are continued to be strong we are booking some at very attractive prices relative to what the this year s prices are at the same time there was quite a bit of tonnage that we booked that was earlier in the cycle so we didn t we haven t been able to time everything at the top of the market but it s safe to say that we expect revenues you know to be higher next year i can t give you a precise number right now but you know we feel like next year of 2022 is going to be a very attractive year relative to what we ve seen in the last two or three years nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it all right i appreciate that joe and then just maybe one final question i know i asked you last quarter of your thoughts on free cash flow allocation i think you said you d you know be better positioned to answer that on the next call obviously you guys felt strongly enough about what you re seeing in the markets to increase double the distribution really you also added some acreage on the oil and gas side i understand there s some uncertainty out there still as you mentioned in your prepared remarks but maybe any other color you can provide on what your priorities are from a capital allocation standpoint or with the potential step up and free cash that you guys could see next year thanks joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer nate one of the uncertainties or headwind that we re looking at is just what the biden administration s going to do they promoted these infrastructure bills which on the one hand tries to encourage workers with what we call true infrastructure and then they ve got a social infrastructure bill that intends to ask peoples not people not to work i don t know what s going to happen there it s just amazing to me that for two or three months they stick with one particular type bill and then all of a sudden everything s changing and nobody really knows what is going to be in the bill or what the impact is going to be i think the positive news for the people in the coal business it looks like senator manchin s been successful in keeping out some of the draconian measures that were in the earlier bills but we really need to see what in the world comes out of the biden administration this quarter heading into next year and what their reaction is going to be relative to whether it be legislation incentivizing alternatives more importantly what position are they going to take toward our financial institutions and access to capital because there have been signs recently that the federal reserve has been encouraging the banks not to lend the coal industry so we need to really assess how the biden administration handles the rest of the year as we think about you know how we allocate capital going into 2022 and beyond i think the fundamentals are very strong we re seeing a lot of opportunities in the oil and gas sector we re continuing to evaluate things in the transition most of those things appear to have a little longer lead time instead of immediate type acquisitions that we re continuing to spend quite a bit of time looking in that area so our challenges like most people now are supply chain shortages transportation shortages weather the economy biden regulations inflation is a big one so and covid i mean what s the pandemic going to do is it going to subside or are we going to see another wave so there are just a lot of different issues in front of us but we feel like we re well positioned to manage those going forward and i wish had better clarity but like i said the insistence on trying to pass this legislation at a time when there s already a worker shortage i don t know how that s going to shake out nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it joe i appreciate those comments and also the variables there just real quick just a follow on on the labor side of things and then the inflation that you just pointed out as well as you guys are seeing any thoughts on what that might add on the cost side going into next year joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer well we re hoping that our productivity improvements will offset those increases but there s definitely inflationary pressure with steel prices natural gas prices oil prices you know labor component is small relative to some of the others that are double digit in prices but we think our margins will expand next year based on the benefit of higher revenues that will more than offset any cost increases nathan martin the benchmark company analyst perfect i think that s all i have for now thank you guys as always for the time and best of luck in the fourth quarter brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer appreciate it nate operator thank you our next questions come from the line of lin shen with hite please proceed with your questions lin shen hite hedge asset management llc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my call that s a great quarter and i m just wondering you know some of the peers talk about that they set a target to reduce their direct operating greenhouse gas emission target and i m just wondering for alliance is there such a approach or is there anything you re kind of working on are you seeing some low hanging fruit you can do for maybe improve your esg joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer not sure it didn t come very clear to me what your question could you repeat your question lin shen hite hedge asset management llc analyst just like some company co company talked about they can they re working on to reduce their greenhouse gas emission for their operations i m just sort of wondering is alliance also working on some approach to reduce your greenhouse gas emission for your operations or some other like work like that joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer we re constantly looking at efficiency opportunities we ve also made some small investments in some offsets carbon offsets on methane emissions from closed operations which we re continuing to look at we re looking at other credits also potentially in the forest areas timber area so that will be my response to that brian do you anything more brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer no not yet lin shen hite hedge asset management llc analyst so you don t see any near term big opportunity for you to invest something like carbon capture you don t foresee any near term opportunities being there joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer the carbon capture would be more on the consumption side not on the operating side brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer at the utility level joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer which i don t really see anything in the near term on that from our existing customer base lin shen hite hedge asset management llc analyst got it and i also want to follow up when you look at 2022 do you think about you probably will export more than 2021 or what do you think about export market in 2022 joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer we do believe the export market is going to be constructive it s going to be robust it will be there for us i think what we have to balance is what are the demands for our domestic customers and you know so it s going to be a matter of communication and commitment you know we long time for the longest time really rely on our domestic base and i think if we re asking our customers that for new commitments to commit for three years and if they would commit for three years i think our preference would be to serve that market as opposed to be in the export market on a short term basis if on the other hand we ve got some export customers that are willing to contract or commit multiple years also so we re looking for long term supply so that we can support bringing on the additional people to meet those needs lin shen hite hedge asset management llc analyst ok great thank you very much appreciate it joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer it could be higher it could be lower depending on what the domestic market brings lin shen hite hedge asset management llc analyst great thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of shelly mcnulty with loomis please proceed with your questions shelly mcnulty loomis sayles company analyst hi thanks yeah i just wanted to go back to your comments about kind of waiting on biden administration and kind of concerning comments from the fed in regards to you know advising banks not to lend to coal is that kind of at this point prohibiting you from being able to come to refinance your bonds that are callable is that would you characterize it as stopping you from doing it at this point or you know if you wanted to refi tomorrow you have banks that would be willing to act as your agents joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer we think the markets are open today it s not a today issue it s you know trying to think through what our access to capital be you know from the banks in particular when our revolver renews in a couple of years so that s the primary concern right now i think the bonds where interest rates are and where the strength of our balance sheet is we ve got some favorable responses currently but there s just an uncertainty there that just puts a premium on us to have a strong balance sheet we just feel like that there s it s hard to know three years from now where the markets are going to be given how fast they ve gone up you know will there be a balance or not i mean i m a believer that we re going to have this supply chain disruption for a while i just don t see anything changing that especially if the biden administration passes this second slug of 2 trillion that puts money in people s pockets and encourages them not to work so if people don t show up to drive trucks at the ports or anywhere throughout the supply chain of our economy i m just very concerned that we re going to continue to have a lot of disruption in the supply side of the business and it could go to anything and everything i mean that s an area that we re not immune to having just products coming to the coal mine as an example it affects everything throughout the economic food chain here so i think the policies really need to be focused on what s good for the economy as opposed to the 2022 election which in my opinion is what s driving their urgency to try to get something passed it has nothing to do with what s right for america in my opinion but we just have to wait and see i can t yeah shelly mcnulty loomis sayles company analyst ok got it and then for your exported tons what is the major market that you re exporting to at this point joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer so we have markets to india and some to europe and some to the middle east a little bit to the far east not a lot shelly mcnulty loomis sayles company analyst and what s the kind of breakeven that you need to see to make the margin more attractive on the export side get a better return on joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer well the price is there i mean the price markers are there it s just a matter of whether we should be selling into the export market or the domestic market and we re further challenged by the fact that we really have no supply to sell for the next two quarters and maybe three so when we re looking at what participation we would have in the export market unless we can bring on these additional tons you know we re looking at second half of next year and a lot can happen in that price curve compared to where we are today but i still believe that there s definitely going to be opportunity from a price standpoint for us to sell into that market it s really just a matter where the domestic customers would they prefer to have the tons stay in america or are they not willing to commit a longer term and if they don t then we ll probably end up turning to the export market shelly mcnulty loomis sayles company analyst but on the shipments that got impacted by logistical you know issues that i would assume mostly just impacted the domestic shipments not your exported shipments so if you can t move the tons because of the domestic freight or whatnot can you kind of move them into the export market quickly on a spot basis just to kind of get those tons out or how does that work joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah the transportation is going to be impacting both domestic and export at the same time shelly mcnulty loomis sayles company analyst ok ok joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer so it s not you know there s either there s only so many train crews there have been employee you know work issues also trying to fill their seats on their train so most of it s a labor issue for the railroads you ve got the you know the vessels on the seas that you know just it s a logistics timing issue so again our challenge in america is most producers are all sold out shelly mcnulty loomis sayles company analyst yes joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer so it s hard to take full advantage of these high prices that you see in the near term shelly mcnulty loomis sayles company analyst ok and the ability to restock inventory for next year is kind of limited in the sense that some of that capacity that closed during the pandemic is it able to quickly you know restart or is there then too much domestic coal capacity permanently shut because of the rhetoric of we don t want the coal anymore how do you is it ever gonna be possible for the utility to restock inventory level to a point where we have a good cushion and i know it s dependent on that i know that is dependent on the policy too but are they wanting to restock or are they comfortable with operating at these levels of inventory have they had joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer utilities would love to be restocking right now but they re more focused on just maintaining their con you know getting the coal that they ve got under contract so that they re prepared for the winter without having to run out coal i mean they re very low the lowest i ve seen in a long time and so everybody is focused on trying to make sure we meet the commitments that they ve made i think as far as restocking from a producer standpoint yes the pandemic did impact coal production by 20 and once you close that out those operations it is tough to bring them back i think that thinking of new operations i know there s a couple of people out there trying to do it but most of what we see of new production is all metallurgical coal there s just been an abandonment by most producers of the thermal business i mean we re one of the very few that s committed to the thermal business for the life of the power plants through 2035 2040 2045 so it s hard for people to get financing to open new thermal mines i just don t see it happening but there is excess capacity because of the pandemic for people like us to where we don t have to make large investments we just have to hire people to get the full capacity and i think that s what most other people would be doing most other people that are in the thermal business are doing it the way we re doing it and that s really just working extra hours and trying to increase their production that way as opposed to thinking about making capital investments that would bring on supply that would have an overhang in the future operator thank you our next questions come from the line of matthew fields with bank of america please matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi i just wanted to ask about kind of the strong balance sheet that you sort of you know highlighted that that s sort of a continuing priority for you you know pre pandemic you had always kind of talked about one turn of leverage as that kind of comfortable level and now as we get sort of you know into a more favorable environment for you and you re starting to increase you know the distribution we re kind of at that one turn of leverage and it s just you know i wanted to get a sense of where you are at this inflection point of you know balancing the balance sheet versus shareholder interests and kind of where you want to see the balance sheet maintained as you kind of try to address shareholders that haven t had their distribution in a while joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer i think the objective is the same i think our you know next year probably because ebitda is going to be higher you re going to see that drop below that our concern is 2023 there s a lot of plants that are scheduled to close in the coal space we need to see again what the biden policies do not only legislatively but from a regulatory standpoint as to whether or not these coal plants will stay up longer or whether they ll close faster and so when we are trying to think about you know the transition we need to be able to continue to make acquisitions so that our ebitda will grow from things other than coal so that as we look to 2030 2035 that our company has strong growth for the long term instead of trying to think that the coal business is going to be around for the next 50 years which would allow us to return to coverage ratios like we ve had when we had more security that we had a longer runway so that you know i think both the access to capital and the future demand for our product are two major issues that influence what our reserves have to be so that we can have the ability to have a strong balance sheet so that we can survive and no matter what environment is presented to us but at the same time still be able to return a sufficient amount of cash to the shareholders which i support strongly as a major shareholder but we had to be prudent in looking not only for the short term but for the intermediate term and the challenges our industry faces and i m hopeful that as i said in my prepared remarks i m hopeful that our policymakers would accept the fact that you can t replace fossil fuels overnight and i don t know why they why the financial community thinks that we can i don t know why they can t see the need to finance fossil fuels through the transition as opposed to saying well i know the transition is going to occur until 2035 2040 but i m not i m going to stop lending to you tomorrow that just doesn t make sense to me but unfortunately there are banks out there that are taking that position and so it influences how we can think about our balance sheet and therefore we can t use leverage like most other industries can so when you look at our balance sheet it is conservative relative to others because we do have lenders that are shying away from the coal world unfortunately matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch analyst so not you know at the risk of oversimplifying it sounds like you know trying to play some offense and defense with offense being the you know the royalty business and then defense being kind of your strong balance sheet to in the absence of information on what the regulatory and legislative policy is going to be and you know maybe that one turn of leverage which was a pretty pre pandemic level is are you saying is that i don t want to put words in your mouth so is joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch analyst you know 450 million of debt too much right now or brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer no joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer no no we think that that s very doable and we could even take on some more matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer but what i m trying to say is we look at different scenarios and we feel very good about the next four or five years if markets were working we would be having a totally different conversation but unfortunately we ve gotten government interference in markets and it goes through everything we do whether it s ferc whether it s the fed whether it s the regulatory i mean there s constantly whether it s the legislative giving when and so are all these tax credits when they don t need them i mean they say they don t need them and yet the government keeps throwing they want to throw 300 billion at them according to the last thing i read and some people tell me that it s really going up to 600 over 20 years i mean when it was a year a year a year now all of a sudden they think they need to do it for 10 years what s that all about so yeah so we feel like you know we can sustain you know 500 million or 600 million of debt but at the same time we need to see how these policies impact other people s behavior toward it s not what we can support it s what we can borrow at a reasonable price brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer what the financial institutions will allow us to do joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah if that makes yeah matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch analyst so practically speaking does that mean that you know you re gonna have to hold more cash on your balance sheet and depend less on a revolver which may or may not be as available to you after 2023 brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer or we re in the process of looking at alternative markets and there are some there are people out there that see the strong credit and realize that we re going to be there for the next 20 years and that we re a solid credit so there are alternatives that we re looking at we just don t have good idea what the pricing is going to be two years from now as opposed to the pricing today i mean it s attractive today but we don t need the money today we need it a couple of years from now when our revolver matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch analyst are you talking about going into the private debt market or a sort of a private revolver or with a nonbank institution joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah the latter matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok that s very interesting you know i appreciate it and good luck this the rest of this year and next thank you joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer ok thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of scott ferguson with pacific value please proceed with your questions scott ferguson pacific value analyst hi guys brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning scott scott ferguson pacific value analyst just a couple questions i ll just rattle them off and let you go but i know you guys touched on this in an earlier question but just ballpark the amount of tonnage you guys have booked for next year how much was booked before this recent price run up and then secondly you guys in the past have mentioned investments that you guys were close to pulling the trigger or were looking at that we re outside of oil and gas are those still on the table and potential timing so thanks guys joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah as far as the booking of business i d say that most of this was really pretty ratable ever since our last call so we booked some in august september october i d say it s probably a third a third a third i don t know maybe it s a little maybe it s something in that neighborhood would be what i would guess i haven t really looked at it that way but i would say that it s probably in that zip code of a third a third a third maybe yeah i don t know brian i ll defer to you brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer no that s about right i mean i think if you look at our committed tons at the end of the second quarter third quarter compared to the end of the second quarter we about doubled it this quarter and then as we mentioned in the call since the end of the third quarter we booked another 10 7 million tons of volumes so tough to time the market obviously i think joe s characterization of we are constantly in the market we re constantly booking agreements at pricing that s attractive at that time so we ve definitely caught some of the uplift i mean the fact that we were able to increase our full year sales price realizations by 1 10 in one quarter speaks to that but it has been occurring on a more ratable basis joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer and we increased last quarter brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer yes joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer also in anticipation of some of that so we ve got i mean our revenue is up we re 150 million i think for the year so we were able to capture some of that before the july call and then we add some after as far as the acquisitions you know non fossil what we re we ve looked at in some of the transition type investments we re seeing significant inflation in some of the fundamental elements to go into different aspects of the various different alternatives that we ve been looking at we still have most of the products are actually supplied from overseas from china so there s still been some issues on what the tariffs are going to be and not be so as we see the economics of what has driven the growth in some of those renewable spaces looking forward it appears to us that the costs are going to be higher but we haven t seen a desire on ppa as an example of adjusting to that we ve also sort of formed a view that if there s going to be a fast acceleration toward wind solar batteries then we think that the prices are going to be better a little later than they are today and it may be prudent to wait a while before jumping into that space especially if there s 10 year tax credits instead of one year tax credits so much of what was driving a one year deal was we re trying to do something sooner than later it was because tax credits were expiring it sounds like they re going to get extended so to me that takes some of the urgency off and allows for participation at a better entry point than trying to do something sooner compared to later operator thank you our next questions come from the line of arthur calavritinos with anc capital please proceed with your questions arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst thank you very much guys hi it s great to see these numbers in black and white so good for you and good for us joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer thank you arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst question i had joe i m reading all this stuff in india three days worth of supply spain is a disaster england had to turn on a coal plant which is basically going to blow up but they ve realized the wind doesn t blow and all this other stuff and i was wondering if those guys have to they have to take their inventories worldwide they re realizing it now what does that mean i mean for you because you made a statement earlier which caught my attention when you said you d rather keep the coal domestically because you want three year contracts and i get that and at some point i got to think that guys in india you know pick a country are going to be like we re going to play and we re going to do the three year contracts or something like that and i m sure you re probably getting phone calls from those guys so how does this play out because i just got to think your phone is going to be ringing off the hook with guys that are finally saying ok i m not going to do a one year or less than year contract i want to go longer for a certain price because if you run out of electricity in like india i mean the guy running utility is going to get killed right i mean in all these countries i mean i don t think the guys people get what s going on out there so just if you could just expand on that joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so a couple of things we as i mentioned earlier we are having conversation with some export customers that are willing to commit longer term back to your point second arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst is that news is that news to them is that like did they finally acquiesce and ok that s the new paradigm joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer well we yeah this year we actually had a customer that committed for a full year you know normally they re quarter to quarter vessel by vessel is what we participated in so this year we ve had actually two customers that have committed for longer term within a year now we re talking about even longer arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst ok joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer i think when you look at europe one of the you know you re exactly right i mean it s sort of should be a wake up call but what we are seeing is now we ve got oil being replacing natural gas even these guys are trying to scramble around to try to make sure that people have enough gas for the winter so it s i ve never seen anything like this is all i can say and arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst ok what go ahead i m sorry go ahead i m sorry go ahead joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah but we re very focused on trying to take you know full benefit of what the markets give us but you know we feel that our best policy is to really think longer term and short term arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst ok and joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer given the headwind and spacing our coal industry come in politically like i ve mentioned before arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst oh no look i mean i don t know what the industry would have been like if you took the pro forma closures for 23 and you had them this year right joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer correct arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst and then those electrons get substituted by nat gas i mean i m in boston nat gas in maine is like at the terminus there is like 20 bucks right we re at 550 on a cushion and guys still don t get this because they look at gasoline in terms of what energy costs are rather than electricity until it hits which is going to start hitting in about two or three months joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst can you get work i ve talked to guys energy guys and one of the things that has come back from some utility guys well they worry about is the ability you guys being able to get workers an extra shift we start to mine because i m sure there s a lot of guys that even though the pay would be greater probably wouldn t want to go back because they re like i can make more money for a year but then the administration all the talk this coal is going away other than make less money and have more certainty in what i m doing then just go to a coal i mean mine coal for a year just wondering how tough it is you know joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah that s why it s important to get long term contracts so that we can not only talk about it but reinforce it with commitment there s potential that we have some even longer term contracts that we re in conversations with right now but one of the things i may have mentioned this i don t know i ve had so many calls i don t know which call or whether it s last quarter or not but we have one customer that actually came to our coal mines and talked to our men saying we need you we need you for 15 years that s how long at a minimum that s how long our plants are going to run so we appreciate what you do and even though we can t commit for 15 years contractually because of company policy but we re here to tell you that we need you and that was very impactful and so what we ve seen is with the fortunes that have turned and with the price signals that we have and the opportunity to reposition our pay policies without in a way to make it more attractive people had a taste of going to a manufacturing job that is the same thing every day whereas when they come to coal mine it s different every day every day they work they re working in a different place and so we ve had great success we ve hired over 150 people in the last quarter that had left us earlier in a year arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst wow joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer because they see the opportunity over the next several years arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst ok good to hear joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer and as i mentioned we were just able to recruit two shifts in eastern kentucky which is amazing given the fact that we re competing against metallurgical coal guys they re trying to hire the same folks so we ve got great benefits we got great culture we got great people we feel if anybody can hire employees it s us so we feel that i m sure there s other of our competitors who feel the same way but i mean we ve like i said we ve been able to hire that many people just in the last quarter given the strength of these three year contracts that we ve been able to secure during that time so we re yeah at the same time if biden comes out and says pay people more money to stay at home arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst yeah not everybody became a computer coder like you know the two administrations ago said all the coal miners were going to become computer programmers so yeah joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yes arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst yeah let me ask you one other thing you said something to utilities if they mothball a coal plant and to restart it it doesn t happen overnight you made a statement like that earlier on the remarks i mean joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer that was a coal those were coal mines not the util i think one s the brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer coal mines arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst not the on not the ok got it it was the mines joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer not the utilities i think once the coal plant is offline it s very very it s very unlikely that it ll start back up now having said that there is a plant in the uk that they went back and brought out of the brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer out of mothball yeah joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah but it s unlikely that you ll see any coal plant that s been closed brought back into service until the policies change unless the federal arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst and one i m sorry joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer unless by unless the government says we need you like they did in 1970s when we had an energy crisis here arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst do you think last one and i ll take it with you guys offline i got to think there s got to be a price on nat gas electricity eventually that gets people to get off your back and realize what s going on and plus like i think with yuri superstorm the cold storm in the event in texas in houston i mean to me that would have been the wake up call but it seems like we ve forgotten about it as you think as i think about it and you think about it is there like a price where people via electricity bills like i said they haven t been reset yet for the rates they re starting to but they haven t fully and plus we re in a seasonal low that that s the wake up call i mean because i think eventually price drives all regulations joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer you think so yeah yeah when you look at fossil fuels mostly oil and some natural gas what it does and permeates through any and all products this morning i think it was wall street journal had a deal on baby diapers arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst right joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer and showing the increasing cost of baby diapers and traced it back to lumber and oil and that s true with so many products that we use i think that s the one thing that most people in america don t understand is all the byproducts that we use day to day that are derivative oil but back to your question i think it s going to take more than price i think it s going to take blackouts before the politicians start to say wow i didn t know my policies were going to impact people s lives like they did in texas where you had over 50 people die i m afraid that that s what s going to take to get the policymakers and the ceos of banks and the blackrocks of the world arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst yeah i agree with you joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer will realize that the policies we re advocating here and they re going to china and they re investing over there but they won t say a word china s 70 coal fired generation they got more power plants being built today than we have in existence and they say nothing arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst yeah no no i think joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer you think that would wake up america but arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst yeah no yeah you re right unfortunately i agree with you it s going to take like it s going to have to take blackouts like i mean in the boston area like in january or february when it s cold and you know or you shut down electricity and manufacturing plants when i was a kid in the 70s that s i think that s what happened they just shut stuff down you know and even if ferc sent a notice out to the grid operators in this region and they just said you got to store more nat gas and it s like thanks for the warning but people don t get it yet you re going to need a black you re going to need blackouts and in the wintertime you know or something like unfortunately something like that ok joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah unfortunately arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst unfortunately joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer thank you arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst all right thank you very much and i ll be back offline with you guys joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer you bet arthur calavritinos anc capital analyst or i ll call you guys thank you brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you our next questions come from the line of andrew cosgrove with bloomberg please proceed with your questions andrew cosgrove bloomberg intelligence analyst hey gentlemen thanks for taking my questions just one if you could just give us an idea on where current iob prices are today and then i guess along the same lines would be assuming you know if you could expand if it s like the new kind of range for gas obviously hot month is five but if we were to settle somewhere closer to 350 what do you think the right price for iob coal is in that environment joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think most of the publications you see out there are showing prices in the 80 to 90 range for illinois basin pricing today i think that anything above 4 can support prices that high if you re just looking at coal versus gas competition at the same time if you start thinking about coal on coal it would drop the price down to some other price level which we just don t see happening in 2022 it may happen toward the end of the year it may not i just feel like that you know it s really difficult to bring on enough volume to meet the demand i mean as i said in my prepared remarks if there had been enough coal supply you know we would have seen more coal consumed in the fourth quarter than what we re going to see and so right now as far as trying to get coal now they can get powder river basin in the market easier and you can the underground mines in the east and then you re also facing the competition of the export market like an earlier caller talked about that there are some folks that are looking more to just sell on the export market in the short term but i can t give you an exact price on the 350 we don t see it going to 350 it s possible it could but we will be definitely booked up in 2022 before that happens andrew cosgrove bloomberg intelligence analyst all right ok i mean i think the caller as far as what you just said with anything over 4 supporting somewhere near spot is pretty telling in and of itself so i appreciate that i guess the other one would be if you could maybe expand on you know any inflation on the rail side or the bar side and maybe if you could just refresh my memory as far as how you guys move coal down to the gulf coast and then anything as far as what that cost today versus where it was and where it might be going because i know on the net side for rail specifically i guess the rules prior to what s coming up next year was around 20 bucks a ton and obviously i know we re talking about different geographies but that s going to double next year so i was just curious you know what that looks like in you guys neck of the woods joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer i think on the transportation side i don t consider it really inflation as a cost push to their pricing andrew cosgrove bloomberg intelligence analyst right joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer i think it s more just it s all really supply and demand as the who can pay the who s going to pay what price and what movement brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer and we will commit joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so on the domestic side on the rail side that s usually determined by our customers and then they usually have long term contract they have pricing associated with that so when we think about pricing for domestic shipments in large part the customers are able to maintain those prices that may be back to your inflationary type levels then when you get into the spot market it s just based on total supply and demand at the time you are shipping and earlier right now last six 60 days both rail and large shipment pricing was up quite a bit to get their fair share as they would say of the economic grant of the higher prices but going forward you know i think that we factored all those in as to how we look at what our cash flows would be and you know we re going to have a very strong 2022 unless the bottom falls out of the economy andrew cosgrove bloomberg intelligence analyst ok and then just the last one would just be around can you just remind me where the bookings were for 2023 before 3q so where you exit 2q at in 2023 and i think you said you re at 15 8 million tons right now joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer all right brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah give me just a second joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer brian is looking that up if you got another question or if anybody else has one andrew cosgrove bloomberg intelligence analyst yeah i guess the other one i think you kind of answered before but the willingness from utilities is going to keep more coal on the ground from an inventory standpoint i guess you guys kind of said that they re just really just trying to focus on what they ve contract out so far and what they re just focusing on those deliveries versus building up so much strategic stockpiles right joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer right yeah that s what i think brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah and since the second quarter we ve booked about 8 2 million tons into 2023 andrew cosgrove bloomberg intelligence analyst ok all right that s all i had and thank you gentlemen i really appreciate it and good luck for the rest of the year joe craft chairman president and chief executive officer thank you brian cantrell senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to brian cantrell for any

i want to start by addressing the recent pullback in and prices as well as shares of crypto miners since bitcoin hit a new record high last week it s important for investors to remember that the crypto ecosystem remains and is expected to remain highly volatile whereas gold bullion and the s p 500 have a standard deviation of 1 over a single trading day bitcoin has one closer to 4 ether s is even higher at 6 and hive blockchain technologies nasdaq can easily go up or down 8 during any given trading session needless to say the crypto ecosystem is high risk and potentially high reward and it s essential that investors who are thinking of participating manage their expectations there s much more to cover from last week below are five bitcoin developments you need to know the first bitcoin etf was also the fastest to 1 billion in assets many of you reading this may be aware that wall street finally got a bitcoin linked etf the proshares bitcoin strategy etf nyse which tracks the performance of bitcoin futures contracts was first out of the gate last monday mere days after the securities and exchange commission said it would no longer block the issuance of investment products related to the digital asset but that s not the only record bito now holds the etf attracted more than 1 billion in as little as two days after its debut making it the fastest ever to reach that milestone the previous record holder appropriately enough was state street s spdr gold shares etf nyse launched in 2004 it took the popular gold backed etf three days to reach 1 billion in assets bito may be the first but it will hardly be the last a second bitcoin futures fund the actively managed valkyrie bitcoin strategy etf nasdaq btf became available for trading on friday having said that not everyone is jumping to buy a bitcoin futures contract of the nearly 700 people who took a recent hive poll more than three quarters said they were either probably or absolutely not interested in an etf that tracks the futures market presumably they are holding out for a bitcoin spot etf or they would prefer to own the crypto outright 2 bitcoin s all time high price has reignited speculations of 100 000 the price of bitcoin topped 66 000 for the first time ever last wednesday pushing its market cap above an incredible 1 3 trillion the surge was driven largely by the debut of bito as well as the undeniable power of fomo or fear of missing out this has reawakened speculation that the crypto is headed for 100 000 perhaps as early as year s end take a look at the logarithmic chart below each horizontal line represents a growth factor of 10 arithmetically there are a lot of numbers in between 66 000 and 100 000 but geometrically it s a hop and a skip 3 a public u s pension fund bought bitcoin and ether bito wasn t the only love bitcoin got from institutional investors last week for the first time ever a u s pension fund has invested in the space on thursday the 5 5 billion houston firefighters relief and retirement fund hfrrf announced that it had purchased 25 million in bitcoin and ether representing a watershed moment for bitcoin and its place in public pensions according to nate conrad global head of asset management at new york digital investment group nydig which facilitated the purchase fiduciaries are increasingly aware of how even a small allocation to digital assets can make a big impact over time conrad said like bito this allocation may be the first of its kind but i don t believe it will be the last imagine what would happen to bitcoin and ether s price if the approximately 440 billion california public employees retirement system calpers the largest such fund in the u s got involved 4 walmart now has bitcoin atms with plans for thousands more bitcoin s been called lots of things over the years it s worse than tulips it s a bubble warren buffett described it as rat poison squared more recently jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon said it s worthless well now nearly anyone will be able to convert their loose change into worthless bitcoin at their neighborhood walmart nyse last week it was being reported that walmart quietly began installing special coinstar machines at select locations that give customers the option to buy bitcoin some 200 kiosks are currently available at the giant retailer but according to bloomberg there are plans to install as many as 8 000 of them over time 5 the global bitcoin network uses less energy than holiday lights on a final note the bitcoin mining council bmc released its quarterly report last week and it contained much to celebrate about bitcoin if you recall this group came together during the summer in response to elon musk s claims that bitcoin mining consumed too much energy and too much dirty energy the council s findings on the other hand tell a very different story according to the group which is headed by microstrategy ceo michael saylor and of which hive is a member bitcoin mining uses a negligible amount of energy globally when stacked against any major country and even any major industry gold mining included in fact you may be surprised to learn that bitcoin mining uses even less energy than holiday lights do every year and contrary to musk s claims the network uses a more sustainable energy mix than any major country on earth germany leads this list at nearly half renewable whereas the global bitcoin mining network is estimated to be 57 7 the figure rises to almost 66 for the members of the bmc and then there s hive which uses 100 green renewable energy to mine bitcoin

when facing high demands from family life working single mothers who have a present time mindset in contrast to the tendency to focus on the past or future may feel more in control of their leisure time according to a new study headed by virginia tech researchers in turn these feelings of control over time away from work may support these single mothers in fitting healthy habits such as exercise into their busy schedules the effect of control on exercise time was unique in that this perceived control did not affect consumption of unhealthy food or excess alcohol the researchers wrote exercise of course has been linked to better long term physical and mental health in scores of studies the national science foundation supported study was recently published in applied psychology health and well being a publication of the international association of applied psychology spearheading the study was charles calderwood an assistant professor in the department of psychology part of the virginia tech college of science although evening family demands can present a barrier to leisure time exercise for working sole mothers this health impairing relationship is not inevitable calderwood said instead focusing more on the present living in the moment helps these working parents feel that they have greater control over their time even in the face of elevated family demands in turn they can harness this control to support their engagement in exercise from day to day working with calderwood were molly minnen a graduate student in psychology and researchers from rice university and georgia institute of technology the team followed 102 single working mothers during a seven day period the study focused on how the mindset of these women while balancing work and family tasks impacted their pursuit of healthy behaviors during their downtime unsurprisingly the researchers found that a working mom s evening family demands make exercise less likely yet it was specifically one s sense of control over how to spend their evening that was diminished by high family demands and that made all the difference in whether they made time for themselves and their health amid hectic schedules and individuals who typically focused on living in the moment saw a reduced impact of evening family demands on the perceptions of control central to exercising present focused mothers who chose to prioritize their health weren t necessarily more or less busy than mothers who did not exercise as much said danielle king an assistant professor of psychological science at rice and one of the study s co authors a key difference was mothers feeling more in control of their choices and capable of choosing to prioritize their needs what comes next for this study calderwood posits the design of interventions that can improve health behavior engagement for working sole mothers and other individuals facing elevated family demands such as individuals caring for a dependent adult relative secondly calderwood said it is possible that other healthy behaviors such as increasing hours of sleep could be enhanced through a similar process to what was observed for exercise in the current study numerous past and current studies on working single mothers have tended to focus on demonstrating the potential for occupational health disparities such as lower levels of occupational health relative to partnered parents with less focus on the day to day lived experiences and health behaviors of members of this population a looming question that remains is whether similar processes would apply in other populations that face elevated family demands such as working single fathers although there have been studies to compare the experiences of working sole mothers and working sole fathers to my knowledge there has not yet been an investigation of the process through which family demands influence recovery experiences or health behaviors from day to day in working sole fathers calderwood added we chose to focus our initial investigation of these processes on working sole mothers because the occupational health disparities they face may be particularly acute relative to a number of other comparison groups in the broader workforce minnen the graduate student working in calderwood s work stress and recovery lab focused part of her efforts on theoretical model building for the study her hope for the study s impact i hope this study helps bring unique populations that may be left out by traditional sampling strategies into the spotlight for work and well being research minnen said hopefully the community of work and well being researchers will continue to consider the unique characteristics of life as a single mother and work towards tangible recommendations and solutions to improve their well being amy mccaig of rice university contributed to this report

annualized growth rate of 9 1 the increase in loans for the third quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by increases of 73 8 million or 11 2 annualized in commercial loans excluding ppp loans 220 4 million or 11 6 annualized in commercial real estate loans 23 7 million or 14 3 annualized in real estate construction loans and 41 1 million or 4 annualized in residential mortgage loans our fourth

of ppp loans were forgiven as of september 30 2021 our deferred ppp loan fees were 3 8 million we continue to monitor our commercial real estate loans turning to slide 7 of our earnings presentation

provision for credit losses of 3 1 million reflected net charge offs of 2 3 million in provisions for the loan growth during the third quarter we expect the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter as a result of the expected loan growth in the fourth quarter turning to slide 12 total average deposits increased by 517 2 million or 12 6 annualized during the third quarter of 2021 we were especially pleased by the 233 million increase or 25 6 annualized in average demand deposits during the third quarter compared to the second quarter average time deposit decreased by 152 6 million or 10 1 annualized due mainly to the run off of broker cds we repurchased 942 613 shares of our stock at an average cost of 39 40 totaling 37 1 million in the third quarter of 2021 there is 98 6 million remaining under our september 2021 125 million stock buyback program we continue to work on the integration and conversion plan for our purchase of the 10 branches in select west coast loans and

the third quarter 2021 financial results in more detail heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you chang and good afternoon everyone for the third quarter of 2021 net income decreased by 4 8 million or 6 2 to 72 4 million compared to second quarter of 2021 the decrease was primarily attributable to a provision for credit losses of 3 million in the third quarter as compared to 9 million reversal of provision for credit losses in the second quarter our net interest margin was 3 22 in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 3 24 in the second quarter of 2021 in the third quarter of 2021 interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 4 basis points to the net interest margin as compared to 3 basis points for the second quarter of 2021 there were 3 1 billion of loans at the floor rate as of september 30 2021 approximately 1 4 billion of our cds mature during the fourth quarter 2021 with a average rate of 0 68 we are targeting renewing retail cds in the 40 to 50 basis point range given the results of the third quarter of 2021 we continue to expect our net interest margin for 2021 to be between 3 2 to 3 3 non interest income during the third quarter of 2021 decreased by 360 000 to 12 2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to a one time boli income of 1 2 million in the second quarter non interest expense increased by 2 5 million or 3 6 to 72 2 million in the third quarter of 2021 when compared to 69 7 million in the second quarter of 2021 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 1 7 million in amortization in low income housing and solar tax credit funds including a 3 2 million catch up adjustment for 2020 low income housing losses resulting from the receipt of 2020 tier 1s and an increase of 0 7 million in salary and employee benefits mainly from higher bonus accruals the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 19 1 as compared to 22 7 for the second quarter of 2021 the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from a 1 7 million catch up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2021 for 2020 solar tax credits for higher 2020 solar tax credits resulting from the receipt of 2020 tail wins we expect the full year 2021 effective tax rate to be between 21 5 and 22 solar tax credit amortization was 1 4 million in third quarter of 2021 and is expected to be 1 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 as of september 30 2021 our tier 1 leverage capital ratio decreased to 10 67 as compared to 10 35 as of june 30 2021 our tier 1 risk based capital ratio decreased to 13 29 from 13 77 as of september 30 2021 and our total risk based capital ratio decreased to 14 93 from 15 47 as of june 30 2021 georgia lo assistant secretary and investor relations thank you heng we will now proceed to the question and answer portion of the call questions and answers operator for our first question we have brandon king from truist securities brandon your line is open brandon king truist securities analyst hey good afternoon chang m liu president and chief executive officer hi brandon brandon king truist securities analyst hey so loan growth was pretty strong in the quarter kind of ahead of guidance of 3 to 5 how do you think that will shake out going into 2022 when do you think you re kind of on a sustainable trajectory when it comes on loan growth especially on the commercial side chang m liu president and chief executive officer so far we re looking at fourth quarter pipelines and fourth quarter pipelines are pretty strong so i think we re kind of staying on our sort of the target growth range in the 5 range for 2021 as far as 2022 i think it really comes down to a lot has to do with sort of the economic recovery some of the shipping and freight delay costs and what s going on at the ports i think our commercial growth c i growth on the third quarter was pretty strong at 73 million range we re in talking to some of our clients we believe that 2022 will hopefully show a strong growth as well but not completely certain where some of that growth will come from and in which segment whether that s c i side or the commercial real estate side heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah well brandon we ll give formal guidance in january when we report the fourth quarter earnings but i want to also add that we think in 2022 the residential mortgage loan portfolio will start to increase faster because with higher interest rates we think the prepayments on that portfolio will be much lower so it will have a higher growth rate in 2022 but once again we ll update in january brandon king truist securities analyst okay thanks for that and then on the liabilities side with deposit repricing could you tell us or give us an update on running off those broker deposits and what do you expect from the ceding pricing picture in 4q and potentially early 1q 22 heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we have probably 200 million of wholesale deposits that we will be running off in the fourth quarter of that 100 million will be fairly late it will be in late december so we won t see the full quarter effect and in q1 2022 we ll probably have another 150 million of brokerage cd run off but as we get into 2022 if our loan growth resumes to be stronger than it has been in 2021 we may even start to have to renew some brokered cds and then lastly as interest rates are increasing we are buying more securities given that the yields are more attractive so i know those are some of the background on how we re thinking there brandon king truist securities analyst okay and for those broker deposits if you do renew those what would be the delta in the cost based on what they are today and what you will renew heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i m telling you this from memory i think that probably about 50 basis points and then we have a brokered money market deposit that s only 1 basis point i talked about that in the past so that s going to mature in december brandon king truist securities analyst okay thanks for answering all my questions heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah thank you operator for our next question we have david chiaverini from wedbush securities david your line is open david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst thanks for taking the questions the first one is on deposit growth how are you guys thinking about deposit flows here it s been pretty decent chang m liu president and chief executive officer for us we re seeing accumulation of deposit balances from our customers we re also kind of making a shift away from cds and focusing more on business operating accounts as much as we can some of that cd balances may have transitioned over to money market balances as we ve seen that in our quarter over quarter results but for the most part we re driving toward lower cost of deposits and lower cost of funds david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst great thanks for that and you mentioned about roughly 100 million remaining on your buyback authorization i was curious about your appetite for additional purchases from here heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i think we ll still be in the market compared to our peers our price to tangible book is somewhat lower and our capital levels are pretty strong so we ll we won t be in the market but at some point we may taper back on that depending on the stock price david chiaverini wedbush securities analyst yes that makes sense thanks very much chang m liu president and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator for our next question we have chris mcgratty from kbw chris your line is open chris mcgratty kbw analyst hey good afternoon heng i was wondering if you could repeat the numbers for the branches i think you said 1 billion of deposits 850 million of loans i m wondering associated expenses from that transaction and also just kind of help with the expense guide on your transaction heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer chris i think this we said it the hsbc deals got 2 accretive in terms of expenses it s roughly slightly over 10 million and the revenues are the low 20 million but we re waiting to get all of this information is as of march 2021 and we re waiting for hsbc to give us updated balances and then when we announced in january we ll probably we ll update that chris mcgratty kbw analyst okay so those are annual numbers the 10 million and 20 million ok heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah and then for your modelling there is going to be one time expenses maybe in 3 8 million i don t know how finally you do there as probably 2 million to 3 million and then we have the day one cecl charge for those acquired loans you might want to use 50 basis points on quite loan balance it is ultimately we still think it s going to be 2 accretive chris mcgratty kbw analyst okay that s great and then maybe if i could my follow up the little bit of tax on the solar and low income i think you said 1 5 million for the solar what was the low income that we should be modeling for next quarter heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer probably 7 million yeah in q3 we had this catch up adjustment as i mentioned of 3 2 million but in q4 it s going to be 7 million chris mcgratty kbw analyst great thank you heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah thank you operator for our next question we have gerry tenner from d a davidson jerry your line is open gerry tenner d a davidson analyst hi good afternoon just wanted to actually clarify on the catch up adjustment you said it was 3 2 million or i thought i heard 2 2 million and then what was the associated tax impact on that catch up adjustment heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer can you repeat the question jerry are you talking about the low income housing gerry tenner d a davidson analyst yeah the catch up adjustment on the amortization i had written down 2 2 million was it 3 2 million or 2 2 million heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer it was 3 2 million on the low income housing gerry tenner d a davidson analyst okay and then the associated tax impact because of the catch up heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer there was none gerry tenner d a davidson analyst there was none okay heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer and we have a 1 6 million tax benefit from the solar catch up gerry tenner d a davidson analyst okay okay great and then just follow up in terms of the core loan yields by my math down about 12 basis points to 4 or 4 01 simply just the kind of pull down effect of new production yields being below portfolio yields i think you d highlighted the prepayment benefit which is really unchanged versus last quarter heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we you want to cover that chang m liu president and chief executive officer you re asking about the origination yields versus the portfolio yields heng w chen executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah chang m liu president and chief executive officer gerry gerry tenner d a davidson analyst yeah effectively yes chang m liu president and chief executive officer yeah so for the residential mortgage originations third quarter we re probably around 3 82 compared to the weighted average portfolio of about 4 03 on the commercial real estate q3 origination we re at about 3 57 compared to the weighted average portfolio at about 4 23 and on the new c i loans our current originations are close to 5 versus the weighted q3 portfolio you had about 3 61 gerry tenner d a davidson analyst great thank you chang m liu president and chief executive officer of course operator at this time there are no questions in the queue thank you for your participation i will now turn back the call over to cathay general bancorp s management for closing remarks chang m

executive officer thanks bruce good morning and thank you for joining us my name is matt hulett i m the new ceo petmed i m incredibly honored and enthusiastic to join this iconic company and i m excited to be on this earnings call today i would like to begin by thanking bruce rosenbloom for acting as interim chief executive officer prior to my arrival before we update you on our progress in q2 i would like to first share my personal thoughts and motivations regarding why i m so optimistic about petmeds in our future first i d like to introduce you to my dog harry who was featured on this slide he is the latest addition to our family and he is also a puppy in fact harry s is the first thought to my family our family had no idea what we are getting ourselves into it s like having a new newborn again and as many of you fellow pet parents now parties can be challenging we also can t imagine not having harry in our lives and we think of him as a member of our family personally it is fulfilling to be involved in an organization where you can spend your time and energy on a business that has positive social impacts on society while you re focused on generating returns for shareholders now that we ve established my personal connection to the business i d like to spend some time walking through the rationale as to why i believe petmeds is a great long term investment having a large addressable market is important it enables us more optionality for new brands and products to be developed it provides more opportunity to develop a myriad of go to market strategies target at different cohorts of customer segments this also means that there is room for more market participants and for those market participants to co exist and flourish the pet industry s total addressable market is very large and it is growing currently it is over 100 billion and the service addressable pet medication market where we participated today is approximately 10 billion we are one of the leading pet pharmacies today and as such i see a future where we can extend our already sizable customer reach combined with our widely respected and known brand into additional segments of the total pet care market as our future vision comes fully into focus in addition to the benefits of participating in a large market the market timing is also considerably favorable pet ownership has always been high in the united states but we have seen an increase in pet ownership especially due to the macro effects of covid 19 pet ownership has surged to record heights and now 7 out of 10 us households own a pet those new and existing pet parents will need more pet medications and other related healthcare services for their pet family members as we have seen in other digital e commerce verticals the adoption curve of the digitization of retail is a favorable tailwind this pull forward of digital based retail experiences has now given customers a taste of the future and has created new buying habits of purchasing more products and services online today our addressable market is largely dominated by offline sales and we see the trend to purchase online is clearly very favorable to us pet parents see their pets as an extension of their own family and they are increasingly demanding more healthy pet care options for their furry friends we see this as a positive trend for petmeds and an opportunity for example we have increased the number of products that we carry and have started to include specialty dog food and higher end wellness products which we believe have contributed to the increase in our average customer order value lastly just like we ve seen in the human healthcare market covid 19 accelerated the increasing trend for the digitization of healthcare in fact in the pet market for the first time regulations related to in person veterinary visits and prescription fulfillment were temporarily waived and moved online in unprecedented ways we think this opens the door to the acceleration of digital based telehealth services as i look at the business there are several key competitive advantages that we can leverage in the future first our brand is widely known and trusted having a strong brand takes years to develop and our customers look to petmeds as their trusted pharmacy and as their pet medication experts second we have strong operational and quality efficiency as a pharmacy our customer care integration with our pharmacy is world class which ensures that customers get their products delivered quickly but also accurately and our vet partners receive high quality fulfillment and service delivered through our vet platform our deep experience with the vet community is a latent competitive advantage we currently have one of the largest direct to consumer vet networks in the online retail space petmeds has a large network of over 70 000 veterinarians that we have worked with over the company s history our online vet portal currently has 17 000 veterinarians and vet clinics this is a core capability and asset because it enables us to expand our fulfillment capability as we scale our business our prescription medication authorization rates are the highest they have ever been which speaks volumes the level of veterinary and cooperation we receive our pet pharmaceutical category expertise is something that i view as a unique strength being a differentiated provider allows petmeds to focus our offering especially if the market continues to get even more competitive again more to come on where we see our brand and business growing in the coming months petmeds has long enjoyed close bonds with many of our supplier partners those relationships have developed over time to become even more strategic today we have direct relationships with all of our major suppliers and we partner with them to market their products to our customer base our customer service and overall customer centricity ethos permeates our culture and our team i personally sat in on hours of phone calls between our customers and our service agents and i ve never experienced such a tightly integrated and empathetic customer centric organization in my entire career we don t just have a transactional interaction with our customers we have built trusted relationships before we comment on our earnings performance i would like to reiterate several compelling reasons to invest and to continue to invest in petmeds petmeds has several core fundamentals that are compelling including a strong balance sheet we do not have debt we have over 100 million in cash and we are cash flow positive we have a long history of providing shareholder returns throughout a dividend and a strong return on equity that has been historically over 30 we have started to build a recurring subscription base to our customers with a program which we just recently launched in july of this year through our new autoship save program where we are building higher lifetime value and recurring relationships with our customers in september approximately 20 of our customers signed up in order via our autoship save subscription program and that number continues to rise our customers responded very positively and enrollment in autoship save has increased steadily throughout the quarter we expect many of our reorder sales to eventually transition to autoship save by the end of our fiscal year which will only continue to strengthen our relationship with our customers we also continue to have a large a base of returning customers which is an indication of the quality of service and the value that we deliver to our customers so to sum up the core company s strengths we have over 25 years of experience as a pure play pet pharmacy fully licensed in 50 states delivering fantastic service and value which is recognized by our customers and continues to be rewarded with their loyalty our nps score is over 80 which puts us in the upper quartile along with some of the most beloved brands in the world we are a direct to consumer brand with a rapidly growing addressable market and we have successfully serviced more than 2 million active customers over the last two years now i would like to have bruce rosenbloom our chief financial officer to review our financials for the quarter bruce s rosenbloom chief financial officer thanks matt now we ll review the financial results we will compare our second fiscal quarter ended on september 30 2021 to last year s quarter ended on september 30 2020 and in some cases we ll refer back to september 30 2019 similar to the quarter ended june 30 2021 we faced a unique situation comparing two totally different environments between 2020 pandemic and 2021 post pandemic we were coming off a strong september quarter last year which was primarily driven by increased e commerce demand as a result of the pandemic which caused many retail stores to close and many veterinarians to be unavailable however during the most recent quarter while the pandemic was abating and retail stores and veterinarians were open for business the advertising market continue to surge with increased demand dramatically driving up cpc and cpm rates by more than 30 as a result we spent approximately 33 less in advertising due to these cost increases for the second fiscal quarter ended on september 30 2021 sales were 67 4 million compared to sales of 75 4 million for the same period the prior year a decrease of 10 7 but sales were only down 3 6 versus the quarter ended september 30 2019 prior to the pandemic the decrease in sales was due to decreases in both new order and reorder sales our sales were negatively impacted by a much more competitive market and credit advertising space with substantially higher costs compared to the same quarter last year in addition during the past six months there was a dramatic increase in veterinary visits by both pet owners who were unable to visit their veterinarian during the pandemic we believe the increase in veterinary visits was primarily due to pet owners needing to visit their veterinarians for their pet exams and to renew their prescriptions since some pet owners purchase medications directly from their vets during the visit the company believes that has negatively impacted sales and especially reorder sales during the quarter we were disappointed with our sales results during the quarter however sales were trending more positive in the month of august and september 2021 when you compare them to august and september 2019 reorder sales decreased by 8 5 to 62 million for the quarter compared to reorder sales of 67 8 million for the same quarter last year while for the quarter ended september 30 2019 our reorder sales were 61 9 million encouragingly reorder sales in the most recent quarter was down versus a year ago were up slightly compared to 2019 pre pandemic we would expect to see stronger reorder sales in the back half of fiscal 2022 as we anticipate more prescriptions being renewed a positive trend to highlight for the quarter was the continued increase in our average order size our average order value was approximately 92 for the quarter compared to 87 for the same quarter last year and 85 for the quarter ended september 30 2019 the increase in aov can be attributed to a shift in our product mix to more prescription items and less over the counter items with prescription items having a higher gross margin profile in comparison to over the counter items as i mentioned earlier during the quarter ended september 30 2021 the advertising market was extremely competitive and this increased demand drove our bad prices dramatically as a result our advertising spending was less efficient than usual and delivered fewer impressions than in prior years because of this we believe our advertising spending was less effective in the most recent quarter and its ability to attract new customers new order sales decreased by 30 to 5 4 million for the quarter compared to 37 7 million for the same quarter of the prior year we acquired approximately 65 000 new customers in our second fiscal quarter compared to 96 000 for the same period the prior year however we anticipate that advertising prices should revert back to more normal levels as the pandemic further subsidies which should help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our media spending and thereby continue to help us gain more new customers in the future we are also in the process of reevaluating many of our current marketing relationships which has resulted in changing some of our marketing partners with the expectation of improved marketing efficiency and results for the second fiscal quarter net income was 6 3 million or 0 31 diluted per share compared to 8 4 million or 0 42 diluted per share for the same quarter last year a decrease to net income of 25 for the second fiscal quarter our gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28 5 compared to 30 5 for the same period a year ago the percentage decrease for the quarter can be attributed to some of the major manufacturers shifting their funding from discounting product costs to cooperative marketing rebates there may be an opportunity to improve gross margins in the second half of fiscal year 2022 if the shift to prescription medications continue we had 106 6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 90 7 million in inventory with no debt as of september 30 2021 the board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 0 30 per share on the company s common stock the dividend will be payable on november 19 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on november 8 2021 the company continues to be committed to returning capital to our stockholders however the declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the board of directors each quarter following its review of the company s financial performance this ends the financial review operator we are now ready to take questions questions and answers operator we will be conducting a question and answer session and our first question is from anthony lebiedzinski from sidoti please proceed with your questions anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst yes good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions so welcome matt welcome back bruce so as far as new order sales i mean obviously you guys did have certainly felt the impact of the advertising market being lower but kind of what gives you confidence that things will bounce back in the back half of the fiscal year just curious as to what s driving that ad maybe perhaps are you seeing some good results better results so far in the current quarter just wondering about your confidence level about your ability to bounce back with the new order sales matt hulett president and chief executive officer anthony this is matt and thanks for the question great to hear from you again and then bruce feel free to chime in a couple of things about that one is i would say that we re taking a small bites too fast approach to looking at our new customer acquisition we basically have rewired our entire marketing partnerships and agencies in the last i would say i ve been here two months so we ve done that in the last four weeks and now we ll be rolling out very soon so we re looking at our capital allocation spend to where we spend i think we ve been spending too aggressively in some channels where we haven t seen the return and we haven t been taking advantage of new sources of traffic where we actually think we have a lot of advantage that s one two is we re spending a lot more time rewiring our system and databases around tracking our customers better and really focusing on reengagement and for rates in general we are seeing some changes to the rates out there i think some of the channels like facebook have obviously got more expensive due to the loss of first party data due to the apple s idfa decisions so those are some channels that obviously i think are just still getting hotter in terms of increased cpms and cpcs but in others we re seeing favorable trends so it depends on the channel but for us we re really looking at each channel and seeing how we get the incrementality of each channel which is different than what we did in the past anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst okay got it okay and then in terms of your gross margins now you did mention that you have been shipping more items like specialty dog which obviously is much heavier than typical pet medications so as we look to refine our models here like how should we think about as you on the one hand it sounds like you re doing a good job of increasing your aov but how is the margin gross margin impact going to be because of that bruce s rosenbloom chief financial officer yeah anthony i m going to take that question if you don t mind as far as our margins for the past quarter we have as we may be spoken offline before but our vendors shifted funding to our co op marketing in lieu of discounting products and this negatively impacted our gross margins during the quarter and it will probably be like that going forward where instead of getting price discounts off the price of the items or the inventory these rebates and these promotions are going to be below the line as they are in the advertising line item so as far as moving forward with gross margins you ll see that that s an overriding factor but however as we ve also seen our shift moving back to more prescription than otc we do expect a positive trend of margins moving forward because of that going back to some semblance of normalcy pandemic versus post pandemic when it comes to our mix shift of items anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst okay got it and then in terms of the capital allocation just curious to get your thoughts matt as far as looking at pets for years the company has been a company with a lot of cash and growing the dividend and sort of maintaining a very healthy cash position just wanted to get your thoughts about that how should think about that especially the dividend what are your thoughts there matt hulett president and chief executive officer yeah i think there are several things to unpack there it s a great question and i ve been a long listener of pets earnings calls as well so i ll try to give a slightly different answer i would say with the dividend we re always looking at that and it s always subject to change but we ve been pretty consistent with the dividend and nothing to announce here obviously but to your cash question with over 100 million in cash with interest rates being so low there i think there s a lot of opportunities in this space to deploy cash and allocate capital more efficiently to get higher returns there is also a lot of businesses in the pet ecosystem that fortunately in this market different than other verticals there s a lot of ways to partner a lot of ways to look at m a as well so we re certainly going to be looking at those in the future since we do have such a large cash position and lastly it s a little early for me to articulate the strategy i ve been around for two months i think the first four weeks felt like six months because there was a lot to do and learn and now i m kind of selling in and feeling better about things but yeah i think there s a lot of opportunity to deploy capital differently especially given the tailwinds in pet ownership so that s kind of a non answer answer anthony other than i think we re taking a fresher look at that and i would expect that we will make some decisions in the coming quarters that we ll obviously update everyone on anthony lebiedzinski sidoti analyst got it okay well thanks and best of luck going forward matt hulett president and chief executive officer thanks anthony operator and our next question is from steph wissink with jefferies please proceed with your questions steph wissink jefferies analyst hi everybody thanks for taking our questions and the first is i wanted to just go back to some of the comments in your prepared remarks around vet visits and i think i head you correctly that there is an inverse correlation meaning when vet visits go up you tend to see vets sell prescription and otc directly and so your business feels that impact is that the right way to think about it or is there a net second derivative wherein follow up to those primary prescriptions you ll start to see some of the secondary prescription refills in your business bruce s rosenbloom chief financial officer hi steph this is bruce now let me address that question really the vet visits inform there really to try to give an understanding of what we were seeing last year versus this year last year during the pandemic virtually all the vet offices were closed and there really wasn t many alternatives where our pet owners can turn to for medications and many were trying online pet medications for the first time and so that was definitely something that we welcomed last year this year all those clinics were open for business and they re making up for lost time so they re making sure if they haven t seen that pet in a 12 month period they re enforcing and making sure that pet owner is coming into their clinic so it s almost a resetting of the prescription cycle and many of the pet owners are going to vet buying there and then we re in line for the refill and we can sort of through our data we know when it s time for a reorder and we ll go ahead and market for that reorder subsequent reorder and we expect to see that in the second half of this fiscal year is what i was referring to earlier in the call steph wissink jefferies analyst okay got it and then my second question is on ad spend i think you mentioned both that you expect advertising prices to revert i m curious if you could just give us a sense of do you expect them to go back to pre pandemic levels on a purchasing price basis or do you still expect there to be a bit of inflation post pandemic and related to that i think you also used the word words less efficient can you maybe talk a little bit about what you re doing to tweak your marketing mix or your marketing plans out over the next couple of quarters to try to improve some of the efficiency even if the costs remain a little bit elevated matt hulett president and chief executive officer yeah and i ll take your second question first a couple of things i would say overall the way in which we ve been purchasing media is going to change significantly we re looking at new and have actually implemented new marketing partners to help us with that that specialize in specific areas of media i won t get into the channels themselves but obviously google facebook connected tv there is a lot of options out there and i think the way we ve configured media spend to date needed a fresh pair of eyes so that s one two is just adding more data around the decisions that we re making around our media buys with another i would say quick win that we ve implemented and then lastly to your first question media rates have been dancing around quite a bit i was in the language learning space prior to this with rosetta stone and we took advantage of favorable rate during the pandemic because advertisers were leaving things like brand advertising to performance i would say going into the holiday season it s too early to tell since it s a very competitive time to be buying advertising but i would say that i m a little bit more optimistic about rates than i was when i started two months ago steph wissink jefferies analyst okay that s great thank you for the help matt hulett president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from ben rose with battle road research please proceed with your question ben rose battle road research analyst yes good afternoon and i know we haven t had a chance to meet matt but i look forward to meeting you post call a couple of questions with regard to pet health advice on your slides matt you talked about the growth in the telehealth market and i was just curious to know what thoughts you have with regard to the ask the vet service that you offer now and whether you envision that being expanded in some way or perhaps being monetized in some way in the future matt hulett president and chief executive officer hey ben and looking forward to catching up in subsequent conversations yeah i m really excited about the pet telehealth space there has been a lot of innovation in this space there is a lot of different start ups that i had talked to personally in the space to get some advice i think the way i d start is i always try to evaluate businesses not only on the tam and the timing and the kind of the fundamentals but also the customer relationships an inordinate amount of our customers are wanting additional services from us they almost they are giving us permission to give them more advice than we are today because prescriptions are in a way the milk of the back of the proverbial store with the customer because they see petmeds as the expert in pet healthcare it just so happens as the customer is leading the store we re not providing a lot of expert experience yet and so i see pet telehealth is us being very well positioned to add additional services that we don t do today because customers really view as that specialty pharmacies they re not viewing it as the mega retailer with lots of different services we re not known for selling food we re not selling known for selling dog toys we re known for providing expert advice and so for pet telehealth while the market is really small i see it as an opportunity to engage with our autoship customers in really unique ways and then sell them additional services so nothing to announce but we re certainly going to be doing a lot of testing even this quarter on this which i hope hopefully be able to talk to you about next time ben rose battle road research analyst okay great and with regard to the company s relationships with the veterinarian community and vet clinics this is the first time that i heard you quantify the number of veterinarians in clinics that you work with and find that to be an intriguing opportunity was curious to know plans that you have to perhaps reduce friction with the veterinarians or to improve relationships with them matt hulett president and chief executive officer yeah ben thanks for noticing that and it was intentional to put that in there because i was quite surprised when i first started the company we have a vet portal that s used today i ve seen other competitors in this space quote numbers and i think still might be surprised that we have a larger network than most i think our relationship with vets has been a little confrontation to be honest over the span of the company when we first started because we are the pioneers in this space i think when we we would go to the veterinary conferences we are probably the least likely to be welcomed and i think now there is other players in this space and we ve kind of opened the door for them and i think we re kind of seen as a more friendly player in this space to be honest our vet verification rates are as high as they ve ever been i think there s a lot of things we could do in our vet portal to make the veterinarians life easy we re very sympathetic to veterinarians they are overworked they have some of the highest suicide rates of any profession and i think that there is a lot we can do to be a better friend of the vet and our vet portal i think has a great start but i think there s a lot of opportunity to automate what they do in their clinics and we re going to be pro vet in terms of how we approach the market our intent is not to be anti vet ben rose battle road research analyst okay thank you very much matt hulett president and chief executive officer thanks ben operator and our questions and answers portion of the call has ended i would now like to turn the call back to matt hulett the company s ceo for his concluding remarks matt hulett president and chief executive officer thank you i want to reiterate what bruce just covered in his financial highlights section we are disappointed with our sales results for the quarter but after my two months on the job i m confident there is much we can do and will do to improve our business growth to be clear in a market that s growing petmeds needs to be make the necessary changes to our operating playbook to take advantage of the market trends in my first weeks here i ve listened in on countless customer service calls engaged with over 20 pet industry leaders brief research analysts and engaged with our own main pharmaceutical partners i ve already seen a lot of core areas that we can and have already begun to improve in this business and these include the following using more data insights to acquire and retain customers better segmentation of our customer base in order to drive more mass personalization of our offers and services improved new customer acquisitions through a different allocation of variable marketing spend expanded product and services that are already being demanded by our customers since i ve only been with petmeds for a short period of time i m not ready on today s call to provide a comprehensive future strategy or capital allocation plan for the business and that would be premature however i do have a 90 day 180 day plan that i presented to our board of directors and i ll be sharing more about our vision and strategy with you during our q3 earnings call but i will say this today we firmly believe that we can take advantage of the large market tailwinds leverage the main core strengths we highlighted today and execute on a broader strategic vision for the company we look forward to briefing you in the coming quarters on our strategy and our progress thank you for listening in operator this ends the

and blueberries love me some blueberries i m making grilled sirloin with spicy blueberries tonight pictured above perfect blueberry pancakes recipe here i always think that chicken piccata is going to be a nice light dish until i reread the recipe and remember it always takes more oil and butter than i think as i go along oh well not every meal has to heart healthy lol chicken piccata bowl skillet combine breadcrumbs basil zest and pepper in bowl mix ½ tbsp oil and garlic together coat both sides of chicken with oil garlic and dredge in breadcrumbs over medium high heat 1 tbsp ea of butter and oil in skillet add chicken and cook 4 5 minutes on each side remove chicken keep warm add lemon slices to pan sauté 30 seconds add water parsley and juice boil for 1 minute spoon over chicken scrub well before slicing from narya her strawberry and chocolate cake this is such a hard time of the cooking year for me the farm share people want to give me onions carrots root veggies and potatoes and spinach but potatoes don t do all that much for me and most of the root veggies are brassicas i love a lot of brassicas kale broccoli and cauliflower in particular but they are offering things like turnips and parsnips and cabbage i have discovered that i cannot eat any brassicas in their raw state and that some of them will fight me even if i cook them first i like purple potatoes and sweet potatoes can be used with a lot of asian spices but again there s only so much i can eat two other things have helped this year i froze a lot of corn that i par boiled then cut off the cob and i roasted a lot of tomatoes and froze those i ve been hoarding them a bit because we still have so much of winter to go for an excess of potatoes i make gnocchi i use the lucky peach recipe archived here i ve used all kinds of potatoes including purple and sweet that means i end up with purple or orange gnocchi i currently have some of the types of potatoes he recommends and i will likely turn them all into gnocchi this weekend here s the important part if you re going to go to the trouble of making gnocchi make a lot of it after you boil them you can spread them out on cooling racks and freeze them don t do this in lumps you have to spread them out then bag and freeze the frozen gnocchi for a later meal thaw them spread out too rather than in a lump i also save the skins and roast them till they re crispy i don t want to throw away anything i can use still brassicas and potatoes and onions and carrots then again dessert makes everything better so let s go there i always get a bunch of frozen fruit from the farm share or the grocery store if need be especially strawberries keeping in mind that i eyeball a lot of things here s my favorite way to use them i start with smitten kitchen s easy chocolate cake link to recipe here and i hack it in the following ways hack number 1 fruit and frosting first take a bunch of frozen strawberries cherries work too and throw them in a saucepan with a little sugar and some lemon rind if you have it cook it down this week i started with well over a pound but i divided the results in two and froze half let it simmer for awhile half an hour on low then scoop out the berries with a slotted spoon and reduce the liquid even further until it s very thick and syrupy get out your mixer and make frosting with some of the cooled fruit syrup confectioner s sugar and a little butter you ll need more sugar than you think especially if you use a fair amount of the syrup why do i make the frosting first because it s easier to make in a mixer than by hand and then i don t have to wash the beater there are no raw ingredients that can hurt you if you make the cake and then the frosting you have to wash between because of the eggs and flour if you don t like this much frosting you can make a simple glaze with the strawberry syrup and some confectioner s sugar strawberry frosting makes everything better powdered dried fruit will also work hack number 2 more fruit mush up the strawberries and add them to the cake if i m ambitious i ll pull out my mini food processor but not always i ll note that it can be hard to taste them in this hack the chocolate is pretty strong so if you are looking to taste the fruit go with hack 2 5 hack number 2 5 fruit filling mush up strawberries and possibly a little of the syrup with cream cheese and use that as a filling for the cake put half the batter in the pan put the strawberry cream cheese mixture in then put the rest of the batter on top this does work better if you puree the fruit a bit use a pastry bag or a plastic bag with a corner cut off rather than trying to spread the mixture you can add an egg or a little cream or milk if you need to make the filling more spreadable but not too much hack number 3 other ingredients go ahead and use two eggs i am not going to use a yolk for this and have a white sitting around for the cocoa i use a combo of king arthur three cocoa blend and a little bit maybe 10 grams of king arthur black cocoa i also added a little baking powder half a teaspoon to make up for a lack of acidity for the baking soda cocoa powder is something i tend to buy in bulk because it s so useful and it lasts so i usually have several varieties sitting around hack number 4 liquid i rarely have buttermilk around i have used sour milk yogurt plus water water milk yogurt plus water plus whatever s left of the strawberries and or syrup you get the idea it can affect the rise of the cake but i guarantee you that for this kind of casual cake a flatter cake that is slathered with strawberry frosting will still make everyone happy i also add good quality chocolate chips sometimes be aware of that when you test for doneness as a chocolate chip might make you think it s not done when it is in addition to chocolate and berries being a classic combo i find that the sweet taste of spring fruit helps mitigate the endless slog of brassicas and potatoes that is the winter farm share

by simon black i arrived home late last night back to puerto rico after a wonderful 2 day event with our total access members this weekend luminaries like ron paul and robert kiyosaki joined me on stage and as you can imagine we spent a lot of time talking about the trends in western civilization inflation social conflict supply chain disruptions etc we also spent a fair bit of time talking about taxes given that lawmakers in the land of the free are presently bickering about whose taxes to raise and by how much some of these tax proposals are downright mystifying for example one proposal forbids individual retirement accounts from making non traditional investments like startups private placements and even certain crypto investments this is completely bizarre when you think about it the politicians who came up with this idea i e comrade bernie sanders love to dump all over wall street yet by taking away the ability for iras to buy private assets bernie would force millions of americans to invest all of their retirement funds with the very same wall street banks that he claims to hate so basically we have a socialist who is engineering more business and more fee income for wall street s biggest banks weird on top of this there are proposals in the legislation that could be considered clinically insane if you take the definition of insanity to be trying the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result the proposal to jack up capital gains tax is an obvious example the united states government has an almost unblemished historical track record here nearly every time they ve raised capital gains tax rates capital gains tax revenue has actually fallen in the late 1960s for example the federal government significantly raised capital gains tax rates yet capital gains tax revenue fell significantly in 1967 before the law passed total capital gains tax revenue was 4 1 billion by 1970 even though tax rates were higher tax revenue had fallen by nearly 25 to just 3 1 billion the same thing happened in the late 1980s capital gains tax rates were increased from 20 to 28 yet actual capital gains tax revenue fell from 52 billion in 1986 down to just 35 billion by 1989 and reached as low as 24 billion by 1991 the real irony here is that the top capital gains tax not including the obamacare surtax is currently 20 and they are proposing to raise this rate to 28 it s literally a repeat of 1987 all over again raising capital gains rates from 20 to 28 the historical outcome is clear capital gains tax revenue fell by more than half and yet these people still think this is a good policy idea they fail to understand a very simple lesson when you change capital gains tax rates investors merely change their behavior duh and there are always plenty of ways to beat increases in the capital gains tax one obvious effect is that tens of thousands of tax refugees will come here to puerto rico where the local government has incredibly generous tax incentives for business owners and investors we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us us citizens who live in puerto rico are subject to 0 tax on qualifying capital gains they pay no puerto rican tax and they are not subject to us federal income tax either another effect is that many investors will simply choose to not sell especially if they re holding bankable assets like real estate cryptocurrency and stocks i e assets that banks will accept as collateral for loans interactive brokers for example will currently make margin loans to its investors secured by the investor s stocks and bonds at rates as low as 0 75 when you can borrow against your assets for just 0 75 why bother selling at all especially when the alternative is paying 28 to hunter biden s dad plenty of people do this already elon musk famously borrows heavily against his tesla stock he doesn t actually sell his stock so there s no capital gains tax and because loans are not considered income he doesn t owe income tax either in effect elon can monetize the gains in his tesla stock without having to pay a penny in tax the real irony of this strategy is that if they really pass a significant capital gains tax increase even though it s a historically bad idea it might drive asset prices even higher i explained this to our audience this weekend if people stop selling their assets because of a tax hike then there will be fewer stocks less real estate less crypto etc available for sale and with a lower supply of investments in the marketplace the people who want to buy those assets will have to pay a higher price so in effect the tax increase could engineer lower tax revenue but more gains for investors totally insane i also told our audience this weekend that politicians would eventually figure this out and as a result they ll pass a wealth tax some day the idea would be to tax people based on the unrealized gains of their assets i e stock real estate crypto etc that you haven t sold it turned out that some day was yesterday by the time i landed last night in puerto rico nancy pelosi had already announced that they would add a billionaire s wealth tax into their new legislation this is how it begins they propose taxes to milk a certain portion of the population and then slowly over time it grows to affect millions upon millions of unintended victims the alternative minimum tax is a great example it was originally passed to tax just a handful of people in 1969 today it hits tens of millions of taxpayers it would be foolish to assume a wealth tax will be any different

don t miss out on the headlines from hitech followed categories will be added to my news tesla s mega deal with hertz has widened the gap between the us car maker and the rest of the industry the order for 100 000 cars is the single biggest order of electric cars to date and could be worth as much as us4 4 billion 5 9b to tesla according to reports the brand whose value recently topped us1 trillion is now more valuable than the next nine biggest carmakers the valuation is remarkable given the fact that tesla makes a fraction of the cars made by its two closest rivals toyota valued at 280b and volkswagen 160b each make an estimated 10 million vehicles each year tesla is on track to build about a tenth of this number after having delivered roughly 250 000 vehicles in the past quarter the tesla model 3 was the best selling car in europe in september a sizeable chunk of tesla s profit comes from the sale of regulatory credits which totalled about 280m in the previous quarter and more than 500m in the first quarter of this year a regulatory credit is handed out to carmakers to help promote the development low or zero emissions vehicles car makers are given the credits by governments for producing a certain amount of zero emissions vehicles each year car makers are required to have a certain amount of regulatory credits each year and if they can t reach their required number they can buy them off other car makers or suffer significant penalties enter tesla which only sells zero emissions vehicles so has an excess of credits which it then sells to other companies boosting its profit at no extra cost to itself it has been reported that stellantis which owns fiat chrysler and jeep brands among others bought more than 2b worth of credits from tesla between 2019 and 2021 tesla s perceived dependence on the sales of these credits to remain profitable has been one of the reasons the company has been heavily shorted as more and more car makers go electric the sales of these credits will dry up car rental company hertz has ordered 100 000 teslas but the company may be in a position shortly where it no longer needs the sales of credits as its production capacity and popularity continue to ramp up it is in the process of building two new massive factories to make cars and batteries in texas and germany the latest european car sales figures prove tesla s growing dominance in september for the first time the tesla model 3 was the best selling car in europe beating the volkswagen golf according to uk publication autocar tesla is now valued at more than one trillion dollars second hand car shoppers are set to benefit too as the price of used teslas should drop when the rental companies renew their fleets in a few years and sell the current stock tesla keeps its sales in australia secret but data revealed by the electric vehicle council in august this year showed the brand s growing popularity down under the report showed aussies bought 7248 electric cars in the first six months of 2021 car sales figures by the federal chamber of automotive industries showed every other car maker sold 2188 electric cars in the same period meaning 5031 teslas found a new home this shows tesla outsells all rivals combined by more than two to one if these figures continue tesla is on track for 10 000 sales this year in australia this would put it above established luxury brands such as lexus and volvo originally published as tesla is worth more than the next nine most valuable car makers

nwe earnings call for the period ending september 30 2021 northwestern corporation nwe 0 47 q3 2021 earnings call 3 30 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer continue to be under recovery of electric supply costs and you see that impact reflected in 106 9 million increase overall year to date in electric supply or overall energy supply costs and you can see the breakout at the bottom between electric and natural gas from a quarter perspective that s about a 20 million continuing trend as we think about it year to date slide 10 the non gaap earnings slide i would point you to a couple of things here again we ve already talked about the impact ongoing of favorable weather and you will see for the quarter 0 05 of favorable weather that we remove that compares to 0 01 of unfavorable weather in the prior quarter the other item i would mention here is again that mark to market of the qf liability adjustment there with 0 02 so when you look at the quarter of 0 68 on a diluted eps basis adjusted to 0 65 on a non gaap basis compared to the prior period of 0 58 of earnings adjusted to 0 59 so that s 0 65 on a non gaap basis compared to 0 59 again driven by margin improvement offset by some higher operating costs slide 11 i would mention that the quarter again was in line with our expectations i ll remind you that in q2 we narrowed in our guidance a bit we had a wider range at the beginning here of 0 20 we narrowed that down to 0 15 and have reaffirmed our guidance for 21 at 3 43 to 3 58 per diluted share and q2 we also discussed that we expect proceeds of 200 million in 21 from our equity offering and that s driven by higher capital but also remind you we had delayed equity from 2020 and in 21 are executing on that we are on track for 450 million of capital in 2021 which is a higher number than we ve been at in prior years so with that expect to stay consistent with our guidance for 2021 and then broadly we re close to eei here in a couple of weeks and with that we re looking forward to discussing with you our plans in 2022 including both guidance capital program and also where we will be going from an equity needs perspective so bob back to you 10 stocks we like better than northwestern when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and northwestern wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 robert c rowe chief executive officer crystal it sounded like you were selling tickets to eei good job a couple of regulatory items first concerning the power cost credit adjustment mechanism we had requested we requested approval to increase the base forecast given that the existing pcam really is energy driven not capacity driven we implemented an interim of about 17 million of loss replacer pardon me anyways we implemented the interim subsequently then the consumer council filed a motion arguing that the pcam can only be adjusted in a general rate case we were disappointed that the commission granted that motion to dismiss however we have not seen a written order when we do see that we will evaluate and certainly have the opportunity to request reconsideration our view is that under the tariff the pcam base may be reset outside of a rate case second concerning our decoupling mechanism as you know we requested that that be suspended early on in covid as the disparate direction of the residential and c i sectors really highlighted that the mechanism was a mismatch to its intended purpose and the commission voted to grant our request to suspend we consider that a real positive the consumer council had requested reconsideration and that was denied so that s a very good outcome and then finally i know we ll come back and talk about this on may 19 we had filed a request for approval of three capacity resources including our laurel plant and we withdrew that request simply to manage the supply chain issues and we re very much going ahead with the laurel plant brian will come back and talk about that a couple other regulatory matters really below the radar ferc has initiated a routine audit covering the years 2018 to present we responded to quite a few data requests haven t yet received a report but that is expected within the next six months can t really speak to the outcome of that and then just a couple of weeks ago wecc western electricity coordinating council initiated one of their audits brian and our vice president for transmission mike cashell and i all participated in the kick off with our wecc audit team we consider those to be constructive and important processes and we re looking forward to the results there and now moving on to the capital plan as crystal mentioned we will be updating our plans and discussing that with you at eei but as is reflected here we currently have a 2 1 billion overall capital plan over the next five years which we expect to finance with cash flows from operations first mortgage bonds and equity issuances then as always financing plans are subject to change two important highlights to this current plan first of all the plan as depicted here does include about 60 million for 30 to 40 megawatt flexible generating plant near aberdeen and we decided to discontinue our plans there as a result of significant increases in estimated construction costs and the overall supply chain challenges we will obviously continue to monitor our customers needs in south dakota and make appropriate decisions to address those on the other hand these projections do not include about 275 million of anticipated investment in the 175 megawatt generation facility to be constructed near laurel so this overall level of capital is anticipated to result in an annualized rate base growth of 4 to 5 and with the acceleration of the laurel project and the discontinuation of the aberdeen project we anticipate we do anticipate providing an update at eei coming up in just a few weeks and i ll now turn it over to chief operating officer brian bird for an update on the generation portfolio and also to report our progress on esg matters brian b bird president and chief operating officer thanks bob as bob pointed out obviously we withdrew our filing associated with the laurel project but we are certainly moving ahead with the project in fact we want to take advantage of the fixed price contract and protect our customers from rising costs that everyone is seeing and also to get moving as quickly as we can on the project in case unforeseen supply chain issues arise in addition to that the beartooth battery contract since the time period to build that facility is much much shorter than the laurel plant we do plan to bring that in front of the commission as a stand alone pre approval filing and in fact we plan to file that relatively soon in addition to that the powerex contract which will actually go in effects in early 2022 will be available to provide protection to our customers coming up in the coming winter season in regards to south dakota we are in construction of a 16 megawatt plant and it s going relatively well with covid and some other supply chain issues it has been pushed out to early 22 but we re excited about seeing that come online here relatively soon as we pointed out as bob pointed out in terms of the aberdeen plant we looked at the rising costs we did not have an opportunity to lock in prices associated to that project we are still in the development phase and we are negotiating those prices but it was we saw those prices go up we picked the prudent thing and talked with the south dakota commission and talked about the expected increase in the price of that project and collectively agreed with folks we discussed the matter decided to put a hold to the project and come back at what we hope is a more reasonable pricing and then possibly with different alternatives sometime down the road moving on to esg i guess i would say one of the big advantages of being a member of nasdaq is they have services one of which is onereport it s a tool that we can track all of our esg related information we ve certainly used that tool in the first half of the year recorded everything that we can capture today and loaded it into one report we ve now disseminated that information to those folks that rate us from an esg perspective and we also dovetailed that into the release of our brand new web page which is you will see that esg is very very prominent in that we re already seeing some improvement in some of our scores and we expect to see a bit more as people continue their process of looking at our information and with that i ll send it back to bob robert c rowe chief executive officer okay and with that we are ready for your questions questions and answers travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thank you bob and team looks like we have our first question in the queue from ryan greenwald of bofa ryan ryan is your line unmuted ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey can you hear me travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yeah now we can ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst awesome appreciate the time good afternoon everyone travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer hey ryan ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst can you talk a bit about latest conversations with the rating agencies following withdrawal of the pre approval application and the pcam order out of the commission i know it sounds like we re going to get some more information at eei here but anything preliminary you can say just in terms of potential equity needs end of 22 and the initial thoughts around timing and cadence whether it d be a block or another atm crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer ryan crystal here thanks for the question first i ll take the first part of your questions we did speak with each of the rating agencies as we made the decision to move forward with the laurel project and the importance of that given as brian alluded to having fixed price contracts on the table being able to progress quickly and be able to execute on that from a customer perspective i think the ratings agencies understand the perspective of that side of it moving forward from a business side of it we also understand the other piece of that is you re looking for us to get recovery on rates and that ll be chief of mind for us as to how we progress with the montana commission and work together to accomplish that with your question with regard to 22 happy to talk about that at eei and looking forward to it robert c rowe chief executive officer one footnote on the ratings agencies just a couple of weeks ago moody s did an excellent presentation to the montana commission laying the foundation for what the ratings agencies do how they look specifically utilities and then how they evaluate northwestern energy that was really well received by the commission lot of good discussion it s the presentation at least the video is available online south dakota commission is very interested in having a similar presentation of course our view is the more our regulators understand the better for all ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thank you and then can you help quantify the magnitude of inflationary pressures you guys saw with aberdeen before opting not to move forward with the project was the balance sheet a limiting factor at all or was were the concerns really just oriented around elevated rates with the higher costs brian b bird president and chief operating officer no i think we were seeing prices upwards of 50 higher than we originally seen and that s why based upon that news that we thought it made sense to sit down and chat and collectively made a good decision we believe the balance sheet certainly obviously we want to invest much capital as we need but that was not the factor as to why we decided not to move forward ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thank you and then maybe just lastly i know you alluded earlier in terms of the fixed costs for laurel here but is there anything that s open in terms of that contract in terms of the 275 million that could be subject to price movement brian b bird president and chief operating officer not that i can think of ryan ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst great i ll leave it there thank you guys thanks ryan crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer thank you travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer we ll take our next call from jamieson or as his friends call him james

officer now i can james ward guggenheim partners analyst perfect i had i dialed star 6 i hit the unmute button on the screen and then another one popped up in the bottom corner travis meyer director

chief executive officer we had an extra layer of security for equity analysts brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah james ward guggenheim partners analyst i love it what i was saying there to travis comment i said well i count you among those front so feel free to call me as you wish so the question on aberdeen was already asked and answered 50 higher is very clear 2022 eps guidance i understand capex and presumably how you re going to finance that in some way shape or form will be part of the discussion at eei will 2022 eps guidance come at the same time or will that come later crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer absolutely we will be talking about both 22 eps guidance along with capital plans obviously with things shifting with both laurel accelerating and aberdeen moving we ll be updating capital eps and all financing plans james ward guggenheim partners analyst beautiful robert c rowe chief executive officer so you ve got to be there james ward guggenheim partners analyst well certainly will be the final question that i have is on laurel you mentioned in the release that toward the end of last week there was an unfortunately other lawsuit filed and mentioned the potential for that to delay construction how should we think about the timing on when you could start construction how this could impact well maybe i ll just start at there how good this is about timing and then start date end date financing etc robert c rowe chief executive officer i will say a couple of things and turn it over to our coo obviously we were disappointed by the litigation it seem to be untimely in terms of the administrative process followed we were encouraged to hear today from the governor that we will be side by side with the department in defending the lawsuit but obviously this is monday we received that just several days ago so our legal team is evaluating brian brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah what i would add is the biggest time factor at this point in time is getting the engines manufactured and from a site preparation standpoint and permitting there are certain things that we re working on we ll continue to work on that during this process but it s the and that will take time and so i think there ll be on a time that can transpire if you will the lawsuit that we can be working at some other things james ward guggenheim partners analyst got you well it sounds like you ve got some good allies there which is very nice to hear the last question would be just on those the construction of those engines where would that be taking place some rice units are european in origin others rather than just assuming and figure out i d just ask the question where would brian b bird president and chief operating officer we have had engines in the past for pggs so produced in germany and shipped and we ll be doing the same here for laurel james ward guggenheim partners analyst beautiful thank you very much guys look forward to seeing you at eei travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks james we ll take our next question from the line of jonathon reeder at wells fargo jonathan don t forget the triple unmute jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst all right can you hear me now robert c rowe chief executive officer yes travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yeah sure can jonathan jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst yeah it takes a while for that unmute button pop ups so apologies for that just kind of piggybacking on that last question just to be clear you ve given i guess the contractors for laurel the notice to proceed then right where we re definitely moving forward it s not that you intend to do it before sometime in the future when you have to execute on the fixed price brian b bird president and chief operating officer we are on the final stages on final notice to proceed i ll leave it at that jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst and then another front around the capex refresh but it sounds like despite this environmental lawsuit you are going to be rolling that laurel plant then into the forecast even though i guess that has the potential to derail it brian b bird president and chief operating officer absolutely jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay is it safe to assume these global supply chains and inflationary pressures are also impacting kind of the base capex budget thus if you want to accomplish the same amount of work as contemplated in the current budget it might cost more to do so brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah it s a good question matter of fact a question that was raised by the board yesterday when we got the capital budget approved i would say in two ways at the time of capital budgets put together in july and we considered increasing cost from an inflationary standpoint but i d argue that since july even we re seeing a bit more change there so it s something that we certainly want to keep our eyes on i think what might be an offsetting factor to some increased cost is concerns about supply chain concerns about other things that could slow construction too so we kind of felt that we probably will end up about where we planned initially jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst you re saying where you planned initially from a dollar perspective but not necessarily brian b bird president and chief operating officer from a dollar perspective from a dollar perspective jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay okay and then i guess in terms of though like getting certain amount of work actually done going forward you ll have to look at what it s going to cost to get that done balanced out against your i guess expected rate impacts and figure out what the sweet spot is there brian b bird president and chief operating officer correct jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay and then robert c rowe chief executive officer the other comment on supply chain is the board management is paying a lot of attention to supply chain issues both sides cost and availability as is the entire industry and we re participating in the industry effort to manage through this certainly the challenges don t same transitory in the sense that they will evaporate in a period of weeks or months brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah and again just to be a bit more clear from my perspective obviously the supply chain issues and other issues that could cause work to slow things could i don t think it s an essence of cutting projects as much as pushing projects out into the future jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst got you well that makes sense and then actually i m trying to think i had a follow up on that and i lost my train of thought just two kind of housekeeping items the 2 7 million pre tax reversal of the previously written offline collectible accounts was that anticipated in the 21 guidance or was that kind of an upside surprise crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer i would say that was within line with our expectations jonathon reeder wells fargo securities llc analyst okay all right well thanks i ll leave it there appreciate the time travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks jonathan and with that we i think our monday morning call has no we did just have one come into the queue here it is the last four digits 3425 eric peterson millennium management analyst hey guys can you hear me travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yes we can who do we have eric peterson millennium management analyst hey this is eric peterson from millennium travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer hey eric eric peterson millennium management analyst i appreciate you taking my question hey just real quick on the project up in aberdeen can you give us any flavor on whether the capacity need will still be there in the next iteration of the irp next year brian b bird president and chief operating officer absolutely eric peterson millennium management analyst and then part two oh go ahead brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah i think i m sorry i didn t interrupt if you had a further question i ll pause and let s keep going eric peterson millennium management analyst okay yeah just separately was that charge off adjusted out in your non gaap earnings this quarter brian b bird president and chief operating officer no i ll let the cfo answer that question i ll take the first question i think the capacity need still exists in south dakota i think we just want we will continue to manage that and these other means to close that gap in the short term but continue to evaluate what we want to do longer term there and again understanding what pricing has done in the future come back at some point in time in the next irp and make a decision there crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer and eric this is crystal the second part of your question is was the charge off that s related to those initial cost at aberdeen non gaap ed out it was not it is in our earnings eric peterson millennium management analyst got it okay thank you guys very much travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks eric it looks like we have one more question in the queue that we re trying to get through here we ll see if this works it s from the line of matt davis i believe matt we just allowed you to speak if you matthew davis coann capital analyst hi guys can you hear me travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yeah we can matthew davis coann capital analyst so i just had a question on the aberdeen project i mean i understand that pricing has gone up roughly 50 but what based on what you re seeing in the energy market as well as in the capacity market in your region with the extreme cost as well as i believe the project was expected to come online sometime in 2024 so a little bit later in the the planning horizon why go ahead and make that decision now and how do you and is this the 50 increase in the project cost enough to kind of outweigh what you re seeing in the energy and capacity markets brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah i think the main thing was when you sit down with the commission and tell you want to give them a heads up that if we move forward this project at this point in time this is what we expect to see and we talked about alternatives and then we collectively agreed it probably makes sense to wait and we had asked if there is certain other things we can do in the short term we did say we had alternatives and we would collectively look at that in the next irp if you might remember we initially aberdeen was something it didn t necessarily contemplate in the first irp but we thought from an expeditious standpoint we could forge ahead with that and we were certainly planning to head that direction but again the dialog we have with the commission it just was a collective decision to not move forward matthew davis coann capital analyst and then just one other one in terms of thinking about the moving pieces around the capital program i get that your base plan probably has some inflationary measures but is it just as simply as thinking about at putting in laurel and subtracting out aberdeen or are there other pieces to the puzzle robert c rowe chief executive officer we ll be discussing the updated capital plan in great detail at eei honestly excited about the good and important work ahead of us so it s not a simple matter of trading out one for one matthew davis coann capital analyst okay thank you brian b bird president and chief operating officer thanks matt travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer thanks matt it looks like we have one more question in the queue from andy levi andy we re opening your line andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst unmute okay does that work travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer that works andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst oh look at that see i am the old guy and i can figure it out quicker than the other guys robert c rowe chief executive officer you re technologically adept andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst yeah i can push a button how are you guys are doing all right everything good robert c rowe chief executive officer very good andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst everything good yes ok good okay so just two questions first just on natural gas in general if i remember it correctly right you guys made several acquisitions on the natural gas side as far as resources is that correct robert c rowe chief executive officer correct andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst and are those still flowing gas are those still flowing gas robert c rowe chief executive officer yes andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay and so could you just i have a couple of questions around that but could you kind of just explain how significant that is as far as helping you this winter on supply and i mean that price wise robert c rowe chief executive officer i ll say a couple of things and turn it over to again brian our coo in montana in particular think about the integrated system that does have some owned supply that has a lot of storage and transmission and storage at both ends of the system so that gives us flexibility in terms of bringing gas in several points on the system storing purchasing and storing gas in the off season when prices are relatively more attractive than moving the gas around the system so that puts us in i think a much better position than if we were simply a local delivery system so that s a real positive brian brian b bird president and chief operating officer yeah i would say two things first of all we thought that buying gas reserves made sense some rules were changed at the commission that made difficult for us to do more of that we would like to have done more particularly for events like this with higher prices but i would say about 10 to 15 of that purchase gas is available to us at this point in time and the nice thing bob mentioned stores that we have in our system we re able to use that storage and fill it up and save it for peak periods in the winter season and that provides about 50 of the gas that we use so we certainly that s a nice advantage of our system andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst when you say 10 to 15 that s your total supply not what you re using from the reserves that you have is that correct brian b bird president and chief operating officer total supply total supply andy andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst right okay and how i know it s been a while since we discussed this what do you have as far as reserves like what s the total amount that you have or that you actually produce on an annual basis brian b bird president and chief operating officer andy years ago we used to have those slides in our deck and we re talking about andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst i know okay okay so ok so that s fine you don t have it right now that s fine we can discuss at eei and then i ve like a bigger picture question about that i understand it s a rate base type of product project product okay at the same time you need equity and obviously equity affects our rates and affects the customer as well are there any thoughts again that s kind of paying its dividends this year but also the price of gas has gone up so dramatically and the price for assets has gone up so dramatically that have you ever thought of monetizing those assets in lieu of doing equity robert c rowe chief executive officer that would be a no andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay fair enough stuff that pops in my head robert c rowe chief executive officer no it s good we always appreciate your ideas andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay well some people do i don t know about my family for that it depends on the family member and then the last question robert c rowe chief executive officer no one is a hero at home andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst that s true and then the last question i have is just again around the amount of equity that you need not the actual dollar amount but just again you re thinking on because i truly believe that the atm has affected your stock price on a relative basis and so any thoughts kind of around that versus just someone like myself or other people just kind of buying the shares from you all at once and then taking that pressure off the stock since it doesn t trade that much volume same question i ask to you every quarter robert c rowe chief executive officer crystal crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer andy we appreciate your resounding interest in our stock we think it s a good holding through we hear you on that the comments on technical execution would be the only thing i have to say about that we hear you brian b bird president and chief operating officer i ll help you out andy on your previous question you asked the amount of bcf and if my math serves me kind of in that 10 to 15 i d argue it s about 3 bcf andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay that s great guys i see brian b bird president and chief operating officer andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay i see you guys soon in florida look forward to seeing you in person can you hear me crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer yes robert c rowe chief executive officer yes thank you andrew levi hite hedge asset management llc analyst okay see you guys thank you bye travis meyer director of corporate finance and

rowe chief executive officer barely paul patterson analyst i ll send you a text travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer yes we can hear you now crystal d lail vice president and chief financial officer we can hear you paul patterson analyst okay my question is basically with the aberdeen increase of 50 it sounds a little like hyperinflation was there any specific driver or drivers or can you just give a little more color on i apologize i missed it brian b bird president and chief operating officer no i didn t give any specific drivers thinking about the total cost it wasn t just one particular component but from a total cost perspective it was upwards of 50 increase all in paul patterson analyst okay okay so it s just everything just pretty much came together is that it this seems so big brian b bird president and chief operating officer yep it does paul patterson analyst okay thanks so much i really appreciate it robert c rowe chief executive officer thank you brian b bird president and chief operating officer thanks paul travis meyer director of corporate finance and investor relations officer all right with that i think we have

sibanye stillwater concluded an r8bn share repurchase programme earlier this month but its success belies no small degree of frustration at the gold and platinum group metal pgm miner while a buy back is a viable form of shareholder return less shares in issue mean more earnings per share its evil twin is a recognition that the market isn t fully valuing the company this notion of fair valuation was at the heart of recent comments by laurent charbonnier sibanye stillwater s chief commercial and development officer rarely in the spotlight charbonnier raised the question at the firm s pgm capital markets day on september 23 as to why one anglo american platinum amplats the 80 owned anglo american company was worth two sibanye stillwaters clearly the market is always right and it always knows best said charbonnier yet sibanye stillwater is in positioning on the cost curve in terms of ebitda not that different from amplats he said among the assets discounted in sibanye stillwater s share price is its south african gold and us based pgm recycling businesses and its growth strategy which provides geographic and earnings diversity he argued for instance some r10bn has been invested or committed by sibanye stillwater this year alone in strategic joint ventures in the future facing battery metals market nickel processing and lithium in europe and the us as the market is always right charbonnier thinks it simply hasn t the correct information on sibanye stillwater s business trajectory we are now providing significant information to the market to break the neck of previous stereotypes which existed around the group he said of the capital markets presentations which had included an earlier focus on the group s gold assets charbonnier s comments appear to have fallen on deaf ears at least for now since that presentation sibanye stillwater has continued to underperform amplats gaining 6 compared to an 12 improvement at amplats on a 12 month basis shares in sibanye stillwater are 1 6 higher whereas amplats is 14 higher why does the discount on sibanye stillwater shares persist gold losing shine the clue might be in the gold business whilst producing about 800 000 oz and offering leverage to the gold price sibanye stillwater s three gold mines kloof driefontein and beatrix contributed only 6 to the r40 5bn in adjusted ebitda sibanye stillwater reported for the six months ended june as ageing deep underground mines with about 31 000 employees 5 600 contractors they are also vulnerable to safety lapses seismic events and strikes resources are depleting and therefore carry rehabilitation liabilities hsbc analyst leroy mguni captured the matter at sibanye stillwater s presentation on gold by asking whether the company would consider selling its gold assets especially in view of the high safety risks of course selling is always an option but that is a cop out said neal froneman ceo of sibanye stillwater there are 30 000 people who have jobs dependent on us we won t put lives ahead of livelihoods but these are complex situations he added there are plans to access uranium resources at sibanye stillwater s beatrix west mine in the free state province which only has about five years of life left but this as with the group s acquisition of battery metals of which there are more to come is a bet placed on a major improvement in the uranium price mick mcmullan the former president and ceo of stillwater mining the us firm that sibanye stillwater bought for 2 2bn when it was still called sibanye gold says the company s strategic acquisitions could stand for a lot as the battery metals market develops mcmullen is betting on it he recently set down plans to list a 250m spac on the new york stock exchange aimed at investing in green metal production he was an early mover in getting out of south africa by buying stillwater and now we can see he s an early mover in future facing metals said mcmullen at the joburg indaba conference earlier this month whilst these acquisitions don t measure up for the stillwater mining outlay if they pay off they will give his company a differentiation against some of the other traditional south african mining companies he said uncertain future for now the battery metals investments aren t generating cash and bring with them uncertainty for example a joint venture with an australian firm ioneer in a lithium mine is being threatened by environmentalist opposition it will destroy a rare buckwheat however concerns that sibanye stillwater will break out a new blockbuster merger and acquisition transaction large enough to imperil the recently reinstated dividend are not considered high charbonnier argues sibanye stillwater has a track record of successful merger and acquisition activity in the case of the pgm assets it bought its market timing was spectacular but the assets were all turnaround opportunities at which froneman is a past master there s more scepticism on greenfields and brownfields development which is perhaps another reason investors are holding off on the premium rating the company craves
in response to a continued rise in hate crimes across the country the minnesota house is moving forward with a bill to update the state s hate crime laws despite the rejection of several proposed amendments house file 1691 attempts to improve the reach of existing anti hate crime legislation by expanding certain legal definitions updating law enforcement training increasing public reporting capabilities and more house file 1691 offers a multi faceted approach the bill aims to increase both proactive and reactive responses to hate crimes in several ways the main components of the bill include codifying graffiti targeting any protected class as a hate crime updated training for law enforcement regarding hate crime response classifying gender identity and expression as a protected class allowing community organizations to report hate crimes on behalf of victims community organizations have long requested the ability to act as a type of intermediary between hate crime victims and law enforcement many victims of hate crimes especially traditionally marginalized individuals such as minorities and members of the lgbtq community don t always feel comfortable contacting the police additionally many victims find navigating the criminal justice system difficult community organizations often have a pre existing relationship with these individuals as well as a familiarity with law enforcement allowing them to report crimes on victims behalf should hopefully encourage more victims to come forward ultimately providing more accurate data on hate crimes throughout minnesota several proposed amendments rejected the bill recently passed the public safety committee by a vote of 10 to eight and the judiciary committee by a vote of 11 to five during debate in both committees two amendments were introduced but both were voted down rep matt grossell r clearbrook introduced an amendment to add law enforcement as a protected class making perpetrators of crimes against law enforcement subject to hate crime laws however typically a protected class is based on what are called immutable characteristics such as race sexuality religion and gender additionally minnesota s existing laws already add enhanced penalties for crimes against law enforcement officers the second proposed amendment introduced by rep eric lucero r dayton attempted to remove the classification of gender identity as a protected class he argued that a person s gender could only be either biologically male or female the path forward into law after passing both committees house file 1691 then moved to the house ways and means committee if passed by the committee the bill would then progress to the house floor for a final vote although the bill has yet to be enacted into law community organizers say they ve already seen a positive effect as members of the community feel increasingly comfortable reporting incidents to their organizations directly for example the coalition of asian american leaders has seen a recent dramatic uptick in requests for help hate crimes serve no purpose in our community says kristian kircher attorney and co founder of bk law group it is important we all do our part to make this a safe and comfortable place for all hate crimes continue to increase throughout the united states with particularly violent acts targeting asian americans specifically the recent series of shootings throughout atlanta targeting asian women has caused a shockwave of fear felt throughout asian american communities across the country including in minnesota while two members of the house did attempt to introduce fairly narrow amendments the general components of the bill face no particularly significant or organized opposition from either side of the aisle as the bill moves forward through the minnesota house and possibly into the senate additional changes could be proposed but the core idea of reducing hate in the state does seem to garner a broad coalition of support
the inflation expectations as captured by rbi s survey shows near double digit expectations it is difficult to bring it down once it is stuck at higher levels one other indicator of inflation anxiety is when people start buying more gold if gold prices start climbing that too indicates demand arising from a desire to hold on to something which is a hedge against rising prices but this is by a wealthier and smaller section of the population on the other hand there have been a number of distress sales of gold and as such gold loans have gone up by a whopping 62 in the past year or so this indicates the distress of inadequate incomes gold loans are often used to finance consumption spending such as children s education weddings illnesses or to even meet household expenses

homing in on a final proposal to tax the nation s wealthiest individuals and families as a principal source of revenue for a major human infrastructure spending bill the proposal would apply only to taxpayers who have more than 1 billion in assets or who earn 100 million in income for three consecutive years according to a person familiar with the negotiations it would apply to around 700 taxpayers and is projected to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in a package that s supposed to be about giving everybody a shot to get ahead it would be a big mistake from both a policy and a political perspective not to ask billionaires to pay a fair share said senate finance committee chairman ron wyden d ore in a statement monday the billionaires income tax is about fairness and showing the american people taxes aren t mandatory for them and optional for the wealthiest people in the country wyden said no working person in this country thinks it s right that billionaires can pay no taxes for years on end and sometimes never at all the background senate democrats initially wanted to raise revenue to pay for their budget reconciliation package by raising the corporate tax rate and marginal income tax rates on wealthy americans in the top income tax bracket but plans to raise the corporate tax rate and marginal income tax rates were shelved because of opposition from sen kyrsten

to help pay for his big economic and social agenda president joe biden is looking to go where the big money is billionaires biden never endorsed an outright wealth tax when he campaigned for the white house last year but his more conventional proposed rate increases on the income of large corporations and the wealthiest americans have hit a roadblock recommended videos that leaves a special tax on the assets not the income of billionaires being proposed by a senate democrat as a possible way to help pay for child care universal prekindergarten child tax credits family leave and environmental initiatives biden has pledged that his programs will not add a penny to the deficit which means selling to congress and voters a tax on the wealthiest 0005 of americans some details on the proposed billionaires tax how would it work essentially billionaires earn the bulk of their money off their wealth this might be from the stock market it could include once sold beachfront mansions or the ownership of rare art and antiquities a triceratops skeleton this new tax would apply solely to people with at least 1 billion in assets or 100 million in income for three straight years these standards mean that just 700 taxpayers would face the additional tax on increases to their wealth according to a description obtained by the associated press of the proposal of by the chairman of the senate finance committee sen ron wyden d ore on tradeable items such as stocks billionaires would still pay a tax even if they held on to the asset they would be taxed on any increases in value and take deductions on losses under current law those assets get taxed only when they are sold billionaires would also face an additional tax on nontradeable assets such as real estate and business interests once those assets are sold during the first year of the proposed tax the billionaires would also owe taxes on any built in gains that predate the tax how much money would it raise house speaker nancy pelosi d calif estimated on cnn sunday that the tax would raise 200 billion to 250 billion this is a meaningful sum but it s well shy of the nearly 2 trillion in proposed additional spending over 10 years being negotiated right now this means that additional levies such as the global minimum tax and increased enforcement dollars for the irs would still be needed to help close the gap and the forecasts for revenue from the wealth tax are highly debatable it s just impossible to implement said allison schrager a senior fellow at the conservative manhattan institute there s a lot of evidence that these things don t work and i ve never heard an explanation of how this could be workable why would biden go this route the president would rather raise corporate tax rates and rates on wealthy individuals that was his initial proposal but he s got to appease sens joe manchin d w va and kyrsten sinema d ariz those are the two make or break democratic votes in the evenly split senate sinema objected to higher rates which brought the wealth tax into play as an alternative the idea gained steam after the publication of french economist thomas piketty s book capital in the twenty first century sen elizabeth warren d mass made a 2 wealth tax a trademark policy in the 2020 presidential primaries and fellow candidate bernie sanders the senator from vermont proposed his own wealth tax biden never jumped on that bandwagon but he did make higher taxes on the wealthy a key promise saying no one earning less than 400 000 would pay more is a wealth tax constitutional if a wealth tax were to become law it probably would be challenged in court the likely case comes from article 1 section 2 of the constitution it states that direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union according to their respective numbers what does that mean it means that revenues from direct taxes must reflect the population of the states which is a problem because billionaires tend to cluster in places such as california and new york if that s the case how does the federal government charge income and payroll taxes that s because of the 16th amendment it allows congress to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several states so what really matters is whether the supreme court would interpret a wealth tax as a direct tax on property that is unconstitutional or whether it s essentially a tax on income that is permissible are billionaires really that rich seems that way there is a legitimate debate about the optimal forms of taxation is it better for the economy for the wealthy to keep their assets invested in new businesses or is it better for some of their money to go to the government to help pay for programs such as child care universal pre k and shifts to renewable energy what is clear is that the wealthy do have money to tax should the government wish to do it america s billionaires have seen their collected wealth surge 70 since the start of the pandemic to more than 5 trillion according to an analysis by the pro wealth tax americans for tax fairness and the institute for policy studies program on inequality that gain from march 18 2020 to this past month is equal in size to biden s spending plans over 10 years right now billionaires are not paying a dime in taxes on their fabulous income gains from their stock holdings during the pandemic said frank clemente executive director of americans for tax fairness the billionaires income tax would tax the increase in the value of those assets each year just like workers wages are taxed there were 614 u s billionaires at the start of the pandemic the total has now grown to 745 part of what makes the coronavirus unique is that many poorer americans also became wealthier but they did so at a much slower pace than billionaires federal reserve data indicate that the net worth of the bottom 90 of americans a group that includes the middle class rose by roughly 22 for many americans the wealth increase reflected a rising stock market higher home values and unprecedented government aid in the form of direct checks and forgivable payroll loans to small businesses can billionaires escape taxation they ve found ways before they can hire armadas of lawyers accountants and others to minimize their tax burdens the news outlet propublica revealed various tax shelters with irs data earlier this year and the recent pandora papers showed there is a global industry to shelter the assets of the politically powerful and extremely wealthy the propublica investigation showed that warren buffett paid an average rate of 19 amazon founder jeff bezos paid 23 while tesla s elon musk was at roughly 30 the top tax rate on income earned from labor is 37 but the tax on capital gains is a lower 20 and that favors those with extreme wealth the lower capital gains rate can also encourage more investment in new companies that help the economy grow a white house analysis in september indicated the country s 400 wealthiest families paid an average federal income tax rate of 8 2 between 2010 and 2018 the administration s fundamental message is that a rate this low is unfair because middle class families often pay a greater share of their income in taxes the bottom line question for democratic lawmakers is how to close or at least narrow the escape hatches for those with extreme wealth it could require calculations such as the deferral recapture amount and other technicalities that are likely to baffle most of america but the writing of the tax law and its enforcement will determine just how successful a wealth tax would be and perhaps the fate of biden s big agenda as well ___ associated press writer will weissert contributed to this report

we may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page btw prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting english departments are strange places even to those of us who spend our working lives inside them they can seem utterly mysterious those looking in from outside must find them even more baffling what exactly do lecturers do all day they teach and interact with students but what happens the rest of the time literary scholars everywhere writes terry eagleton live in a state of dread a dread that one day someone will suddenly get wise to the fact that we draw salaries for reading poems and novels this fact say eagleton is as scandalous as being paid for sunbathing eating chocolate he has a point harvard professor deidre shauna lynch says even more bluntly that what english academics get up to simply does not look like work to those on the outside those of us writing on literature she suggests must make our peace with this fact we must resign ourselves to being largely unknown to the broader culture living in quiet obscurity and yet as netflix s the chair makes clear life within an english department can actually look a lot like life in any other workplace at the fictional pembroke university there are familiar office politics and dramas as well as the usual mixture of ambition resentment and status seeking that exist elsewhere professor ji yoon kim sandra oh steers a team of colleagues who have eccentric literary quirks but are recognisable figures in many workplaces if you enjoyed this series i d recommend checking out these four novels all of which offer compelling depictions of english departments forget the campus novel the english department novel is a more interesting sub genre read more 21 netflix thrillers that you won t be able to look away from russo s comic novel shares many similarities with the chair it centres on the madcap adventures of william henry devereaux jr who chairs an english department similar in size to that of pembroke furious about recent financial cuts devereaux takes matters into his own hands he uses a local television network to publicise his cause threatening to kill one goose from the university pond every day until his department s budget is reinstated russo emphasises the slapstick farcical side of departmental politics straight man is a glorious send up of self serious academics the politics of literary theory and intellectual ambition it also offers a perfect gloss on the old adage that academic politics are so vicious precisely because the stakes are so low i strongly suspect that the writers of the chair had devereaux in mind while creating the similarly hapless bill dobson jay duplass john williams may well have written the most moving novel ever to be set in an english department in understated elegiac prose williams gives us the tragic life story of william stoner an obscure english professor at the university of missouri who enters as an agriculture student but develops a lifelong passion for literature he lives his entire life against the backdrop of the university and all of his significant relationships are found within the english department while stoner s contributions to the field seem middling to his colleagues he inspires generations of students with his generous and rigorous teaching his personal life may well be a kind of tragedy but he finds redemption in his teaching and research and a true home in the department williams gives us an example of the english department novel at its most existential and weighty one beloved of readers inside and outside the academy mccarthy s novel takes us back to comedy once again mining the same territory as the chair and straight man but written well in advance of either drawing on her own experiences at bard college and elsewhere mccarthy gives us a farce with a serious political edge set at the fictional jocelyn college the novel centres on henry mulcahy an expert on james joyce who learns he has been let go seemingly without cause as he fights to save his position mccarthy shows us the subtle and shifting nature of allegiances within the english departments she knew firsthand as well as the petty disputes and lurid scandals they can harbour she pulls no punches laying bare the gossip naked careerism and backstabbing that even seemingly mild mannered english academics are capable of the novel also gives us a classic bait and switch the central character mulcahy whom we initially see as sympathetic and unfairly mistreated slowly comes into focus as manipulative and profoundly unlikable as we begin to see the central events from the perspective of once minor characters the truth is revealed and mccarthy skillfully shows us the mistakes of our earlier judgments this wise and moving novel explores the lifelong friendship between two couples larry and sally morgan and sid and charity lang sid and larry are english professors in madison wisconsin and the novel follows them as they chase literary ambitions while also managing substantial teaching duties both are striving for tenure and are forced to negotiate complicated faculty politics ultimately this is a novel about quiet lives as the narrator tells us its great themes are friendship marriage and the nature of love and while the english department often fades into the background as stegner explores other aspects of his characters lives its politics are never far away sid and larry are often concerned with the petty machinations of their academic colleagues and crossing to safety includes many details that still resonate with life at a university today stegner s novel also offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of literary studies from the 1930s to the 1970s of course there are many other novels within this sub genre including david lodge s beloved campus trilogy as well as novels by vladimir nabokov j m coetzee and others while eating chocolate and sunbathing wouldn t necessarily make for interesting fiction life in an english department it seems certainly does lucas thompson lecturer department of english university of sydney this article

in this tuesday nov 28 2017 photo a hertz rental car logo rests on the front of a hertz location in boston car rental company hertz is ordering 100 000 electric vehicles from tesla the company says its buying the tesla model 3s by the end of 2022 and it also will buy electric vehicle chargers no price was given for the order but it has to be worth around 4 billion because each model 3 has a base price of around 40 000 ap photo steven senne file detroit hertz announced monday that it will buy 100 000 electric vehicles from tesla one of the largest purchases of battery powered cars in history and the latest evidence of the nation s increasing commitment to ev technology the news of the deal triggered a rally in tesla s stock driving the carmaker s market value over the 1 trillion mark for the first time recommended videos the purchase by one of the world s leading rental car companies reflects its confidence that electric vehicles are gaining acceptance with environmentally minded consumers as an alternative to vehicles powered by petroleum burning internal combustion engines in an interview with the associated press mark fields hertz interim ceo said that teslas are already arriving at the company s sites and should be available for rental starting in november hertz said in its announcement that it will complete its purchases of the tesla model 3 small cars by the end of 2022 it also said it will establish its own electric vehicle charging network as it strives to produce the largest rental fleet of electric vehicles in north america fields wouldn t say how much hertz is spending for the order but he said the company has sufficient capital and a healthy balance sheet after having emerged from bankruptcy protection in june the deal likely is worth around 4 billion because each model 3 has a base price of about 40 000 it also ranks at the top of the list of electric vehicle orders by a single company in 2019 amazon ordered 100 000 electric delivery vans from rivian a startup manufacturer of electric van pickup trucks and suvs amazon is an investor in rivian the hertz order sent tesla shares soaring nearly 13 to a record closing price of 1 024 86 and pushed the world s most valuable automaker s total market value to just over 1 trillion the wealth of ceo elon musk the richest person in the world grew 11 4 to 255 8 billion according to forbes in his interview with the ap fields made clear his belief that electric vehicles are increasingly moving into the mainstream and that hertz intends to be a leading provider of evs to rental customers he pointed to surveys showing that over the past five years consumer interest in electric vehicles has grown dramatically more are willing to try and buy he said it s pretty stunning fields said that hertz which is based in estero florida is in discussions with other automakers too about buying additional electric vehicles as it expands its ev fleet as more models enter the marketplace hertz also is investing in its own charging network fields said it has plans for 3 000 chargers in 65 locations across the united states by the end of 2022 and 4 000 by the end of 2023 many of the sites will be at hertz locations such as airports he said while others will be in suburban areas customers also would be able to use tesla s own large charging network for a fee fields said the company has a network of about 25 000 chargers worldwide fields declined to say how much hertz will charge to rent the teslas or whether they would be more expensive for customers than gas powered vehicles daniel ives a technology analyst at wedbush securities wrote in a note monday to investors that hertz s order represents a major feather in the cap for tesla and shows that a broad adoption of electric vehicles is under way as part of this oncoming green tidal wave hitting the u s china and europe have been ahead of the u s on vehicle electrification but demand in the united states is accelerating ives noted with tesla leading the way followed by startup lucid motors general motors ford and others that are chasing a potential 5 trillion market opportunity over the next decade in an interview ives said he expected other rental car companies to follow hertz s lead it s a wake up call for the rest of the industry as well he said ives suggested that the deal will help tesla and other manufacturers by giving thousands of consumers the experience of driving electric vehicles who might not otherwise have done so it s the ultimate test drive he said for a company that doesn t normally market this is the best brand and marketing deal they ve ever struck he said of tesla hertz s order may also help alleviate a nationwide shortage of rental cars he said automakers have slashed production and sales to rental car companies because of a global shortage of computer chips still ives said he doesn t expect hertz to receive significant numbers of teslas until the automaker s new factory near austin texas starts producing late next year hertz likely will charge customers more to rent the model 3s compared with conventional vehicles with combustion engines ives noted hertz global holdings inc filed for bankruptcy protection in may 2020 two months after the coronavirus erupted across the country it was among the first major corporations to be felled by the pandemic as infections surged and shut down travel on a global scale for both companies and vacationers in october hertz named fields a former ford motor co ceo as its interim chief executive shortly after hertz s announcement monday the national transportation safety board released a letter from its chairwoman chastising tesla for failing to respond to recommendations that emerged from several fatal crash investigations involving the company s autopilot partially automated driver assist system the agency recommended four years ago that tesla limit where its autopilot system can operate and that it better monitor drivers to make sure they re paying attention

don t miss out on the headlines from hitech followed categories will be added to my news tesla s mega deal with hertz has widened the gap between the us car maker and the rest of the industry the order for 100 000 cars is the single biggest order of electric cars to date and could be worth as much as us4 4 billion 5 9b to tesla according to reports the brand whose value recently topped us1 trillion is now more valuable than the next nine biggest carmakers the valuation is remarkable given the fact that tesla makes a fraction of the cars made by its two closest rivals toyota valued at 280b and volkswagen 160b each make an estimated 10 million vehicles each year tesla is on track to build about a tenth of this number after having delivered roughly 250 000 vehicles in the past quarter the tesla model 3 was the best selling car in europe in september a sizeable chunk of tesla s profit comes from the sale of regulatory credits which totalled about 280m in the previous quarter and more than 500m in the first quarter of this year a regulatory credit is handed out to carmakers to help promote the development low or zero emissions vehicles car makers are given the credits by governments for producing a certain amount of zero emissions vehicles each year car makers are required to have a certain amount of regulatory credits each year and if they can t reach their required number they can buy them off other car makers or suffer significant penalties enter tesla which only sells zero emissions vehicles so has an excess of credits which it then sells to other companies boosting its profit at no extra cost to itself it has been reported that stellantis which owns fiat chrysler and jeep brands among others bought more than 2b worth of credits from tesla between 2019 and 2021 tesla s perceived dependence on the sales of these credits to remain profitable has been one of the reasons the company has been heavily shorted as more and more car makers go electric the sales of these credits will dry up car rental company hertz has ordered 100 000 teslas but the company may be in a position shortly where it no longer needs the sales of credits as its production capacity and popularity continue to ramp up it is in the process of building two new massive factories to make cars and batteries in texas and germany the latest european car sales figures prove tesla s growing dominance in september for the first time the tesla model 3 was the best selling car in europe beating the volkswagen golf according to uk publication autocar tesla is now valued at more than one trillion dollars second hand car shoppers are set to benefit too as the price of used teslas should drop when the rental companies renew their fleets in a few years and sell the current stock tesla keeps its sales in australia secret but data revealed by the electric vehicle council in august this year showed the brand s growing popularity down under the report showed aussies bought 7248 electric cars in the first six months of 2021 car sales figures by the federal chamber of automotive industries showed every other car maker sold 2188 electric cars in the same period meaning 5031 teslas found a new home this shows tesla outsells all rivals combined by more than two to one if these figures continue tesla is on track for 10 000 sales this year in australia this would put it above established luxury brands such as lexus and volvo originally published as tesla is worth more than the next nine most valuable car makers
