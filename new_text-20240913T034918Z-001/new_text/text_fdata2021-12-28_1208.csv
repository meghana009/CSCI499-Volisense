charlyne smith s grandfather wanted her to be the prime minister of her native jamaica she has bigger dreams to solve the world s climate crisis using nuclear energy beginning in her home country i want to build a nuclear energy infrastructure in jamaica said smith a distinguished postdoctoral associate at idaho national laboratory s irradiated fuels and materials program she is also working on a proposal for a summer engineering program her goal is to expose jamaican high school students to engineering disciplines that are not taught anywhere in the caribbean for example nuclear engineering materials science engineering and environmental engineering she is working with the university of florida and the university of west indies mona in kingston where jamaica operates the caribbean s only nuclear reactor the 20 kilowatt slowpoke 2 research reactor is used for environmental agriculture and health studies research smith a native of st catherine jamaica grew up with constant power outages particularly during hurricane season things would get bad when there were extreme weather events i remember my mother running to the grocery store with all four children behind her in a panic she said smith s mother would stock up on dry goods batteries flashlights and candles they would cook all the frozen items to minimize the amount of food that would go to waste when we would lose power she said they also would fill up as many pans and buckets with water because they never knew when the water supply would be restored hurricane ivan was the worst smith was 9 years old at the time but recalled a three month period when the country was without power it wasn t until high school when she really understood the importance of reliable access to electricity her country s lack of infrastructure became apparent during occasional visits to the united states there was hot water coming out of the pipes there were washing machines dryers and dishwashers all this stuff that saves time and makes life so much easier she said after my visits i would go back to jamaica and think there are infrastructure problems to tackle at that point as a 14 year old i thought the necessary solutions would come from science and engineering fields at 17 she moved to maryland attended coppin state university in baltimore and graduated in 2017 with a degree in mathematics and chemistry while at coppin she studied solar power but decided to pursue a doctorate in nuclear engineering after talking with a nuclear scientist i wanted to work on an energy solution that would have a significant immediate and positive impact on a nation s infrastructure she said a solution that had the potential to replace the baseload fossil fuel energy source used in the caribbean imported fossil fuel energy sources make up more than 87 of the energy produced in the caribbean she decided while in graduate school at the university of florida to focus on understanding fuel performance under irradiation for qualifying nuclear fuels for commercial and research use she earned her doctorate in june 2021 and became active in pro nuclear nonprofit groups like students for nuclear and generation atomic for the past three months the 26 year old has been inl s glenn t seaborg distinguished postdoctoral associate examining the types of fuels used in nuclear reactors i want my experience at inl to broaden my network and push me in the direction of my own personal career goals to achieve net zero targets and address energy poverty especially during extreme events she said i believe nuclear energy is the solution she is doing this through science and activism dennis keiser directorate fellow of nuclear science and technology s nuclear fuels and materials division is smith s project manager and mentor charlyne is one of the smartest most driven students i have ever had the pleasure of working with he said tncms asset alignment right app editorial id 04ca4484 642a 11ec bf76 00163ec2aa77 presentation presentation width half over the course of her still short career her grandfather still prodded her to become prime minister of jamaica it wasn t until a recent visit that her grandfather finally understood her bigger dreams i was telling my grandfather about my plans and he finally seemed to get onboard with the whole nuclear engineering role he said oh yeah you can go and talk to the prime minister about it so smith drove herself to the prime minister s office where she was confronted by three heavily armed security men she didn t get to see the prime minister but drove away with his contact information her grandfather who died 18 days after she graduated with her doctorate in august was her biggest motivator she said she painted a portrait of him with her tncms asset alignment right app editorial id 3b6344a0 642a 11ec a915 00163ec2aa77 presentation presentation width half those were some of my last moments with him she said he was the

the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all the cdc recommends a five day quarantine then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days also in the news apple is temporarily not allowing customers to shop inside its retail stores in

are talking about a new year s eve party where you have 30 40 50 people celebrating you do not know the status of the vaccination i would recommend strongly stay away from that this year fauci said there will be other years to do that but not this year biden promises to ramp up access to testing president joe biden conceded monday that his administration has not done enough to provide access to coronavirus testing and promised to step up the effort earlier this month the biden administration touted a plan to combat the latest surge that included 500 million free tests but those test haven t begun rolling out yet and demand for tests before holiday gatherings set off a rush that depleted stocks in most pharmacies and other locations seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do biden said during a call with the white house covid 19 response team and several governors we re doing it he said that starting in two weeks private insurance will reimburse people for the cost of at home test and that the government will provide access to free tests for people without insurance thousands more flights canceled delayed airlines canceled and delayed thousands more flights monday amid a staffing crisis caused by the nationwide surge in covid 19 cases fueled by the omicron variant this after more than 1 500 flights within into or out of the u s were canceled sunday and over 6 000 delayed the tracking website flightaware reported several airlines said the scheduling issues were caused by staffing problems tied to covid 19 jetblue spokesperson derek dombrowski said the airline has seen an increasing number of sick calls because of the fast spreading omicron variant the company entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels since the start of the pandemic he said he warned that additional cancellations and delays remain a possibility the omicron variant is proving to be much more contagious than the delta

wong us should consider vaccine mandate for us air travel dr anthony fauci says dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the u s should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel signaling a potential embrace of an idea the biden administration has previously eschewed as covid 19 cases spike fauci the president s chief science adviser on the pandemic response said such a mandate might drive up the nation s lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights for which federal regulations require all those age 2 and older to wear a mask when you make vaccination a requirement that s another incentive to get more people vaccinated fauci told msnbc if you want to do that with domestic flights i think that s something that seriously should be considered the biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel two officials said biden s science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president the u s currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the u s be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus though citizens and

which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at

avoid the gatherings where they don t know the vaccination status of all the guests the omicron variant is fueling another infection surge and crowded indoor parties could accelerate spread when you are talking about a new year s eve party where you have 30 40 50 people celebrating you do not know the status of the vaccination i would recommend strongly stay away from that this year fauci said there will be other years to do that but not this year biden promises to ramp up access to testing president joe biden conceded monday that his administration has not done enough to provide access to coronavirus testing and promised to step up the effort earlier this month the biden administration touted a plan to combat the latest surge that included 500 million free tests but those test haven t begun rolling out yet and demand for tests before holiday gatherings set off a rush that depleted stocks in most pharmacies and other locations seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do biden said during a call with the white house covid 19 response team and several governors we re doing it he said that starting in two weeks private insurance will reimburse people for the cost of at home test and that the government will provide access to free tests for people without insurance thousands more flights canceled delayed airlines canceled and delayed thousands more flights monday amid a staffing crisis caused by the nationwide surge in covid 19 cases fueled by the omicron variant this after more than 1 500 flights within into or out of the u s were canceled sunday and over 6 000 delayed the tracking website flightaware reported several airlines said the scheduling issues were caused by staffing problems tied to covid 19 jetblue spokesperson derek dombrowski said the airline has seen an increasing number of sick calls because of the fast spreading omicron variant the company entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels since the start of the pandemic he said he warned that additional cancellations and delays remain a possibility the omicron variant is proving to be much more contagious than the delta

wong us should consider vaccine mandate for us air travel dr anthony fauci says dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the u s should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel signaling a potential embrace of an idea the biden administration has previously eschewed as covid 19 cases spike fauci the president s chief science adviser on the pandemic response said such a mandate might drive up the nation s lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights for which federal regulations require all those age 2 and older to wear a mask when you make vaccination a requirement that s another incentive to get more people vaccinated fauci told msnbc if you want to do that with domestic flights i think that s something that seriously should be considered the biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel two officials said biden s science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president the u s currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the u s be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus though citizens and

finding stocks that can 10x in 10 years doesn t have to be complicated and this company proves it my top consumer goods growth stock to buy right now is discount retail chain five below five 3 39 this company isn t curing cancer splitting the atom or landing humans on mars it s simply a retail chain that specializes in toys candy and other novelty items for teens and preteens nevertheless this seemingly mundane business can be a spectacular long term investment just ask anyone who bought shares of five below s initial public offering ipo in 2012 their investment is up more than 10 times in value from the ipo price of 17 per share in less than 10 years returns many investors aspire to and the exact factors that made five below a winner since its ipo are still working to make five below a market beating investment going forward here s why profitable growth when it comes to growth stocks investors typically overlook net losses and indeed that s appropriate in certain situations for example it s reasonable for a software company to lose money early on since it s expensive to build the product however profit margins increase with new customers because they re selling the same software product over and over again therefore it makes sense to overlook losses for a young software company with a rapidly growing customer base by contrast investors should not overlook losses with a retail business like five below as profits are realized on individual sales fortunately five below doesn t report any losses the company is solidly profitable in 2020 it reported net income of 123 million a 6 3 net profit margin despite the challenges from the pandemic and through the first three quarters of 2021 it s reported net income of 139 million a 7 5 margin keep in mind that five below has produced healthy profits even as it s expanded rapidly some retail companies promise profits someday with supply chain efficiencies not five below the company is on pace to open 170 new locations this year approaching 1 200 total more than twice as many locations than the 522 it had at the end of 2016 and yet it s been profitable all along underpinning this profitable expansion is five below s unit economics new stores cost 300 000 on average but generate 450 000 in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda meaning the payback period is less than one year on average those are stellar returns and management is wise to aggressively open new locations as long as the return on investment is this good possibly better profitability to come five below is currently marching toward its long term goal of owning more than 2 500 locations more than double what it has right now assuming the unit economics we just looked at hold up this will be a business generating much higher profits in time however there s reason to believe its operations can gain more operating leverage with scale five below just opened a fulfillment center in arizona in the third quarter of 2021 and only just fulfilled its first order from there in september another center is currently being built in indiana these locations are necessary to support 2 500 stores someday but in the meantime they re more of an expense than a savings however as new stores are opened in proximity to new distribution centers five below can start recognizing the efficiencies that come with these new facilities according to management with the arizona and indiana facilities it will have the infrastructure to support 2 000 locations this means it probably only needs one or two more distribution centers to get to 2 500 locations and once those are built higher profit margins will be possible current valuation valuation isn t typically discussed with growth stocks but i believe investors today are paying a price that s more than fair for five below stock since going public five below stock has traded at cheaper and more expensive price to sales and price to earnings multiples its current valuation is neither expensive or cheap but rather within its normal range fair however paying a fair price for a quality company like five below feels like a rarity these days you typically pay up for quality in the stock market five below has proven it s a quality company and yet the valuation means the investment make sense today for those willing to hold for the next five years and more however a closing word of caution as a retail business there could be lumpiness in five below s results expect occasional quarters of underperformance followed by a negative overreaction from wall street the stock has dropped 20 or more many times in the past decade but this kind of volatility isn t a risk for buy and hold investors as long as the company is expanding profitably i expect it will be a market beating investment over the long haul

british officials were apoplectic about the granting of a us visa waiver to gerry adams in 1994 but subsequently accepted it was beneficial newly released state papers from the period demonstrate london s opposition to the proposed us visa to the sinn féin president with an irish government document indicating that british officials said there would be hell to pay if the visa was granted secret government documents are released annually under the 30 year rule and sent to the national archives providing journalists and historians with a fresh glimpse into historical events this year even more recent files up to 1998 are also being released to bring the national archives up to date with material released by the public record office of northern ireland two months before adams visit to the us the british and irish governments outlined their common approach to the northern ireland peace process as part of the downing street declaration it was argued that a visit by adams to the us would allow him convince ira supporters in the us to support the both governments plans and a ceasefire the documents show concerns among us officials about allowing adams enter the us with a member of the national security council saying there was a strong resistance to him president bill clinton intervened to ensure the visa was granted to adams ahead of a conference in new york but the documents also show significant reluctance on the part of us officials the conference at the waldorf astoria hotel in february 1994 was organised by a us non profit organisation and invited representatives from all the main parties in northern ireland unionist parties declined to attend but adams spoke at the conference along with john hume of the sdlp and john alderdice of the alliance party however a private briefing memo sent by a civil servant to then tánaiste dick spring suggested the entire seminar may have been a subtext for adams to apply for a visa the granting of the visa also provided adams with an opportunity to speak to supporters of the republican movement in the us ahead of the first provisional ira ceasefire later that year in the letter to the tánaiste spring was advised that the irish government may be criticised by the fine gael led opposition if it favoured granting the visa to adams and criticised by irish americans if they opposed the official position of the irish government was that it was it was entirely a decision for us authorities to make whereas the british government was said to be opposing the visa with vehemence and determination nancy soderberg of the us national security council was said to have told the irish ambassador in washington that british officials were apoplectic about the consideration being given to adams visa concern over the granting of the visa was also evident among us officials however specifically whether adams would use the trip for fundraising purposes and due to the potential that he may embarrass the clinton administration while in the us advertisement a record of one conversation between irish embassy staff in washington and soderberg shows that the national security council was seeking that adams would make a public statement renouncing violence soderberg told irish officials that there was blood on the floor within the administration over the white house potentially speaking to adams and that he must not underestimate the strong resistance to him given that the ira was still blowing up buildings irish officials were told that there was a genuine domestic sensitivity here about terrorism in the context of the 1993 bomb at the world trade center and that adams should appreciate the decision to speak to him was a substantial one individuals involved in the 1993 bomb at the world trade centre were connected to al qaeda and there have never been any suggestions that the ira were linked to it the memo instead referenced the bomb as part of wider concerns about the visa various papers show differing opinions on whether the visa should be granted with the sdlp leadership split on whether it would be a positive move party leader john hume was in favour of us officials granting the visa waiver to adams with sdlp deputy leader seamus mallon opposed hume argued that the visa would help adams to sell support of the downing street declaration to the more hardline elements in the ira in a meeting with us vice president al gore in washington gore told hume the us administration had taken a gamble in issuing the visa and that hume s input was vital granting of the visa adams was granted a waiver on 30 january 1994 but the visa was strictly limited in duration and adams was not permitted to be outside a 25 mile radius of the conference in a fax sent by the irish ambassador to the us informing the irish government of the decision it was recorded that the white house emphasised to the irish ambassador that it was a difficult decision to grant the visa to adams not because of british pressure but because of domestic terrorism politics the comunique added that london was informed of the visa decision by way of a phone call to the prime minister s office they seemed resigned to the decision and while clearly not welcoming it hoped it would help the process the ambassador said in the fax further documents show that british opposition to the visa decision remained following the decision this includes a letter from prime minister john major to taoiseach albert reynolds a week later in which major said the us administration must be regretting their decision to let him in because adams did not provide unequivocal support for the downing street declaration in his speeches during the visit this anger at adams visit waned over time and by june 1994 british cabinet secretary robin butler told irish ambassador to london joseph small that the granting of the american visa was with benefit of hindsight on balance beneficial butler admitted that what hurt the british most in this case was the failure of the american administration to accept the advice of the british government in the matter a report of the meeting states
the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all the cdc recommends a five day quarantine then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days also in the news apple is temporarily not allowing customers to shop inside its retail stores in

the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all the cdc recommends a five day quarantine then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days also in the news apple is temporarily not allowing customers to shop inside its retail stores in

previously did not perform as well as the competition citigroup has turned a new leaf with jane fraser taking over as the first women ceo to run a major bank in the country the stock price has gone up substantially and seems to be in a good place for potential long term growth moreover many impactful transformations are underway in citigroup they may help the bank and its stock do better than before does that mean you should invest in citigroup stock is the stock worth a buy despite performing worse than the other major banks in the country find out in this guide citigroup stock current price as of dec 27 2021 the current price of citigroup stock is 60 65 the stock has a market cap of 120 346b and is expected to reach its target of 82 64 in a year s time looking at these figures you can easily say that citigroup stock is worth an investment but you should also be familiar with the concerns regarding the bank and its stock concerns about citigroup stock with the appointment of the new ceo there have been several changes in citigroup some of them are concerning for investors exit from consumer markets earlier in 2021 fraser announced that the bank would sell or exit its consumer banking franchise in about 13 global markets the decision was made to free up a whopping 7 billion although investors initially supported the idea citigroup s exit from the first two global markets has not been very smooth the bank s first sale was of its consumer franchise in australia the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of 680 million in the third quarter secondly citigroup announced that it would exit its consumer franchise in south korea without selling it that move can cost the company over a billion dollars although these two exits have freed up about 2 8 billion of capital investors are still hoping for the future exits or sales to be smoother than these strict accountability the bank is undergoing massive transformations but doesn t seem to be getting too much credit from the market thus the bank s management will have to execute their plan extremely well since the investors and analysts are holding them up to high standards if citigroup wants to attract stakeholders and investors the management will have to leave no room for error compensation earlier this year citigroup s board of directors approved incentives based on which three key figures in the organization could potentially earn up to 5 million based on how well the transformation plan goes the incentives will be based on these individuals performance while incentivizing the management boosts performance investors aren t exactly pleased with the idea the bank s stock has been underperforming for years and it s easy to see why investors are cautious and understandably so even if the bank has a basis for justifying this compensation shareholders and investors don t have enough patience left they want to see the bank putting them above the needs of its management is citigroup stock worth the investment whether or not you re considering if citibank stock is a good buy right now depends on the success of the bank s transformation plans the earning reports of the fourth quarter of 2021 will be released in january next year although every subsequent report for the bank will be of utmost importance this report could dictate how the investment trajectory will look for citigroup citigroup will also organize an investor day on march 2 2022 the bank will lay out its transformation plans in front of the investors giving them a peek into the full vision for the organization hopefully investor day will give the investors some tangible information about the bank such as the return on equity the bank is expecting to achieve or what the trends for the expenses will be it s also important to remember that citigroup still has to sell many of its global markets to free up the remaining capital if these sales go better than the previous two the bank s stock could do much better current price and trading value another reason the stock is an attractive investment is its current price at the moment the stock has a price to book ratio of 0 6582 as of dec 27 2021 which means it s trading below its assets value such a number is an indication of a stock that has an attractive value especially when you factor in the efficiency of management and growth potential return on equity is a metric to measure the investment worthiness of an organization it is calculated as the income of a company divided by the average equity of the shareholder over the last 12 months including any earnings that have been reinvested into the company citigroup also has a return on equity of 13 12 which indicates that the bank is going in the right direction since this value is higher than the average in the banking industry all in all citigroup stock is worth a buy since it has been doing well lately the metrics also show the bank s potential to perform even better next year if the further exits and sales of the international markets go well the bank s stock will certainly do well too final take as evident from the current standing of citigroup bank it s straightforward that investors should consider putting their money in citigroup stock the bank is expected to undergo major transformations in the coming year too the earnings report for the last quarter of 2021 along with an insight into the company s full blown transformation plans will further help determine how much potential the stock has good to know the tangible book value is the worth of an organization if it were liquidated at the moment citigroup is trading at nearly 80 of its tangible book value thus there s a good opportunity for investors to buy shares in one of the largest banks and a well established organization in the investment banking space information is accurate as of dec 27 2021 editorial note this content is not provided by citibank any opinions analyses

the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all the cdc recommends a five day quarantine then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days also in the news apple is temporarily not allowing customers to shop inside its retail stores in

eve parties a little champagne and a kiss are fine but americans should stay away from big parties this new year s eve dr anthony fauci said monday fauci said in an interview on cnn that people should avoid the gatherings where they don t know the vaccination status of all the guests the omicron variant is fueling another infection surge and crowded indoor parties could accelerate spread when you are talking about a new year s eve party where you have 30 40 50 people celebrating you do not know the status of the vaccination i would recommend strongly stay away from that this year fauci said there will be other years to do that but not this year biden promises to ramp up access to testing president joe biden conceded monday that his administration has not done enough to provide access to coronavirus testing and promised to step up the effort earlier this month the biden administration touted a plan to combat the latest surge that included 500 million free tests but those test haven t begun rolling out yet and demand for tests before holiday gatherings set off a rush that depleted stocks in most pharmacies and other locations seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do biden said during a call with the white house covid 19 response team and several governors we re doing it he said that starting in two weeks private insurance will reimburse people for the cost of at home test and that the government will provide access to free tests for people without insurance thousands more flights canceled delayed airlines canceled and delayed thousands more flights monday amid a staffing crisis caused by the nationwide surge in covid 19 cases fueled by the omicron variant this after more than 1 500 flights within into or out of the u s were canceled sunday and over 6 000 delayed the tracking website flightaware reported several airlines said the scheduling issues were caused by staffing problems tied to covid 19 jetblue spokesperson derek dombrowski said the airline has seen an increasing number of sick calls because of the fast spreading omicron variant the company entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels since the start of the pandemic he said he warned that additional cancellations and delays remain a possibility the omicron variant is proving to be much more contagious than the delta

wong us should consider vaccine mandate for us air travel dr anthony fauci says dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the u s should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel signaling a potential embrace of an idea the biden administration has previously eschewed as covid 19 cases spike fauci the president s chief science adviser on the pandemic response said such a mandate might drive up the nation s lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights for which federal regulations require all those age 2 and older to wear a mask when you make vaccination a requirement that s another incentive to get more people vaccinated fauci told msnbc if you want to do that with domestic flights i think that s something that seriously should be considered the biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel two officials said biden s science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president the u s currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the u s be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus though citizens and permanent residents only need to show proof of a negative test taken within a day of boarding new york city begins requiring vaccinations for private sector businesses private employers operating in

securities laws these forward looking statements are based upon ilpt s present beliefs and expectations but these statements and the implications of these statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur for various reasons some of which are beyond ilpt s control for example this press release states that the joint venture plans to incur approximately 134 million of debt secured by the properties in early 2022 however the joint venture may be unable to obtain debt financing in early 2022 or at all and any debt financing arrangement the joint venture may enter into may not be on the terms ilpt expects or desires as a result ilpt may receive lower total net proceeds from this transaction than it currently expects mr murray states that the sale of properties to the joint venture announced today underscores the value of ilpt s industrial real estate this may imply that ilpt s remaining portfolio may have similar value or that ilpt could finance those properties in similar joint venture or other transactions however the value of ilpt s properties may not be similar to the value of the six properties that are the subject of the sale announced today further property values change and may decline in addition investors and other financing sources may not agree to finance any of those properties mr murray states in this press release that the sale of properties to the joint venture underscores the strength of ilpt s relationships with strong institutional private capital partners this may imply that ilpt will engage in additional transactions with its joint venture partners and that ilpt will find additional capital partners or enter into additional joint ventures in the future however ilpt may not engage in additional transactions with its joint venture partners and ilpt may not be able to identify other suitable capital partners in the future in addition any future joint venture arrangements ilpt may enter into may not be successful mr murray s states that this transaction will enable ilpt to raise efficient equity capital that will be used to reduce leverage and increase financing capacity to fund future growth plans this may imply that ilpt s leverage will be sustained at this reduced level however ilpt has a revolving credit facility under which it may borrow repay and reborrow amounts and ilpt may seek to obtain additional debt financing in the future as such ilpt may not maintain the reduced leverage it achieves by completing this transaction and may not have increased financing capacity to fund future growth plans mr murray states in this press release that ilpt looks forward to both continuing to expand its private capital vehicle and enhancing value for ilpt shareholders over the long term however ilpt may not be able to raise or deploy additional private capital in the future or its capital partners may fail to fund their required capital contributions further any raising and deployment of additional capital may not increase value for ilpt s shareholders and ilpt may not realize the value to its shareholders it expects from this joint venture the information contained in ilpt s filings with the

the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all the cdc recommends a five day quarantine then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days also in the news apple is temporarily not allowing customers to shop inside its retail stores in

eve parties a little champagne and a kiss are fine but americans should stay away from big parties this new year s eve dr anthony fauci said monday fauci said in an interview on cnn that people should avoid the gatherings where they don t know the vaccination status of all the guests the omicron variant is fueling another infection surge and crowded indoor parties could accelerate spread when you are talking about a new year s eve party where you have 30 40 50 people celebrating you do not know the status of the vaccination i would recommend strongly stay away from that this year fauci said there will be other years to do that but not this year biden promises to ramp up access to testing president joe biden conceded monday that his administration has not done enough to provide access to coronavirus testing and promised to step up the effort earlier this month the biden administration touted a plan to combat the latest surge that included 500 million free tests but those test haven t begun rolling out yet and demand for tests before holiday gatherings set off a rush that depleted stocks in most pharmacies and other locations seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do biden said during a call with the white house covid 19 response team and several governors we re doing it he said that starting in two weeks private

jetblue spokesperson derek dombrowski said the airline has seen an increasing number of sick calls because of the fast spreading omicron variant the company entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels since the start of the pandemic he said he warned that additional cancellations and delays remain a possibility the omicron variant is proving to be much more contagious than the delta

wong us should consider vaccine mandate for us air travel dr anthony fauci says dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the u s should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel signaling a potential embrace of an idea the biden administration has previously eschewed as covid 19 cases spike fauci the president s chief science adviser on the pandemic response said such a mandate might drive up the nation s lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights for which federal regulations require all those age 2 and older to wear a mask when you make vaccination a requirement that s another incentive to get more people vaccinated fauci told msnbc if you want to do that with domestic flights i think that s something that seriously should be considered the biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel two officials said biden s science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president the u s currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the u s be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus though citizens and

it s a good time to be a company that sells a test at home covid diagnostics kit what happened monday was a very good day for stocks in general but it was a standout day for healthcare diagnostics specialist cue health hlth 0 24 in retrospect the stock s nearly 22 leap wasn t surprising as the current state of the world plays perfectly to the company s strength so what on its website cue health isn t shy to point out that it s the maker of the first molecular diagnostic test for covid 19 approved by the u s food and drug administration fda so as far as coronavirus testing goes the company was a first mover with a product that is relatively better established than others cue health s covid diagnostic test is also a product that can be administered at home with no training the appeal of such a test is clear and obvious in an environment when cases are growing precipitously due to the omicron variant although early research suggests that the variant isn t as lethal as its predecessors it s still very much a threat particularly to the immuno compromised and other vulnerable populations the latest variants are understandably significantly boosting the healthcare company s fundamentals on the solid foundation of its covid testing product the company s total revenue grew by a robust 63 quarter over quarter in q3 on a year over year basis product revenue expanded more than one hundred fold now what demand for cue health s covid test should only rise in the coming weeks this will be aided by additional regulatory approvals such as the one granted on dec 1 by singapore s health sciences authority corporate interest will also probably increase last week the company announced it was partnering with air canada to give american passengers access to the cue health test in order to satisfy coronavirus screening requirements for visiting that country

the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all the cdc recommends a five day quarantine then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days also in the news apple is temporarily not allowing customers to shop inside its retail stores in

eve parties a little champagne and a kiss are fine but americans should stay away from big parties this new year s eve dr anthony fauci said monday fauci said in an interview on cnn that people should avoid the gatherings where they don t know the vaccination status of all the guests the omicron variant is fueling another infection surge and crowded indoor parties could accelerate spread when you are talking about a new year s eve party where you have 30 40 50 people celebrating you do not know the status of the vaccination i would recommend strongly stay away from that this year fauci said there will be other years to do that but not this year biden promises to ramp up access to testing president joe biden conceded monday that his administration has not done enough to provide access to coronavirus testing and promised to step up the effort earlier this month the biden administration touted a plan to combat the latest surge that included 500 million free tests but those test haven t begun rolling out yet and demand for tests before holiday gatherings set off a rush that depleted stocks in most pharmacies and other locations seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do biden said during a call with the white house covid 19 response team and several governors we re doing it he said that starting in two weeks private insurance will reimburse people for the cost of at home test and that the government will provide access to free tests for people without insurance thousands more flights canceled delayed airlines canceled and delayed thousands more flights monday amid a staffing crisis caused by the nationwide surge in covid 19 cases fueled by the omicron variant this after more than 1 500 flights within into or out of the u s were canceled sunday and over 6 000 delayed the tracking website flightaware reported several airlines said the scheduling issues were caused by staffing problems tied to covid 19 jetblue spokesperson derek dombrowski said the airline has seen an increasing number of sick calls because of the fast spreading omicron variant the company entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels since the start of the pandemic he said he warned that additional cancellations and delays remain a possibility the omicron variant is proving to be much more contagious than the delta

wong us should consider vaccine mandate for us air travel dr anthony fauci says dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the u s should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel signaling a potential embrace of an idea the biden administration has previously eschewed as covid 19 cases spike fauci the president s chief science adviser on the pandemic response said such a mandate might drive up the nation s lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights for which federal regulations require all those age 2 and older to wear a mask when you make vaccination a requirement that s another incentive to get more people vaccinated fauci told msnbc if you want to do that with domestic flights i think that s something that seriously should be considered the biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel two officials said biden s science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president the u s currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the u s be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus though citizens and

complex in september while flanked by chief justice luke malaba left conrad mupesa mashonaland west bureau the year 2021 will go down memory lane for mashonaland west province as it recorded several successes whose results seek to turn around the country s economy and create employment while defining the devolution agenda devolution was adopted as a key component of the new constitution of zimbabwe which promotes democratic participation in government by all citizens and communities and devolution of power and responsibilities to lower tiers of government in zimbabwe the policy is one of the major anchors of unity which encompasses inclusive development to promote representative accountable participatory inclusive governance and socio economic development and the agriculture seeks to propel zimbabwe towards vision 2030 of making the nation an upper middle class economy being an agro and mining based community various projects in line with these industries were commissioned by

breeding project whose expectations are to boost milk and beef prospects as the country works to improve the national herd under the livestock growth plan by growing the sector to us 1 9 billion by 2025 zimplats has also expanded the scheme to chegutu and mhondoro ngezi districts communities paying attention to providing them with better beef and dairy breeds in addition zimplats has expended thousands of united states dollars to import some expensive wagyu japanese cattle breed president mnangagwa said during the launch of the us 15 million cattle ranching project in mhondoro ngezi that the venture was a demonstration that the two mainstays of the country mining and agriculture can co exist the project dovetailed with government scheme of increasing the cattle numbers from a 2019 baseline of 5 4 million to 6 million in 2025 with a beef production of 90 000 tonnes and milk production from 79 9 million litres to 150 million litres are some of the targets of the livestock growth plan the programme also aims at increasing the national dairy herd from 38 000 in 2019 to 60 000 by 2025 a target herd of 10 000 cattle comprising 5 000 beef and 5 000 dairy cattle is earmarked while

returns mhondoro ngezi and chegutu communities have also started benefiting under out grower schemes through access to fodder grass and other stock feed such as maize and traditional grains the

and productivity a free cattle cross breeding programme where locals will trade in their fully fledged cattle in exchange of a better cattle breed including the wagyu was mulled chief ngezi born peter pasipamire said locals were eager to try the new breed for an economic turnover the wagyu beef is one of the most expensive meats in the world fetching above us 400 per kilogram and famed for its tender and though it differs by region the meat remains good even for heart health related issues on average according to the wagyu breeders association the cows can sell for as much as us 30 000 and the calf fetches 40 times the price of ordinary cattle to tap into the lucrative business zimplats in a joint partnership with palmline holdings seeks to produce 630 tonnes of wagyu beef for export by 2026 already 178 wagyu cows of various ages are at the ranch with plans for more to be bought reported zimplats in a statement the cattle ranch sitting on an 11 000 hectare area under zimplats is

empowering communities around them to draw lessons the university is commended for rolling out a robust artificial insemination programme for the production of adequate semen to grow our national livestock herd the commercial production of animal feed to supplement free range grazing for our livestock and wildlife is also applauded president mnangagwa said the project was going to help modernised dairy milk production and processing systems for the university and surrounding farmers while help the agricultural recovery plan towards making zimbabwe a breadbasket of the region his

dna special pharma companies do not want covid 19 to end know the business model of fear at present all the pharma companies in the world are making vaccines used to be at loss till covid 19 now we will tell you about the business model of fear going on all over the world because there is someone who does not want the fear of covid 19 to ever end from your mind these are the big pharma companies that make the medicines for covid 19 who want the fear of the virus to stay in your mind forever and their vaccine continues to be sold every year at high prices the first case of the omicron variant was detected on 24 november in south africa but the world came to know about it completely in the first week of december the atmosphere of fear created by this made the companies making vaccines rich that is your fear has become a cash printing machine for these companies due to the omicron variant 8 investors of america s pfizer and moderna company alone benefited 10 billion us dollars i e rs 75 thousand crore in a week due to the new variants the prices of shares of these companies reached the sky in the stock market overnight think when the new variant of corona is making these companies thousands of crores of rupees why would these companies want to see the pandemic end for them the new variant is like a new product on which nothing is spent but the profit is rs 75 thousand crores that is like the same business model of fear under which weapons were sold first and then fear of those weapons produced more weapons to save the world at present all the pharma companies in the world are making vaccines used to be at loss till covid 19 in the year 2020 moderna was in loss of about rs 4 000 crores but this year as soon as its vaccine came in the market its total revenue became 7 billion dollars i e rs 52 500 crores that is it became a billionaire company directly from the loss similarly the total revenue of pfizer in the year 2020 was 8 billion dollars i e about rs 60 000 crores but in 2021 its revenue has become 19 billion dollars i e rs 1 42 000 crore and this has happened because of covid 19 and its fear there has also been a tremendous jump in the revenue of serum institute of india a company that manufactures covishield in india in the year 2020 the total income of serum institute of india was rs 5 446 crore out of which it earned a profit of rs 2 251 crore accordingly his profit in total income was 41 percent think of it in such a way that out of every 100 rupees 41 rupees was the profit of this company in the year 2020 among the companies which did a business of more than five thousand crores the highest profit was from the serum institute of india however it is not that this profit happened only to the serum institute of india the revenue of bharat biotech and other companies has also reached the sky in the last one year and these companies have become so rich that today they are influencing the politics and economic affairs of small and poor countries too the companies that make vaccines have a secret deal with every country serum institute of india offers a dose of covishield for rs 215 to the government of india while the cost of a single dose for argentina and african countries is up to rs 3 000 pfizer company spends only a dollar for making one dose that is it spends only about rs 75 despite this pfizer sells one dose for 30 dollars i e rs 2200 in rich countries and poor countries also have to pay the same amount now it is believed that these companies do this so that the vaccine does not reach small and poor countries and new variants of corona keep getting there for example omicron is found in south africa no power in the world can defeat the new variants of the virus until all 800 crore people of the world get the vaccine and this is what is happening in the world right now in rich countries and especially in western countries booster dose has also started after the vaccine but african countries are yearning for a vaccine in the us 20 percent of all vaccines being given are booster doses that is one booster dose out of every five apart from this rich countries have hoarded vaccines to for booster doses america currently has so many vaccines that it can vaccinate its entire population twice more whereas canada can apply three more booster doses to its entire population this is the situation when who has not yet made any official policy on booster dose but now you compare it with african countries where only 8 percent of the people have got the vaccine so far that is the full formula of profit is that rich countries will save their population and economy by applying booster doses and the new variants of the virus that will spread from poor countries will benefit these companies and their countries overall the story is that the world s big pharma companies do not want to let the epidemic end rather they want that new variants of coronavirus should keep coming and this world should never be the same as it was before 2020

the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at

eve parties a little champagne and a kiss are fine but americans should stay away from big parties this new year s eve dr anthony fauci said monday fauci said in an interview on cnn that people should avoid the gatherings where they don t know the vaccination status of all the guests the omicron variant is fueling another infection surge and crowded indoor parties could accelerate spread when you are talking about a new year s eve party where you have 30 40 50 people celebrating you do not know the status of the vaccination i would recommend strongly stay away from that this year fauci said there will be other years to do that but not this year biden promises to ramp up access to testing president joe biden conceded monday that his administration has not done enough to provide access to coronavirus testing and promised to step up the effort earlier this month the biden administration touted a plan to combat the latest surge that included 500 million free tests but those test haven t begun rolling out yet and demand for tests before holiday gatherings set off a rush that depleted stocks in most pharmacies and other locations seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do biden said during a call with the white house covid 19 response team and several governors we re doing it he said that starting in two weeks private insurance will reimburse people for the cost of at home test and that the government will provide access to free tests for people without insurance thousands more flights canceled delayed airlines

or out of the u s were canceled sunday and over 6 000 delayed the tracking website flightaware reported several airlines said the scheduling issues were caused by staffing problems tied to covid 19 jetblue spokesperson derek dombrowski said the airline has seen an increasing number of sick calls because of the fast spreading omicron variant the company entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels since the start of the pandemic he said he warned that additional cancellations and delays remain a possibility the omicron variant is proving to be much more contagious than the delta

at child care locations large scale regular testing remains rare in the child care world but the idea is gaining traction as omicron works its way into communities families are fighting to keep their

wong us should consider vaccine mandate for us air travel dr anthony fauci says dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the u s should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel signaling a potential embrace of an idea the biden administration has previously eschewed as covid 19 cases spike fauci the president s chief science adviser on the pandemic response said such a mandate might drive up the nation s lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights for which federal regulations require all those age 2 and older to wear a mask when you make vaccination a requirement that s another incentive to get more people vaccinated fauci told msnbc if you want to do that with domestic flights i think that s something that seriously should be considered the biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel two officials said biden s science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president the u s currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the u s be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus though citizens and permanent residents only need to show proof of a negative test taken within a day of boarding new york city begins requiring vaccinations for private sector businesses private employers operating in

like like love haha wow sad angry 2 thyblackman com there have been countless reports recommendations rule changes investigations civilian checks and balances on the lapd and black live matters protests it s as if none of these things ever happened or meant little to nothing the lapd s wanton reckless and outrageous slaying of 14 year old valentina orellana peralta is grim testimony to that it s worse if that can be said than that the lapd shootings are drastically up from a year ago over twenty to be exact even when the lapd shot fewer people the death toll from the shootings has remained high now we have the peralta slaying this again rammed home the perennially troubling issue of what when and how lapd officers should use non lethal force in the peralta slaying the official version is that officers responded to a violent incident call at a burlington store in north hollywood there were reported shots and a gunman no gun was found and no evidence of shots there is no dispute that she posed no threat to the officers what makes the peralta saying even more outrageous is that it and the other lapd shootings come in the wake of the historic legislation the state legislature passed last january 1 2020 it mandated strict training accountability and discipline procedures for the use of force by officers since the law was passed however the number of shootings some questionable has not dropped the lapd shooting sprees are a prime example the one certainty in the latest killing is that it s not an isolated case of deadly force used by the lapd so the question again in the latest shooting is did she have to die the stock answer is that whenever a suspect poses a direct threat to an officer or an officer responds to a potentially life threatening incident he or she can use whatever force is necessary up to and including deadly force in more cases than not this is a strictly subjective judgment call and in almost all cases officers that use lethal force are shielded from prosecution in the absence of iron clad proof of wrongdoing no lapd officer has been prosecuted for the use of deadly force on duty no matter how questionable in many years a prosecution must leap a mountainous bar that requires the testimony of another officer a smoking gun body or dashcam recording or a preponderance of consistent testimony from civilian eyewitnesses that the killing was unjustified even then the victim must have been unarmed and in most cases not in the commission of a crime but what if the victim is armed with a knife stick screwdriver or any other non firearm weapon and the victim is a woman and suffers from mental or emotional challenges the lapd and other police departments have long grappled with these thorny questions there is no one size fits all answer police departments have an array of non lethal weapons that include bean bags tasers stun guns rubber and wooden bullets pepper spray and of course shouts commands and attempts to talk down a suspect but in the event of any sudden movement toward an officer all bets are off the outcome is almost always predictable namely the use of deadly force yet there are many cases where officers have subdued a suspect who has directly confronted an officer with a knife or other potentially lethal weapon without firing a shot and without incurring injury to themselves or the suspect while the use of force levels will even in the best case situations remain a judgment call there still must be clear policy guidelines that spell out the likely situations in which non lethal force can and must be used there are court rulings that give solid guidance on this one is the supreme court decision in 1985 that forbids police officers from shooting a fleeing person unless the individual poses a significant physical threat to the officer in all such cases where there is no threat the officer must use and continue to use non lethal force in foot chases officers have options to call for back up employ aerial surveillance and cordon off a perimeter a sweeping national institute of justice study in 2011 on the use of non lethal force found that injuries to officers and suspects markedly decreased with the use of non lethal devices from tasers to pepper spray it also recommended that good policies and training requirements that officers evaluate the age size sex apparent physical capabilities and health concerns of a suspect in determining what level and type of force to be used the answer to the question of whether the use of deadly force in the slaying of peralta was necessary should be beyond any doubt it s a resounding no this makes it even more compelling for lapd officials and the l a police commission to take an even harder look at when on whom and in what circumstances non lethal force should be used this is not just a matter of life and death it s also a matter of good public and police policy the family of valentina orellana peralta deserves no less written by earl ofari hutchinson one can find more info about mr hutchinson over at the following site thehutchinson report also feel free to connect with him through

into 2022 the report was authored by bruce mehlman a founding partner of the washington d c based consulting firm mehlman castagnetti rosen thomas and former assistant secretary of commerce in the george w bush administration mehlman advises prominent companies to understand and prepare for emerging trends and risks critical to the ever evolving policy environment mehlman outlined over 20 risks in politics and policy and the daily caller news foundation identified eight of the most significant concerns the risks included covid 19 extreme weather inflation supply chain issues stock market bubble biden s perception decoupling between u s and china and employee activism inflation softness in the white house and pandemic uncertainty make up some of the biggest risks to the u s economy in 2022 according to a washington consulting firm every quarter i take a macro look at trends driving politics and policy looking both backward and forwards and identify where key political risks may lurk and where political opportunities may present themselves bruce mehlman former assistant secretary of commerce in the george w bush administration told the daily caller news foundation the most recent analysis targets 2022 and identifies the emerging risks business and government leaders should anticipate and prepare for a founding partner of the washington d c based consulting firm mehlman castagnetti rosen thomas mehlman advises prominent companies to understand and prepare for emerging trends and risks critical to the ever evolving policy environment mehlman s report living in limbo anticipating the top 2022 risks in politics and policy outlined over 20 risks in politics and policy and the daily caller news foundation identified eight of the most significant concerns covid the fourth wave looking forward to the risks covid 19 poses heading into 2022 mehlman believes the virus won t suddenly disappear but also won t wipe out humanity he explained to the dcnf i am not an epidemiologist but it feels to me that this is the best example where all expectations are either 1 or 11 you hear it either a common cold or that we will all get sick and die mehlman told the dcnf instead mehlman sees an endemic situation comparing it to a bad flu strain that will have a new flavor each year he explained to the dcnf at some point we need to get to accepting that it will never go away and that it is not going to kill everybody mehlman told the dcnf the risks are overhyped and the preventions are under embraced he told the dcnf adding that those preventions include mass vaccinations and wearing masks when bad outbreaks occur in south africa we re thankfully seeing a striking decoupling between new covid cases and icu admissions and deaths whether omicron is inherently less virulent whether this hopeful finding is result of baseline immunity in infected or a combination of both is still unclear pic twitter com xtmcsdpcnc scott gottlieb md scottgottliebmd december 19 2021 covid 19 cases continue to soar throughout the country and globe after the emergence of the omicron variant over 90 countries have reported omicron cases forcing some to implement new lockdown rules cases in the u s increased to over 156 000 on friday with the new variant now reported in 43 u s states according to the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc said monday the omicron variant has become the dominant strain in the u s making up 73 of reported cases while cases continue to surge deaths have not increased at the same rate as some believe the new variant is less dangerous than previous strains extreme weather disasters in 2021 we saw an influx in extreme weather disasters increasing costs challenging supply chains and driving policy mehlman explained to the dcnf so far these policies have disfavored fossil fuels reducing investments and inventories causing severe energy inflation mehlman told the dcnf increased severe weather disasters pose a serious risk to insurers mehlman added insurers use historical data to price risk we are increasingly seeing 500 year record floods and other disasters that are out of proportion to what was witnessed in the past mehlman told the dcnf these insurers are now being asked to cover things that you didn t think would be insuring things that would be this bad because historically they haven t been mehlman told the dcnf they are now covering people who didn t use to be in harm s way but as a result of changing weather disasters they are now at risk mehlman added pointing to the recent winter freeze in texas a massive ice storm hit texas in february leaving millions without power as the state s power grid became ineffective after it was coated with ice the estimated cost was over 18 million in damages making it one of the most expensive storms for insurers on record manufacturers supply chains there are short term medium term and long term problems facing supply chains entering 2022 mehlman told the dcnf the short term risk is the global employee semi conductor and energy shortages exacerbated by politics medium term challenges for supply chains are the rising theme of economic nationalism mehlman told the dcnf headwinds that made global supply chains so efficient from 1989 through 2019 are fading posing the greatest long term risks u s and chinese economies used to be tied together now they are splitting apart technology used to encourage greater cross border data flows but now regulators are attempting to shut them down mehlman told the dcnf consumer inflation continued inflation will continue to challenge the biden administration s agenda mehlman told the dcnf soaring prices will determine how the federal reserve pursues its monetary policy heading into 2022 how much money the government will try and spend on safety nets and infrastructure and if the administration will continue its antitrust competition reviews mehlman added the companies the administration plans to go after are also probably some of the most productive companies in the economy he told the dcnf inflation has soared to its highest level in 39 years with the consumer price index jumping 0 9 in november bringing the key inflation indicator s year over year increase to 6 8 the producer price index which measures inflation at the wholesale level surged 9 6 year over year as of november growing at the fastest rate ever measured growing inflation along with falling unemployment triggered the federal reserve to accelerate its asset purchasing stimulus while also forecasting three interest rate hikes in 2022 according to cnbc markets irrational exuberance the biggest threat stock markets face in 2022 is potential financial bubbles that would persist as the fed tightens its monetary policy according to mehlman s report the market is clearly out of all its historic wack mehlman told the dcnf the fact that in the last year we saw as much money invested in equities as the last prior 19 years is not normal the fact that so many stocks are down but the biggest five to 10 are off the charts up is also very unusual he added mehlman identified elements of a robust stock market with justified profits but also noticed characteristics of a bubble he told the dcnf stock markets tumbled monday as the spread of the omicron variant triggered lockdowns in european countries the dow jones industrial average dipped 433 28 points at the end of the trading day monday while the s p 500 fell 1 1 and the nasdaq declined 1 2 according to cnbc biden perceived softness president joe biden s perceived softness will serve his political risk entering 2022 according to the report mehlman pointed to biden s softness on the border economy crime and foreign policy as his approval rating continues to plummet and more americans see growing failures and weakness in the respective categories biden and the democrats will have a harder time passing legislation mehlman explained to the dcnf a president with high approval is more feared and followed legislatively it will be harder for him to get people to do what he wants and will also be dangerous news for down the ballot democrats mehlman told the dcnf roughly 46 of respondents approved of biden s handling of the covid 19 pandemic while 48 disapproved according to a recent cnbc survey biden s economic approval also plummeted with 37 approving and 56 disapproving biden s disapproval rating surged once again on monday reaching 55 according to an npr pbs news hour marist poll multinationals u s china decoupling looking at the future of u s china relations mehlman saw a steady decoupling between the two world powers but people shouldn t assume everything will catch on fire he told the dcnf both leaders will balance assertiveness and accommodation mehlman wrote in the report businesses should plan for neither detente nor war but stead decoupling with tightening restrictions both nations need to show that they are tough but they both want to avoid a war and a recession both want to challenge big tech but they also want to remain as an innovation powerhouse mehlman told the dcnf brands employee activism business leaders have seen increasing employee activism after the trump administration and george floyd s murder to urge businesses to become engaged in non traditional issues mehlman told the dcnf company leaders now have to address employees urging their employers to combat growing liberal issues or run the risk of getting canceled we found that as business leaders begin to think about political risks some of the risks are the politics within the office place as opposed to national politics mehlman told the dcnf business leaders are trying to decide when it is appropriate to weigh in on issues like

the centers for disease control and prevention has cut the amount of time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus reducing the number of days from 10 to five health officials similarly reduced the amount of time a person should quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive the changes come amid a surge in cases spurred by the omicron variant and concerns about staffing shortages at hospitals airlines and businesses across the country research has suggested omicron while more infectious causes milder illness cdc officials say the new guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop cdc director rochelle walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases not all of those cases are going to be severe in fact many are going to be asymptomatic she said monday we want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science last week the agency loosened rules that had called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive the new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms and the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages the cdc s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public and the new recommendations are happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance said lindsay wiley an american university public health law expert isolation recommendations are for those who are infected with the coronavirus and start on the day a person tests positive the agency recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period quarantines are defined differently because the term refers to those who are in close contact with someone who tests positive the cdc had recommended that unvaccinated people who come into close contact with someone who tested positive should quarantine for 10 days the agency had said those who were vaccinated could skip a quarantine the cdc is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days if a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all the cdc recommends a five day quarantine then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days also in the news apple is temporarily not allowing customers to shop inside its retail stores in

eve parties a little champagne and a kiss are fine but americans should stay away from big parties this new year s eve dr anthony fauci said monday fauci said in an interview on cnn that people should avoid the gatherings where they don t know the vaccination status of all the guests the omicron variant is fueling another infection surge and crowded indoor parties could accelerate spread when you are talking about a new year s eve party where you have 30 40 50 people celebrating you do not know the status of the vaccination i would recommend strongly stay away from that this year fauci said there will be other years to do that but not this year biden promises to ramp up access to testing president joe biden conceded monday that his administration has not done enough to provide access to coronavirus testing and promised to step up the effort earlier this month the biden administration touted a plan to combat the latest surge that included 500 million free tests but those test haven t begun rolling out yet and demand for tests before holiday gatherings set off a rush that depleted stocks in most pharmacies and other locations seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do biden said during a call with the white house covid 19 response team and several governors we re doing it he said that starting in two weeks private insurance will reimburse people for the cost of at home test and that the government will provide access to free tests for people without insurance thousands more flights canceled delayed airlines canceled and delayed thousands more flights monday amid a staffing crisis caused by the nationwide surge in covid 19 cases fueled by the omicron variant this after more than 1 500 flights within into

jetblue spokesperson derek dombrowski said the airline has seen an increasing number of sick calls because of the fast spreading omicron variant the company entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels since the start of the pandemic he said he warned that additional cancellations and delays remain a possibility the omicron variant is proving to be much more contagious than the delta

wong us should consider vaccine mandate for us air travel dr anthony fauci says dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the u s should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel signaling a potential embrace of an idea the biden administration has previously eschewed as covid 19 cases spike fauci the president s chief science adviser on the pandemic response said such a mandate might drive up the nation s lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights for which federal regulations require all those age 2 and older to wear a mask when you make vaccination a requirement that s another incentive to get more people vaccinated fauci told msnbc if you want to do that with domestic flights i think that s something that seriously should be considered the biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel two officials said biden s science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president the u s currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the u s be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus though citizens and permanent residents only need to show proof of a negative test taken within a day of boarding new york city begins requiring vaccinations for private sector businesses private employers operating in

stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 16 2021 this video was recorded on dec 16 2021 chris hill it s thursday december 16th welcome to market foolery i m chris hill with me from the financial capital of the united states of america maria gallagher thanks for being here maria gallagher thanks for having me chris hill we ve got some airline news we ve got another preview of this week s motley fool money year end review special we re going to start with maybe it s an overstatement to call it the stock of the day but it is doing well and its accenture first quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected for the consulting firm accenture also raised guidance for the full fiscal year and the stock up seven percent today this is about as good as it gets i think if you re an accenture shareholder maria gallagher yeah the quarter was pretty much as good as it gets you have total revenue up 27 percent you had growth in all areas 26 percent growth in north america 28 percent growth in europe 30 percent growth in their growing markets they increased their quarterly dividend up 10 percent to 97 cents a share they repurchased 2 4 million shares they raised their business outlook and they added 50 000 people to their workforce this quarter to a total of 674 000 people i just think the growth that accenture has is so impressive with the size it s one of those companies where you think it can t keep growing at this very steady very strong pace and it keeps proving that it can it was really just a knock out of the park as they say chris hill i m still reeling from how many people work at accenture maria gallagher so many people work at accenture chris hill because this is a 250 billion dollar company i don t know i just wouldn t have guessed it was that many going back to motley fool money on last week show this was ron gross radar stock when you look at 2022 and beyond what stands out to you in terms of what accenture is attempting to do that you find impressive as an analyst maria gallagher i think that their business model is really impressive i think their ceo is really impressive and all of those types of business statistics but one of the other things that i d want to talk about too with accenture is their sustainability is one of the leading in the industry i think they have really concrete goals they have pledges to help keep global warming below 1 5 degree celsius reducing greenhouse gas emissions they ve reduced 65 percent of their total emissions from 2016 they re working on being powered by 100 percent renewable electricity they do pay equity every year they re really transparent about it in 2021 dollar for dollar there was 100 percent pay equity between genders between races they re moving toward zero waste and they re talking about things like committing to eliminating single use plastic in all locations when you think about how many people work there how many offices they have those moves really matter i think as well as being a leader in the industry for so many different reasons i think that their sustainability is something i really admire about them chris hill who s competing with them when i think about global consulting firms i guess deloitte is there as well but i don t know it just seems like accenture is such a behemoth maria gallagher yeah it s in a league of its own in terms of competition i think a lot of times that s the one you think of you have deloitte you have bcg you have these other global consulting firms but i think accenture does it in a really sustainable way i think they do it in a really compassionate way in terms of what i ve heard in the way that they talk to their businesses they are just really a leader in the field and continue to be and so i think that s what s really impressive it s one of those companies really like where it can get bigger it can get better and they continue to outperform themselves chris hill delta air lines is a month away from its next earnings report but the company is now projecting a fourth quarter profit of 200 million which is nice because analysts had been expecting a loss delta says it is seeing higher demand this holiday season shares were up earlier in the morning but by early afternoon they re slightly negative there are couple different things i want to get to with delta but in terms of the projection here i m a little surprised that the bloom got off the rose that quickly not that i was expecting the stock to pop 10 15 percent or something like that but this seems like legitimately good news from a business in let s just call it a challenge industry maria gallagher yeah i would say i m not too surprised based on all the news we re having in the past couple days with omicron and continued variance and the stagnation in boosters and the rise of cases globally i think so much of these airline stocks it s just really tied to this macroeconomic news while it s good news that they can make a profit then people are saying well what s going to happen the quarter after what s going to happen in the next three weeks what s going to happen in the month how many people are going to cancel their holiday plans or their new year s plans they are saying that they have new assumptions for 2024 to get them back to pre pandemic profit levels they re hoping for operating margins in the mid teens operating cash flow of over nine billion liquidity between five and six billion they re working on trying to get back to those pre pandemic levels but i think so much of it ends up being macroeconomic focus international travel searches were up 155 percent year over year domestic travel searches were up 211 percent year over year in the past couple of weeks but they re still down 50 and 40 percent from 2019 levels we re continuing to see that surge in domestic traveling which is much more rental cars and much less planes the demand for rental cars in the us is up 229 percent compared to 2019 alone and so they re thinking there s probably going to another rental car shortage this holiday season if anyone else has seen that episode of seinfeld where they get to the rental car place and they say that he has actually just rented the idea of a car feels like that might happen to a lot of people it s good news but i just think the macroeconomic environment is one such that i am interested to see how it shakes out over the next year because i think it s going to continue to be a bumpy ride chris hill it seems like on some level investors collectively are saying to delta air lines we don t believe you like no offense but we don t think you re going to get there because it s still a month till their earnings report and any enthusiasm that they might have seen any increase in demand that they might have seen it s not that we don t believe you ve seen that to this point it s that we don t think you re going to get there over the next 3 4 weeks maria gallagher yeah i think that s a fair assumption in saying well we think that maybe you had the idea of all these people coming and then in reality it s going to be very different because of all of the news that you have no control over i think that s always what s frustrating for a lot of these companies it s like well we re doing everything we can and there s this other thing that s happening these third party forces that are completely out of our control and especially i think with so many people leaning more into domestic travels and more into using trains and cars and buses as opposed to getting on a plane i think that that s still something that people are very nervous about i think that i am one of those people saying i think that that would be nice but i don t know we ll see chris hill yeah not to pick on delta air lines because we could be talking about any airline as an industry it just seems like for investors at this point in time there s not really a great reason to jump in on any of these stocks or if there is i m not seeing it as you said there are so many uncertainties so many things that are out of control of the airlines themselves that i don t know why would you jump in on delta or southwest or jetblue or any of these maria gallagher yeah i also think sometimes they re talking about here s the growth we re looking for and it s still not getting back to 2019 levels so they re still trying to fight an uphill battle to break even to what they were doing two years ago i feel like that s something else that people are thinking about i will say it s interesting just as a fun fact i was looking at research for this and a lot of people when they are choosing to travel in the next six months are really planning for beach vacations because of the top 10 travel destinations i think six of them are all beach destinations so that s a travel trend to look for chris hill that makes sense to me maria gallagher yeah i mean it s the winter chris hill it s the winter and most people don t live near a beach so yeah that makes sense maria gallagher i m just one of the few people who s trying to go to a colder place for vacation in the winter chris hill are you looking for a ski vacation because i m assuming at least here in the united states where we ve started winter that maybe the other four on the list are more sort of ski vacations maria gallagher no personally i was hoping to go to finland and meet some reindeer not ski but just hang out with some reindeer that was my goal chris hill all right i do want to get to the last thing but now i need to talk about reindeer so when you say meet reindeer you were planning on going out in the woods or is this a tour or something like that i m all for getting out in nature but it seems like if you run into the wrong pack of reindeer what was the plan maria gallagher no there is a national park outside of helsinki where you can go and you can feed the reindeer carrots chris hill okay maria gallagher then you can also do dog sledding i wouldn t just be walking around hoping to run into a reindeer i would have a plan to meet a reindeer chris hill okay and food maria gallagher yeah and the reindeer would know i was coming i wouldn t startle or scare them chris hill smart move for everyone involved that s a smart move on motley fool money this weekend we re going to be doing our year end review and part of that is one of the questions i m going to be asking people is about their investing discovery for 2021 and that can be a stock that you bought for the first time it could be a book you read it could be an investor that you started following on twitter or something like that so what s your investing discovery of 2021 maria gallagher i m going to go book i read and i just finished this yesterday the book is called the ascent of money by niall ferguson it goes through the history of money and it goes through banks the stock market the bond market the insurance market the housing market and international growth it s super fascinating it has a lot of shakespeare references talking about the banks and the merchant of venice it has a lot of really interesting political history as well as just understanding how often history repeats itself and how often in financial services the people who are making decisions are just a little too young to remember it from the last time around but how important it is to understand history he goes through long term capital management he goes through solomon brothers in 2008 2009 the book was written in 2008 so it s a really fascinating way to think about it so i think understanding the monetary system as it exists is so important especially right now as people are talking about the changing monetary system and inflation one of the things i learned is that the highest inflation rate in history was four quintillion and that was in hungary in 1918 so understanding inflation understanding interest rates i was a big fan i really learned a lot i would really recommend it to anybody chris hill maria gallagher great talking to you thanks for being here maria gallagher thanks so much for having me chris hill as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear that s going to do it for this edition of market foolery the show s mixed by dan boyd i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you on monday
tierney backus prepares traditional jewish foods for her family including matzo ball soup challah bread and latkes courtesy of tierney kristine backus lisbon tierney backus described her first attempt last year to make sufganiyot as an epic failure the sufganiyot is a jelly filled donut and among the comfort foods traditionally served during the jewish hanukkah celebration the 29 year old mother of three young boys was not discouraged she plans to try again soon but in the meantime she s been honing her skills and preparing family hanukkah favorites that included latkes and meat knish while mixing in some traditional jewish foods such as matzo ball soup and challah a braided egg bread the latkes are potato pancakes that can be topped with sour cream or apple sauce backus prefers lox or salmon on top traditional foods vary based on the different cultures where judaism exists backus has been all in on jewish foods over the past several years ever since she decided she was going to convert to judaism for orthodox and conservative jewish denominations judaism is a matrilineal religion if the mother is jewish the kids are jewish regardless of the father s religion the move to convert backus said was as much about finding her own religion as it was about about grounding her children in judaism backus and her husband cameron a tugboat operator met and married while serving in the navy and come from families with varied religious backgrounds she was raised catholic having attended catholic schools while growing up in nebraska but said her mother was a seventh day adventist and her father was lutheran her parents taught her the fundamentals of religion but opted to let her explore her own way and while her husband identified as jewish neither were living religious lifestyles and had drifted away from religious services until after their first child was born when we had kids we said we kind of have to pick a lane she said we were raising them the way we were raised backus had already learned a lot about judaism a religion that had always stuck out for her because of its customs and traditions it s not just a religion it s a community and an identity she said it was cameron s grandmother ann beth ostroff who helped pass along the cherished jewish traditions backus said she came to know and love the family spent time at ostroff s home in cape cod relying on her to lead the customs and faith practices that accompanied the jewish holidays she died of cancer in 2018 and backus said her absence left a big hole in both her and her husband s lives as well as a religious void she had a special place for me in my heart she would call me every week and ask how i was doing she became my psuedo bubby she said bubby is a yiddish term for grandmother it was after ostroff s death that backus started her work toward conversion to judaism in earnest and kind of went all in making her home a jewish home she used you tube videos as guidance for prayers during the initial hanukkah celebrations and has worked with a rabbi studied attended weekly services and celebrates shabbat the jewish sabbath starting at sunset every friday she officially converted in july and is a member of congregation beth el in new london backus has also worked to make a kosher home to be kosher means to follow jewish dietary laws that involve which foods and ingredients are permitted to be eaten how the food is produced and even how food is combined for instance it is not kosher to eat meat and dairy together pork is not kosher and as a general rule fish must have fins and scales shrimp lobsters crab and oysters are not kosher backus said she tries to be picky about meat and poultry looking for locally raised products where she can vegetarian dishes are typically kosher and a healthy way for the family to eat hanukkah is not among the most important holidays for jews rosh hashanah the jewish new year and yom kippur the day of atonement are considered high holy days rosh hashanah is associated with apples and honey and other sweet foods while yom kippur is a day of fasting hanukkah the festival of lights is an eight day celebration that commemorates the capture and rededication of the temple of jerusalem during the second century b c after occupation by the syrian greek empire legend has it that the jews led by judah the maccabee reclaimed the temple and when rededicating the temple menorah found enough oil to burn for just one day the oil miraculously burned for eight days the hanukkah or hanukkah menorah is an important part of the hanukkah celebration while it often falls in december hanukkah it is not associated with christmas and often does not fall on the same day every year instead the holiday falls on the 25th day of the month of kislev on the hebrew calendar hanukkah is typically a time to delve into fried foods for her latkes backus uses five pounds of shredded potatoes a shredded onion an egg and matzo meal to form the dumplings that cook in chicken stock she makes from scratch the memory of her husband s grandmother is still alive in her home since much of the jewish literary and historical materials known as judaica was passed on to her home but the backus family is quickly making their own traditions g smith theday com tierney backus prepares traditional jewish foods for the

beijing bloomberg china has unveiled sweeping regulations governing overseas share sales by the country s firms taking one of its biggest steps to tighten scrutiny on international debuts in the wake of didi global s controversial listing the regulations issued by the country s securities watchdog commerce ministry and top economic planning agency over the past week cast more uncertainty over the prospects for overseas initial public offerings ipos that had proceeded virtually unchecked for two decades the nasdaq golden dragon china index dropped 1 1 per cent overnight despite another all time high for us shares while the hang seng tech index slipped as much as 1 6 per cent on tuesday dec 28 dragged down by losses in tencent holdings and meituan chinese firms in industries banned from foreign investment will need to seek a waiver from a negative list before proceeding for share sales the national development and reform commission and the ministry of commerce said in a statement on monday overseas investors in such companies would be forbidden from participating in management and their total ownership would be capped at 30 per cent with a single investor holding no more than 10 per cent according to the updated list effective jan 1 meanwhile the china securities regulatory commission proposed on friday that all chinese companies seeking ipos and additional share sales abroad would have to register with the securities regulator any company whose listing could pose a national security threat would be banned from proceeding the overhaul represents a major step taken by beijing to tighten scrutiny on overseas listings after ride hailing giant didi proceeded with its new york ipo despite regulatory concerns over the security of its data while regulators stopped short of a ban on ipos by companies using the so called variable interest entities vie structure the new rules would make the process more difficult and costly it means chinese firms seeking to list abroad via vies may need to complete the compliance procedure with the commerce and economic planning ministries in addition to a cybersecurity review before getting the clearance under the csrc s proposed registration process said winston ma adjunct professor of nyu law school the new edicts on vies and listings indicate china s efforts to rein in its massive internet sector isn t abating after cracking down on areas from e commerce to fintech after school education gaming and online content beijing s attentions have turned to the risks posed by tech start ups as they seek access to foreign capital in a bid to expand in addition to the new rules on vies regulators had previously proposed that firms with at least a million users undergo a cybersecurity review before going public overseas vies have been a perennial worry for global investors given their shaky legal status pioneered by sina corp and its investment bankers during a 2000 ipo the vie framework has never been formally endorsed by beijing it has nevertheless enabled chinese companies to bypass rules on foreign investment in sensitive sectors including the internet industry the structure allows a chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity registered in places like the cayman islands or british virgin islands with shares that foreign investors can then own the requirements apply to new share listings and won t affect the foreign ownership of companies already listed overseas according to the ministry of commerce and ndrc companies using the vie structure would be allowed to pursue overseas ipos after meeting compliance requirements the securities regulator said on friday without providing further details foreign securities firms that underwrite chinese firms overseas share sales are required to register with the csrc and submit an annual report on the businesses that may create new compliance challenges to the foreign underwriters as they might need to follow chinese rules once they are registered with csrc said mr ma it s all part of a yearlong campaign to curb the breakneck growth of china s internet sector and what beijing has termed a reckless expansion of private capital curbing vies from foreign listings would close a gap that s been used for two decades by technology giants from alibaba group holding to tencent to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment and list offshore days after didi s mega us 4 4 billion ipo china shocked investors in july by announcing it was investigating the company and ordered its services be taken off chinese app stores tanking the ride hailing firm s shares didi said earlier this month that it would remove its american depositary shares from the new york stock exchange and pursue a listing in hong kong didi s stock tumbled 5 4 per cent in us trading on monday after the financial times reported that the firm has barred current and former employees from selling their shares indefinitely a lack of clarity on listing rules have hobbled the ability of upstarts and their marquee investors to cash in on their growth after the blockbuster debuts of companies like kuaishou technology at the start of the year several start ups expected to come to market have scrapped or put off their listing plans podcast app ximalaya and lifestyle platform xiaohongshu were among companies that had abandoned their preparations to sell shares in the us while bytedance the owner of the hit tiktok and douyin apps that s the world s most valuable start up has sought to douse fervent speculation of its own listing plans the heightened scrutiny by chinese regulators has been echoed by their us counterparts the securities and exchange commission this month announced its final plan for putting in place a new law that mandates foreign companies open their books to us scrutiny or risk being kicked off the new york stock exchange and nasdaq within three years china and hong kong are the only two jurisdictions that refuse to allow the inspections despite washington requiring them since 2002 for companies that seek to list under the vie structure the tougher oversight may affect their decision as to choosing the listing destinations said xia hailong a lawyer with shenlun law firm they used to have no obstacle to overseas listing but now they ll surely face much tougher scrutiny and the path to overseas ipos will be much more difficult mr xia said

taking a closer look at the buy now pay later space and we ve got a listener question on where to put non stock portfolio money joining me this week it s fool com writer recovering attorney and financial planner mr dan caplinger dan thanks for being here dan caplinger hey jason glad to be here always good to be here especially around the holidays and i hope the holiday season is treating you well too jason moser yes sir so far so good i think we ve got close to all of our christmas shopping done the weather is still delightful it s not so frightful yet so hopefully we re working our way into a nice christmas week i hope we could say the same for you dan caplinger it s been good here it s gotten colder but i have decided to become a ski person this year for the first time so i m actually enjoying it jason moser first time ever dan caplinger well 20 years ago i took a free lesson and then i moved away and now i m back i ve been back for 15 years and i just never did it and so i m like okay this is dumb if i m shoveling the snow off my driveway i should be at least enjoying it on the slopes jason moser i feel you there you are because you re up in massachusetts right dan caplinger yeah that s right jason moser i feel you there i grew up skiing i grew up in south carolina but fortunately had parents that took us out west for some vacations i had a lot of fun learning how to ski growing up fast forward to today i feel like i m the only person in my family who has any interest in skiing which means that we don t go skiing anymore maybe that s a blessing in disguise i m not getting any younger dan last week the consumer financial protection bureau announced that it is seeking information from a firm afterpay aftp f klarna paypal pypl 1 84 zip on the risks and the benefits of their buy now pay later products now this buy now pay later or bnpl as we d like to call it space this is a new space yet it doesn t seem so new because it almost seems like just something we re very familiar with but buying another name there are a lot of different ways to get at this and i d love to first and foremost just understand your big picture view on this bnpl space do you like it do you not like it why or why not dan caplinger now it s funny when i first heard of these companies that they are big innovation was gee let s take something and it s take purchase that you could make all at once and break it into four payments i was like okay that s going to be the big innovation of the world here it just didn t seem like that big of a deal to me but that shows you just how intune im necessarily with the connection between the real world and stock prices because it s a huge deal people love the opportunity to take something that they can t afford all at once and say hey i don t have 40 bucks but i ve got ten bucks and i ll probably have ton bucks next month and the month after that and so let s get it on with these buy now pay later deals as you alluded to i m very familiar with the idea of layaway purchases going way back when if you wanted to buy something big like a lawnmower tractor or something like that then you could go store and say hey i don t have enough money to buy it now but let me start making some payments on it and eventually you get to the point where it was paid you get to take the thing home and it was all good buy now pay later is even better than that you don t have to wait to take it home you get to take it home right away so that s a nice deal but it s been fascinating to me just how quick on the uptake folks have been with this both on the consumer side especially younger folks it seems to love it they love it better than credit cards which it s interesting to me because i m a big credit card charge things up pay it off at the end of the month i tend to try to get rewards cards that give me something whether it s air miles or something like that that s the 50 year old me that s my way of doing stuff but for the 2030 year olds out there this seems to be the wave of the future that they love so much and that s why we ve seen so much interest in a firm it s why we saw square sq 3 84 it s now block by afterpay and it s been a huge winner for investors who got in on that trend early even with some of the big stock pullbacks that we ve seen in those stocks over the past month two months or so jason moser yes i hear what you re saying but i m with you like i tend to just use credit card products a couple of credit leaving an american express axp card i had for 20 years i ve got an amazon prime rewards card that i used frequently and i m with you i use them i pay them down i collect the rewards it s a nice symbiotic relationship but just i don t have any problem with it it feels to me at least like this idea of buy now pay later perhaps one of the more attractive parts of it and i feel like these companies have done a good job in creating this narrative is that credit cards charge you interest and fees that s bad buy now pay later you can get what you want now pay for it later and they re not going to be fees and that s good now we know that s not just a writ large statement some of these buy now pay later products definitely do have fees interrelate charges but depending on the situation i wonder as time goes on one of the statistics i ve seen is that to this point you are looking at a considerable number of folks who have missed at least one payment on a buy now pay later purchase already they re using multiple buy now pay later products in other words they re not loyal to just the paypal offering or the afterpay offering or the affirm afrm 3 49 offering it seems like they are using a lot of they re collecting a lot of credit cards and using a lot of credit card debt at the end of the day is debt i think that we can all pretty much agree on that maybe in the near term maybe the hook for a lot of these buy now pay later firms is that they are giving you this new way to use debt without being charged necessarily these extraordinary fees i also feel like that doesn t last forever you know that old saying is no free lunch dan everything comes at a cost and at some point or another as we see this interest rate environment start to go up as we see the cost of doing business start to go up it s not going to surprise me at all particularly if we continue to see customers for consumers missing payments for late on payments i think as time goes on there you re going to see those particular individuals being targeted and saying you know what you re a bigger credit risk therefore you re going to be charged fees in order to finance this purchase because you ve got a track record of not being still reliable and that goes to another point here where we re seeing equifax wanting to incorporate these buy now pay later purchases into consumers credit records which i think makes a lot of sense because i think again it is tangible consumer behavior for me i wonder how sustainable is i don t know what do you think dan caplinger i agree with all of those points i m going to invert a little bit because you focused quite correctly on the consumer aspect of it but there is a big aspect of this that s really between the buy now pay later companies and the merchants and their interactions with credit card merchant services and all that i think that the issue that the consumer financial protection bureau brought up it was really helpful it s a good release to look out because it really does reveal some of the business model that affirm and afterpay and these companies are all trying to do basically merchants pay between three percent and six percent upfront to those buy now pay later companies in order to extend what amounts to that short term credit then that might seem like a lot returns out as the cfpb points out is very similar to the interchange fees that merchants pay off the top when you use a credit card to pay those interchange fees that finance those nice one percent 1 5 percent two percent cashback rewards that you and i are getting jason on those credit card purchases from the merchant perspective it s not necessarily all that much different meanwhile the merchants are saying they re getting big increases in the amount of money people spend on products when they go to the services they can offer these buy now pay later products since the stores are getting paid they don t really pay much attention to the customer actually making that payment that s beyond them they ve gotten their payment upfront that s all in the buy now pay later company to deal with now when you hear interviews from the folks at the buy now pay later companies they re talking about how it s different from a credit card model because at least in theory every single time that you or i go to a buy now pay later service and try to buy something whether it s for 40 bucks or 400 bucks or however much it is that s an individual credit decision that the buy now pay later company can access and they can just basically say well we gave you this before but we re not going to give you this one because reasons i think that s part of what the cfpb is looking at is what are the reasons how is the past history getting used how much of this is really more about data collection and the ability for buy now pay later companies to make lucrative partnerships with big merchants to enhance their businesses and the symbiotic relationship how much of it is about that and therefore how much protection does a consumer need both from any individual buy now pay later company and from those broader personal finance issues with regard to get into too much debt because you can use any number of these apps and they re not talking to each other and until equifax is now trying but until then they re not necessarily talking to credit reporting agencies and so it has impacts on credit card companies because credit card company that necessarily know you ve got this buy now pay later debt because it s in this different ecosystem you re right that as everybody realizes this is a trend that s here to stay it s going to have to get incorporated into the entire financial system and when that happens there s big question about is it going to be able to survive if it has to be on the same playing field as all these other existing payment methods that have been around for so long subject to regulation all things that it will be interesting to see jason moser yeah i certainly understand your point there from the merchant s perspective it s almost i don t want to say it s zero risk situation but essentially they re getting a guarantee upfront there and the owner then the burden is left to the actual buy now pay later firm that s paypal that s one thing because paypal is an extremely diversified business you ve got paypal you ve got to venmo you ve got zoom the remittance company dynamic to it their buy now pay later offering is just something they built organically which i thought was the right way to approach it to me you build something out like that and you see if it works and if it could become a meaningful driver of the business over time then that s great that s a big win if not you probably can take some warning from it but overall it s not something that really hurts the business too much to get the other side of the coin there you look at block enable formerly known as square and i wonder if we re not going to see that name change here soon you ve seen that lawsuit the h r block hrb 1 41 filed recently on block i keep thinking maybe they re going to have to get a cube next but we ll wait and see dan but you look at something like block and they make that acquisition of afterpay for 30 billion which just interesting now they are on the hook for that if buy now pay later space doesn t shake out to the upside maybe a lot of these folks think it may and it s reasonable to at least question that it would then all of a sudden that 30 billion acquisition looks like a lot of goodwill sitting on your balance sheet that you ve ultimately at the write off now goodwill s goodwill whatever but it s worth remembering square issued a lot of shares block issued a lot of shares to finance that purchase then you see a business like a firm that really is solely buy now pay later that s their one specialty you can see a broad spectrum there of risk per workplace in that fintech space if you are a believer in buy now pay later versus if you feel you think it s got potential maybe you invest in something like a paypal because you see the potential if they succeed but you can see definitely more risks to something like in firm with maybe a middle of the road risks there with block it will be a fascinating space to watch shake out here and i agree with you i think his network s key is they re going to have to be able to communicate with each other because right hand doesn t know what the left hand is doing you get a big problem dan caplinger i just believe you though from a growth standpoint these businesses have been sensational afterpay s revenue i looked it up up 36 times between 2017 and now our firms revenue almost quadrupled just since 2019 just two years ago jason moser yeah dan caplinger it s easy to see why block is like yeah this is the wave of the future it s got demographics in its favor but you re right if it goes well then it s good but if it doesn t go well then it s another one of those historical blunders that you see some companies do and can block recover from it if that happens sure because they ve got the rest of their business but at least at this point a firm is the pure play you get the upside but you get the downside too jason moser well we ve got a listener question we get this question a lot not only from listeners members subscribers and we get this question often friends family the interest rate environment that we ve witnessed over the last decade plus really has been one that makes you ask would put their money maybe your money market savings account just there s zero return there i think that s one of the arguments for the stock market these days really is that s where the best opportunity still is now with that said we re not all at the same stage of life if you get plenty of investors out there who maybe they re getting a little bit older maybe they re moving into that protect your wealth stage of life but we get questions all the time about where to put non stock portfolio money people have money out there that they don t necessarily want to commit to the market based on their timeline based on the risk tolerance whatever that may be but what do we do with that non stock portfolio money particularly in this interest rate environment today we were talking a little bit back and forth before the show and this is something that you and robert brokamp talk often about i thought it was really interesting suggestions you had there but let s go and talk a little bit about this where do you suggest investors put that non stock portfolio money today dan caplinger in the past what we ve always recommended is looking at high yield savings accounts and cdes for bank insured federally insured money that you would want to have either for retirees a lot of time we re suggesting 3 5 year cash cushion if you get an extended stock market downturn you don t have to sell stocks at a loss you can draw off of that cash unfortunately they haven t changed the name of high yield savings account because really it s a low yields savings account right now you re lucky to get a 0 5 percent or something like that the interesting opportunity right now is an investment that a lot of people don t think of as an investment and i know that people of a certain age will see this as something that they think of as a grandpa or grandma gift to grandkids we re talking about us savings bonds and specifically the series i savings bond is linked to the inflation rate now a lot of folks have heard about inflation lately it was a non starter it s not on the radar at all for most of the past 40 years but now inflation is back with a vengeance because these series i savings bonds are tied to the inflation rate if you go out and buy series i savings bond right now you will get an interest rate guaranteed federally guaranteed 7 12 percent jason moser wow dan caplinger that rate is good for six months what happens in six months depends on what happens with the inflation rate going forward if the consumer price index goes up then the interest rate on that ibond is going to be in line with the amount of that increase if inflation suddenly reverse its course like the federal reserve has been hoping lately then you will never lose money the interest rate never goes below zero there may be six month periods in the future because these series i savings bonds the rate changes every six months you might go for a six month period with no interest but the idea is it s protecting your purchasing power and that s something that traditional fixed income investments right now it s just not doing it when you ve got a treasury bond it s yielding two percent and you have cpi up six percent that s minus four percent that s four percent of purchasing power has gone away each year yes i don t think that inflation is going to stay at this rate for very much longer but there is a good possibility we will see some continuing inflation these series i savings bonds have a lot going for them they re not cash though once you buy them you have to hold them for a year if you sell them out before five years there s a three month penalty then the only other thing is there s a 10 000 limit on the amount of series i savings bonds you can buy for somebody with a million dollar portfolio they re looking to put 10 or 20 percent aside into bonds this isn t really going to be that much of a needle mover but for younger folks with smaller portfolios or if you are just looking for some place to put a little extra cash this is definitely something to think about jason moser not just stocks folks always nice to know there are options dan caplinger thanks so much for taking the time to join the show today dan caplinger glad to be here as always jason and have a good holiday jason moser you too as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against don t buy yourselves stocks based solely on what you hear thanks as always to tim sparks for putting the show together for us for dan caplinger i m jason moser thanks for listening
