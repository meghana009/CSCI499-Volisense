tv s martin roberts reveals to me my money that experts get caught out too even i lost 2m in the overseas property meltdown the biggest money mistake that bbc tv presenter martin roberts ever made was investing in overseas property the homes under the hammer star told donna ferguson he lost so much money in the 2008 financial crisis that he had to borrow from his father to pay for petrol to put in his car roberts has developed a training course that teaches investors how to buy renovate and rent out property in a profitable but ethical way what did your parents teach you about money that there are more important things in life happiness for instance money doesn t buy it both my parents were research scientists at industrial giant ici they were from working class backgrounds i don t remember money being tight but i wouldn t say we were well off have you ever struggled to make ends meet i invested in overseas property it went really well until the credit crunch of 2007 and 2008 like lots of people i was caught out by the collapse of the overseas property market in spain in particular it took me to a scary place i now understand what it s like to be awake in the middle of the night trying to prioritise bills that need to be paid crying a lot and suffering enormous stress investing in overseas property was the biggest money mistake i have ever made it almost took me to the cleaners during that period i struggled to pay personal and business bills at one point i had to borrow the money off my dad to fill up my car with petrol i ended up losing all the properties i owned in spain and other parts of the world in total i probably lost a couple of million pounds it s scary thinking about it have you ever been paid silly money yes for appearing in a vidal sassoon commercial at the time i was working at a local radio station for 25 a week trying to break into television i showed up with a haircut that had cost 4 50 at a barber s in manchester and got picked to be the face of vidal sassoon in the united states for a year they didn t change my haircut they just puffed up my hair a bit i signed a contract on the day of filming and ended up getting paid 30 000 over two years i felt pretty rich but then i discovered that if i had negotiated properly i would have earned 300 000 what was the best financial year of your life there hasn t been one outstanding year because i ve been a steady earner but 2003 was the most important financial year of my life because that was when i started presenting homes under the hammer we make 80 episodes a year and i d estimate i ve visited approximately 3 000 properties during filming in retrospect though i should have negotiated a better contract i don t earn anything like what people think i do what s the best property you ve ever filmed it was a house in stockport i asked the owner why she had bought it and she replied because of you she told me that when her mother was dying in a hospice they had watched an episode of homes under the hammer her mother had said when i die i m going to leave you some money and you must do what this man tells you to do and pointed at me on the television that s why we were standing there in stockport that s why she had bought that house it brought tears to my eyes it made me realise that when you do daytime tv you re often part of people s lives at a time when things aren t going well they might have been made redundant they might be ill you are holding their hand through difficult times the most expensive thing you bought for fun it was a second hand 15 yearold aston martin db9 for 40 000 i bought it three years ago it s a gorgeous metallic baby blue with a cream leather interior it was an extravagance but i always wanted one for me an aston martin and electronic gates at home mean you ve made it i haven t got the gates yet the best money decision you have made buying my first house a three bedroom semi near stockport for 23 000 at age 23 i bought it in 1990 with a 15 per cent fixed rate mortgage and a 4 000 deposit money i had inherited from my grandmother i did up the kitchen and bathroom and sold it two years later for 56 000 over those two years i d earned 2 000 working for a local radio station while my house had delivered a profit of more than 30 000 the penny dropped i kept on investing in property do you invest directly in the stock market no i don t understand it enough not the way i understand property do you own any property i have a mix of investment properties buy to lets and holiday lets they are my pension i also own my home which is the second property i ever bought it s a grade ii listed four bedroom house in a village just outside bath it was rundown and derelict when i purchased it in the early 1990s for just over 100 000 it s worth considerably more than that now but i ve lived here for some 30 years and i never plan to sell it it s not an investment but a home what is the one little luxury you like to treat yourself to when i was a child i yearned after dinky toys that my parents could never afford to buy me so every few months i now go to a toy fair and buy a vintage dinky toy for up to 100 if you were chancellor what would you do i would stop penalising landlords for providing people with places to live landlords should be able to deduct business expenses from their business income and not be penalised with a raft of taxes i would also increase the amount government gives to charity there are lots of key things done by charities that should be paid for by the state so i would instigate a scheme where the government matched every pound raised for charity do you donate to charity yes i do but i tend to donate by giving my time doing auctions for the nspcc and other charities i can raise hundreds of thousands of pounds at a charity auction event which is a lot more than i can afford to give i ve also got my own children s charity martin roberts foundation which is all about children s mental wellbeing and safeguarding what is your number one financial priority to remember what my parents taught me money doesn t buy you happiness i never want to lose sight of that

its name may lack sex appeal but investment trust scottish mortgage has delivered some racy returns over the years an investment of 1 000 five years ago is now worth more than 3 000 not surprisingly it s loved by investors of all ages young and old why the answer is simple it tends to make investors more long term gains than they can make elsewhere its success has been such that the trust managed out of edinburgh by investment house baillie gifford now has assets under its wing of 5 5billion making it the only investment trust in the country to form part of the ftse100 index quite a feat yet adored though it may be this investment trust doesn t provide a one way ticket to the investment land of milk and honey far from it it s actually a rather bold and risky investment vehicle taking big bets on overseas companies that are driving through technological change or supplying the components allowing such change to take place on the edge should investors avoid big technology stocks or have prices fallen so far that there are real bargains to be found some experts describe it as the uk s biggest technology company and baillie gifford doesn t disagree last week it told me its modus operandi was to hunt down exceptional companies and support them in finding solutions to some of the world s great problems solutions involving decarbonisation digitalisation and in baillie gifford s own words the intersection of information technology with biology tech tech and more tech as a result when stock markets sneeze as they did last week over fears of war in ukraine and higher interest rates in the united states scottish mortgage s share price sneezes louder last monday it tumbled by more than five per cent compared to a 2 6 per cent fall in the ftse100 index although going on to recover its share price still closed last friday more than 6 per cent down on the week over the last six months it is down 24 per cent nearly 18 per cent over the last year with technology shares falling sharply in the united states biotech giant moderna the covid vaccine maker and scottish mortgage s biggest holding has seen its price fall by more than 10 per cent over the past five days a key question for investors now raises its head should they avoid big technology stocks including scottish mortgage or have prices fallen so far that there are real bargains to be found some commentators believe investors should treat all technology orientated companies with a big dollop of caution among them is jason hollands a director of wealth manager tilney he believes rampaging inflation and higher interest rates are game changers for most of these growth orientated companies whose share prices have been inflated by the high expectation of juicy future profits rather than what they are delivering today even after recent stock market dips he says shares in these companies are far from cheap he backs his argument by way of example tesla is an innovative and exciting company he says a pioneer in the electric vehicle market but every other car manufacturer is now playing or aiming to play in this space although tesla s share price is down 30 per cent this year hollands says it still looks expensive when taking account of its forecast earnings there s an incredible amount of optimism about the future built into the share price he adds maybe it will continue to defy the equivalent of financial market gravity but it is my view there are clear risks for investors who continue to pour money into such a highly valued stock proven deliverers and unproven promisers other experts are a little more nuanced david coombs runs multi asset portfolios for rathbone investment management he says recent market falls represent an overdue check on reality but he believes all technology focused companies should not be ruled out by investors he says technology is now such a diverse sector what investors should be doing is buying the proven deliverers whose shares have fallen and avoiding the unproven promisers so in the technology space select those companies with low levels of debt good visibility on future growth and which have a significant competitive advantage over rivals among the proven deliverers in the portfolios he runs are adobe alphabet microsoft and software specialist ansys since the turn of the year shares in these companies have fallen respectively by 6 9 9 and 18 per cent coombs wasn t prepared to disclose the names of unproven promisers other than to say they fall into a basket headed short term covid winners but other experts are bolder naming firms such as home exercise equipment specialist peloton and e commerce specialist the hut group thg as technology shares to be cautious about dan lane senior analyst at share trading company freetrade makes the same point as rathbone s coombs but in a broader market context lane says no amount of apparent share price cheapness can make a shoddy business good when you re bargain hunting as an investor keep that front of mind instead of pouncing on anything that s stepped into the proverbial cartoon manhole look to the companies that maybe have been unfairly tarred in this market shake out he elaborates divide opportunities into two buckets those companies you would have invested in before the pandemic and those you wouldn t have touched then focus on the first bucket hopefully the world will spend a longer time in the future out of a global pandemic than in one so what are the technology focused companies you should back long term as an investor and those you maybe should avoid we asked a number of experts to provide their selections perennial high achievers susannah streeter senior investment and markets analyst at wealth manager hargreaves lansdown says long term tech winners should include big established american brands microsoft a favourite of rathbone s coombs and amazon its shares are down 17 per cent since the turn of the year microsoft s software and services are increasingly indispensable to our lives says streeter be it at school home or in the workplace she describes amazon as the king of e commerce and an exciting growth opportunity as margins improve she also believes lesser known tech stocks roku and nvidia will bounce back respective year to date share price falls of 35 and 26 per cent roku s shares have been pummelled in the tech sell off she says but she believes the us digital media company has a good future as it cements its position as the leading tv operating system in the united states american tech company nvidia she believes should benefit from having its fingers in all sorts of pies including digital design and artificial intelligence victoria scholar head of investments at wealth manager interactive investor likes iphone giant apple whose shares are down 7 per cent since the start of the year its share price has got caught up in the tech share price slump she says but unlike many tech companies it s got lots of cash and low levels of debt charles jones of waverton investment management likes us listed company upstart technologies a lending platform that embraces artificial intelligence it has a big market is profitable and sales this year could grow by nearly 50 per cent he says high fliers to be wary off as rathbone s coombs alluded to earlier many of the tech stocks to avoid are those that thrived during the pandemic and whose share prices got grossly inflated as a result hargreaves lansdown s streeter includes deliveroo tesla peloton and the hut group among her shares to be cautious about there is a tight pack of competitors jostling for position in the delivery sector she says although deliveroo delivered some appetising financial results in the fourth quarter of last year it faces an uphill struggle ahead freetrade s lane agrees believing the company came to the stock market too soon its shares floated at 3 90 last year and are now trading at 1 46 he is also sceptical about tech company darktrace which like deliveroo listed last year although its shares are above the flotation price of 2 50 lane says recent share sales by company directors beg the question why buy the shares when big chunks are being offloaded by the people who know the business the best russ mould investment director at wealth platform aj bell says investors should avoid deliveroo and the hut group and also online electrical retailer ao world which he believes could struggle as household budgets get squeezed one final word diversify all the investment experts i spoke to on friday say the best way of building long term wealth is to maintain a diversified portfolio this can best be achieved through holding a number of investment funds stock market listed investment trusts and shares diversification should be obtained geographically overseas market exposure as well as uk holdings by assets not just equities and by sector so invest in financial stocks tilney s jason hollands is a big fan invest in drinks companies such as diageo most of us like a tipple or three invest in brands we love the burberrys of this world invest in travel companies such as jet2 the best of them according to aj bell s russ mould in a nutshell don t put all your investment faith in technology shares and do drip your money in
apple inc is overcoming the costly global shortage in computer chips posting record sales over the holiday quarter beating profit estimates and forecasting that its shortfall is narrowing the iphone maker which is world s largest company by market capitalization has handled supply chain challenges such as factory shutdowns and shipping delays brought on by the pandemic better than any of its top peers analysts said apple shares rose about 5 percent in after hours trading erasing half their losses on the year the gains came after the company teased its ambitions for augmented reality in the metaverse more people wanted iphones ipads and other gadgets over the holiday quarter than apple had to sell costing the company over 6 billion in sales or in line with what it feared yet apple which is many part suppliers biggest client used its buying power to squeeze those vendors to ship enough gadgets to power record sales in its iphones mac and wearables and accessories segments apple executives said chip shortages are mostly affecting older models of its products and particularly slowed ipad sales they ve navigated the supply chain better than everybody and it s showing in the results said ryan reith who studies the smartphone market for industry tracker idc the four best selling phones in urban china were all iphone models apple said as competitors struggled to manufacture rival offerings it was the top selling vendor in china for the first time in six years research firm counterpoint research reported on wednesday nicole peng who tracks china s smartphone sector at research firm canalys said comparatively low prices and the retreat of chief rival huawei from the market led to a strong quarter peng said apple was unlikely to repeat that quarterly performance this year given it was driven by one off factors however she said the company could still have a strong 2022 if chinese consumers warm up to a new iphone se which is expected to be released this year apple s growing sales of services such as music tv and fitness subscriptions also are helping soften the blow of low device supply the company said it now has 785 million paying subscribers across its at least seven subscription offerings up by 40 million from last quarter and soothing investors concerned about slowing growth at rivals such as netflix inc even better apple chief financial officer luca maestri told reuters that easing chip shortages should mean less than 6 billion in lost revenue in the current quarter but he declined to estimate further in the future the level of constraint will depend a lot on other companies what will be the demand for chips from other companies and other industries he said record iphone upgrades the iphone 13 which started shipping days before the quarter began led to worldwide phone sales revenue for apple of 71 6 billion a 9 percent increase from the 2020 holiday season that handily beat wall street targets according to refinitiv data maestri attributed the sales bump to a record number of upgrades from older iphones and double digit growth in people switching from rivals apple s overall fiscal first quarter revenue was 123 9 billion 11 percent up from last year and higher than analysts average estimate of 118 7 billion profit was 34 6 billion or 2 10 per share compared with analysts expectations of 31 billion and 1 89 per share maestri warned though that revenue growth will slow in the current quarter compared with the december quarter primarily due to less favorable foreign exchange rates and the different launch dates of products apple s only category segment to miss sales expectations was ipads sales fell 14 percent to 7 25 billion compared with analyst estimates of 8 2 billion seeming to confirm industry predictions that the tablets would have low priority for any scarce parts services apple s second biggest segment after iphones increased sales 24 percent to 19 5 billion revenue from mac computers rose 25 percent and apple said the last six quarters have been its best for mac sales the pandemic has accelerated adoption of digital tools for communication learning and entertainment powering apple to blowout sales over the last two years but investors this year have been shifting funds toward safer assets and away from tech stocks such as apple that have soared during the pandemic with people spending time more time online wall street has questioned how long it will take apple to deliver its next big product such as an augmented reality ar headset for the metaverse we see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly chief executive tim cook told investors on thursday apple also is facing antitrust pressure in the united states and europe that could lead to new regulations that cut into its services revenue late last month the dutch authority for consumers and markets acm ordered apple to make changes for apps on offer in the apple app store in the netherlands by jan 15 or face fines after it found that the u s company had abused its market dominance by requiring dating app developers to exclusively use apple s in app payment system still apple is trading at 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months while down from as much as 35 a year ago it remains above the company s five year average of 20 times expected earnings according to refinitiv by danielle kaye paresh dave and nivedita balu
elon musk the ceo and founder of tesla said on jan 26 that the automaker will delay releasing its new vehicles such as the cybertruck until 2023 because of supply chain problems however the company stated that it would be able to build 50 percent more vehicles than it made in 2021 musk a native of south africa said production of tesla s new cybertruck semi and roadster models won t start until at least 2023 after promising a 2021 release tesla stated that for 2022 it s focusing on automated car navigation software and a new humanoid robot called optimus musk believes that human like robots and self driving cars are more important at this moment than the cybertruck design or 25 000 electric cars optimus is a humanoid robot that can assist in factory tasks or perform other types of repetitive work and he hopes that it could eventually address global labor shortages musk thinks that robots could be more important than cars and that they have the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time he said full self driving will become the most important source of profitability for tesla and that in the long term it s nutty good from a financial standpoint tesla and other automated vehicle designers have constantly missed their targets to deploy fully autonomous cars for years with tesla model 3 model s model x and model y cars still far from driving themselves the company currently has 60 000 drivers who have paid 12 000 or a 199 per month subscription to test the latest self driving software package fsd beta in the expectation that full autonomy will become possible the society of automotive engineering which sets standards for the engineering industry has set six benchmarks that a vehicle s technology must reach before it s officially declared autonomous thus far the market has only produced automated cars and not autonomous cars which by definition allow the car to do everything without human assistance fsd beta has sophisticated features such as smart summon which allows drivers to call their cars from parking spots t pick them up the tesla app on their smartphones acts as a remote control musk believes that smart summon could multiply a vehicle s utility as owners could send their cars out to work when not needed tesla s other vehicle assistance feature is the self driving system known as autopilot which is standard on every new tesla vehicle autopilot enables the car to perform some maneuvers on its own though it should only be used with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment according to tesla it can automatically change lanes maneuver the vehicle into a parking space and make some turns however autopilot and fsd beta software aren t enough to make tesla s vehicles fully autonomous a concern that tesla s rivals and industry regulators have is its innovative technological approach to automation which some say is dangerous and potentially deadly tesla uses a system of cameras and artificial intelligence for navigation instead of standard technologies such as radar and lidar sensors used on competing fully autonomous designs even if the technology is perfected tesla would come under more rigorous scrutiny from regulators before deploying fleets of free roaming vehicles it s clear that if you re marketing something as full self driving and it is not full self driving and people are misusing the vehicles and the technology you have a design flaw and you have to prevent that misuse jennifer homendy the chair of the u s national transportation safety board ntsb told cnbc industry and government officials are in the process of updating industry safety standards for vehicle automation such as for who s at fault if a self driving car causes injury federal vehicle safety regulators are issuing new guidelines to states but not comprehensive standards for governing self driving cars while certain states still require approval for fully autonomous vehicles full autonomy will be dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience as well as regulatory approval which may take longer in some jurisdictions tesla states on its website the ntsb and the california department of motor vehicles are currently investigating different aspects of tesla s fsd development and technology after auto safety regulators opened a probe into tesla s advanced driver assistant system following crashes involving the vehicles and parked emergency vehicles being safer than a human is a low standard not a high standard people are often distracted tired texting it s remarkable that we don t have more accidents musk said he s still optimistic that tesla will have a feature enabling its cars to safely drive themselves in any conditions by the end of 2022 i would be shocked if we do not achieve full self driving safer than human this year i would be shocked musk said during tesla s jan 26 fourth quarter earnings call you know the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self driving by a software update i think might end up being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history we shall see a newly released software update autosteer on city streets and traffic and stop sign control can presumably enable cars to navigate and steer on urban roads without driver assistance however automakers have yet to convince the public as driver surveys show that more than 70 percent of the u s public are still wary of driverless cars tesla made 5 5 billion in 2021 compared with its previous record of nearly 3 5 billion posted in 2020 the company delivered a record 936 000 vehicles in 2021 nearly double its 2020 figure with fourth quarter vehicle sales hitting 308 600

it was a week that shook wall street as an era of easy money is coming to an end markets went on such a roller coaster ride that it even stumped the most veteran investors ending remarkably with the biggest rally of the year for the main stock indices the reason for all the volatility the federal reserve this week telegraphed at its first policy meeting of the year that it plans to start raising interest rates as early as march to tackle inflation which has reached 40 year highs markets are penciling in four to five rate hikes this year with bank of america on friday predicting as many as seven increases in 2022 here s what to know about an incredible week in markets and what it means for you why are investors so fearful as it turns out it s not just average americans who are worried about the economy and inflation professional investors are too a unique period in wall street s history is coming to an end for most of the period since the 2008 global financial crisis inflation has remained relatively low and the fed for the most part has kept interest rates near rock bottom levels that s made it very inexpensive for companies to borrow money and it s fueled wall street s record setting run that era seems to be over or coming to an end the central bank hopes to raise interest rates just enough to bring down inflation but not so much as to hurt the economy investors are deeply uncertain about the fed s ability to strike that balance that has resulted in incredible swings in markets this week often within the same day on monday for example the dow jones industrial average dropped by more than 1 000 points only to end the day with a modest gain the dow ended on friday with a more than 500 point gain the biggest of the year while the nasdaq surged more than 3 after companies such as apple brought some comfort by reporting good earnings even wall street veterans say they haven t seen this kind of sustained volatility since the dot com bubble burst back in 2000 or during the 2008 financial crisis so what should we expect from the economy analysts widely expect economic growth this year will slow down after posting its strongest growth since 1984 last year that growth however was uneven which is why many americans don t feel positive about the economy according to recent polls it s not just inflation the biggest challenge remains the pandemic itself each time infections flare up it makes people nervous about getting out and traveling and it cuts into consumption the pandemic also keeps would be workers on the sidelines and that just prolongs the staffing shortages and supply chain problems that have dogged the economy take lindsay mescher who runs the greenhouse cafe restaurant in lebanon ohio right now she s struggling with not having enough customers because of omicron but even when business picks up she s worried about rising prices just yesterday i got a text from my farmer our chicken went up a dollar a pound and i understand that her costs went up too but i can t keep passing these costs on i can t charge 12 for a chicken salad sandwich in this town it s just not going to work she says the international monetary fund this week cut its growth forecast for the u s economy to 4 down 1 2 percentage points from its previous estimate what do these economic challenges mean for us borrowing costs are going to be higher as the fed raises interest rates we ve already seen mortgage rates rise to their highest level since the start of the pandemic car loans and other forms of credit will also be going up as the fed raises rates however it s also important to keep things in perspective rates are likely to still be low by historical standards the federal government is also going to be putting less money in people s pockets now that most of the pandemic relief programs have ended but on the plus side we are seeing rising wages and better benefits as employers are having to compete for scarce workers giving employees more bargaining power data on friday showed employers spending on wages and benefits rose 4 last year the biggest increase in two decades still on average wages still are not keeping pace with inflation and what s this going to mean for stocks some veteran investors are sounding a warning that we are in a really dangerous time one of them is influential money manager jeremy grantham who said this month we are in the midst of a superbubble with inflated prices in stocks housing and commodities because the fed has kept interest rates too low but that s not a widely held view other investors call this a natural recalibration after three years of strong growth in stock markets that have stretched valuations of some companies i think what we re seeing right now is sort of justified based on valuations and what the fed has been telling us which is why we were relatively cautious heading into the year said savita subramanian the head of u s equity research at bank of america technology stocks especially have had an incredible rally with the nasdaq more than doubling over the past three years the tech heavy index is now in correction territory after falling more than 10 this year a decline that is spooking investors but at the end of the day professional investors urge patience markets have consistently gained in the long run we just happen to be in the midst of a volatile ride

michel martin host if you are one of the millions of americans who makes an income through gig work or a side hustle you probably get paid through an app like venmo or paypal or cash app they make it easy to exchange money for services and products no muss no fuss until now starting this year the irs is requiring third party apps like the ones i just mentioned to report any income for goods and services that total 600 or more and that ll probably have an effect on what s expected of these workers come tax season and that s not all the financial news that could affect your budget the stock market had a wild week and interest rates are set to go up soon so with so much going on we thought we d call michelle singletary to try to point us in the right direction she s the personal finance columnist for the washington post and she s with us now welcome thank you so much for joining us michelle singletary thank you for having me m martin so you recently wrote about this new reporting rule for the washington post and we want to begin with how you define it in your piece you say it s a new reporting requirement it s not a new tax so what exactly is it and whom does it affect singletary so the american rescue plan act added reporting requirements for 1099 k so that s the reporting requirement that for you know gig workers people who are self employed and so you know we ve got a tax gap in this country and so they re trying to make sure people report their income and we know that when third parties report what we earn then people tend to be honest and put it on their tax forms because there is accountability and so as part of you know fixing the tax gap they put in this new requirement that if you make more than you know 600 or more those apps that you mentioned have to send the information to the irs before the limit was way higher like 20 000 and 200 transactions so you can see for most people who are small business owners entrepreneurs gig workers that you know the old reporting rules didn t cover that however they were always supposed to report their income it just wasn t that reporting requirement and i think that s where a lot of the confusion comes out lots of people sort of think it s a new tax and that somehow this is attacking those people who are trying to do you know trying to make money for themselves but you were always supposed to be reporting your income to the irs this just has more accountability to it m martin so it s not about like splitting dinner with friends it is about that airbnb income it is about your etsy hustle for example singletary that s exactly right you know lots of people are concerned am i going to get a tax bill no if you are changing money between like you know i have a sister i might send her some money or you re splitting that you know restaurant bill or the grandma sent money it doesn t apply to that we re talking about business transactions m martin if people are not used to this and have not accommodated themselves to this how should they change their say budgeting if they haven t gotten one of these 1099 k forms before or frankly were not in the habit of putting money aside what do you recommend singletary so let s say you ve got a business and you re making you know a couple hundred dollars a month and you say you know you re spending this on all your you know personal expenses when you get that income from your business or side hustle you should automatically figure out what taxes you owe put that money into a different account and when it comes time to pay those estimated taxes is it four times a year then you go ahead and make those payments so you ve got to become much more disciplined in your business dealings lots of people mix the business with their personal and you know you put your business income in your personal account and next thing you know you ve spent it the tax money isn t there so you ve got to be even more disciplined and a lot of these platforms have business accounts they ll help you with that you know definitely if you you should have a tax professional to help you out with this you don t want to get in trouble with the irs on this you don t want to come next year when you file your taxes realizing you owe you know several thousand dollars in taxes and you don t have that money m martin so let s talk about another story that may affect people s personal finances earlier this week federal reserve chairman jerome powell signaled that he plans to start raising interest rates in march now this is going to affect what people who already have a lot of debt or who are thinking about taking out a mortgage or other loans if you re in that position what should you be thinking about singletary so if you re deep in debt the federal reserve has just given you your financial resolution get out of debt because it s going to cost you more if you have an arm an adjustable rate mortgage it s going to cost you more if you re buying something interest rates are going up we already now see that mortgage rates are inching up and so for example if you were thinking about it you might want to refinance and all the numbers work because you got to make sure the numbers work i would say refinance now before the rates go up most importantly if you are in credit card debt if you re not paying off that credit card bill every single month just make that your no 1 priority because that debt is going to cost you more it s already cost you a lot the average interest rate on a credit card is between 16 to 17 and some people it s you know 20 29 and even going up a couple of you know percentage points it s going to cost you money over time if you keep that debt hanging around like it s a pet m martin final big story the stock market had a wild week and this may make people nervous especially people who have money tied up in the stock market for retirement accounts which is probably the way most people do right so is there something that you suggest that people do right now if they re looking at these numbers and it s kind of making their stomach hurt singletary if you ve got time till retirement you know weather this storm now if you re nearing retirement and you were heavily invested in equities then you probably should be a little worried because this is money that you need now you know i talked to quite a few experts financial experts financial planners and they said listen you got you know if you retire in your 60s it s very likely you re going to live another 20 30 years so you need to have your money grow so it s ok to have it in equities but you also need to have a pile of money that isn t in the market that isn t tied to these turbulent times so that you can pull from that money when we have times like

easy to exchange money for services and products no muss no fuss until now starting this year the irs is requiring third party apps like the ones i just mentioned to report any income for goods and services that total 600 or more and that ll probably have an effect on what s expected of these workers come tax season and that s not all the financial news that could affect your budget the stock

columnist for the washington post and she s with us now welcome thank you so much for joining us michelle singletary thank you for having me m martin so you recently wrote about this new reporting rule for the washington post and we want to begin with how you define it in your piece you say it s a new reporting requirement it s not a new tax so what exactly is it and whom does it affect singletary so the american rescue plan act added reporting requirements for 1099 k so that s the reporting requirement that for you know gig workers people who are self employed and so you know we ve got a tax gap in this country and so they re trying to make sure people report their income and we know that when third parties report what we earn then people tend to be honest and put it on their tax forms because there is accountability and so as part of you know fixing the tax gap they put in this new requirement that if you make more than you know 600 or more those apps that you mentioned have to send the information to the irs before the limit was way higher like 20 000 and 200 transactions so you can see for most people who are small business owners entrepreneurs gig workers that you know the old reporting rules didn t cover that however they were always supposed to report their income it just wasn t that reporting requirement and i think that s where a lot of the confusion comes

make that your no 1 priority because that debt is going to cost you more it s already cost you a lot the average interest rate on a credit card is between 16 to 17 and some people it s you know 20 29 and even going up a couple of you know percentage points it s going to cost you money over time if you keep that debt hanging around like it s a pet m martin final big story the stock market had a wild week and this may make people nervous especially people who have money tied up in the stock market for retirement accounts which is probably the way most people do right so is there something

the biden administration talks with wall street about russian sanctions and worries about a repeat of 2018 when aluminum prices soared by 30 the biden administration has made it clear that it will impose severe sanctions on russia in the event of a military conflict between russia and ukraine this week the biden administration discussed possible sanctions against russia with wall street banks bloomberg said citing people familiar with the matter wall street reported earlier that the media revealed that the biden government was considering reducing the scope of the crackdown focusing on imports needed by big banks state owned enterprises and russia given that russia is one of the largest exporters of oil gas and metal raw materials the biden government did not target oil and gas exports nor did it consider severing russia s links with the swift international payment system the impact on global trade and financial markets must be a major consideration for policy makers according to bloomberg analysts the impact of the conflict between russia and ukraine on aluminum supply if there is a military conflict between russia and ukraine the impact on the global supply of commodities will certainly be huge cutting off the supply of russian commodities would wreak havoc on the global manufacturing supply chain it is worth noting that the prices of oil natural gas and non ferrous metals are bound to soar people familiar with the matter said that the reason for the discussion was the biden administration s concern that if the conflict between russia and ukraine escalated and sanctions increased in europe and the united states it could repeat what happened in 2018 at that time after the us government imposed sanctions on rusal it disrupted the global aluminum supply chain causing international aluminum prices to soar more than 30 per cent in 11 trading days to a seven year high not only that gold oil and nickel metals also soared this is mainly because rusal is one of the largest aluminium producers in the world with an electrolytic capacity of more than 4 million tons accounting for 6 per cent of the global electrolytic capacity as a result of the severe shortage of aluminium at that time the cost of downstream manufacturing companies in the united states soared after negotiations the us government finally had to lift sanctions on rusal at present the united states is in a critical stage of economic recovery in the later stage of the epidemic and if the situation repeats itself in 2018 it will deal a severe blow to the manufacturing industry sanctions against russia may deal a heavy blow to banks the biden administration s sanctions against banks are expected to include banning us banks and other entities from trading with banks on the blacklist but there may also be individual exemptions according to people familiar with the matter some analysts pointed out that if sanctions are imposed on russia it is possible to bring significant risks to banks with greater exposure to russia according to foreign news agencies russia now has more foreign exchange reserves and faster economic growth and relies less on international borrowing although bank of america s exposure to russia is relatively small citibank is likely to be more affected among the three largest banks in the united states that is why members of the national security council and senior government officials as well as senior executives such as citibank and bank of america discussed possible sanctions against russia this week

make that your no 1 priority because that debt is going to cost you more it s already cost you a lot the average interest rate on a credit card is between 16 to 17 and some people it s you know 20 29 and even going up a couple of you know percentage points it s going to cost you money over time if you keep that debt hanging around like it s a pet m martin final big story the stock market had a wild week and this may make people nervous especially people who have money tied up in the stock market for retirement accounts which is probably the way most people do right so is there something that you suggest that people do right now if they re looking at these numbers and it s kind of making their stomach hurt singletary if you ve got time till retirement you know weather this storm now if you re nearing retirement and you were heavily invested in equities then you probably should be a little worried because this is money that you need now you know i talked to quite a few experts financial experts financial planners and they said listen you got you know if you retire in your 60s it s very likely you re going to live another 20 30 years so you need to have your money grow so it s ok to have it in equities but you also need to have a pile of money that isn t in the market that isn t tied to these turbulent times so that you can pull from that money when we have times like

susan tompor detroit free press their checks to the u s treasury were cashed nearly a year ago but taxpayers say they re now receiving letters from the internal revenue service asking them to immediately file their 2020 federal income tax returns yes copies of their 2020 returns yes the same paper returns they filed last spring please file today the letter begins send your signed return to the address shown above we ll assign the credit to the tax you owe and refund any over payment if you owe no other taxes or obligations some readers who contacted me wondered whether if this could be some sort of scam it wasn t a text message it wasn t an email it was a letter said anne hovell 72 who recently received the irs letter dated jan 24 according to the letter sent to the couple in gibraltar the credit on their account is 1 056 the irs letter warns that there can be more problems ahead if we don t hear from you if you don t file your return or contact us the form letter says you may lose this credit the internal revenue code sets strict time limits for refunding or transferring credits can you finally stop working this year with stock market taking a hit can you still afford to retire in 2022 rough stretch over for now stocks surge to salvage a volatile week on wall street hovell who keeps track of transactions in her checking account knows the money cleared a year ago and she recognized that the amount listed as a credit is what she paid in taxes if a check doesn t clear i follow up she said it did clear hovell who retired as a consultant for a tech company knows that scammers often use email or texts but she wondered if somehow the scammers were getting even more sophisticated and created actual letters to demand copies of tax returns the notion of a scam seemed to make even more sense than thinking that the irs could be sending letters to people who already paid their taxes and filed their returns why would the irs need another return if the federal government cashed their checks she and others wondered doesn t that mean the irs received their return in the mail since the return and check were mailed together why wouldn t the irs already have their tax returns it s a good question and frankly one that could leave you in shock when you re thinking about all the work that goes into filing your tax return in the first place it s very unsettling to get an irs notice when you think you did everything by the book filed the return on time sent the money that was due the less scary part here of course is that the irs wasn t trying to collect money from the couple the letters that readers sent to me are marked notice cp80 and the letters i saw were sent out of kansas city missouri the letter goes on to say if you have already filed this return please send a newly signed copy to the address shown above be sure to attach copies of all schedules and other documents you included with the original return unprocessed returns built up the pandemic has flipped a lot of things in life upside down the tax system has undergone sizable challenges since the two year long pandemic began in early 2020 as of dec 4 2021 the irs said it had a backlog of 6 7 million unprocessed individual returns and 2 6 million unprocessed amended individual returns mark luscombe principal analyst for wolters kluwer tax accounting said the irs is still processing millions of 2020 returns and these notices go out automatically when the irs believes it has not received a return while it might seem on the surface that delays have gone on so long that the irs is unable to find many of the paper returns many experts say that s not likely to be the case at all a glut of automated notices might have been sent to many people who likely should not have received them edward karl vice president of tax policy and advocacy for the american institute of cpas said the cp80 notice has an important place in the process the notice would normally be sent when a tax return for a given year wasn t received even though the filer might have paid a good deal of money already into the system such as through estimated taxes someone might have forgotten to file a return when they have a credit to their account money that could be owed to them in a refund when there s been a troubling event such as a trauma a divorce a death or natural disaster the cp80 notice lets the taxpayer know that when a return hasn t been filed and they can file one in time to claim any refund money owed in most cases an original return claiming a refund must be filed within three years of its due date for the irs to issue a refund the only issue is we re not in normal times karl said the irs like the rest of the country has faced more than its fair share of challenges since the covid 19 pandemic hit to stem outbreaks of the virus the irs had to shut down its centers earlier in the pandemic and irs employees had to be protected but piles of unprocessed returns built up they have such a backlog of processing karl said the pandemic has put them in a deep hole the irs backs off but not soon enough for some the notices sent out in january though seem to be adding to the paperwork on thursday the irs announced that it would suspend notices in situations where we have credited taxpayers for payments but have no record of the tax return being filed the idea behind stopping the notices is to avoid even more confusion the irs noted in its statement in many situations the tax return may be part of our current paper tax inventory and simply hasn t been processed stopping these letters which could have otherwise been sent to thousands of taxpayers will help avoid confusion unfortunately many taxpayers opened their mail already and read the notices before the irs announced that it was halting some of these mailings diana vollmayer of rochester hills said she and her husband already mailed the copy of their 2020 return certified with return receipt we are keeping records of all transactions she said noting that she too was told via her notice of a credit to the couple s account they made estimated tax payments but had filed their 2020 return by paper last spring and paid the rest of the money that they owed when they filed the return she said her friend received one of these letters too but hired a cpa to review her 2020 taxes and handle the situation for her the irs didn t offer a clear detail of what notices it is suspending in its statement as it doesn t even mention cp80 in its statement in an email response to the free press the irs said it has suspended issuing the cp80 and cp080 unfiled tax return credit on account notices the irs said the cp80 is a notice letter that informs a taxpayer that the agency has credited payments and or other credits to their tax account for a certain tax period but the agency hasn t received their tax return the irs has not disclosed how many of the notices went out this month but confirmed that the letters aren t a scam if a taxpayer has received a notice for a 2020 return they should not refile according to luis garcia a spokesperson for the irs in detroit for taxpayers who timely filed their 2019 tax return including extensions and have received a notice they should refile their return garcia said taxpayers also can establish and log into their tax account online at irs gov to view their tax status and any correspondence the irs has sent karl maintains that taxpayers who received a notice now regarding a 2020 return would not have to send a copy of the return if they already filed a 2020 return and know that their payment went through if you didn t file a return obviously you could have money that you might be owed based on the notice and would want to file to claim a refund if you received a notice regarding a 2019 return karl said you would need to send in another signed copy the aicpa is part of a group of stakeholders called the tax professionals united for taxpayer relief coalition which is seeking more relief for taxpayers in light of the pandemic related challenges the coalition s recommendations submitted to the irs include discontinuing automated compliance actions until the irs is prepared to devote the necessary resources for a timely resolution similar recommendation also included in the 2021 national taxpayer advocate report the automated system makes more sense in more normal times when the backlog isn t so great but bulk batches of notices now pose a great risk of alerting many taxpayers to problems that aren t real on their end according to professionals they re going to be wrong in many instances because of the backlog karl said he said the news thursday was welcome but more needed to be done the group also wants to see among other changes the irs providing taxpayers with targeted relief from the underpayment and the late payment penalty for the 2020 and 2021 tax year the irs maintains that making significant operational changes to our systems including stopping certain notices from being printed and mailed may require programming and other operational changes with an outdated technological ecosystem these are changes that cannot be made as efficiently as they should be and that is part of the reason why investing in irs it modernization is so important getting one of these letters of course raises other questions such as why would the irs have cashed the check if the return that was filed wasn t processed karl noted that cashing the check when it s its received is part of the normal process it s not a cause for alarm it s prudent karl said the u s treasury uses this money to cover a wide range of government expenditures you make your check payable to the united states treasury and include a payment voucher called form 1099 v that goes with the paper check the irs notes when we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment the returns are separated from the check and then returns are processed further down the line after the check has been cashed normally we re not thinking about the ins and outs of how the irs handles all that paperwork but again not much has been normal for the past two years contact susan tompor stompor freepress com follow her on twitter tompor

new york jerome powell s hawkish pivot makes it clear that a key crutch of support for the global economy is going to be pulled away sooner than financial markets had been betting chair powell s federal reserve last week indicated it would soon raise interest rates but also to cease adding to its massive stockpile of bonds by early march counterparts are also ending or slowing the bond buying which accelerated in the coronavirus recession with some even looking to reverse it the bank of canada last week signaled it could tighten monetary policy in coming weeks having ended so called quantitative easing in october markets are betting the bank of england will lift rates on thursday to the level it has said it may begin shrinking its portfolio the reserve bank of australia is projected to announce an end to its bond buying program when it meets tuesday all told bloomberg economics expects group of seven central banks will add just 330 billion to their balance sheets this year a sharp drop from the more than 8 trillion added during the pandemic in a bid to ease markets contain borrowing costs and spur demand and risk taking that lays the groundwork for the g 7 s combined portfolio to peak in the middle of this year at around 27 trillion an amount that would have been unimaginable before the 2008 financial crisis when bond buying became a key tool for most monetary authorities what does qe exit mean a key question is what does the exit from qe mean for the world economy if it enables central banks to get on top of rampant inflation then it could help extend the recovery from the 2020 slump especially if it acts as a substitute for higher benchmark rates but if the process ends up roiling markets it could have the opposite effect by cutting off the flow of credit to consumers and businesses hitting their confidence if central bank rates alone were increasing but quantitative easing was staying in place this would provide at least some liquidity support to asset prices said freya beamish head of macro research at ts lombard with the liquidity tide turning there is no cushion to fall back on that sets the scene for a divergence as major central banks in the english speaking world look not only to stop quantitative easing but begin quantitative tightening qt the term given for shrinking balance sheets while others keep on easing monetary policy japan remains wedded to stimulus even as it slows the pace of its asset purchases and the european central bank is seen as being still more than one and a half years away from raising rates although it too is reducing net purchases meantime china which avoided qe through the crisis has switched to stimulus mode to cushion the economy from a property slump is the party over for markets the global economy isn t facing synchronized tightening said mansoor mohi uddin chief economist at the bank of singapore ltd while that s a consolation it hasn t stopped financial markets from turning skittish about the pending withdrawal of liquidity when the fed started quantitative tightening in 2017 it had been raising rates for more than a year and it never directly sold assets reducing its balance sheet by curbing reinvesting existing holdings of treasuries as they matured back then fed chair janet yellen likened the process to watching paint dry

st george the utah senate passed a 160 million income tax cut bill friday senate bill 59 sponsored by sen daniel mccay r riverton and cosponsored by 22 other state senators drops the current income tax rate from 4 95 to 4 85 it passed the senate in a 22 5 vote from data shared by mccay during a hearing of the senate revenue and taxation committee held thursday the tax cut equates to nearly 100 in annual savings for a utah family of four making 72 000 for a family of four that makes 40 000 that would equate to 45 a year over the last few years the legislature implemented significant tax reductions mccay said in a press release following the bill s passage in the senate because of conservative fiscally sound policy our state is in a position to reduce taxes across the board income tax is burdensome on utah families and a targeted approach to giving income tax relief will benefit all utahns mccay went into detail on tax cuts passed by the legislature over the last five years on the senate floor friday in 2018 the legislature passed a 56 million income tax cut when the rate went from 5 to 4 95 later in 2021 cuts to the state tax on social security passed to the amount of 18 3 million military retirement income tax was also cut to the amount of 24 6 million with another 55 million in personal personal tax exemptions passed by the legislature this year the legislature is putting 350 million in new funding toward education and also looking at additional cuts to the social security tax and the creation of an earned income tax credit as sb 59 enters the house the state s food tax may also be up for consideration mccay said while sb 59 passed out of the senate committee thursday following a 6 2 vote taxpayer advocates wanted to see deeper cuts of 4 6 or 4 5 we can do better was a common phase among these advocates as they spoke to the committee i say it s stingy utah resident heidi balderie said please consider 4 5 we can afford it heather andrews of americans for prosperity said states surrounding utah have lower income tax rates and utah needs to make its rate lower to be competitive she called the proposed 4 85 rate premature as it was decided on ahead of new state revenue projections set to release next month numbers are expected to be better than those previously released and would support a deeper tax cut she said on the other hand opponents to the tax cut said the state has a gap in its funding for its social programs that needs to be addressed the 160 million the state has set aside for the tax cut should go toward those programs they said it s repugnant to hear about tax cuts when the social programs need funding utah resident lisa stamps said during the hearing sen luz escamilla d salt lake city held this view as well and voted against the bill while in committee and on the senate floor she also voiced her support for repealing the state s food tax as that would provide immediate relief to families in need sen gene davis d salt lake city also voted against the bill in committee and in the senate he shared concerns about the state not being able to provide meaningful wages for state employees and felt the 160 million could be better spent providing them with higher wages that as he put it could help raise the quality of life for state employees and help make some no longer reliable on snap benefits an objection to the tax cut in favor of more funding for k 12 education and higher education was also raised mccay said the state s overall budget this year is 25 6 billion with education getting around 27 of that rainy day funds for education also amounted to around 600 million he said right now we are more prepared than ever for a rainy day he said adding there is also a large amount of one time money that can go to the state s other needs like education and social programs during the vote on the senate floor sen curtis bramble r provo said opponents to the bill had neglected to mention a demographic of people the money from the tax cuts would help regular utah taxpayers they are the ones who pay for the social programs opponents said needed more money so why not provide them with some relief he posited looking out for the taxpayer has been one of the key components that s been left out of the debate bramble said senate majority leader evan vickers r cedar city who mccay said transferred his own income tax bill to him voted in favor of sb 59 we need to implement a tax policy that puts more money back into the hands of utahns vickers said in a statement each and every utah taxpayer no matter their income will experience a tax cut working families and individuals will get to decide how they spend more of their hard earned dollars other state senators representing southern utah who voted for the bill include don ipson derrin ovens and david hinkins sb 59 now goes to the house for consideration check out all of st george news coverage of the 2022 utah legislature here for a complete

construction on apartments in fairfield in 2017 file photo imagine this scenario 35 years ago you and your spouse bought a modestly sized home in a neighborhood in suburban connecticut it took just about everything that you had to put together the down payment years of working hard and saving until you could purchase your dream home one day you learn that the 1 acre lot behind your property has been sold to a developer who plans to build a four story apartment complex with 94 units built right up to within three feet of your property line after the initial shock and anger wears off you ask yourself what can you do surely it would be impossible for any developer to get the approval to put up a building of that size in a lot that small but in connecticut you can and this scenario is real there s a zoning law called 8 30g it was enacted over 30 years ago in effort to build more affordable housing in connecticut and it applies to all towns with less than 10 percent of total housing units deemed affordable advertisement article continues below this ad the law enables housing developers to largely ignore zoning regulations governing height lot coverage and setbacks if they deed restrict 30 percent of the units to be affordable it s a great deal for developers and home builders but a bad deal for most neighborhoods who see their property values go down their neighborhoods drastically changed and of course negative effects on to our natural environment with 8 30g the burden shifts from the applicant justifying the development to the commission justifying a denial there needs to be evidence of substantial harm to health or safety issues sometimes neighbors who can afford to hire an attorney to fight 8 30g applications do so some successfully but oftentimes they impact very modest neighbors where residents don t have the means to intervene town plan and zoning commissioners like myself have to follow the law even though i suspect many of us struggle with it despite many towns doing the hard work of adding affordable housing units most towns will never be able to achieve 10 percent of their housing stock being deemed affordable the math will never add up the 10 percent ratio is virtually a mathematical impossibility in part because 70 of the new units need not be affordable advertisement article continues below this ad due to its draconian results the law seems to generate as much litigation as it does affordable housing units in the 30 years of the 8 30g being law only a small fraction of towns of our 169 cities and towns have achieved 10 percent we need to change it the 8 30g law has educated us on the laudable goal of creating more affordable housing this is good but it has come at a cost by penalizing the vast majority of connecticut towns that can never achieve the 10 percent target the law sets up an unfairness paradigm degrading public support and encouraging litigation land is finite and unique and land use decisions permanently affect a town s economic ecological and community health we can and must find a better way advertisement article continues below this ad some ideas include a moratorium lower the threshold to enable towns to plan better and sooner without being inundated in my very short tenure on the fairfield tpz we ve had two applications before us already remove the burden shifting component of 8 30g requiring zoning commissions to justify denials rather than applicants justifying development proposals this leads to commissions rendering permanent land use decisions without being fully informed often a poorer neighborhood can t retain experts to challenge the applicant s experts leaving the commission without enough information of potential safety or other harm provide leadership education and training in novel ways to incorporate diverse housing and affordable housing within a communities existing scale and character and how to fund the same so towns can plan advertisement article continues below this ad the law should be repealed and replaced with laws or programs that incentivize towns to expand affordable housing suited to each town s unique characteristics all of us are stakeholders and it behooves each of us to inform our legislators fellow residents and zoning boards of the importance of changing this harmful and punitive law
the owner of this ahem unique vw jetta is parting ways with it for 3 200 imagine this you own a volkswagen jetta and want to make it stand out you could do a number of things like fit a set of aftermarket wheels install a bodykit or perhaps perform an insane engine swap alternatively you could do what this owner has done this particular 2005 jetta tdi was recently posted up for sale on facebook s marketplace in mount ayr iowa and caught our attention after it was shared to reddit making it stand out from all others are the wing mirrors for whatever reason the owner has equipped the jetta with mirrors which seem lifted off either a super duty pickup truck or a full size semi truck we have little doubt that the massive mirrors help the owner spot ants 100 feet behind them but we re sure that they also negatively impact the car s aerodynamics in a pretty significant way they probably also produce a hefty amount of wind buffeting also the 2022 vw jetta gets a very light refresh and 11 extra horsepower thanks to new 1 5 tsi there s another odd addition made to the car namely a massive sticker on the windshield that simply reads windshield if that s a joke no we don t get it either the seller notes that they have owned the car since it had 301 000 miles 484 000 km with the odometer currently readying 304 000 miles 489 000 km they note that the stock wing mirrors have been kept in the trunk and that the car does have a coolant leak one of the wheels is also missing a lug nut you will also no doubt notice the black grille tinted taillights and the fact that it is rolling on a spare wheel the price for this weird jetta just 3 200 so would you be tempted

the content of this article was relevant at the time of publishing circumstances change continuously and caution should therefore be exercised when relying upon any content contained within this article despite a recent fall in the markets here s why i think warren buffett s recommendation of an s p 500 index fund still makes sense for my portfolio the content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be nor does it constitute any form of personal advice investments in a currency other than sterling are exposed to currency exchange risk currency exchange rates are constantly changing which may affect the value of the investment in sterling terms you could lose money in sterling even if the stock price rises in the currency of origin stocks listed on overseas exchanges may be subject to additional dealing and exchange rate charges and may have other tax implications and may not provide the same or any regulatory protection as in the uk when investing your capital is at risk the value of your investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you put in you re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fool s premium investing services become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more legendary investor warren buffett is a long time advocator of an s p 500 index fund for ordinary investors like me i ve already invested in a vanguard s p 500 etf but following the recent fall in the index i m looking at whether it s still a good fit for my own portfolio selecting a fund the standard and poor s 500 is widely considered the most important index in the united states and an essential barometer of us stock market health it contains 500 large companies selected by a committee firms must have a big enough market capitalisation and have at least 10 of shares outstanding this is in addition to meeting liquidity and profitability requirements with companies like microsoft and amazon included this index includes not only the biggest but also possibly the best firms that wall street has to offer for my own holdings i believe that buying a low cost etf exchange traded fund is the easiest way for me to invest in the index an etf is a fund that tracks an index or sector and can be bought and sold like a share through most online brokers in this case it allows me to invest in the s p 500 by owning a single share listed on the london stock exchange there is a myriad of choices in this space and most of the big investment companies offer similar products two of the factors i like to use in selecting an etf are the size and management charge for my own portfolio i feel that vanguard s p 500 etf lse vusa is the best fit it s one of the largest with over 37bn in assets it s also very low cost with a 0 07 ongoing charge does this s p 500 etf still make sense the fund is not without its faults first as it follows the index it only includes us companies second in buying it i can only get the returns of the s p 500 perhaps if i can pick the right individual stocks then maybe i can outperform the index indeed warren buffett has made his fortune by picking individual stocks from apple alone it s estimated that berkshire hathaway has made over 100bn in profit already during 2021 this etf increased by around 30 however year to date it s a different story at the time of writing this fund is down 8 that said most of the stock market is down worries about increasing us interest rates and rising russia ukraine tensions continue to drive shares lower however i like to think about the long term and the us index has averaged around 10 per year since 1957 though nothing is certain in investing i m hopeful that in the future we might see something similar also this fund allows me to invest in 500 companies by holding a single share for me it s a low cost way of diversifying across companies and sectors therefore as part of a balanced portfolio i m happy to follow warren buffett s advice and continue to hold and maybe buy more of vanguard s p 500 etf

the city s largest office landlord had lots of positives to say about the market s recovery sl green realty slg 2 95 is manhattan s largest office landlord the real estate investment trust reit owns interests in 73 buildings across the city with 34 9 million square feet of space because it has such an extensive portfolio it knows the state of the city s office market better than anyone else while the pandemic hit that market harder than most sl green sees better days ahead here s what it had to say about the recovery in the new york city office market ending 2021 on a high note sl green recently reported its fourth quarter financial and operating results one of the highlights was the continued improvement in leasing the company signed leases covering nearly 574 000 square feet during the fourth quarter bringing its full year total to over 1 9 million square feet that was well above the company s initial expectations that it would sign leases covering 1 3 million square feet the company saw demand across both new and legacy buildings it capped the year by signing two additional new leases for space at its recently completed one vanderbilt which is now 95 2 leased tenants included a global investment holding company and a bitcoin mining company the office reit also signed a 10 year nearly 82 000 square foot lease with the world s largest independent insurance brokerage firm at 1185 avenue of the americas the lease included a renewal of more than 42 500 square feet and an expansion of 39 000 square feet overall sl green enjoyed notable leasing velocity in the portfolio driven by new york city s ongoing recovery a look at what s ahead for sl green and the manhattan office market sl green s ceo marc holliday took some time on the accompanying conference call to discuss the current state of the manhattan office market he noted that after a solid december in the office market we had a bit of a reset in january which is not atypical after the holidays but most businesses in our portfolio express their intentions to return to the office in february and by march we expect to be back at the same levels we saw in december if not beyond that the omicron virus seems to be dissipating as fast as it arrived and we are hopeful that february we will begin to return to normal the ceo then noted a few catalysts driving its optimism about what s ahead for the new york city office market first he turned to the residential real estate market holliday stated those questioning the ability of new york city to rebound need to look no further than the resurgence in 2021 of the residential markets which saw record high end condo sales and a 1 vacancy in rental apartments as young people return to the city he believes that younger office workers who fled during the early days of the pandemic because of remote work are now returning in anticipation of heading back to the office this year the other catalyst holliday noted was the continued improvement in the office job market he pointed out that the city added 8 000 office using jobs in december bringing the increase to 61 000 year over year as a result the city had regained more than half the office jobs lost during the pandemic the ceo said that there are approximately 50 000 additional jobs forecasted to be created in 2022 which should help to begin to reduce office vacancy rates in manhattan because of these catalysts the reit remain optimistic about hitting our ambitious leasing goals for 2022 of 2 million square feet holliday stated that the company s current leasing pipeline stands at 1 3 million square feet as more companies gear up to return to the office this year he said that the positive takeaway is that companies continue to see the office as the central and necessary hub of business activity and are making long term commitments and expansions within the portfolio that vastly outnumber contractions new york city is slowly recovering the past couple of years have been tough on manhattan s office landlords given the impact the pandemic had on that city however the city s office market is starting to make a comeback sl green sees that continuing in 2022 which has the reit growing increasingly optimistic about its future that bodes well for investors it should help boost sl green s stock while enabling it to continue increasing its high yielding monthly dividend that makes it an attractive way to play the recovery in the manhattan office market
the opportunity to make money while we sleep is one few of us would turn down and passive income at face value suggests we can do just that social media is chock full of influencers telling us how to make passive income and while many of those content creators do actually earn money even when they re not on the clock fewer of them are forthcoming about the work required to get there a lot of people are surprised by how much work it takes because i think a lot of people who are earning a passive income are talking about how great it is having earned that says pat flynn a california based entrepreneur and creator of the smart passive income podcast but they don t necessarily tell you the whole truth you re seeing the tip of the iceberg passive income in most cases won t be created passively whatever the pursuit investing in stocks to receive dividends buying rental properties earning ad revenue on video channels you ll have to put in work upfront before you can start making money while doing little or no work and in many cases you ll have to keep doing work to maintain that income too passive income has no set definition when does a job or side hustle turn into passive income that depends on how you define it there is no clear cut point where income turns passive for some it could be when no work or upkeep is required or for others it could be when a minimal amount of work each week is required and minimal work is also subjective passive income for me is really something that you have to work to set up but after that it takes very minimal work to maintain and to keep that income stream coming says joseph hogue a chartered financial analyst and creator of the youtube channel let s talk money other sources of passive income include investing in bonds or peer to peer lending generating ad revenue from a blog or putting your money in a high yield savings account even the money an artist makes through plays of their songs on a streaming platform can qualify as passive income be ready to work contrary to what the phrase passive income suggests you need to put in work in order to attain it investing money you inherited or won in a lottery may be the only path to truly passive income start to finish but for most of us creating this new revenue stream will involve investing money made from more traditional means like a job or investing our time building a source of income from the ground up without a large initial financial investment people often underestimate the sweat equity or time and energy required at the beginning says jannese torres rodriguez a florida based entrepreneur and creator of the yo quiero dinero podcast that initial workload that time it s going to take to get to a place where it s passive is what freaks a lot of people out and makes them think that oh well this is obviously a scam because i just want to make money quickly says torres rodriguez for both torres rodriguez and flynn it took at least a year before they saw earnings from some of their current sources of passive income both said that it took consistent work during that period before they started seeing money come from their blogs including from affiliate marketing ad revenue and selling courses among other sources the amount of work upfront can depend on the income stream and what you want to get out of it for instance if you re making income from rental properties you can hire a person or a company to take care of all the property management that ll take away from your earnings but putting in your own time will make the income more active than passive if you re looking to make passive income keep in mind it s not guaranteed down the road even if you do put in the work there s no promise your investment whether that s time or money will pay off inevitably there is risk involved seeing other peoples successes or hearing about them can trigger that fear of missing out on a good thing but before you try to emulate them consider the journey it s not unattainable but it won t happen overnight this column was provided to the associated press by the personal finance website nerdwallet the content is for educational and informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice colin beresford is a writer at nerdwallet email cberesfordnerdwallet com twitter colin beresford related links nerdwallet what is passive income and how do i earn it
a u s federal court on thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing robinhood markets inc of violating state laws by restricting trades on so called meme stocks during a january 2021 rally a move that retail traders allege resulted in billions in losses chief judge cecilia altonaga of the federal court in miami ruled that retail investors cannot pursue negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims against the commission free brokerage citing robinhood s customer agreement which allowed it to restrict trading natalia salas an attorney for the plaintiffs said they plan to appeal the decision on behalf of investors who were not bound by the robinhood customer agreement the lawsuit was part of the wave of litigation after the brokerage temporarily barred customers from buying certain hot stocks including gamestop corp and amc entertainment holdings inc as their value soared during the social media fueled rally the investors alleged that robinhood had courted customers with promises of expanding access to the stock market but was indifferent to known risks tied to increased demand the lawsuit sought damages on behalf of robinhood customers as well as traders who lost money on gamestop amc and 11 other stocks in her 66 page opinion altonaga wrote that while traders were gravely disappointed by the plunge in meme stock prices that occurred after trades were restricted the law does not afford relief to every unfulfilled expectation robinhood is pleased with the decision spokesperson jacqueline ortiz ramsay said in a statement once more this confirms that the unfounded allegations against robinhood have no basis altonaga previously dismissed a lawsuit alleging that robinhood and other brokerages colluded with citadel securities llc to halt a short squeeze that was causing billions of dollars of losses for hedge funds that had bet against the stocks retail investors championed citadel securities and robinhood have denied those allegations the judge allowed plaintiffs to file an amended version of that lawsuit another meme stock lawsuit alleging robinhood violated securities law is pending robinhood has sought to dismiss the claims by jody godoy

according to this week s release from the commerce department the us economy has been growing at its fastest pace in almost 40 years corporate profits are their highest in 70 years and the stock market although gyrating wildly of late is still scoring record gains so why do most americans remain gloomy about the economy mainly because their real inflation adjusted wages continue to go nowhere steeply rising profits economic growth and stock market highs coupled with near stagnant wages has been the story of the american economy for decades most economic gains have gone to the top so why not share the profits profit sharing was tried with great success in the early decades of the 20th century but is now all but forgotten in 1916 sears roebuck co then one of america s largest corporations with more than 30 000 employees announced it would begin to share profits with its employees giving workers shares of stock and thereby making them part owners the idea caught on other companies that joined the profit sharing bandwagon included procter gamble pillsbury kodak and us steel the bureau of labor statistics suggested profit sharing as a means of reducing frequent and often violent disputes between employers and workers profit sharing gave workers an incentive to be more productive since the success of the company meant higher profits would be shared it also reduced the need for layoffs during recessions because payroll costs dropped as profits did by the 1950s sears workers had accumulated enough stock that they owned a quarter of the company and by 1968 the typical sears salesperson could retire with a nest egg worth well over 1m in today s dollars the downside was that when profits went down workers paychecks would shrink and if a company went bankrupt workers would lose all their investments in it the best profit sharing plans took the form of cash bonuses that employees could invest however they wish on top of predictable wages but profit sharing with regular employees all but disappeared in large us corporations ever since the early 1980s when corporate raiders now private equity managers began demanding high returns corporations stopped granting employees shares of stock presumably because they didn t want to dilute share prices sears phased out its profit sharing plan in the 1970s yet just as profit sharing with regular employees disappeared profit sharing with top executives took off as big wall street banks hedge funds private equity funds and high tech companies began doling out huge wads of stock and stock options to their mvps the result share prices and chief executive pay composed increasingly of shares of stock and options to buy stock have gone into the stratosphere while the wages of the typical worker have barely risen researchers have found that before the 1980s almost all the increases in share prices on the us stock market could be accounted for by overall economic growth but since then a large portion of the increases have come out of what used to go into wages jeff bezos who now owns about 10 of amazon s shares is worth 170 4bn other top amazon executives hold hundreds of millions of dollars of shares but most of amazon s employees such as warehouse workers haven t shared in the bounty amazon used to give out stock to hundreds of thousands of its employees but in 2018 it stopped the practice and instead raised its minimum hourly wage to 15 the wage raise got headlines and was good pr amazon is still touting it but the decision to end stock awards was more significant it hurt employees far more than the increased minimum helped them if amazon s 1 2 million employees together owned the same proportion of amazon s stock as sears workers did in the 1950s a quarter of the company each amazon worker would now own shares worth an average of more than 350 000 america s trend toward higher profits higher share prices mounting executive pay but near stagnant wages is unsustainable economically and politically profit sharing is one answer but how can it be encouraged reduce corporate taxes on companies that share profits with all their workers and increase taxes on those that do not sharing profits with all workers is a logical and necessary step to making the system work for the many not the few

michel martin host if you are one of the millions of americans who makes an income through gig work or a side hustle you probably get paid through an app like venmo or paypal or cash app they make it easy to exchange money for services and products no muss no fuss until now starting this year the irs is requiring third party apps like the ones i just mentioned to report any income for goods and services that total 600 or more and that ll probably have an effect on what s expected of these workers come tax season and that s not all the financial news that could affect your budget the stock market had a wild week and interest rates are set to go up soon so with so much going on we thought we d call michelle singletary to try to point us in the right direction she s the personal finance columnist for the washington post and she s with us now welcome thank you so much for joining us michelle singletary thank you for having me m martin so you recently wrote about this new reporting rule for the washington post and we want to begin with how you define it in your piece you say it s a new reporting requirement it s not a new tax so what exactly is it and whom does it affect singletary so the american rescue plan act added reporting requirements for 1099 k so that s the reporting requirement that for you know gig workers people who are self employed and so you know we ve got a tax gap in this country and so they re trying to make sure people report their income and we know that when third parties report what we earn then people tend to be honest and put it on their tax forms because there is accountability and so as part of you know fixing the tax gap they put in this new requirement that if you make more than you know 600 or more those apps that you mentioned have to send the information to the irs before the limit was way higher like 20 000 and 200 transactions so you can see for most people who are small business owners entrepreneurs gig workers that you know the old reporting rules didn t cover that however they were always supposed to report their income it just wasn t that reporting requirement and i think that s where a lot of the confusion comes out lots of people sort of think it s a new tax and that somehow this is attacking those people who are trying to do you know trying to make money for themselves but you were always supposed to be reporting your income to the irs this just has more accountability to it m martin so it s not about like splitting dinner with friends it is about that airbnb income it is about your etsy hustle for example singletary that s exactly right you know lots of people are concerned am i going to get a tax bill no if you are changing money between like you know i have a sister i might send her some money or you re splitting that you know restaurant bill or the grandma sent money it doesn t apply to that we re talking about business transactions m martin if people are not used to this and have not accommodated themselves to this how should they change their say budgeting if they haven t gotten one of these 1099 k forms before or frankly were not in the habit of putting money aside what do you recommend singletary so let s say you ve got a business and you re making you know a couple hundred dollars a month and you say you know you re spending this on all your you know personal expenses when you get that income from your business or side hustle you should automatically figure out what taxes you owe put that money into a different account and when it comes time to pay those estimated taxes is it four times a year then you go ahead and make those payments so you ve got to become much more disciplined in your business dealings lots of people mix the business with their personal and you know you put your business income in your personal account and next thing you know you ve spent it the tax money isn t there so you ve got to be even more disciplined and a lot of these platforms have business accounts they ll help you with that you know definitely if you you should have a tax professional to help you out with this you don t want to get in trouble with the irs on this you don t want to come next year when you file your taxes realizing you owe you know several thousand dollars in taxes and you don t have that money m martin so let s talk about another story that may affect people s personal finances earlier this week federal reserve chairman jerome powell signaled that he plans to start raising interest rates in march now this is going to affect what people who already have a lot of debt or who are thinking about taking out a mortgage or other loans if you re in that position what should you be thinking about singletary so if you re deep in debt the federal reserve has just given you your financial resolution get out of debt because it s going to cost you more if you have an arm an adjustable rate mortgage it s going to cost you more if you re buying something interest rates are going up we already now see that mortgage rates are inching up and so for example if you were thinking about it you might want to refinance and all the numbers work because you got to make sure the numbers work i would say refinance now before the rates go up most importantly if you are in credit card debt if you re not paying off that credit card bill every single month just make that your no 1 priority because that debt is going to cost you more it s already cost you a lot the average interest rate on a credit card is between 16 to 17 and some people it s you know 20 29 and even going up a couple of you know percentage points it s going to cost you money over time if you keep that debt hanging around like it s a pet m martin final big story the stock market had a wild week and this may make people nervous especially people who have money tied up in the stock market for retirement accounts which is probably the way most people do right so is there something that you suggest that people do right now if they re looking at these numbers and it s kind of making their stomach hurt singletary if you ve got time till retirement you know weather this storm now if you re nearing retirement and you were heavily invested in equities then you probably should be a little worried because this is money that you need now you know i talked to quite a few experts financial experts financial planners and they said listen you got you know if you retire in your 60s it s very likely you re going to live another 20 30 years so you need to have your money grow so it s ok to have it in equities but you also need to have a pile of money that isn t in the market that isn t tied to these turbulent times so that you can pull from that money when we have times like this when the market is see sawing up and down m martin that is michelle singletary she s the personal finance columnist for the washington post her latest book is what to do with your money when crisis hits a survival guide michelle singletary thank you so much for being with us singletary thank you for having me transcript provided by npr copyright npr

by peter certo stop me if this sounds familiar it s been kind of a hard year but i felt optimistic about the holidays my wife and i had just scheduled our covid 19 boosters even better we d been able to get our young child vaccinated we imagined a cautious return to simple family pleasures like indoor dining and maybe playdates at indoor play centers during the long midwestern winter maybe we d even test our kid s appetite for air travel and visit relatives in different parts of the country then another covid 19 variant possible breakthrough infections travel bans and tumbling stock markets and that familiar feeling of the rug being pulled out we don t know a whole lot about the omicron variant yet will it fizzle out like earlier variants or run rampant like delta whatever happens we do know one thing the longer it takes the world to get vaccinated the more variants we ll see here in the united states getting vaccination rates up means battling misinformation apathy and employers who won t give their employees sick time but vaccinating the rest of the world means battling corporate greed in poorer countries vaccine access is limited by the patent protections for pharmaceutical giants like pfizer modern and johnson johnson that puts life saving vaccines beyond the reach of what many countries can comfortably afford omicron was first reported in south africa as my institute for policy studies colleagues pointed out in their invaluable inequality org newsletter south africa had pleaded with western governments earlier this year to waive vaccine patents instead south africa ended up having to pay over double the price for doses that european union nations paid don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free thanks to price gouging like that they note moderna alone has minted five new billionaires meanwhile south africa s vaccination rate hovers at less than 30 percent with rates that low new variants are inevitable but south africa is comparatively lucky less than 10 percent of people on the african continent are fully vaccinated according to the people s vaccine alliance rich countries have received about 50 times as many vaccine doses as poor countries that means the virus has free rein to multiply over vast swathes of the planet every new infection increases the possibility of new variants including some that may prove resistant to the existing vaccines to close those gaps poorer countries need more vaccines and fast the biden administration courageously defied big pharma by backing a waiver for vaccine patents but countries like germany continue to resist it and advocates insist the u s isn t doing enough to fight for it another solution involves simply sending doses overseas the administration announced in august it had already exported 110 million doses and it recently promised another 500 million that s good but public health advocates are calling for far more vaccine equity could save millions of lives and prevent needless suffering that s reason enough on its own but by protecting workers across the globe it would also ease the global supply disruptions that are contributing to inflation here and abroad and it would go a long way toward ensuring that the existing vaccines remain effective you may be fully vaccinated you may have had your booster but you re not that disconnected from the person who lives in a country where only 2 percent of the population is vaccinated warns emory university virologist boghuma kabisen titanji if these gaps persist the virus will catch up with us regardless of where you are she s right thanks to a new variant halfway around the world i have to worry about whether i can take my kid to the diner down the road but it s a fitting holiday lesson in a way the more we give the more we get better tell the administration to make a list this piece was originally published on otherwords peter certo is the editorial manager of the institute for policy studies and editor of otherwords org this post was previously published on inequality org under a creative commons license

sitting in the basement of a historic courthouse in lincoln a wind swept town in north central kansas bradley roberts laughs while comparing his current situation to his previous life in san francisco roberts was like many people in the bay area savvy successful and drowning in housing expenses when he bought a house 15 years ago he and his partner went 300k over their budget rent at his last place in san francisco was nearly 4k a month it was awful roberts 50 told the hustle roberts whose grandparents were from lincoln bought a converted barn home in the middle of town last year for 22k his annual housing costs in lincoln are about the same as what his monthly housing costs were in san francisco when i moved to kansas roberts said i was like holy shit they re giving stuff away bradley roberts started a handyman business and says he fell in love with lincoln again the hustle roberts is exaggerating but only slightly in kansas small towns the houses are cheap with quality homes going for 100k and fixer uppers costing far less land a commodity over which nimby battles rage throughout the country can actually be obtained for free in several counties the downside to living in rural kansas of course has always been economic opportunity high paying jobs don t grow as easily as the milo but price conscious urban dwellers have been drawn to places they never thought they could live after a year of soaring real estate prices in every city and suburb long depressed and depopulated kansas is going through a lower key real estate boom of its own it always used to be the case that we said there s a big difference between what s going on in the larger cities and the rural areas said stanley longhofer a professor and founding director of the wichita state university center for real estate and the answer now is not as much it really is kind of across the board are the great plains the greatest option left for an affordable lifestyle and can small towns reverse the market forces that have long made them financially risky and undesirable the boom and bust of the great plains in the mid 1800s after breaking treaties and forcing the removal of native americans the united states had thousands of miles of land in the middle of the country and almost no western settlers wanted to live there then in 1862 abraham lincoln pulled the ultimate manifest destiny power move with the homestead act the government granted individuals 160 acres of free land as long as they lived on and farmed the land for 5 years enticing americans to claim 270m acres in states like kansas nebraska and north dakota free territory was also distributed to railroad companies which sold their surplus land to new residents at dirt cheap rates buoyed by the free and inexpensive land small towns sprung up overnight often just a few miles from each other these hyperlocal economies thrived with farming at the center of life but in the 1920s the mechanization of agriculture reduced the need for farm work and population loss followed the outflow accelerated in the coming decades as commercial farming operations consolidated family farms and interstate highways took away visitors once bustling main streets are now pockmarked with shuttered buildings and elder care facilities are often small towns top employers vacant storefronts in lincoln the hustle kansas embodies the ups and downs of the homestead act as much as anywhere the state boomed from 100k residents in 1860 to 1 4m in 1890 making it larger than new jersey but the vast majority of kansas counties experienced peak population before 1950 farms in the state have declined from 167k in 1920 to 58 3k today while growing in size from an average of 272 acres to 784 acres my own family deserted the great plains my great grandmother s parents farmed in osborne in the early 20th century but her daughter moved to larger less agrarian mcpherson and her daughter my mother moved to the kansas city area with dwindling populations the large number of small towns has turned into a logistical and financial headache many of kansas s sparsely populated 104 counties and 627 incorporated municipalities compare that to 58 counties and 482 municipalities in 13x larger california struggle to pay for government services recruit civic leaders and hold onto businesses health care and schools towns can t survive without enough people and people are hard to recruit when the local economies are in shambles so to attract newcomers towns have attempted a dizzying array of stunts and initiatives one of the most influential was a modern remix of the homestead act by marquette to save its school and stanch its population loss in 2003 marquette s leaders offered 60 free lots for anyone willing to move in and build a house a hutchinson news story picked up by the associated press led to a national media sensation culminating in a visit from cbs evening news at least 27 kansas towns have enacted free land programs since the late 1990s only a few have had success the hustle even in marquette the population rose for about 10 years before falling again and its elementary school was only temporarily saved closing in 2014 roughly 20 lots are still available why can t kansas give away land it s because the rural areas biggest strength cheap real estate has also been a weakness free but flawed on a cold day last november lincoln county economic development foundation director kelly gourley drove me to the east side of the town where an asphalt cul de sac backed into a sea of yellowing grass lincoln pop 1 2k is not overly small for rural kansas it has a theater a high school that ranks among the top 25 in the state and even a luxurious airbnb in a downtown loft but the population has fallen by 25 since 1980 and numerous storefronts are boarded up on the main drag a coffee shop below the airbnb closed just a few weeks before my trip the grass on the east side is another sign of frustration it was supposed to be covered by homes symbolizing a lincoln repopulated by the free land program but only 2 of 21 lots have been developed one by a former mayor and another that functioned as a spec home gourley who started her job after the program was enacted explains why a free giveaway can still be a questionable deal a new house would cost 100k 200k to build but is likely to sell for less given the low real estate prices buyers also struggle to get homes appraised at the cost of construction and sometimes need to cover the difference out of pocket kelly gourley stands near the lots lincoln can t give away it doesn t help that a nearby creek means some are in a floodplain the hustle lincoln has shifted to prioritize its inexpensive existing housing stock a strategy that has its own drawbacks similar to many kansas towns 30 of lincoln s houses require significant repair or outright demolition given how this shortage of good homes and economic risk for new construction scares off people who would even want to move to rural kansas it s easy to see why towns have sunk in a downward spiral but the insane real estate prices that have challenged the rest of the country have led to a spark in interest building up supply priscilla frankenstein loved the views in whitehall montana pop 1k on clear days she could see peaks and snow in almost every direction but after moving in 2019 from california and opening a restaurant frankie s with her husband charles prices got too high as the rapid growth in nearby bozeman spread to smaller towns their landlord hiked their rent and they were asked to pay 320k to buy the building where frankie s was located seeking an affordable alternative they moved to lincoln in january and found a much cheaper building for a restaurant they also bought a house that s big enough for their family of 5 for 70k in lincoln houses that used to sit on the market for a year were selling within weeks in 2021 gourley said she can t recall ever having fewer houses available after more than 30 were sold each year in lincoln county in 2019 2020 and 2021 up from 14 in 2018 per lincoln county statistics other rural kansas counties experienced the same rush mls data of 15 small counties across the state showed 2021 housing sales up 11 from 2019 and median time on the market last summer was 33 lower than in 2019 downtown lincoln kansas wikimedia we ve seen a lot of people coming back to rural communities because the cost of living is lower and because there s a quieter calmer lifestyle here said betsy wearing coordinator of programs at the kansas based dane g hansen foundation the momentum has led to a new challenge preparing the housing market to meet the demand economic development corporations are scouring for grants to pay for demolition and rehabilitation costs as well as payments that bridge the difference between the cost of new housing and the amount a bank will cover for a mortgage in lincoln gourley secured 150k in grant money late last year to help prospective buyers rehab 5 chronically vacant houses residents have also gotten involved in renovations vicki hook a native of nearby beverly moved back to kansas from florida and bought a 2nd home as an investment she paid 7 5k put in 60k in repairs and hopes to sell it for 85k vicki hook left returned to lincoln after decades away pam morgan moved to lincoln from kansas city not long after a chance side trip in central kansas the hustle in crowded housing markets in large cities house flipping is often viewed as a driver of inequality that s not a major concern yet in lincoln given the sheer quantity of neglected homes and the lack of outside speculators but the lower incomes in kansas small towns mean greater sensitivity to increasing costs even for prices that look cheap to people on the coasts while charles frankenstein doesn t want lincoln prices escalating as high as in whitehall he expects property values to increase we look at lincoln as a place we re moving to and investing into he said and we want to watch it grow and be on the ground floor of it as it grows making a living on the plains eric and emily wolgamot had all but given up on homeownership before they found lincoln in the last few years they moved out of california where emily wolgamot struggled to pay 1 2k in monthly rent on a telemarketer s salary in san diego to seligman a tourist town outside flagstaff the cost was manageable 400 a month for a plot in a trailer park but they needed a larger space for them and their 3 kids and yet taking the next step seemed impossible they saw off grid 3 bedroom houses listed at 150k houses with basic necessities like plumbing were going as high as 500k and i kind of wanted to turn on a faucet wolgamot said she and eric started searching online for houses across the country lincoln had the best deal 2 vacant houses for a combined 5 5k they paid cash and now only owe taxes which run 150 a month since moving in spring 2020 eric has rehabbed their homes while starting his own tree trimming and junk removal business the work is far different from the service industry jobs they had in california and arizona but they say it has been enough to provide for their family given the low cost of housing eric and emily wolgamot bought two vacant homes in lincoln for 5 5k the hustle entrepreneurship is encouraged for newcomers to lincoln a website advertising the town lists new or transitioning opportunities for restaurateurs contractors accountants attorneys and veterinarians gourley has plans to open a gym roberts the san francisco transplant started a handiwork business life isn t the same as in the bay area where he owned a flower business and drove a mercedes but last fall while visiting a friend in palm springs who was barely scraping enough money to afford a mortgage roberts realized the advantages of rural kansas i feel fortunate to be here because now i m back to where i feel comfortable he said that isn t to say lincoln doesn t have its drawbacks the diminished aging population makes it hard to grow business this is one reason why gourley wants to recruit remote workers who can increase the need for services while not being dependent on the local economy for their earnings reliance on the local economic base is still a significant risk dil darjee a bhutanese refugee moved with his family from st george utah and opened the post rock motel restaurant in 2020 lincoln was one of the few places he found a business opportunity he could afford the motel has drawn rave reviews online for cleanliness and professionalism and his restaurant serves a range of himalayan and american cuisine but that s not enough to guarantee success although his revenues had picked up during hunting season in november he said he struggled to cover his expenses in the summer months i m hoping for better days he said the narrowing gap between urban and rural after my conversation with darjee i drove back to the kansas city area the next day i enjoyed the various things people enjoy in bigger cities going to a coffee shop watching live jazz at a bar i m fortunate to have enough stability to afford increasingly expensive urban life and i prefer hustle and bustle over calm and quiet somewhere between marquette and lincoln the hustle besides an urban area s multitude of options and luxuries there are more pressing needs rural kansas does not meet anybody who doesn t drive would have extreme difficulty getting around and people who want racial and cultural diversity will not find it small towns in north central and northwest kansas are usually 90 white child care is also hard to come by although nonprofits have begun incentivizing it this lack of amenities coupled with the shortage of quality housing are why longhofer the wichita state professor does not expect rural kansas towns to find lasting salvation from recent real estate trends these have been issues that are not new with the pandemic they ve been long term longhofer said and so often we want to come up with this magic amulet that s going to fix all the problems and it s just a challenge for small town america yet people who need to move may find life in the city and life on the plains is more similar than ever the wi fi is still fast in towns like lincoln the same shows are still on netflix and amazon packages still come to your door the communities are small but friendly and it s so so much cheaper during my visit gourley showed me the ultimate real estate bargain an olive green dutch colonial house with an ad states enough woodwork to cause anyone to swoon it s a fixer upper but not beyond repair the free fixer upper in lincoln the hustle the price tag 0 00 the only catch is the house must be moved but the free lots are just down the street a buyer could put the free house on a free lot there s more one of the grants gourley secured can be used on the house meaning income eligible buyers could get 30k to spend on renovations as of last week the house was still available it could be yours if you re willing to have someone pay you to take it update 2 1 22 the hustle added some language to more clearly explain that the events surrounding the homestead act included the displacement of native americans who had inhabited midwestern land for centuries
the way home program is a rapid rehousing project that has been making an impact in philadelphia founded through striking collaboration the program is the first of its kind in the country and first designed specifically for lgbtq adults the program is now about a year and a half old and funded through the city way home was launched by self inc and the william way lgbt center operated through self inc the program is a component of the william way lgbt community center and the philadelphia office of homeless services s rapid re housing rrh project rapid re housing is a housing first model and is meant to be a model of extremely low barrier referrals come from the office of homeless services ohs clearinghouse through the coordinated entry and assessment based housing referral system cea bhrs by utilizing a 400 00 cares act grant way home will for a year pay a portion of the rent of 40 lgbtq residents who have been facing homelessness the way home plan the program is lgbtq affirming transgender competent anti racist and offers billingual services staff members who speak spanish are available to help spanish speaking applicants we re wanting to center language access and justice in this said cara tratner housing assistant director at self inc there are systemic barriers for spanish speakers and immigrant communities particularly to accessing shelter approximately five out of 30 who enrolled in the way home program have identified as latino or latina several of whom speak spanish way home offers rental assistance for individuals suffering from homelessness and focuses specifically on lgbtq folks the program has chosen a goal in the combating of homelessness among transgender and gender non comforming adults one very easy thing i can say about homelessness particularly among trans individuals is we just haven t done a great job ever of knowing just how widespread homelessness is in lgbt communities and in trans communities specifically said michael hinson president and chief operating officer of self inc the rate of homelessmess among these groups has been reportedly rising since 2017 but so has the visibility of homeless trans individuals some folks are saying there s been an increase well part of the increase is collecting more information said hinson there s still barriers really huge barriers to lgbt folks coming into the housing system or homeless system despite more attention being paid to affected communities some worry that lacking information and understanding still stands in the way of solution barriers stand between trans people and the housing system especially affecting groups such as those in latino communities african immigrant communities non english speaking communities and communities of young people the way home program utilizes a process embracing lgbtq friendly landlords in the city after locating a landlord and apartment for an individual the way home program helps to pay for housing and then helps connect individuals with jobs and services still way home finds it challenging to find lgbtq landlords or any landlords who are interested in working with people recovering from homelessness the way home from here when undergoing the screening process households will not be screened out for assistance based on criteria that assumes to predict successful outcomes such as employment criminal history mental health history medical history and evidence of motivation this process omitted by way home is often not abandoned when trying to predict success the answer is usually who appears to be the most employable in a system where black trans folks have so many barriers to getting employment that are less likely to find employment in that year because of all the layers of discrimination that doesn t mean they shouldn t deserve their basic right human right of having housing said tratner when considering what criteria predicts successful outcomes and how to avoid the pitfalls of such a system it depends on how success is defined in any case a tenet s success post assistance does not define the achievements they made while being assisted somebody who may have severe mental illness might not be able to stay permanently housed after this program because they don t have all the resources and supports they need but in our mind that doesn t mean they shouldn t still get housing said tratner to be eligible for the way home program an individual must be 18 years of age at or below the 30 of section 8 area median income ami and living in an emergency shelter or somewhere not suitable for living such as one s vehicle as of now way home is receiving an overwhelming number of submissions for housing assistance the program s waitlist was recently sitting at more than three times its capacity as reported by billy penn amid these obstacles philly s lack of affordable housing overall adds to the challenge if we are not increasing housing stock that is generated for poor people people who are living on a 15 or lower minimum wage folks who are elderly and have fixed incomes housing for those folks without some kind of subsidy without some kind of support or service is really unfortunately a dream said hinson some who apply to the program have been subject to a waitlist requiring months of patience the lack of clarity surrounding definite housing may cause further anxieties for homeless applicants a lot of people need more than one year of housing support because of our affordable housing crisis says tratner going forward way home will first run for a year of rehousing service and then the program will assess this period to consider how best to move forward considering the amount of applicants the program can hopefully move forward with another round of housing assistance hinson believes factors contributing towards homelessness are interconnected and a reflection of a broken system refusing to offer a clean slate to those who need it by the time someone is homeless and needs homeless or housing services that is just a symptom indicative of a system that has comprehensive failure for very particular groups of people said hinson with so many applicants coming forward it is worrisome there aren t more resources spread across the city to ensure philly s population is housed but way home is a start further information on the way home program and forms of contact can be found on the program s overview this article is part of broke in philly a collaborative reporting project among more than 20 news organizations focused on economic mobility

helping locals with food security builds a stronger community says alexander dillon closter nj united states january 28 2022 einpresswire com more than 38 million americans face food insecurity according to feeding america those who struggle with a lack of food span every community in the country struggling to get nutritious food in large enough quantities for the entire family many families going through food insecurity cannot qualify for federal food programs alexander dillon recently noted the inability to qualify for food assistance is one reason local food banks are so important those who donâ t qualify for national nutrition programs can visit community pantries or food banks to get the food they need though food insecurity can strike any family in any community the hardest hit communities are latino african american native american rural families children and seniors food banks are large warehouses that supply local food on a regular basis to those in the community who show up to get help food pantries may be similar to grocery stores or they might be small pantries located throughout the community and regularly stocked by locals people seeking help from these food programs are not required to prove their financial status or meet federal criteria â itâ s important there are options for someone who just hit a really hard streak â says alexander dillon â what if someone got slammed with a medical expense and hasnâ t had time to fill out the forms needed to get federal aid with food there should be ways for people to get the food they need without filing paperwork and going through a whole process those programs exist but gap filling programs like food banks are important for struggling households as well â as a business owner and entrepreneur alexander dillon started a successful restaurant in 2021 with two childhood friends in olarnoso he has been a regular supporter of charities like st francis food pantry for the past four years during this time heâ s seen the impact of food generosity on the community he recommends everyone get involved with communities in the areaâ especially food banks and local pantries that offer options for those facing empty shelves and hunger alexander dillon says the most helpful methods of support are usually financial since food pantries and food banks can often get bulk discounts most food banks are able to provide several meals for just a dollar and know what they need to stock for their program participants volunteers are also needed by nonprofits providing the human power needed to stock prepare and distribute the goods for those who want to donate goods nutrition not volume should be the focus along with diapers cleaning supplies paper products and personal hygiene items dillon adds that a growing number of local farmers and backyard gardeners are also supplying food banks with their excess vegetables each summer while not all food banks can accommodate home grown produce others are excited to receive fresh food and have the shelf space to accommodate it he recommends connecting with a local food bank to see the possibility of helping them meet their needs for the community they serve

since january 2022 copper prices have fluctuated within the range and there has been a surge in the market within the month but the duration is not long the overall increase in the price center of gravity is not large represented by smm1 copper the average price of copper at the beginning of the month is 69840 yuan ton which is basically within the range of consolidation within the month january 13 reached a peak of about 72200 yuan ton and then the price fell rapidly and then basically in the range of shock finishing as of january 28 the average spot price of copper in smm was 70500 yuan per ton with a slight increase of 660 yuan per ton or about 1 per cent market analysis domestic monetary policy is loose since the fourth quarter of last year the central bank has frequently issued easing signals at the beginning of this year the people s bank of china launched 700 billion yuan medium term loans to facilitate mlf operations and 100 billion yuan open market reverse repurchase operations the winning interest rates for medium term lending facilities mlf operations and open market reverse repurchase operations both fell by 10 basis points from a cut in reserve requirements to a cut in interest rates expectations of marginal monetary easing have been fulfilled slightly faster than expected in addition the regular meeting of the monetary policy committee in the fourth quarter of 2021 also released a positive policy signal some analysts believe that monetary policies such as cutting reserve requirements and interest rates will continue to make efforts which will be conducive to the growth of market confidence and enhance medium term optimism at least in the first quarter there is no need to worry about liquidity which may play a supporting role in the spring market to a certain extent inflation expectations are rising recent concerns about inflation still hang over the market singapore tightened policy and raised inflation expectations inflation surged in australia in the fourth quarter of 2021 amid speculation that the rba would raise interest rates early in japan and india a sharp rise in commodity prices was also pushing up inflation expectations in the united states inflation reached a nearly 40 year high in december while a series of recent official data highlight the current high inflation in the united states which is expected to remain high so far base metals have not overreacted to inflation expectations but in the long run high inflation will drive up the prices of commodities such as crude oil and could unexpectedly support the prices of energy intensive metals russia ukraine geo game energy crisis fermentation since 2021 due to the global shortage of natural gas coal and other energy supplies the european energy crisis has continued to ferment european natural gas prices have risen by more than 600 with the exception of poland and some nordic countries the average price of electricity in most european countries has exceeded 300 euros per megawatt hour which is at an all time high data show that over the past 20 years the degree of dependence on natural gas imports in europe has been increasing russia is one of the major countries of natural gas imports in europe affected by geopolitical factors the nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline project connecting germany and russia is difficult to put into operation although the price of natural gas in europe has fallen somewhat the cold wave in winter may occur at any time coupled with the uncertainty of the geo game between russia and ukraine which makes the supply of natural gas in europe even more difficult the expectation of natural gas shortage leads to high electricity prices which suppresses the flexibility of the release of smelting capacity in the short term if the energy crisis is not effectively alleviated the smelter side may continue to be hit and the price support for the supply side of basic metals will still exist off season consumption should not be overly bearish with the lunar new year holiday approaching domestic consumption began to enter the off season copper downstream demand weakening mainly to consume inventory the holiday was early this year and some enterprises began to have a holiday one after another on the 15th industries such as electric power real estate and new energy also showed a downward trend consumption of refined copper rods copper tubes and copper strips weakened and orders and operating rates of related enterprises all dropped however according to the law of previous years there is still periodic stock demand before and after the spring festival household appliances can be scheduled after january photovoltaic wind energy consumption is still good coupled with the recent rapid rise in copper prices have a certain restraint on consumption with the copper price back to around 70 000 the willingness or enhancement of downstream replenishment the follow up need to pay attention to the downstream acceptance short term consumption should not be overly bearish low inventory support is still strong in 2021 the explicit inventory of copper in lme comex and shanghai stock exchange was the lowest since 2008 and lme even staged a large scale delivery the inventory was the lowest since 1998 and the domestic copper inventory also fell to a low the second half of 2021 was in a state of continuous destocking with the improvement of the epidemic situation abroad and the recovery of foreign consumption coupled with the fact that china began to be short of copper imports and made profits inventories were quickly digested it was not until the end of the year that copper stocks stopped falling and rose which is related to the off season of copper consumption near the end of the year as of december 31 2021 lme copper inventory was 88950 tons comex copper inventory was 69667 tons and the previous period of copper inventory was 38182 tons with the arrival of the spring festival holiday china may start the accumulation process in late january although copper inventories have rebounded slightly from their lows overall inventories are still at historically low levels after low supply growth in recent years in addition the energy shortage in europe has led to continuous production cuts in european smelters while the overall demand for non ferrous metals is more resilient in the near future and inventories will still decline to varying degrees on the whole in the current situation of low inventories the pressure on copper prices is expected to be limited if there is a small surplus of copper supply and demand in 2022 the global market will still be able to absorb the excess relatively easily and should not be overly bearish on copper prices future forecast in the short and medium term foreign inflation expectations are heating up metal prices are supported domestic stable growth policies are underpinned fundamentals and liquidity are stable and the nature of the market s positive trend remains unchanged in addition in the context of domestic spring festival reserve loans and low inventories there is still support for prices and it is expected that the short and medium term copper prices will have limited room to fall and the short term range will remain volatile
central bank policy normalization or lack of it and monetary policy differentials are the main reasons why the usd jpy is set to race higher towards the 118 level this year in the opinion of economists at scotiabank gains in the usd unlikely to encounter verbal intervention from officials in washington or tokyo we expect the fed to tighten monetary policy aggressively and look for the fed funds rate to reach 2 00 this year to combat more persistent and entrenched inflationary pressures meanwhile the bank of japan boj is unlikely to shift monetary policy any time soon we expect rates to rise in the us whereas japanese government bond yields are poised to remain extremely low we forecast us 10y bond yields reaching 2 40 this year and to hold at or a little above that point in 2023 in contrast jgb yields are poised to remain more or less flat this year 0 14 and rise just 3bps from that to 0 16 in 2023 according to the bloomberg survey our correlation studies suggest the influence of longer term yield spreads on usdjpy is rising again the 5 year and 10 year spread correlations with spot are holding at 60 currently while the 2y spread correlation remains a relatively soft 46 wider spreads will lift the usd a higher usd jpy rate would likely suit both the us and japan at the moment a firmer dollar helps curb imported inflationary pressures into the us while japan s exporter base will welcome a weaker exchange rate the consensus anticipates little movement in the jpy this year or next 116 forecast for both end 2022 and end 2023 whereas we see more upside risk to 118 this year and 120 in 2023
from crisis to transformation part 1 earlier this week the international monetary fund imf revised its global economic outlook for 2022 according to the imf global growth is expected to moderate from 5 9 in 2021 to 4 4 percent in 2022 representing a half of a percentage point lower for 2022 than was projected by the fund last october the imf noted that its forecast largely reflects markdowns in the united states us and china the world s two largest economies the imf blamed the downgrade on rising cost pressures inflation and the rapid spread of omicron while the outlook for the us and china appears to be worse than for everyone else the fund noted that few countries would be spared a slowdown in addition to the more modest imf forecast for global economic growth in 2022 global stock markets have also been jittery for the past few days mainly because the brewing russia ukraine conflict has been rattling investors the economic times also went as far as to predict that a big global stock market crash is on the horizon perhaps within the next year if we were hoping for a diet of better news in 2022 early indications are not very promising however the old adage often credited to former british prime minister winston churchill that we should never let a good crisis go to waste still rings true the multiple crises facing the world also present opportunities for transformation especially for small economies many of which have had one crisis too many in the past five years alone underdevelopment is not an inevitability for small economies and there are many which have managed to attain high levels of income and human development however one always gets the sense that most small economies are one crisis removed from the undoing of their hard earned social and economic gains whether they are small economies in the caribbean the pacific or africa there are certain realities which make their development prospects highly uncertain and which tend to be heightened in the face of global crises small economies are typically more open to both international trade and foreign direct investment have narrow export structures and few export markets government expenditure also tends to play an outsized role in the economy sometimes because the state ends up having to provide services which the private sector might be reluctant to provide due to limited returns on investment meanwhile smaller landmass also suggests that the impact of natural disasters is more severe these factors contribute to persistent volatility and this volatility gets worse when global crises occur now the question of transformation takes centre stage how can transformation occur in the face of persistent volatility is transformation possible in a crisis environment which further amplifies existing volatility the answer is yes but with the caveat that it is not an easy feat transformation would require some difficult decisions one of which would involve a commitment to save more about four years ago the world bank published a report which showed that caribbean countries for example have low savings the world bank publication noted that compared to the rest of latin america caribbean economies have had lower average savings rates over the past forty years of course hardly any other region of the world is as disaster prone as the caribbean and this certainly affects the ability of governments to save national savings are important because they contribute to increased productivity and stronger economic growth over the long term they also increase a country s capacity to produce goods and services in the future and consequently help to increase the standard of living for future generations savings also help to buffer against external shocks and provide governments with other options to borrowing how can national savings increase economic diversification export growth and tax reform can go a long way in this regard incentivising the private sector to play a bigger role in the economy can also help as this would free the state of the burden of having to be involved in areas of the economy perhaps best suited to private sector involvement these will be elaborated on in next week s article joel k richards is a vincentian national living and working in europe in the field of international trade and development email joelkmrichards gmail com
the familiar litany heard from clients in the late 1990 s and lately today when the subject of trimming winners arises particularly the megacap 8 as ed yardeni refers to the top market cap weights in the is that they ll come back i m not worried having recently had this conversation with a client with me warning that some longer term portfolio winners will have to be reduced a list was put together of growth stocks from the late 1990 s that took years to recover their all time highs if at all microsoft nasdaq peaked in january 2000 and did not make a permanent all time high until july 2016 cisco nasdaq peaked at 82 in april 2000 and has yet to get back above that key price level intel nasdaq peaked at 73 in july 2000 and has yet to make a new all time high in 21 years oracle nyse peaked in september 2000 at 46 and then didn t make a new all time high until june 2017 pfizer nyse peaked at 45 in june 2000 spinoff adjusted and just broke out of that 20 year base in 2021 merck nyse also peaked at 87 50 in december 2000 again spinoff adjusted and has yet to make an all time high walmart nyse peaked in january 00 at 70 25 per share and never traded above that level until july 2012 home depot nyse peaked at 70 per share in april 2000 and it too never made a permanent all time high until march 2013 or just around the same time the s p 500 was making new all time highs for the first time since march 2000 and october 2007 bank of america nyse hasn t made a new high since january 2006 when it printed 55 per share and still looked reasonable on a valuation basis given it s dividend yield etc schwab nyse made a new all time high in april 1999 at 51 52 per share and never recovered that price until the last 18 months on a permanent basis so chuck was under water from 1999 highs for 19 20 years think about a jdsu jds uniphase whose chart can t be found on worden due to the 2015 split into two separate companies or even corning nyse whose monthly chart looks like this glw had a good week this week but the company has a heavy capex burden to bear much like intel nasdaq glw hasn t been owned for clients since the early 2000 s glw since 1 1 2000 has returned less than 1 a year while the s p 500 has returned 7 4 for the last 21 years summary conclusion while there is a captain obvious element to this post for professional investors it s important for readers to understand and get when stocks are in the news like the megacap 8 have been for the last 5 years and have had favorable macro conditions like very low interest rates and low corporate tax rates and pro trade policies conditions inevitably change and multiples inevitably compress and buying near fevered all time highs can risk a considerable degree of client capital 2022 is going to be a tougher year for growth stock investors and client portfolios have been under transition for some time since later in 2020 to spread the capital gains in taxable accounts but admittedly having been burned in 2000 2002 client portfolios have been managed with growth value blend in mind with a close eye on portfolio weights and correlations today 29 of the s p 500 s market cap is contained in the top 10 names in the s p 500 as of friday january 28 2022 while i personally have high regard for value investors like oakmark associates david herro and bill nygren and other value investors like vitaliy katsenelson and jim chanos it s the how shall i say moral piety of the jeremy grantham s who insist the last 12 years have been a bubble in the s p 500 during a period when the s p 500 s average annual return since january 1 2010 through 12 31 20 was over 15 per year look the decade from 2000 to 2009 was the worst decade of return for the s p 500 since the 1930s it was a pretty safe assumption and it didn t take a rhodes scholar to determine that the next decade 2000 to 2019 would likely see a better return for the s p 500 which it did even i got that right the power of both pe expansion and contraction can make growth and value investors look like complete idiots over long periods of time while company fundamentals remain relatively sound charlie billelo the excellent technician whose work is shown on ycharts and on twitter with regularity put up a chart of microsoft s revenue in dollars every year since the 1990s last week and microsoft s revenue grew in dollars every year from 2000 to 2015 yet microsoft didn t make a new all time high during that period that s a brutal market to really wrap it up this isn t a screed for growth and against value investing or vice versa growth investors get it right and then can get it wrong and value investors do the same as someone who allocates capital for clients i ve become very partial to the great bruce lee s fighting philosophy i e the best style is no style we re reducing the growth stock weights adding to select value names and sectors and looking for uncorrelated with the last 12 years think for yourself take everything you read here with a grain of salt do your own homework and past performance is no guarantee of future results

perpetual covid vaccinations mayo clinic thinks jabs will be necessary for at least a century if you re into this sort of thing maybe now wouldn t be a bad time to call your investment broker and ask him or her to put more of your money into big pharma covid 19 vaccine makers because it sounds like they re going to be around for a long time according to one mayo clinic physician dr gregory poland a vaccine researcher and editor of the medical journalâ vaccine told aâ marketwatchâ webinar this week he believes that covid jabs will be around for more than 100 years which actually means that they re never going to go away given that vaccines are known to contribute to viral mutations in the virus attempt to stay alive â so let me make a prediction which will be hard for any of you to hold me to because we will all be dead by then but your great great great grandchildren will still be getting immunized against coronavirus polandâ said during the webinar according to theâ daily mail interestingly poland s prediction comes as other experts see the omicron variant of the virus which is far milder than previous mutations as diminishing rapidly leading them to conclude that the pandemic will soon become an endemic which means simply that the viral pattern has become stable and predictable but poland disagrees telling the webinar we are not yet at any stage where we could predict endemicity we re not going to eradicate it theâ daily mail adds he noted that the virus has shown the ability to infect animals meaning it can potentially circulate indefinitely as it transmits across species and continues to mutate poland believes the virus will circulate for so long that people will still be receiving covid shots for generations down the line commenting on his prediction poland made a historical reference how can i even say such a thing if you got your flu vaccine this fall you were immunized against a strain of influenza that showed up in 1918 and caused a pandemic he said poland has made dire predictions before and has been accurate just last month he told dailymail com that he thought at least 32 000 people would die from the virus between early december through the end of the year noting 32 000 americans who think they re going to be alive to celebrate christmas and new year s are no pun intended dead wrong not one of them believes that was dec 9 during the period he mentioned there were actually around 31 000 covid deaths per official numbers making him nearly spot on daily mailâ noted further that poland isn t the only viral expert who is predicting more chaos ahead regarding the covid pandemic dr anthony fauci someone who is jointly responsible for the creation of covid in the first place according to previous reports has also predicted that successive new strains are coming after omicron dies down i would hope that the case but that would only be the case if we don t get another variant that eludes the immune response of the prior variant he said during a davos agenda virtual event recently he said in august that he believed a vaccine resistant strain of covid was due to emerge and sure enough a few months later researchers in south africa discovered omicron which is continuing to blow past vaccines and infect tens of millions some seriously these experts are accurate with their predictions because they know that covid is a manufactured virus a product of dangerous gain of function research that fauci helped fund and they know that it was manufactured with staying power so to speak as evidenced by the dozen or so variants that have emerged thus far so again if you are into traditional long term financial investments it s probably a good idea to buy some covid vaccine maker stock because the fact is poland and fauci are right this virus very likely isn t going anywhere sources include dailymail co uk naturalnews com

menafn daily forex the us dollar saw a resurgence during the month of january as inflationary pressures are forcing the federal reserve to tighten monetary policy at the end of the month we saw a rather strong acceleration of this trend and this does lead me to believe that the us dollar will continue to strengthen against the rand during the month of february advertisement take advantage of great zar trading opportunities now trade usd zar now inflation tends to hurt hit emerging markets much harder than it does some of the more developed ones and i do believe that south africa will be in the crosshairs keep in mind that a lot of forex traders use the south african rand as a proxy for the entire continent which will be hurt by the federal reserve raising rates however in the inflationary headwinds that we see in the united states it is likely that the federal reserve will feel that they have no choice but to raise rates although the federal reserve is supposed to be in theory an independent body the reality is that there is a lot of political pressure on them coming from the joe biden white house to do something about inflation that means raising rates this will continue to strengthen the us dollar going forward as the bond market in america has already been priced in at least for rate hikes jerome powell during the last week of the month suggested that they were in fact going to not only raise interest rates but reiterated the idea of running down the balance sheet meaning that rates will naturally stay higher for the foreseeable future in america that makes the us dollar much stronger and slows down growth if growth slows down in the united states the demand for commodities will drop which will directly affect south africa as it is considered to be a proxy for africa but more importantly a commodity currency you already see commodities across the board dropping with maybe the exception of crude oil there are different dynamics at play in that market but clearly we are in a dollar positive environment and they do not think that is going to change over the next 30 days as the federal reserve hasn t even started its tightening yet with that being said it is more or less going to be a buy the dips month from what i see
as the omicron variant has stormed through u s classrooms sending students home and in some cases to the hospital the rate of vaccination overall for america s 28 million children ages 5 11 is even lower than health experts had feared according to a new analysis by the kaiser family foundation based on federal data only 18 8 are fully vaccinated and 28 1 have received one dose for weeks the principal of garrison elementary school in washington d c had been imploring kemika cosey to please allow her children ages 7 and 11 to get covid shots cosey remained a firm no but principal brigham kiplinger swatted away the no since the federal government authorized the coronavirus vaccine for children ages 5 11 nearly three months ago kiplinger has been calling the school s parents texting nagging and cajoling daily acting as a vaccination advocate a job usually handled by medical professionals and public health officials has become central to his role as an educator the vaccine is the most important thing happening this year to keep kids in school kiplinger said largely because of kiplinger s efforts garrison elementary has turned into a public health anomaly of the 250 garrison wildcats in kindergarten through fifth grade 80 have had at least one shot he said the disparity in vaccination rates among the states is stark in vermont the share of children who are fully vaccinated is 52 in mississippi it is 6 it s going to be a long slog at this point to get the kids vaccinated said jennifer kates a senior vice president at kaiser who specializes in global health policy she says it will take unwavering persistence like that of kiplinger whom she knows firsthand because her child attends his school it s hard hard work to reach parents after the pfizer biontech vaccine was authorized for younger children in late october the out of the gate surge in demand lasted just a ew weeks it peaked just before thanksgiving then dropped precipitously and has since stalled it hovers at 50 000 to 75 000 new doses a day i was surprised at how quickly the interest in the vaccine for kids petered out kates said even parents who had been vaccinated themselves were more cautious about getting their kids vaccinated public health officials say persuading parents to get their younger children vaccinated is crucial not only to sustaining in person education but also to containing the pandemic overall with adult vaccination hitting a ceiling 74 of americans ages 18 and older are fully vaccinated and most of those who aren t seem increasingly immovable unvaccinated elementary school children remain a large source of spread traveling to and from school on buses and traversing school hallways bathrooms classrooms and gyms they can unknowingly act as viral vectors countless times a day health experts say parents give numerous reasons for their vaccination hesitation for many working parents the obstacle is logistical rather than philosophical as they struggle to find time to get their children to the clinic doctor s office or drugstore for a vaccination in some communities where adult opposition to vaccines is strong local health departments and schools do not promote the shots for children vigorously for fear of backlash some pharmacies don t even bother to stock the child size doses despite the proliferation of covid crowded hospitals sick children and the highly contagious aspect of omicron many parents still swayed by last year s surges that were generally not as rough on children as adults do not believe that the virus is dangerous enough to warrant risking their child s health by getting a shot experts say health communication experts additionally blame that view on the early muddled messaging around omicron which was initially described as mild but also as a variant that could pierce a vaccine s protection many parents interpreted those messages to mean that the shots served little purpose in fact the vaccines have been shown to strongly protect against severe illness and death although they are not as effective in preventing infections with omicron as with other variants experts say cases involving children for whom covid has been diagnosed keep rising as a report earlier this month from the american academy of pediatrics underscores dr moira szilagyi the academy s president pressed for greater rates of vaccination saying after nearly two years of this pandemic we know that this disease has not always been mild in children and we ve seen some kids suffer severe illness both in the short term and in the long term convincing parents proponents of covid shots are redoubling their efforts to convince parents the american academy of pediatrics has put together talking points for pediatricians and parents kaiser has its own parent friendly vaccine information site patsy stinchfield a nurse practitioner who is the incoming president of the national foundation for infectious diseases keeps up a speaking schedule answering vaccine questions from parents teenagers pediatricians and radio talk show hosts johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health has posted a free online training course to help give pro vaccine parents language and ways to approach their resistant friends it provides vaccine facts resources and techniques to engage them one tip is to share personal stories about covid 19 to ground the purpose of the vaccine in real world experience another is to normalize covid vaccinations by proudly telling friends and relatives when children get covid shots rupali limaye an associate scientist at bloomberg who studies vaccine messaging and developed the course said giving parents tools to persuade others about covid shots could improve uptake rates particularly now that some hesitant parents are rejecting the advice of pediatricians peer vaccine ambassadors as she calls them have more time and exert less of a power dynamic than do harried doctors this is a supersensitive topic for a lot of people limaye said since november kiplinger who has been garrison s principal for five years has been working through a daily call list of parents he says he understands their apprehension because he went through the same mental gymnastics before deciding to get his two young sons vaccinated i m a real pain in the ass he admitted i lovingly harass them covid has been especially brutal for black and hispanic families whose children comprise about 80 of the school s population kiplinger understands that as a white man he has limited standing to ask those parents to trust vaccines and so has been wrangling black pediatricians to supply medical information as well as endorsements given the history of understandable medical mistrust in communities of color hesitancy is natural and understandable he said but to keep our wildcats safe and in school we ve got to push through the natural fear many parents told him they couldn t take off work to take their children to get shots so kiplinger coordinated with a city program to hold covid vaccination clinics in the school s cafeteria during caregiver friendly hours he attends each one cosey worried that the vaccine could exacerbate her son s many allergies it took me a little minute to do a lot more research she said earlier this month she took both children to a school clinic her pediatrician had encouraged her but she gives credit to kiplinger her fifth grader has been at garrison since kindergarten mr kip is more like family so when i say he was nagging it s a good nag she said at the school s clinic mr kip took a million pictures she said he was just superexcited that i decided to come in kiplinger is determined to convert the remaining vaccine holdouts at garrison at the most recent vaccination clinic he stood by as a mother argued over the phone with her husband the mom and her four wildcats wanted the shots but for the dad it was a no it broke my heart he said but we have another clinic coming up soon he added and i m hoping that maybe he ll come around turning corner states where the omicron variant began skyrocketing in late december weeks after setting off spikes in states like new york appear to be turning a corner with new infections starting to decline if that trend holds it would be an encouraging sign that the united states may be through the worst of the omicron wave in arizona the seven day average of daily cases fell from a peak of 20 778 monday to 18 208 friday a roughly 12 decrease over five days according to a new york times database cases in utah have declined 35 and in mississippi 25 since peaking jan 19 cases in north dakota have fallen 19 since a jan 22 peak while these states are early in their downswings they appear so far to be following a similar trend to states where the omicron surge began earlier those states in turn have been following a similar pattern to south africa where the variant was identified in november and where case averages have plummeted 87 from a mid december peak but national case numbers while falling 31 in the past two weeks are still substantial the average remains around 590 000 a day more than double the worst statistics from last winter hospitalizations which lag cases appear to be peaking and are likewise higher than last winter s peak deaths which lag more are still increasing and have passed last winter s peak in some places although not nationally even in new york and new jersey which are further ahead on the curve than many states and have seen the seven day case average fall more than 70 the average is still higher than the peak of last winter s wave and in some states like alaska and washington cases are still rising florida alaska the omicron wave of the coronavirus is receding across florida where the scope of its deadliness has begun to take shape for the first time since mid october florida logged more than 1 000 covid 19 deaths in a week state health officials reported friday viral fatalities rose by 1 192 since jan 21 data from the state health department shows that s nearly twice as many new victims reported last week and more than seven times as many four weeks ago and the omicron death wave appears to be rising as fast as the delta variant surge from last summer during this recent swing health officials counted 122 new deaths during the week ending dec 24 but in the six weeks since then under the omicron variant that tally has grown breaking 1 000 this week florida s covid 19 death toll stands at 64 955 residents the state in june stopped reporting fatalities among nonresidents who tested positive there in alaska a combination of staff shortages and rising patient counts is continuing to strain the state s health care system alaska s omicron surge began a few weeks after that of other states which is likely why cases there have not yet begun to slow dr anne zink alaska s chief medical officer said thursday during a call with reporters by friday there were 156 covid positive patients hospitalized up from 129 reported wednesday and 139 reported monday but still well below the more than 230 hospitalizations reported during a peak last fall about 15 of all hospitalizations in the state involved people with covid 19 at providence alaska medical center the state s largest hospital there were between 80 and 100 staff members who had called in friday because of illness or possible exposure according to mikal canfield hospital spokesman just one intensive care unit bed remained available by friday at noon despite the surge in cases and hospitalizations zink said she thinks that in some ways alaska s pandemic response feels smoother this time around information for this article was contributed by jan hoffman and maggie

falling share prices prompt uncomfortable questions for investors should they sell existing holdings that are now trading at a loss or should they stick with loss making positions in view of the potential for long term recovery it is a quandary that this column has at times faced with mining company glencore since it was tipped as a buy in july 2017 although it now trades 26pc higher than at the time of our recommendation and has outperformed the ftse 100 by 25 percentage points its shares have spent much of the intervening period in the red now though the company has an increasingly upbeat outlook notably it is shifting focus from fossil fuel assets such as oil and coal to commodities that are poised to play an integral part in the world s low carbon energy transition it plans to direct around 75pc of its future capital expenditure to assets including copper cobalt and nickel which are used extensively in renewable energy projects and electric vehicles they are likely to be required for the world to meet its twin goals of reducing carbon emissions and addressing growing energy demand which is forecast to rise by 19pc within the next two decades furthermore long lead times on new mining projects and reduced exploration in recent years may inhibit future supply growth as glencore has exposure to a wide range of commodities and geographical areas unlike many of its pure play rivals it seems well placed to benefit from the ambitious net zero targets of the world s major economies and the population growth that is largely behind a surge in energy demand encouragingly the company s latest production report stated that it was on track to meet full year guidance a further update is scheduled for release on wednesday while annual results are due on feb 15 the company s shares could also be boosted by the rapidly evolving global economic outlook america is experiencing its highest level of inflation since 1982 since commodity prices have historically been positively correlated with a rapid rise in the cost of living shares in mining companies could experience a fillip as inflation is widely expected to increase further in the current year meanwhile the outlook for global economic growth remains relatively upbeat the imf forecasts a figure of 4 4pc this year although this represents a 0 5 percentage point reduction from its october prediction the emergence of omicron accounts for a large part of the downgrade as the pandemic enters its endgame we hope an improving economic outlook and lessened chance of operational disruption could benefit glencore s financial prospects even if commodity prices come under pressure the firm s improving financial position suggests it has a growing capacity to overcome them net debt declined by around 10pc in the first half of its current financial year and it now has a net debt to equity ratio of less than 100pc furthermore the company s shares trade on a forecast price to earnings ratio of around 9 this indicates that they continue to offer a margin of safety should the firm s prospects deteriorate in the short run

author peter martin menafn the conversation australia s leading forecasters expect the reserve bank to resist pressure to lift interest rates all year despite rising interest rates overseas much higher inflation plunging unemployment and financial market traders pricing in two hikes in the next six months the 24 person forecasting panel assembled by the conversation also predicts weaker economic growth much lower housing price growth next to no growth in the australian share market little or no further inroads into unemployment and wage growth so weak that real wages go backwards two thirds of the forecasting panel expect the reserve bank to leave rates ultra low until at least the first quarter of 2023 when it will have a better read on price pressure wages and the jobs market investors are banking on a different outcome ahead of the reserve bank board s first meeting for the year on tuesday securities exchange trading is pricing in an increase in the reserve bank s cash rate from its historic low of 0 10 to 0 25 by june followed by an increase to 0 5 by august and two further increases to 1 0 by christmas read more top economists see no prolonged high inflation no rate hike in 2022 if that happened it would leave mortgage rates higher than they were before covid and before two years of ultra low interest rates pushed up home prices 25 the bank of england increased its cash rate from 0 1 to 0 25 in december and the reserve bank of new zealand lifted its cash rate in october and november to 0 75 a 40 year high in inflation is expected to force the us federal reserve to lift rates in march but china has moved in the other direction cutting rates and imploring the rest of the world not to slam on the brakes reserve bank governor philip lowe addresses the national press club on wednesday lukas coch aap on balance no rate hike all year now in its fourth year the conversation survey taps the expertise of leading forecasters in 18 universities and financial institutions among them economic modellers former treasury oecd and reserve bank officials and a former member of the reserve bank board the panel was surveyed on january 20 eight of the panellists predict the reserve bank will begin lifting its cash rate this year one former oecd official adrian blundell wignall expects the bank to begin lifting in march ahead of the federal election but the bulk of those surveyed point to the bank s target of achieving average inflation sustainably within its target band of 2 3 over time noting that inflation has been well below that band for most of the past five years governor philip lowe will outline his thinking after the first reserve bank board meeting of the year in an address to the national press club on wednesday the panel expects him to suggest he will need to see more than a short lived burst of higher inflation before he lifts rates the panel s median middle forecast is for rate hikes to begin in april 2023 three panellists including peter tulip a former research manager at the bank expect no increase before february 2024 the conversation cc by nd inflation not yet a problem although inflation has jumped to a four decade high of 7 in the united states and although australia s headline inflation rate has hit 3 5 the so called underlying inflation rate targeted by the reserve bank hasn t yet reached the top of the bank s 2 3 target band the panel s average forecast is that it won t reach it in 2022 or 2023 and that it will decline in 2023 but inflation is expected to be high enough to send real wages backwards perhaps for two consecutive years a first in the 25 year history of the wage price index in 2022 the panel s average forecast is for wages growth of just 2 7 in the face of underlying inflation of 2 9 pushing down real wages buying power 0 2 the panel expects wages growth to remain no higher than prices growth in the year that follows despite historically low unemployment and labour shortages in 2023 it expects wages growth to do no better than underlying inflation at 2 8 gdp growth sinking economic growth is expected to sink the panel expects the december 2021 bounce out of state lockdowns to be reported on march 2 to be followed by a march quarter impacted by something akin to voluntary lockdowns as australians restrict movements in response to omicron read more why you might feel anxious after lockdown and how to cope even as immigration and freedom of movement return the panel expects economic growth to sink back towards 2 5 which is roughly where it was before covid and well below the 3 4 common in the 1990s and early 2000s panellists pointed to increasing social and political discord and weaker demand from china along with the absence of any policies designed to lift productivity growth above dismal pre covid rates as drags on growth and identified government spending as one of the few supports the panel expects china s economic growth to sink below us economic growth for the first time since the 1970s mei dong of the university of melbourne said chinese growth would suffer from a shrinking working age population growth declining employment

real net national disposable income per capita is expected to climb more strongly than real wages in 2022 reflecting growth in other sources of income including company profits consumer spending is expected to grow by a healthy 3 7 in real terms although by nowhere near as much as it would if the boost in saving during the covid pandemic was fully unwound household saving soared to an unprecedented 23 6 of income in mid 2020 amid concern about covid plunged down to a still elevated 11 8 in mid 2021 after restrictions eased and then soared again to 19 8 as delta took hold the ratio is expected to remain at an elevated 12 throughout 2022 well above the few per cent common in the decades leading up to covid as households hang onto rather than spend income uncertain about the future in december treasurer josh frydenberg spoke about the unusually high saving rate as a source of future spending saying it was a lot of damn money that s been accumulated the panel s forecasts suggest that accumulation will continue the panel expects non mining business investment to grow strongly throughout 2022 although in response to budget measures rather than what economist stephen anthony describes as structural drivers moving in the other direction panellist mark crosby says investment should slow towards the end of 2022 as the prospect of higher interest rates dents the construction industry unemployment with a 4 but not a 3 few of the panellists expect australia s unemployment rate to fall much below its present 4 2 in the two years ahead despite what former anz economist warren hogan describes as the strongest labour demand australia has ever seen he says the problem is the skills employers are looking for don t match those of job seekers and the workers likely to become available in the years ahead janine dixon says businesses are putting more people on their payrolls to cover sick leave and isolation leave making it likely there has been an increase in underemployment in releasing the december budget update treasurer frydenberg forecast the addition of around one million jobs between october 2021 and mid 2025 it s a projection broadly endorsed by the panel although mainly because they believe that s what population growth is likely to deliver mark crosby described it as a pretty ordinary outcome given the rate of jobs growth seen prior to the pandemic much would depend on migration the more migrants the more extra jobs weaker home price growth after a year in which national housing prices soared 22 the panel is expecting more sedate growth of 6 5 in sydney and 6 1 in melbourne katrina ell of moody s analytics believes the market has already peaked she says mortgage rates will creep higher this year regardless of whether the reserve bank lifts official rates and measures put in place by the prudential regulation authority are starting to cramp investor interest warren hogan disagrees seeing investors driving the next phase of the housing market he says cashed up upper middle to high income households will try to protect their wealth against rising inflation by buying real estate subdued markets in aggregate the panel expects the exchange rate to stay broadly where it is at 71 to 72 us cents in 2022 and expects the asx200 share price index to end the year about where it began after climbing 13 in 2021 and sinking 9 in january they expect the iron ore price to fall from us 137 per tonne to us 98 the panel this conversation survey is the first not to include the views of griffith university professor and former imf and treasury official tony makin who passed away suddenly in november aged 66 his contributions were greatly valued
patience can pay off handsomely when you own stakes in game changing companies the stock market is a wealth building machine but it requires investors to exercise patience and focus on great companies over the long run for instance the broader market has undergone three sizable bear market declines since the beginning of 1995 this includes the dot com bubble bursting which ravaged high growth stocks and the great recession which more than halved the valuations of many great companies despite these declines the innovation driven nasdaq 100 is higher by almost 3 500 in 27 years patience can pay off handsomely if you re invested in innovative companies if your desire is to become a millionaire consider investing 200 000 into the following trio of innovative stocks and waiting 10 years axon enterprise the first high growth innovative company that has the potential to make patient investors millionaires over the next decade is axon enterprise axon 2 41 although it s not a household name axon is well known in the law enforcement community it s the company behind the popular less than lethal taser devices as well as the body cameras worn by police officers axon supplies evidence database software to police departments too for as long as i can recall axon s sole focus has been on law enforcement and enterprise opportunities but last year the company laid out a broader market strategy that nearly doubled its total addressable market from 27 billion to 52 billion this extra 25 billion is expected to derive from axon expanding into the consumer market where it has virtually no penetration at the moment being able to grow organically within the law enforcement community while also offering its less than lethal devices to public should provide the company with a sustainable double digit growth opportunity throughout the decade furthermore axon enterprise can make waves by looking beyond the borders of the united states although the company has plenty of room for market share expansion domestically it holds respective 21 and 12 shares of the taser and body camera market in the u s its market share is virtually nonexistent in latin america asia the middle east and africa its cloud software solutions market share is also in the low single digits worldwide these are long runway opportunities for a highly innovative company everquote innovation comes in all sizes and industries despite its diminutive market cap of 440 million everquote ever 3 96 has the tools to quintuple a 200 000 investment by 2032 and make people millionaires everquote operates an online insurance marketplace according to the company the u s insurance market which includes distribution and ad spend is worth 154 billion just 6 5 billion of this 154 billion is digital ad spending but while the total market value of the u s insurance industry is projected to grow by 4 annually through 2024 digital ad spend is expected to grow by 16 annually in other words ad dollars and consumer buying preference are shifting online which puts everquote at the center of the fastest growing niche of a highly profitable industry what everquote s proprietary platform provides is a benefit for both the consumer and insurers having 19 of the top 20 auto insurers on its platform allows consumers to quickly price compare policies meanwhile the company notes that approximately one out of five consumers requesting an insurance quote will ultimately purchase a policy on its platform this means insurers can more effectively utilize their advertising budget to target motivated shoppers although auto insurance remains everquote s bread and butter the company has been pushing into new verticals for years such as commercial home renters life and health insurance these verticals have been growing at a much faster rate than its established auto insurance marketplace and they provide an add on opportunity that could rapidly lift the company s margins airbnb a final innovation driven stock that can turn a 200 000 investment into 1 million over the next 10 years is stay and hosting platform airbnb abnb 2 37 like virtually all companies focused on travel airbnb s operating results took it on the chin during the initial stages of the coronavirus pandemic however with covid 19 vaccination rates ticking up domestically and around the world the travel industry has rebounded in a big way what investors need to realize about airbnb is this company isn t a fad in the three years leading up to the pandemic airbnb s total bookings more than quintupled from 52 million to 272 million mind you this growth occurred with less than the 4 million hosts currently on the platform with around 1 billion households worldwide we re witnessing the tip of the iceberg in terms of hosting marketplace potential what s more the pandemic has given rise to mobile workforces as long as workers have internet access they aren t necessarily tethered to any one location not surprisingly airbnb s fastest growing segment has been long term stays defined as 28 or more days beyond hosting airbnb also wants a bigger piece of the global 8 trillion travel industry it aims to secure its shares of this giant market through its experiences segment experiences works with local experts to lead travelers on adventures the expectation is that we could see airbnb expand these relationships to also include transportation and dining activities in the future which would allow it to gobble up more travel dollars

clint powell s home in social circle ga sits on a 2 acre lot about 300 yards from the property where electric vehicle maker rivian plans to begin building a giant factory soon he s pretty sure it will change his life but residents like him are still trying to find out how much some are exploring if they can stop or limit the project including throwing up possible zoning roadblocks i think the size of this rivian plant really scares a lot of people said powell an electrical contractor who has been living in the area for 17 years for months last year as local and state authorities negotiated in secret with rivian residents were kept in the dark in this largely rural area about 45 miles east of atlanta a few days before christmas rivian confirmed it will build a 5 billion factory on a roughly 2 000 acre site here and employ about 7 500 people gov brian kemp called it the largest economic development project in state history area residents say they are still struggling to get information even as rivian plans to break ground in the coming months rivian says it will meet with neighbors but hasn t shared a date local authorities canceled a community meeting this past week after residents left an earlier meeting frustrated among the unanswered questions how much new traffic can residents expect how close will the factory get to property lines how bright will the lighting be how will the water supply be protected local opposition to the plant appears loosely organized but residents also haven t had much time to organize some yard signs have begun popping up in social circle population 4 974 in walton county in the smaller neighboring morgan county community of rutledge on the other side of the planned plant a rutledge opposed to rivian assembly plant facebook group has about 770 members almost as large as the town s population about 55 of the proposed factory site is zoned for agricultural and residential use and the local joint development authority has submitted applications to rezone that acreage for industrial use morgan and walton county commissioners will hold separate votes march 1 social circle s city council will vote march 15 thwarting the factory may be a long shot but it could work said john gardner a social circle resident if you have enough people that show enough passion and make their voices heard that they do not want it here and if the government realizes the impact that this will have on people s lives it can be turned down said gardner who called the secrecy around the project unsettling the local joint development authority declined to make its executives available to the atlanta journal constitution for interviews for this article the state department of economic development also declined comment in an emailed statement california based rivian said it is dedicated to becoming a valued member of the communities surrounding our georgia facility including listening first to our future neighbors and dedication to sustainability and conservation cox enterprises owner of the ajc owns a 4 7 stake in rivian and supplies services to rivian sandy schwartz a cox executive who oversees the ajc is on rivian s board of

circle general mills operates a warehouse less than a tenth the size of the proposed rivian plant on the south side of i 20 a large takeda pharmaceutical plant and a facebook data center have been built in recent years but residents say fewer people lived near those sites ken edwards said it s good for georgia that rivian will create jobs but that he moved to social circle from dacula for the small town atmosphere and i would hate to lose that according to a site plan posted online recently by economic development officials the plant will include 12 buildings with about 19 8 million square feet of interior space the site also will have parking lots for cars and logistics trailers waste and recycling facilities storm water management ponds and several new roads the state department of transportation likely will build a new interchange where old mill road crosses i 20 lighting for employee parking areas will follow dark sky principles to reduce light pollution the property also will include minimum 100 foot buffers near residential areas according to the site plan at a community forum in the social circle middle school gymnasium attended by about 150 people on jan 10 residents voiced concerns about traffic noise and water quality many weren t happy with the responses from shane short executive director of the joint development authority of jasper morgan newton and walton

conflicts of interest involving alan verner the authority s former chairman who is selling land for the rivian project short said verner left the room when votes were taken the crowd responded with sarcastic laughter short and verner did not respond to requests for comment the authority canceled a community forum in rutledge planned for jan 20 plant plans appear to be moving quickly short told

the e commerce services leader has had a rough start to the year shopify shop 2 04 one of the hottest growth stocks in recent years has already declined more than 30 this year the e commerce giant s growth accelerated throughout the pandemic as more merchants opened online stores but it faced tougher year over year comparisons as brick and mortar stores reopened meanwhile rising inflation and higher interest rates caused investors to dump frothier growth stocks like shopify which traded at 37 times its estimated 2021 sales when its stock hit a record high of 1 762 92 last november but now that shopify s stock has pulled back nearly 50 from its all time high should investors consider starting a new position let s compare the bear and bull cases for this volatile stock to find out what the bears will tell you about shopify the bears don t like shopify for three main reasons its decelerating growth the competitive headwinds and its valuation like many other e commerce companies shopify faces slower growth in a post lockdown market its revenue surged 86 during the height of the pandemic in 2020 and still grew 66 year over year in the first nine months of 2021 as more businesses reopened analysts expect its revenue to rise 56 to 4 6 billion for the full year then increase another 33 to 6 1 billion in 2022 those forecasts still look impressive but shopify also faces plenty of formidable competitors in the e commerce services space including bigcommerce bigc 3 70 adobe s adbe 0 84 magento for self hosted users and block s sq 4 53 square online woocommerce an open source plugin that turns any wordpress site into an online store is also a popular option for more technically advanced users there was plenty of room for all of these platforms to expand throughout the pandemic but the post lockdown deceleration could force them to compete more aggressively against each other meanwhile shopify s costs will continue to climb as it expands its own logistics network payments platform and digital ecosystem analysts expect its adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda to rise 65 to 800 million in 2021 but to grow a mere 4 to 833 million in 2022 as it ramps up its spending again that forecast implies its adjusted ebitda margin will decline from 17 5 in 2021 to 13 7 in 2022 as for its valuation shopify still trades at about 290 times forward earnings and nearly 20 times next year s sales by comparison bigcommerce which isn t profitable yet trades at just eight times next year s sales those lofty valuations indicate the stock could still have a lot more downside potential if interest rates and other macroeconomic headwinds continue to batter the tech sector what the bulls will tell you about shopify the bulls will claim that shopify deserves its premium valuations for three reasons its platform is disruptive it s constantly gaining new partners and it still has room to expand across non english speaking countries amazon amzn 1 35 and other massive online marketplaces make it easy for smaller merchants to open third party stores but in exchange for that simplicity they need to pay subscription fees abide by strict guidelines and compete against legions of other third party sellers they ll also likely need to purchase more marketplace ads and sponsored listings to truly stand out shopify frees merchants from those marketplaces by enabling them to launch their online stores process payments fulfill orders and manage their marketing campaigns this approach which lets businesses build their own online presence locked in 1 75 million businesses at the end of 2020 compared to just 162 261 businesses at the time of its ipo in 2015 as shopify expands it s tethering its e commerce and payment services to more social media platforms including meta s facebook and instagram pinterest and snap s snapchat to expand into the nascent social commerce market those partnerships could help shopify gain millions of new merchants who sell their products through social media posts they could also widen shopify s moat against dominant payment platforms like paypal shopify enjoys an early mover advantage against its competitors but it still generates most of its revenue in english speaking countries therefore it could still expand into booming e commerce markets like latin america and southeast asia which have been dominated by major third party marketplaces like mercadolibre and sea s shopee in its latest conference call last october cfo amy shapero called shopify s international expansion the company s third key area of investment alongside its shop app and fulfillment network that overseas effort has mainly focused on english speaking markets like the u k and australia so far but i believe it could eventually expand into non english speaking markets as well shopify believes those strengths will enable it to build a 100 year company that s a bold claim but shopify could continue to grow as long as smaller merchants want to build their own online presence don t buy a great company at the wrong price shopify is a great company with a bright future there s still plenty of room for shopify and its peers many of which serve larger or more technically advanced merchants to continue growing as amazon and other massive online marketplaces spark revolts among smaller

in secret meetings two years ago this month members of congress were briefed on what the rest of america would soon learn a deadly virus was spreading rapidly overseas and headed for the united states some lawmakers acted immediately not in the public s interest but in their own they sold stocks weeks before markets crashed when the scale of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus became broadly known a global pandemic was unfolding and these lawmakers were fretting as much about the health of their financial portfolios as about the health of their constituents congress thought it had already fixed what looked alarmingly like insider trading by its members in 2012 lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to enact a bill known as the stock act banning themselves from using information they learned on the job for personal financial benefit the law required sitting members along with their staff and public officials in other branches of the government to make more specific and timely disclosures about their financial transactions although the law helped the public spot conflicts of interest it was unable to prevent them members hear all kinds of news that essentially may amount to insider trading but it s almost impossible to enforce insider trading and to prove what happened when senator jeff merkley of oregon a democrat who has been pushing for years to restrict stock trading by members of congress told me the justice department investigated several senators for their 2020 stock dumps but filed no charges the allegations of pandemic profiteering did however have major political repercussions and helped democrats win their narrow senate majority last year among those who found their transactions under federal scrutiny were both republican senators from georgia david perdue and kelly loeffler they both denied any wrongdoing who lost in special elections last january the democrat who defeated perdue senator jon ossoff is now leading a new push to ban members from trading individual stocks altogether there s widespread bipartisan disgust with america s political class and stock trading by members of congress is egregious and offensive ossoff told me last week legislation that he s introduced along with senator mark kelly of arizona would require members of congress their spouses and dependent children to either sell their individual stocks or place them in a blind trust a bipartisan companion bill was previously unveiled in the house the proposal is not surprisingly popular with a public that loves to look down on its lawmakers nearly two thirds of all respondents including majorities of both democrats and republicans backed the idea of banning members of congress from trading stocks according to a recent poll conducted by morning consult yet the bill is likely to be least popular among the people who actually have to vote on it if congress has struggled in recent years to tackle the nation s most complex challenges its track record of policing itself is arguably even worse republicans made little effort to pass ethics legislation when they last ran washington and although house democrats did advance a major anti corruption bill as part of its initial voting rights push last year they quickly jettisoned its major ethics provisions in a thus far unsuccessful bid to win passage in the senate the proposed ban on stock trading by lawmakers has upended the expected ideological divide a co sponsor of the house measure is conservative representative chip roy of texas a former top aide to senator ted cruz the bill has also won the backing of two groups that usually defend unfettered access to the free market the koch funded americans for prosperity and freedomworks which emerged from the obama era tea party carrying the libertarian flag instead is house speaker nancy pelosi whose husband paul pelosi has made millions in stock trades that have become fodder for amateur trackers on social media platforms such as reddit and tiktok we re a free market economy should be able to participate in that pelosi told reporters earlier this month sounding more like ayn rand than a san francisco socialist read an exodus from congress tests the lure of lobbying the last significant ethics legislation to clear congress was the stock act a decade ago even that bill however passed only after party leaders watered down a tougher initial proposal and within a year of its enactment congress quietly acted to roll back one of its key transparency provisions the need to regulate stock trading by lawmakers is obvious to the bill s supporters who on this particular issue know well of what they speak members of congress are privy to market moving information before the general public on a near daily basis that is especially true in times of crisis such as a major military buildup or the onset of a global pandemic when the stock market is more volatile and lawmakers frequently receive classified briefings from senior government officials they might not be able to discuss what they heard in public but until the passage of the stock act it wasn t clearly illegal for them to make money off it house and senate votes are themselves occasionally market moving events and lawmakers are usually the first to know whether a measure will pass or fail one of the authors of the stock act former democratic representative brian baird of washington state told me that in moments of dark humor during major floor votes a colleague would joke to him and he emphasized that he was indeed joking we could make some money off this vote right in 2012 the authors of the stock act believed an outright ban on stock trades was a bridge too far baird told me but the pandemic trading scandals propelled calls for new legislation and more recent disclosures including a lengthy investigation by business insider have given the push added momentum so too has pelosi s brush off which prompted the bill s backers to redouble their efforts i fervently disagree with her representative abigail spanberger of virginia told me spanberger a democrat first introduced legislation with roy more than a year and a half ago there s many professions where there are limitations placed on what someone can do financially this requirement is an absolutely reasonable one for those of us who choose to enter this profession the proposals would allow members and their families to keep control of investments in diversified mutual or index funds u s treasuries and bonds kelly told me that in addition to preventing insider trading by lawmakers requiring members to step back from active control of individual stocks would ensure that they aren t taking votes on legislation based on how it would impact them financially adding to the pressure on pelosi house minority leader kevin mccarthy has suggested that republicans might implement a ban if they win back the majority this fall pelosi last week softened her stance telling reporters that although she remained personally opposed to the proposal if members want to do that i m okay with that the developments over the past month have created a dynamic reminiscent of other successful drives for new congressional ethics laws craig holman a lobbyist for public citizen and a longtime government reform advocate told me the prospects are very good he said sometimes we have to embarrass congress into doing the right thing and it works once the public gets involved yet the supporters of a ban on lawmaker stock trading still have a ways to go public support for a bill can mask broader private opposition and the leaders of this most recent effort are mostly members with relatively little experience in congress the stock act ultimately passed with near unanimous votes but baird told me that during the years when he was first pitching the bill to colleagues many took offense at the mere suggestion of impropriety others wanted their investments to remain private and some just didn t want the added inconvenience of having to disclose them i thought naively that this would be such an obvious right thing to do that when i raised it with people they d respond gosh i didn t know that we should fix it baird chuckled ruefully well the response was anything but after the stock act s passage baird said he found himself in an elevator with an aide to a high ranking democrat who didn t realize he was speaking with an author of the bill i gotta go home and fill out my effing paperwork for the goddamn stock act the staffer complained kelly told me he didn t have much sympathy for members who opposed ethics legislation because of the hassle of complying with it if you don t want the hassle find something else to do he said there are plenty of folks who could do this job his retort epitomized the challenges that kelly and his allies face they are asking their colleagues to vote for a bill that won t require sacrifice by their constituents only by themselves frankly i don t mind whose feelings i hurt when i make that case ossoff said my colleagues need to hear it and i think they are hearing it
shares are down by more than 40 in the last year but latin america s e commerce leader looks well positioned to rebound as the market continues its broad sell off of growth stocks it is more important than ever for growth investors to keep our long term focus in mind and to continue adding to our positions in recently discounted companies as we go periods like these when investors can pick up shares of great companies at lower valuations ultimately may be the ones that drive our portfolio s outperformance in the long run one company that i am looking forward to increasing my stake in is mercadolibre meli 1 96 here are three simple reasons i believe it could quintuple in value by 2030 mercadolibre s growing importance in latin america with more than 900 000 families reporting that mercadolibre is their primary source of income the e commerce behemoth is quickly becoming ingrained in the latin american economy furthermore 40 of the small and medium sized enterprises smes that sell on the company s platform took out their first ever loans through mercado credito the company s financing unit these merchant loans allow the smes on mercadolibre s platform to expand their operations and then increase their sales on the website creating a tidy flywheel effect additionally as latin america s internet penetration rate continues to rise mercadolibre s e commerce and fintech offerings are poised to become more critical specifically growing shares of latin america s unbanked and underbanked populations are turning to mercado pago and mercado credito for fintech solutions and lines of credit respectively perhaps thanks to opening these consumers up to a sense of financial equality mercadolibre boasts a net promoter score of 49 according to comparably that rating on a scale of negative 100 to 100 also reflects that 66 of its customers surveyed said they would enthusiastically recommend its products and services to others while just 17 are detractors who wouldn t that s a pretty impressive result for any brand maybe best of all for investors is that the company s active customer base of roughly 79 million users still has a massive growth runway ahead of it considering that latin america s population exceeds 600 million plentiful growth optionality of mercadolibre s nearly 1 9 billion in sales in 2021 s third quarter roughly two thirds came from its commerce segment while the rest came from its fintech unit through these two growth avenues the company offers an intriguing blend of product and geographic optionality starting with its commerce segment mercadolibre currently operates in 18 countries but it s still in the early stages of building out its logistics network mercado envios while that unit is far from reaching peak operational efficiency mercado envios has already achieved an 86 penetration rate across its managed network up from 64 just one year ago furthermore mercadolibre partnered with grocery store chain mambo in brazil to test out fresh grocery delivery providing another attractive long term growth option for the company as for its fintech segment the company has several irons in the fire with its mercado credito and mercado pago business units mercado credito offers cash advances to sellers on its e commerce platform while also offering loans to buyers as of the end of q3 the company had built a portfolio of 1 1 billion in loans however investors will want to keep an eye on the share of past due accounts within this portfolio as that metric grew from 10 to 28 over the last year finally mercado pago offers payment processing digital wallets mobile payments prepaid cards and many other fintech applications mercado pago s total payment volume grew by 59 to nearly 21 billion in the third quarter showing that mercadolibre is much more than just an e commerce website an improving risk reward profile after a share price drop of 40 over the last year despite annual sales growth of 89 the company s reward portion of its risk reward proposition for investors has dramatically improved however after seeing its cash from operations nearly cut in half since the start of 2021 mercadolibre is far from a low risk investment this decline in cash from operations stemmed from higher operating costs related to its logistical network and the continued expansion of its first party e commerce business altogether these two expenses accounted for roughly a five percentage point hit to mercadolibre s 43 gross profit margin making matters worse as the economic turmoil from the pandemic s impact continues to weigh on latin america the company lost four additional percentage points of profit margin related to bad debt from its credit portfolio s expansion as previously mentioned more than one quarter of the company s credit portfolio is past due creating a significant headwind for its long term profitability ultimately mercadolibre is sacrificing short term profitability in favor of generating long term cash flows all while battling with its young credit portfolio it is important to remember that as recently as 2020 the company generated nearly 1 billion in free cash flow fcf while still entirely in high growth mode all in all short term headwinds have created a recently discounted valuation for mercadolibre which now trades with a market capitalization or company price tag of 49 billion however i look for the company to gradually return closer to the 1 billion mark for annualized fcf and eventually beyond as its credit portfolio matures and continues slowly improving should it reach this fcf target it would be trading around 50 times fcf making its annual sales growth of 89 year over year look incredibly cheap and 5 000 like

contributed photo despite 20 years of laws and initiatives to spur more affordable housing most towns in the bridgeport region still lack enough low cost units to meet the state s expectations a review of state housing data by hearst connecticut media shows that only bridgeport ansonia and derby comply with a state dictate that 10 percent of a town or city s housing stock be affordable the other nine communities ranging from seymour to westport to milford are well under the threshold and have been since at least 2002 state data shows advertisement article continues below this ad town officials says they generally support more affordable housing but under certain circumstances they noted that many communities lack the infrastructure namely sewer connections to accommodate denser housing complexes and pointed out that hundreds of lower cost units have been built in the suburbs over the last 18 years the 10 percent threshold was established in 1989 through state statute 8 30g often called the appeals law in an effort to encourage affordable housing the law enables developers to bypass local zoning regulations when less than 10 percent of a community s housing stock is affordable advertisement article continues below this ad if an affordable housing proposal is rejected by a town not in compliance and developers invoke the law during an appeal to state superior court the town must prove that the venture is detrimental to the health and welfare of the community that s a high bar for many communities to meet because it eliminates traditional zoning rational used to reject a proposal and each year the state legislature considers new zoning and housing related bills to spur construction of more affordable housing most of those efforts fail due to stiff suburban opposition desegregate connecticut a coalition of advocacy groups that prompts affordable housing said the burden is on the town to use the existing law to its benefit for 32 years towns have had the chance to take advantage of the opportunity 8 30g offers but too many towns have failed to use proven zoning strategies to enable and guide affordable housing development desegregate connecticut said in a statement advertisement article continues below this ad instead they have maintained their one size fits all restrictive zoning and forced people who want to build affordable housing to spend years mired in expensive lawsuits the group added milford mayor ben blake said there is a downside to the state law from my perspective there are harsh elements for communities said blake whose city has consistently fallen under the 10 percent affordable housing threshold in 2020 5 2 percent of housing units in the city were affordable state data shows it could use some revisions blake said the intention is to provide housing where it s not affordable but we have seen the consequences developers have used it to circumvent well crafted zoning regulations and take away local control there may be a better way to achieve that end advertisement article continues below this ad not even close the united way points out that a family of four in connecticut needs an income of at least 64 689 annually to cover housing and other expenses with housing accounting for 1 143 a month although alice connecticut families benefit from the unprecedented creation of 7 500 affordable homes since 2011 spurred on by the state government there is still a significant need for affordable housing choices the united way notes on its website referring to the acronym for asset limited income constrained employed the nine bridgeport area communities that have not met the state s 10 percent affordable housing threshold fell short by large margins advertisement article continues below this ad monroe s housing stock was less than 1 percent affordable between 2002 and 2016 when it climbed to 1 percent by contrast bridgeport s housing stock was 20 51 percent affordable in 2002 and 20 66 percent affordable in 2020 a consistent pattern easton s affordable housing stock over the last 18 years never exceeded 1 percent milford was consistently in 5 or 6 percent range and westport in the 2 to 3 percent range only derby showed significant affordable housing growth under 8 30g from 2002 to 2004 derby s housing stock was in the 8 percent affordable range it reached 10 45 percent in 2005 and 11 74 percent in 2020 advertisement article continues below this ad but the percentages don t tell the whole story and hundreds of new affordable housing units have been built in the suburbs over the last 18 years in westport for example affordable units grew from 252 in 2002 to 387 in 2020 state data shows still that growth only brought the town s percentage of affordable housing to 3 72 percent in 2020 well below the state threshold trumbull saw growth as well from 328 affordable units to 2002 to 734 in 2020 and monroe doubled its stock since 2002 from 51 units to 100 in 2020 but those increases were not enough to meet the state threshold trumbull s percentage of affordable housing was 5 58 percent in 2020 and monroe stood at 1 45 percent advertisement article continues below this ad overall only 31 of the state s 169 municipalities in 2020 were exempt from 8 30g because 10 percent or more of their housing was affordable michael santoro a community development specialist for the state department of housing said the appeals law has worked all of these units are being produced without state incentives and would not have been built without 8 30g santoro said housing is expensive in connecticut and the state invests a lot in affordable housing every bit we get without state investment is a benefit santoro said since the appeals law was enacted private developers have built 5 241 units deed restricted as affordable most the result of 8 30g at 100 000 a unit santoro noted that s a 524 million private investment advertisement article continues below this ad it s a very localized impact santoro said of the affordable housing law one project in bridgeport of 20 units is a drop in the bucket he noted but one project in norfolk has a huge impact it s not just how much the percentages have changed it s a unit and a household one could argue that one unit is a success house majority leader jason rojas d east hartford gained little traction last year with the so called fair share bill he co sponsored the bill sought to double housing goals under 8 30g and offered a way for nearby towns to challenge zoning decisions in neighboring towns based on failing to contribute their fair share of affordable housing rojas said the bill would have replaced the appeals law advertisement article continues below this ad it would help us move away from 8 30g which is an imperfect solution rojas said many say it has not worked there has to be an effort on the part of the communities very few developers want to spend the time and money to go through the local zoning process there are some that avail themselves of that but many that don t rojas said it s difficult to understand the opposition to affordable housing which he noted benefits both low and moderate income residents i was in stamford campaigning for a colleague and there are lots of apartments being built rojas said referring to market rate units no one takes issue with apartments being built it seems we are fine for these types of people and not for those attitude has changed rick schultz monroe s town planner said monroe and similar towns are not opposed to affordable housing and recognize the need advertisement article continues below this ad the attitude has changed for allowing affordable housing units schultz said not everyone can afford a 500 000 colonial but he added the state s goal is unrealistic it is not achievable for most towns schultz said of the 10 percent threshold the town is fairly well developed primarily one acre zoning schultz explained the last development plans recognized the need and support affordable housing in appropriate locations and we have approved an affordable housing project for senior housing advertisement article continues below this ad shultz said the lack of sewer infrastructure in many areas is a major impediment to denser development such as affordable housing others have pointed to the lack of available space for larger housing complexes in communities already dominated by single family homes carol martin director of housing authorities in westport and fairfield and former president of the recently dissolved affordable housing alliance said the appeals law has been beneficial the law has been instrumental in getting thousands of affordable units constructed in many communities across the state martin said although the law is not perfect it s the only state law we have martin added what would really be helpful would be introducing new laws that build upon the success of 8 30g and the housing it has created the need is so great and only having one tool in the toolbox seems so disproportionate advertisement article continues below this ad a 2021 department of housing report funded in part by the state concluded there are 86 068 more very low income households than housing units affordable to those households fairfield county represents about one third of that shortage according to the study more than half of fairfield county residents spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs and many must choose between cutting back on food health care and other necessities low wage earners can only afford housing in four of the 23 municipalities in the fairfield county region the study noted expensive housing of the towns in the bridgeport region and naugatuck valley milford and fairfield were the only towns to have less affordable housing units in 2020 than in 2002 advertisement article continues below this ad mark barnhart fairfield s community and economic development director said affordable housing rents can be high in fairfield where 2 57 percent of units were affordable in 2020 barnhart said a household of four earning 80 percent or less than the region s medium income or 80 480 or less would be eligible for state defined affordable housing but an affordable two bedroom apartment in fairfield costs around 1 700 a month less than market value but still a hefty rate for many barnhart noted advertisement article continues below this ad it doesn t exist naturally barnhart said referring to affordable rents in towns like fairfield a 300 000 sale price would be affordable barnhart said last year we had a couple dozen there is not much available in the starter home range barnhart conceded fairfield needs more affordable housing and pointed out the town now requires developers building 10 or more units to designate 10 percent as affordable we want to do it in a way that makes sense for fairfield he explained some projects under 8 30g are better than others but they do create controversy i wish we had a more collaborative process advertisement article continues below this ad asked why it s so difficult to create affordable housing milford s mayor said connecticut is dominated by old towns with long established housing milford is one of the oldest towns in the state back to 1639 blake said our housing stock was well established before the 8 30g statute took effect we want proper development especially in transit oriented areas he added there have been apartments built downtown in the last 15 years and they are in high demand bcummings

you ll want to consider buying the dip on these quality stocks many top growth stocks have been falling significantly over the past several months and for investors who are willing to hang on for the long haul there can be some incredibly attractive buying opportunities out there three stocks that have fallen more than 20 in the past six months but have strong businesses are cresco labs crlbf shopify shop 2 04 and walt disney dis 0 93 although these declines might look concerning buying these stocks now could pay off in the years ahead 1 cresco labs legalization might not be coming to the u s marijuana industry anytime soon as president joe biden has not shown much interest in the issue but that doesn t mean the sector isn t ripe for growth cannabis research firm bdsa projects that the global marijuana market will grow at a compound annual rate of 22 and be worth more than 47 billion by 2025 one company that can be a key part of that growth is multi state operator cresco labs the chicago based pot producer has been growing while consistently generating strong margins in its most recent quarter for the period ending sept 30 2021 adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda totaled 56 4 million and was more than 26 of revenue which came in at 215 5 million just a year ago the company s top line was 153 3 million and for the fourth quarter cresco expects to continue to see that revenue number climb sequentially to between 235 million and 245 million through acquisitions in multiple markets including pennsylvania massachusetts and ohio cresco is steadily growing its presence and capitalizing on more opportunities trading at a price to sales multiple of just over 2 it s also incredibly cheap compared to cannabis giant curaleaf holdings which investors are paying more than 4 times revenue for cresco is an exciting growth stock that could be a steal of a deal at its current share price 2 shopify the pandemic has given shoppers extra motivation to buy goods online whether it s out of safety concerns or because vendors simply offer more convenient pickup and delivery options and nearly two years into the covid 19 crisis there continues to be strong growth in the sector during the black friday and cyber monday weekend of 2021 there was 6 3 billion spent on shopify s e commerce platform representing a year over year increase of 23 and more than doubling 2019 s tally impressive growth isn t new for shopify as the business has grown from revenue of 389 million in 2016 to more than 2 9 billion in 2020 in the trailing 12 months its sales have risen to more than 4 2 billion and there s still no reason to expect the growth to stop in january the company announced a partnership with jd com a chinese e commerce site which will make it easier for chinese companies to sell to western markets through shopify s platform shopify is trading at levels not seen since mid 2020 today its business is much safer than in years past recording both consistent profits and positive free cash flow if you re waiting for the stock to drop much lower you might miss a golden opportunity to secure this top growth stock at a great price 3 walt disney investors have been lukewarm about walt disney after the company s fourth quarter earnings report in november 2021 failed to impress not only did earnings per share miss the mark 0 37 on an adjusted basis versus estimates of 0 51 but the company also warned that subscriber growth for disney could be a challenge for the period ending oct 2 2021 the company added just 2 1 million subscribers from the previous quarter while analysts were expecting 9 4 million but disney isn t the only streaming company struggling with growing its subscriber numbers rival netflix also disappointed shareholders in its latest earnings report with so many streaming services out there in addition to disney and netflix like hbo max and peacock the competition for subscribers is fierce especially with inflation making it harder for consumers to juggle them all however disney is known for its quality content and isn t a company i d bet against in this arena and it still isn t operating at where it will be once covid isn t hampering its theme parks for the past fiscal year revenue from its parks experiences and products segment totaled 16 6 billion two years ago that number was up over 26 billion disney will be a big winner from a return to normal in the economy and even if its streaming numbers may not experience significant growth there are still plenty of opportunities in other areas of its business trading near its 52 week low and at a forward price to earnings ratio of 33 similar to netflix which isn t nearly as diverse of a business disney s stock is definitely one of the best bargains out there right now for growth investors
commentary the world has been ending for decades in 1989 a senior official from the united nations environment program warned that entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000 for good measure a study from the program added that shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s dust bowl conditions to canadian and u s wheatlands so much for that in 2006 in his movie an inconvenient truth al gore stated unequivocally that we only had 10 more years before we reached the point of no return it would seem that we ve been barreling down a path of climate driven self destruction forever one solution that s been put forward has been the idea of carbon offsets or carbon taxes according to the world bank 40 countries and 20 cities around the world use some form of carbon taxes or carbon emissions trading to curb greenhouse gas production here in the united states it s an idea that s been debated and discussed to death but never actually implemented here s why the inconvenient reality of the energy industry at the climate action summit of 2019 the global climate change party the u n has been hosting since 1995 otherwise known as cop25 77 countries and over 100 cities committed to achieving a net zero emissions policy by 2050 billions of dollars were pledged by global governments to various green initiatives it was a huge success for the record net zero emissions doesn t mean absolute zero it means that if you own a business that emits co2 you would need to offset that production by removing an equal amount of greenhouse gases and storing it permanently in soil plants or materials fast forward to cop26 last year where in the ultimate irony attendees rented teslas were charged by diesel generators the results were a little different cnbc reported that the u n climate summit ended with calls on governments to return next year with tougher pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions and climate scientists legal experts and politicians argued the final deal out of glasgow resulted in incremental progress inadequate to address the climate crisis apparently enthusiasm waned now i don t want to be totally dismissive of these efforts certainly a cleaner planet is a noble goal and i want to believe this massive global effort is being made in good faith but it s not hard to understand why countries around the world would be looking to hedge their climate bets energy isn t an elastic commodity you can start buying chicken if arbitrary beef taxes make steak too expensive but you can t just build a wind farm to replace the coal plant that got too expensive to run social engineering the energy market energy runs the world it heats and cools our homes it fuels our cars it basically powers our lives and here s another inconvenient truth fossil fuels are the very heart of the world s energy consumption trying to force a change through economic disincentives i e taxes is a recipe for disaster first off the concept in and of itself is flawed it s a self eliminating tax its taxes are designed to force businesses into more sustainable forms of energy but as businesses move in that direction tax revenues decrease and that s never acceptable to governments then there s the effect on the end user taxes that are designed to modify behavior are typically pretty punitive the u n has recommended a tax of 135 to 5 500 per metric ton that s because their goal is to drive the taxpayer to a less desirable option such as having to spend 10 million to retrofit a factory for solar or wind these costs end up getting passed on to the end user making these taxes regressive long after they re gone assuming they re even that successful the concept of carbon taxes is a form of social engineering it s designed to elicit a response that wouldn t happen otherwise such a levy raises the cost of doing business which makes it a regressive tax and doesn t optimize innovation which only comes via wait for it profit yeah money makes the world go around and free markets where profit can be made will drive innovation these malformed efforts are largely driven by governments and think tanks the problem with that is governments and think tanks are largely funded by free public money it s not like they have to produce a valuable result to get paid such as all businesses do and for all their staff members ph d s they don t understand the actual disincentives that taxes create so while the world struggles to save itself with green energy here s a clue oil is back above 80 per barrel and i believe it s aiming for 100 that means integrated oil producers such as exxon and bp as well as independent explorers such as eog resources should all perform well
stock market investors this month endured their first sizable decline since the early days of the pandemic and most heard a familiar refrain from advisers investment firms the financial media and others hang tight don t overreact don t do much of anything that s generally good advice as it can keep investors from making drastic shifts that they might regret later timing the market isn t easy but some actions might be warranted during times of investment turbulence especially if you haven t paid much attention to your portfolio lately here are some of them re assess your tolerance for risk buy and hold investing is a historically wise strategy but it rests on the assumption that you can stomach and wait out the downdrafts many people can t the stock market s bumpy start to 2022 provides a useful litmus test if you re having trouble handling the stress it might be wise to alter your investment mix possibly trimming some of the more volatile holdings especially if they re concentrated in a few areas such as technology stocks or tech funds then again you might want to add more money to hard hit areas rebalancing is the strategy of setting a target investment mix and adjusting back to that framework when holdings rise or fall sharply it basically means taking some profits in stocks or funds that have fared relatively well and reinvesting the proceeds in laggards your capacity to tolerate paper losses might be greater than you realize especially if you have near term spending needs covered debts under control and steady job prospects you might even start regarding social security retirement benefits or employer provided pensions as part of your portfolio these assets essentially act as highly secure annuities that help to stabilize your finances though most people probably don t view them as part of their investment mix look to other investment possibilities sharp market declines often mark turning points when certain types of investments rotate out of favor and others take their place technological innovation is here to stay but too much of the recent speculative action was centered here it thus might be a good opportunity to shift some of your assets to other areas for example value stocks could offer a more stable ride in a possible slowing economic climate and stocks in many foreign countries have lower valuations than their u s counterparts we do still see the u s in a mid cycle expansion with no recession sight said lars schuster an institutional portfolio manager at fidelity investments but many eurozone countries are earlier in the business
