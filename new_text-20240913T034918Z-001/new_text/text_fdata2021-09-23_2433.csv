washington ap federal reserve chair jerome powell said wednesday that the central bank will overhaul its financial ethics policies in response to growing questions about investing and trading decisions by high ranking fed officials that raise potential conflicts of interest it is now clearly seen as not adequate in sustaining the public s trust powell said at a news conference after the fed s interest rate setting committee ended a two day policy meeting we need to make changes and we re going to do that as a consequence of this powell stopped short of saying explicitly that the trading moves made by the fed officials were inappropriate and he offered few details about what the fed might do or how it would conduct its ethics review the issue arose after it was revealed that robert kaplan president of the federal reserve bank of dallas traded millions of dollars worth of individual stocks such as amazon chevron facebook and johnson johnson in 2020 at the same time that the fed was taking extraordinary measures to boost the economy the fed s moves likely lifted stock prices and other financial assets similar financial disclosures showed that eric rosengren president of the boston fed invested last year in real estate investment trusts that held mortgage backed bonds of the type the fed itself is buying as part of its broad efforts to lower borrowing rates and powell himself owns municipal bonds which the fed bought last year for the first time ever to prevent a collapse in the muni bond market a move that could have driven up the value of such bonds the presidents of the 12 regional banks participate in the fed s private policymaking meetings in which they discuss the central bank s interest rate policies and are privy to economic data not always available to the public the fed s decisions can cause sharp swings in financial markets so can the presidents speeches and comments to the media dennis kelleher president of better markets a watchdog group suggested that powell s comments wednesday fell far short of what is needed to reassure the public he also criticized powell s remark that the fed follows ethics rules similar to those of other government agencies that for example bar trades made with inside information the fed is not like other agencies kelleher asserted it has the most sensitive market moving information of any federal agency kelleher suggested that the central bank should direct an outside agency to investigate all the trading practices of fed presidents and should require additional information from its officials the fed s disclosure forms for example don t specify when fed regional presidents kaplan and rosengren made their trades the fed cannot investigate itself just like wells fargo cannot investigate itself kelleher said referring to that bank s regulatory troubles in recent years only an external independent investigation will have any credibility a fed spokesman said last week that the central bank is taking a fresh and comprehensive look at its trading policies the investments in question were permitted under the fed s current rules and rosengren and kaplan said that lawyers at their fed banks had approved their trades they have also both pledged to sell their holdings and to reinvest the proceeds into index funds and cash at his news conference wednesday powell said fed officials are subject to the central bank s own trading restrictions on top of those that all federal agencies follow officials for example may not trade in the 10 days before a policymaking meeting when it makes critical decisions about interest rates and other issues they re also barred from owning bank stocks because the fed regulates the banking sector one likely change powell said would be for the fed to bar officials from owning any security that the central bank is itself buying that s because the fed s purchases can often and are intended to shore up the prices of such securities such a stricture has been harder for the fed to follow as it has significantly expanded its purchases since last year to stabilize financial markets in the face of the pandemic recession it bought corporate bonds for the first time as well as municipal bonds to steady markets in those securities powell said that his own ownership of municipal bonds was a a real coincidence because he had owned them for many years without expecting that the fed would one day buy them he said he cleared his ownership with the office of government ethics and hasn t sold any since the fed began buying muni bonds sen elizabeth warren a democrat from massachusetts wrote to the 12 regional fed bank presidents last week urging that they bar all stock holdings by top officials she asked that they report by oct 15 on what steps they plan to take copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
chair jerome powell said the fed could announce a pullback in bond buying as soon as its next meeting in november washington federal reserve chair jerome powell signaled wednesday that the fed plans to announce as early as november that it will start withdrawing the extraordinary support it unleashed after the coronavirus paralyzed the economy 18 months ago powell said that if the job market maintained its steady improvement the fed would likely begin slowing the pace of its monthly bond purchases those purchases have been intended to lower longer term loan rates to encourage borrowing and spending i think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations the fed chair said at a news conference i think we can easily move ahead at the next meeting in november at the same time the fed s policymaking committee indicated wednesday that it expects to start raising its benchmark rate sometime next year earlier than the members had envisioned three months ago and a sign that they re concerned that high inflation pressures may persist powell stressed though that a rate hike would occur only after the fed had ended its bond purchases a process that he said would likely last through the middle of next year taken together the fed s plans reflect its belief that the economy has recovered sufficiently from the pandemic recession for it to soon begin dialing back the emergency aid it provided after the pandemic erupted as the economy has steadily strengthened inflation has also accelerated to a three decade high heightening the pressure on the fed to pull back the central bank s pullback in bond purchases and its eventual rate hikes whenever they happen will mean that some borrowers will have to pay more for mortgages credit cards and business loans stock and bond traders took the fed s message wednesday in stride the dow jones industrial average which had been up more than 400 points before the fed issued a policy statement closed up 338 points or a full 1 the yield on the 10 year treasury note was all but unchanged at roughly 1 31 the economy has recovered faster than many economists had expected though growth has slowed recently as covid 19 cases have spiked and labor and supply shortages have hampered manufacturing construction and some other sectors the u s economy has returned to its pre pandemic size and the unemployment rate has tumbled from 14 8 soon after the pandemic struck to 5 2 at the same time inflation has surged as resurgent consumer spending and disrupted supply chains have combined to create shortages of semiconductors cars furniture and electronics consumer prices according to the fed s preferred measure rose 3 6 in july from a year ago the sharpest such increase since 1991 related articles stocks drop the most since may on worries over federal reserve china in its updated quarterly projections fed officials now expect to raise their key short term rate once in 2022 three times in 2023 one more than they had projected in june and three times in 2024 that benchmark rate which influences many consumer and business loans has been pinned near zero since march 2020 when the pandemic erupted the central bank had signaled last year that it would likely start tapering its 120 billion a month in purchases of treasurys and mortgage bonds once the economy had made substantial further progress toward the fed s goals of maximum employment and 2 average annual inflation if progress continues broadly as expected the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted the fed said in the statement it issued after its two day meeting ended inflation has risen enough to meet the fed s test for substantial progress and powell said at his news conference that in his view employment has all but met that test too the fed hasn t hinted at how fast it will taper the purchases but it is widely expected to pare its purchases of treasurys by 10 billion a month and mortgage backed securities by 5 billion powell has repeatedly expressed his belief that the current high level of inflation will fade as the economy normalizes and in part for that reason has said the central bank isn t yet close to raising rates but the changes in the fed s interest rate projections suggest that it s moving gradually closer to doing so in march the 18 officials who make up its policymaking committee predicted that they wouldn t raise rates at all until after 2023 in june the committee revised its forecast to two rate hikes in 2023 now it foresees a rate hike as soon as next year in its latest forecasts the policymakers also indicate that they expect the economy to grow more slowly this year at 5 9 down from its june projection of 7 it sees inflation at 4 2 by the end of this year but raised its projection for inflation next year to just 2 2 from 2 1 powell is also grappling with a major ethics issue surrounding the investments and trading of some fed regional bank presidents robert kaplan president of the federal reserve bank of dallas revealed in financial disclosures that he traded millions of dollars worth of such individual stocks as amazon chevron facebook and google in 2020 while the fed was taking extraordinary measures to boost the economy eric rosengren president of the boston fed invested last year in real estate investment trusts that held mortgage backed bonds of the type the fed is buying as part of its efforts to lower borrowing rates and powell himself owns municipal bonds which the fed bought last year for the first time to shore up that market a spokesman said last week that the fed is taking a fresh and comprehensive look at its rules surrounding its officials financial holdings the investments were permitted under the fed s current rules and rosengren and kaplan have pledged to sell their holdings and reinvest the proceeds into index funds and cash asked about the topic at his news conference powell said we need to make changes and we are going to do that as a consequence of this this will be a thorough going and comprehensive review we are going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards the fed s expected policy changes follow similar steps by other central banks in the developed world as growth and inflation have picked up in many countries the european central bank said earlier this month that it would reduce its bond purchases though it has yet to say that it will fully end them the central banks of canada and australia have also scaled back bond purchases ___

of developing melanoma is 1 in 63 in the us1 in 2019 an estimated 96 480 patients have been diagnosed with melanoma and about 7 230 patients with melanoma have died in the united states2 advanced melanoma presents an enormous clinical challenge as it is prone to metastasis and lacks survival benefit from chemotherapies immune checkpoint inhibitors icis are currently recommended for the first line treatment of most patients with metastasized melanoma3 although approximately 35 to 60 of the patients have a response evaluation criterion in solid tumors recist response to icis the remaining 40 to 65 have shown minimal or no recist response at the outset and 43 of the responders develop acquired resistance in the three years after receiving icis4 therefore patients who failed on or developed acquired resistance to icis are in urgent need of new treatment options this ftd for alrizomadlin is based on combined preclinical results and preliminary clinical data from an ongoing phase ii study apg 115 us 002 clinicaltrials gov identifier nct03611868 the preliminary clinical data released in an oral report at the 2021 american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting showed that alrizomadlin has favorable antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile the cohort of patients with pd 1 pd l1 inhibitor resistant melanoma treated with alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab achieved one case of complete response cr an objective response rate orr of 24 1 and a disease control rate dcr of 55 2 the ftd expedites the development and review of drug candidates to treat serious diseases conditions that present urgent unmet clinical needs this ftd for alrizomadlin will lead to a series of benefits that could accelerate the clinical development and review for this drug candidate including more frequent communications and meetings with the fda during its clinical development and if the fda determines appropriate to be allowed to enter rolling review a process that allows a company to submit new drug applications ndas by sections rather than waiting until all required materials become available this ftd also paves the way for alrizomadlin to

already been granted to alrizomadlin by the us fda for the treatment of melanoma signifying the enormous therapeutic potential of the asset said dr dajun yang chairman ceo of ascentage pharma this ftd will help strengthen our communications with the us fda in the clinical development of alrizomadlin speed up the clinical development of alrizomadlin in the us and globally thus potentially

pat corrigan and his grandson patrick pictured with a ram they will be selling at the 79th wicklow cheviot sheep owners association in blessington 2 october the corrigan name is synonymous with breeding wicklow cheviots no surprise really given this year will be pat corrigan s 75th year exhibiting at the wicklow cheviot sheep owners association s premier sale in blessington on 2 october at the mere age of 14 pat s talented eye for sheep was quickly identified as he walked his sheep into a field up by his school in hollywood that same day the sheep owners association was hosting a sale across the road and before pat knew it he had the yard of buyers looking at his 15 rams pat said all the buyers left the sales yard and came to buy off me instead i had 15 sheep and i sold them all at 15 apiece after that the sheep owners association made me join straight away but what was it that made them want corrigan s sheep so much pat added they were different they were good sheep but they had great bone and wool and looked like rams a lot has changed for pat s farming enterprise since then with the flock now amounting to around 1 000 ewes roaming the ballysax area of the curragh these are all run commercially with around 50 of the best rams then sold for breeding as hoggets it s far from a one man show now though with pat s sons andrew paddy and david as well as grandson patrick all involved in some part alongside outside jobs sheep shearing is also well embedded in the family history with pat a 13 time all ireland champion and both andrew and paddy also collecting titles this legacy continues as this week patrick competes at balmoral show his son andrew added some people go to the pub others go to bingo and others go to matches we go to shearing competitions and have done all my life premier sale in the 1960s and 1970s exhibitors at the main sale were allowed up to 30 rams however this is now back to 10 numbers of breeders exhibiting has also reduced there were at least 50 breeders at one time but this now stands at around 25 this means that while blessington will be the first stop the corrigans flock also regularly sells in kenmare and dowra later in october pat said there has been ups and downs as would be expected in all breeds but i think that demand now is better than ever pat corrigan with the catalogues from the sales over 75 years claire nash the sheep have stayed the same but the wool has got better so there is always a man to breed the crossbred now since rams are getting scarcer it s proving better for the breeder in 1978 pat headed to scotland in search of new genetics looking at north county cheviots he didn t see the attraction though and never bought however others did and he feels this didn t do any favours for the breed instead pat has stuck to buying his stock rams at irish sales this has stood to him well as throughout the years he has claimed champion at the main premier sale on no less than seven occasions while he may have won at several he has invested in many champion rams too throughout the years he said you always have to keep buying most champions go very well at the sales but at the end of the day the buyers are judges when asked about the highlights through his 75 year career two quickly come to mind along with the championships one of the highlights was when a champion 10 years ago sold for 4 200 more importantly that ram went on to breed four champions too the second was in 1988 when pat sold 15 hogget rams at a massive average of 750 they all haven t been good years on some days i ve come home with half unsold he was quick to add however perhaps the biggest achievement of all is that corrigan sheep can be found in all corners of the country so no matter what happens next the genetics of the flock are firmly instilled in the wicklow cheviot breed for many years to come

chair jerome powell said the fed could announce a pullback in bond buying as soon as its next meeting in november washington federal reserve chair jerome powell signaled wednesday that the fed plans to announce as early as november that it will start withdrawing the extraordinary support it unleashed after the coronavirus paralyzed the economy 18 months ago powell said that if the job market maintained its steady improvement the fed would likely begin slowing the pace of its monthly bond purchases those purchases have been intended to lower longer term loan rates to encourage borrowing and spending i think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations the fed chair said at a news conference i think we can easily move ahead at the next meeting in november at the same time the fed s policymaking committee indicated wednesday that it expects to start raising its benchmark rate sometime next year earlier than the members had envisioned three months ago and a sign that they re concerned that high inflation pressures may persist powell stressed though that a rate hike would occur only after the fed had ended its bond purchases a process that he said would likely last through the middle of next year taken together the fed s plans reflect its belief that the economy has recovered sufficiently from the pandemic recession for it to soon begin dialing back the emergency aid it provided after the pandemic erupted as the economy has steadily strengthened inflation has also accelerated to a three decade high heightening the pressure on the fed to pull back the central bank s pullback in bond purchases and its eventual rate hikes whenever they happen will mean that some borrowers will have to pay more for mortgages credit cards and business loans stock and bond traders took the fed s message wednesday in stride the dow jones industrial average which had been up more than 400 points before the fed issued a policy statement closed up 338 points or a full 1 the yield on the 10 year treasury note was all but unchanged at roughly 1 31 the economy has recovered faster than many economists had expected though growth has slowed recently as covid 19 cases have spiked and labor and supply shortages have hampered manufacturing construction and some other sectors the u s economy has returned to its pre pandemic size and the unemployment rate has tumbled from 14 8 soon after the pandemic struck to 5 2 at the same time inflation has surged as resurgent consumer spending and disrupted supply chains have combined to create shortages of semiconductors cars furniture and electronics consumer prices according to the fed s preferred measure rose 3 6 in july from a year ago the sharpest such increase since 1991 related articles stocks drop the most since may on worries over federal reserve china in its updated quarterly projections fed officials now expect to raise their key short term rate once in 2022 three times in 2023 one more than they had projected in june and three times in 2024 that benchmark rate which influences many consumer and business loans has been pinned near zero since march 2020 when the pandemic erupted the central bank had signaled last year that it would likely start tapering its 120 billion a month in purchases of treasurys and mortgage bonds once the economy had made substantial further progress toward the fed s goals of maximum employment and 2 average annual inflation if progress continues broadly as expected the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted the fed said in the statement it issued after its two day meeting ended inflation has risen enough to meet the fed s test for substantial progress and powell said at his news conference that in his view employment has all but met that test too the fed hasn t hinted at how fast it will taper the purchases but it is widely expected to pare its purchases of treasurys by 10 billion a month and mortgage backed securities by 5 billion powell has repeatedly expressed his belief that the current high level of inflation will fade as the economy normalizes and in part for that reason has said the central bank isn t yet close to raising rates but the changes in the fed s interest rate projections suggest that it s moving gradually closer to doing so in march the 18 officials who make up its policymaking committee predicted that they wouldn t raise rates at all until after 2023 in june the committee revised its forecast to two rate hikes in 2023 now it foresees a rate hike as soon as next year in its latest forecasts the policymakers also indicate that they expect the economy to grow more slowly this year at 5 9 down from its june projection of 7 it sees inflation at 4 2 by the end of this year but raised its projection for inflation next year to just 2 2 from 2 1 powell is also grappling with a major ethics issue surrounding the investments and trading of some fed regional bank presidents robert kaplan president of the federal reserve bank of dallas revealed in financial disclosures that he traded millions of dollars worth of such individual stocks as amazon chevron facebook and google in 2020 while the fed was taking extraordinary measures to boost the economy eric rosengren president of the boston fed invested last year in real estate investment trusts that held mortgage backed bonds of the type the fed is buying as part of its efforts to lower borrowing rates and powell himself owns municipal bonds which the fed bought last year for the first time to shore up that market a spokesman said last week that the fed is taking a fresh and comprehensive look at its rules surrounding its officials financial holdings the investments were permitted under the fed s current rules and rosengren and kaplan have pledged to sell their holdings and reinvest the proceeds into index funds and cash asked about the topic at his news conference powell said we need to make changes and we are going to do that as a consequence of this this will be a thorough going and comprehensive review we are going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards the fed s expected policy changes follow similar steps by other central banks in the developed world as growth and inflation have picked up in many countries the european central bank said earlier this month that it would reduce its bond purchases though it has yet to say that it will fully end them the central banks of canada and australia have also scaled back bond purchases ___

one of former united states president donald trump s legacies will probably be his creation of a new branch of the united states armed forces space force army navy air force marines remember the old recruitment commercial that played back in the 80s imagine if they would have thrown in a scene from battlestar galactica that would have probably had sci fi fans lined up at the recruiter s office universal it was president ronald reagan who first talked about a defense system designed for use in space it was the strategic defense initiative and after an artist s rendering of a laser taking out a soviet missile was distributed the program was soon dubbed star wars unlike president reagan s star wars program trump s space force didn t have to start from the ground and build up there were already existing agencies in place under the thumb of the air force that fit right into the space force nicely according to defense news the space force is fundamentally a rebranding of the air force s legacy space organizations specifically the now defunct air force space command how important is the newest branch of the united states armed forces as it turns out it could be very important photo by ethan miller getty images according to time just before former president trump announced the creation of the space defense agency the russians deployed a new satellite which has been dubbed moscow s nesting doll satellite our defense and intelligence agencies were aware of the launch of the rocket and the deployment of the satellite and were keeping an eye on the satellite when something surprising happened it gave birth the satellite split in two hence the nesting doll nickname and after a couple of months our eyes in the sky watched as both satellites closed in on one of our spy satellites nasa gov washington contacted moscow and said отвали so they did the satellites backed away and started to do what satellites do somewhere else spinning around the globe seemingly minding their own business until time reports that the new satellite the one that split off from the other fired a projectile of some sort into space like something out of star wars or star trek or buck rogers or something things just got real was that satellite planning on using that projectile another satellite or a space tool to try to take out our spy satellite or maybe capture it we don t know lucasfilm our government is still watching all three of moscow s nesting doll satellites to see if anything else happens why did i go through all of that before i showed you the new prototype for the space force uniforms because i thought it was important that we are aware of what is going on in the world that s all you have to admit it sounds like a great storyline for a new james bond movie am i right did the united states need a space force many people feel that the air force space command was doing a great job others feel that an agency that can concentrate on space without the added responsibility of patrolling the terrestrial skies terrestrial skies did i just do that would be better one way or another we have a space force and its proposed dress uniforms look awesome kind of a cross between the current air force dress uniform and a fire chief s dress uniform the new space force dress prototype has the internet talking richard daborn likens the uniform to babylon 5 and battlestar galactica adam i jokes about the service ribbons across the breast of the jacket above the name tag in another reply to the space force tweet twitter user roro admits that at first he was okay with the uniform until he saw the pants yikes the pants in yet another post janet hough shared a photo of both a man and a woman wearing the new uniform and she made an interesting observation about the woman s pants her pants do seem to be slightly misfitting robert j agrees and feels that the uniform will make the space force the laughing stock of all space forces others are saying that if the agency is going to borrow from star trek they might as well go all the way jason butler is not happy with the appropriation either and finally this may be the best comment anyway regardless of what the uniform looks like the space force will be continuing the important work some members of the air force were doing and we d like to thank all of our service members for helping to keep us safe
updated september 23 2021 at 1 21 pm et an outside ethics group filed ethics complaints wednesday against seven u s house lawmakers four democrats and three republicans over failing to report stock trades one of the members of congress democratic rep tom suozzi of new york failed to file required reports on approximately 300 transactions according to the complaint from the campaign legal center five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a law to provide transparency and show lawmakers aren t profiting from their jobs members of congress are ignoring the disclosure law under the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge act lawmakers must file a report when they buy or sell stock the form known as a periodic transaction report or ptr must be submitted within 45 days for every trade valued at over 1 000 the ptr is then made public to date most allegations of stock act violations involve members filing months or in some cases more than a year after the required window for submitting a report what makes the complaints filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and republican rep roger williams of texas the lack of accountability we ve seen in regard to stock act compliance is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center said in a written statement axne davidson gooden san nicolas and williams all sit on the house financial services committee john minchillo ap ap rep tom suozzi d n y failed to file required reports on approximately 300 stock transactions according to a complaint from the campaign legal center the values and number of transactions vary in the seven complaints from the campaign legal center according to center s legal filings axne didn t file any ptrs in 2019 and 2020 and the center s complaint indicates it found more than 40 assets with a total value of 43 043 to 645 000 the complaint against davidson lists the sale of workhorse group stock worth between 50 000 and 100 000 in 2020 but notes no disclosure form was filed gooden s annual financial disclosure reflects a dozen stock purchases american airlines apa corp royal caribbean cruises delta hertz luckin coffee marathon oil occidental ovintiv plains all american pipeline sotherly hotels and united american holdings that were valued between 60 019 and 376 000 in 2020 but no ptrs were filed disclosing the initial investments according to the complaint san nicolas failed to file reports for two trades according to the complaint one in 2019 for a call option in yamana gold and one in 2020 for livent stock valued between 15 000 and 52 370 scott did not disclose four stock transactions in 2020 worth between approximately 4 004 and 60 000 these were purchases for air products and chemicals carlisle cos linde plc and rpm international according to the complaint suozzi failed to disclose about 300 transactions from 2017 to 2020 according to the campaign legal center complaint with a value of 3 2 million to 11 million this included roughly 64 transactions in 2017 valued between 456 064 and 1 868 000 31 transactions in 2018 valued between 528 031 and 1 445 00 104 transactions in 2019 worth 1 1 million and 3 8 million and 104 in 2020 worth between 1 1 million and 4 million he disclosed the trades on annual disclosures but did not file ptrs williams did not file ptrs for three stock sales in 2019 the complaintlists sales of three assets by a spouse in 2019 general electric nvidia and the walt disney co worth a total value of approximately 3 003 to 45 000 npr reached out to all seven members for a response to the complaints in a written statement to npr gooden dismissed the complaint saying there were no transactions above the reporting threshold for ptrs which is why none were filed i would encourage anyone filing frivolous ethics complaints to consult page 41 of the 2020 financial disclosure guide regarding the rule on ptrs christine ravold a spokeswoman for davidson told npr that the ptr was filed but an error on the house clerk s website failed to publish it so it was visible to the public npr contacted the clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on others including democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey who transferred his assets to a blind trust after he faced questions about not reporting dozens of trades npr learned malinowski paid a 200 fine proposal to ban lawmakers from trading stocks drew angerer getty images getty images sen jeff merkley d ore thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley told npr dryly merkley said he thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is a huge conflict of interest for someone to be trading in say pharmaceutical stocks at the same time as making policy for pharmaceutical companies he said he has introduced a bill that would require members to divest within six months of taking office and limit investments to mutual funds it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley said dryly he said without a change members keep themselves open to new allegations i can guarantee you that every year there ll be a scandal related to stock trading he has support from some of his democratic colleagues in the senate including gillibrand but she also said there s a need for a stock act 2 0 to look at all the different ways members may benefit financially from their work one new development she flagged is that lawmakers received small business loans from the covid 19 relief bills there were several examples of members of congress who were first in line to get those payouts gillibrand said that is not what the american public would expect members of congress to be doing and she said she thinks transparency regarding investments needs to go beyond capitol hill gillibrand said she has deep concerns about the judiciary and the supreme court she noted that justices are allowed to take privately funded trips paid for by people who have interests before the court congress created the stock act to ensure transparency but if nothing changes and more lawmakers keep failing to report their investments it will be tough for the public to know whether the people they elected are making decisions to benefit their constituents or themselves

melvin van peebles the groundbreaking filmmaker playwright and musician whose work ushered in the blaxploitation wave of the 1970s and influenced filmmakers long after has died he was 89 in statement his family said that van peebles father of the actor director mario van peebles died tuesday evening at his home in manhattan dad knew that black images matter if a picture is worth a thousand words what was a movie worth mario van peebles said in a statement wednesday we want to be the success we see thus we need to see ourselves being free true liberation did not mean imitating the colonizer s mentality it meant appreciating the power beauty and interconnectivity of all people sometimes called the godfather of modern black cinema the multitalented van peebles wrote numerous books and plays and recorded several albums playing multiple instruments and delivering rap style lyrics he later became a successful options trader on the stock market get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters but he was best known for sweet sweetback s baadasssss song one of the most influential movies of its time the low budget art house film which he wrote produced directed starred in and scored was the frenzied hyper sexual and violent tale of a black street hustler on the run from police after killing white officers who were beating a black revolutionary with its hard living tough talking depiction of life in the ghetto underscored by a message of empowerment as told from a black perspective it set the tone for a genre that turned out dozens of films over the next few years and prompted a debate over whether black people were being recognized or exploited all the films about black people up to now have been told through the eyes of the anglo saxon majority in their rhythms and speech and pace van peebles told newsweek in 1971 the year of the film s release i could have called it the ballad of the indomitable sweetback but i wanted the core audience the target audience to know it s for them he told the associated press in 2003 so i said ba ad asssss like you really say it made for around 500 000 including 50 000 provided by bill cosby it grossed 14 million at the box office despite an x rating limited distribution and mixed critical reviews the new york times for example accused van peebles of merchandizing injustice and called the film an outrage van peebles who complained fiercely to the motion picture association over the x rating gave the film the tagline rated x by an all white jury in memoriam people we ve lost in 2021 but in the wake of the its success hollywood realized an untapped audience and began churning out such box office hits as shaft and superfly that were also known for bringing in such top musicians as curtis mayfield marvin gaye and isaac hayes to work on the soundtracks many of hollywood s versions were exaggerated crime dramas replete with pimps and drug dealers which drew heavy criticism in both the white and black press what hollywood did they suppressed the political message added caricature and blaxploitation was born van peebles said in 2002 the colored intelligentsia were not too happy about it in fact civil rights groups like the naacp and the congress of racial equality coined the phrase blaxploitation and formed the coalition against blaxploitation among the genre s 21st century fans was quentin tarantino whose oscar winning django unchained was openly influenced by blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns on wednesday a younger generation of black filmmakers mourned van peebles death barry jenkins the moonlight director said on twitter he made the most of every second of every single damn frame after his initial success van peebles was bombarded with directing offers but he chose to maintain his independence i ll only work with them on my terms he said i ve whipped the man s ass on his own turf i m number one at the box office which is the way america measures things and i did it on my own now they want me but i m in no hurry van peebles then got involved on broadway writing and producing several plays and musicals like the tony nominated ain t supposed to die a natural death and don t play us cheap he later wrote the movie greased lighting starring richard pryor as wendell scott the first black race car driver in the 1980s van peebles turned to wall street and options trading he wrote a financial self help guide entitled bold money a new way to play the options market born melvin peebles in chicago on aug 21 1932 he would later add van to his name he graduated from ohio wesleyan university in 1953 and joined the air force serving as a navigator for three years after military service he moved to mexico and worked as a portrait painter followed by a move to san francisco where he started writing short stories and making short films van peebles soon went to hollywood but he was only offered a job as a studio elevator operator disappointed he moved to holland to take graduate courses in astronomy while also studying at the dutch national theatre eventually he gave up his studies and moved to paris where he learned he could join the french directors guild if he adapted his own work written in french he quickly taught himself the language and wrote several novels one he made into a feature film la permission the story of the three day pass was the story of an affair between a black u s soldier and a french woman it won the critic s choice award at the san francisco film

updated september 23 2021 at 1 21 pm et an outside ethics group filed ethics complaints wednesday against seven u s house lawmakers four democrats and three republicans over failing to report stock trades one of the members of congress democratic rep tom suozzi of new york failed to file required reports on approximately 300 transactions according to the complaint from the campaign legal center five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a law to provide transparency and show lawmakers aren t profiting from their jobs members of congress are ignoring the disclosure law under the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge act lawmakers must file a report when they buy or sell stock the form known as a periodic transaction report or ptr must be submitted within 45 days for every trade valued at over 1 000 the ptr is then made public to date most allegations of stock act violations involve members filing months or in some cases more than a year after the required window for submitting a report what makes the complaints filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and republican rep roger williams of texas the lack of accountability we ve seen in regard to stock act compliance is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center said in a written statement axne davidson gooden san nicolas and williams all sit on the house financial services committee john minchillo ap ap rep tom suozzi d n y failed to file required reports on approximately 300 stock transactions according to a complaint from the campaign legal center the values and number of transactions vary in the seven complaints from the campaign legal center according to center s legal filings axne didn t file any ptrs in 2019 and 2020 and the center s complaint indicates it found more than 40 assets with a total value of 43 043 to 645 000 the complaint against davidson lists the sale of workhorse group stock worth between 50 000 and 100 000 in 2020 but notes no disclosure form was filed gooden s annual financial disclosure reflects a dozen stock purchases american airlines apa corp royal caribbean cruises delta hertz luckin coffee marathon oil occidental ovintiv plains all american pipeline sotherly hotels and united american holdings that were valued between 60 019 and 376 000 in 2020 but no ptrs were filed disclosing the initial investments according to the complaint san nicolas failed to file reports for two trades according to the complaint one in 2019 for a call option in yamana gold and one in 2020 for livent stock valued between 15 000 and 52 370 scott did not disclose four stock transactions in 2020 worth between approximately 4 004 and 60 000 these were purchases for air products and chemicals carlisle cos linde plc and rpm international according to the complaint suozzi failed to disclose about 300 transactions from 2017 to 2020 according to the campaign legal center complaint with a value of 3 2 million to 11 million this included roughly 64 transactions in 2017 valued between 456 064 and 1 868 000 31 transactions in 2018 valued between 528 031 and 1 445 00 104 transactions in 2019 worth 1 1 million and 3 8 million and 104 in 2020 worth between 1 1 million and 4 million he disclosed the trades on annual disclosures but did not file ptrs williams did not file ptrs for three stock sales in 2019 the complaintlists sales of three assets by a spouse in 2019 general electric nvidia and the walt disney co worth a total value of approximately 3 003 to 45 000 npr reached out to all seven members for a response to the complaints in a written statement to npr gooden dismissed the complaint saying there were no transactions above the reporting threshold for ptrs which is why none were filed i would encourage anyone filing frivolous ethics complaints to consult page 41 of the 2020 financial disclosure guide regarding the rule on ptrs christine ravold a spokeswoman for davidson told npr that the ptr was filed but an error on the house clerk s website failed to publish it so it was visible to the public npr contacted the clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on others including democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey who transferred his assets to a blind trust after he faced questions about not reporting dozens of trades npr learned malinowski paid a 200 fine proposal to ban lawmakers from trading stocks drew angerer getty images getty images sen jeff merkley d ore thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley told npr dryly merkley said he thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is a huge conflict of interest for someone to be trading in say pharmaceutical stocks at the same time as making policy for pharmaceutical companies he said he has introduced a bill that would require members to divest within six months of taking office and limit investments to mutual funds it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley said dryly he said without a change members keep themselves open to new allegations i can guarantee you that every year there ll be a scandal related to stock trading he has support from some of his democratic colleagues in the senate including gillibrand but she also said there s a need for a stock act 2 0 to look at all the different ways members may benefit financially from their work one new development she flagged is that lawmakers received small business loans from the covid 19 relief bills there were several examples of members of congress who were first in line to get those payouts gillibrand said that is not what the american public would expect members of congress to be doing and she said she thinks transparency regarding investments needs to go beyond capitol hill gillibrand said she has deep concerns about the judiciary and the supreme court she noted that justices are allowed to take privately funded trips paid for by people who have interests before the court congress created the stock act to ensure transparency but if nothing changes and more lawmakers keep failing to report their investments it will be tough for the public to know whether the people they elected are making decisions to benefit their constituents or themselves

suzhou china and rockville md sept 22 2021 prnewswire ascentage pharma 6855 hk a global biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing novel therapies for cancers chronic hepatitis b chb and age related diseases today announced that its novel mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 has been granted a fast track designation ftd by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma relapsed refractory to prior immuno oncologic agent io treatments previously alrizomadlin was already granted five orphan drug designations odds by the us fda one of which was for the treatment of stage iib iv melanoma melanoma is a potentially deadly dermatologic malignancy that has been increasingly prevalent globally the current lifetime risk of developing melanoma is 1 in 63 in the us1 in 2019 an estimated 96 480 patients have been diagnosed with melanoma and about 7 230 patients with melanoma have died in the united states2 advanced melanoma presents an enormous clinical challenge as it is prone to metastasis and lacks survival benefit from chemotherapies immune checkpoint inhibitors icis are currently recommended for the first line treatment of most patients with metastasized melanoma3 although approximately 35 to 60 of the patients have a response evaluation criterion in solid tumors recist response to icis the remaining 40 to 65 have shown minimal or no recist response at the outset and 43 of the responders develop acquired resistance in the three years after receiving icis4 therefore patients who failed on or developed acquired resistance to icis are in urgent need of new treatment options this ftd for alrizomadlin is based on combined preclinical results and preliminary clinical data from an ongoing phase ii study apg 115 us 002 clinicaltrials gov identifier nct03611868 the preliminary clinical data released in an oral report at the 2021 american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting showed that alrizomadlin has favorable antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile the cohort of patients with pd 1 pd l1 inhibitor resistant melanoma treated with alrizomadlin in combination with pembrolizumab achieved one case of complete response cr an objective response rate orr of 24 1 and a disease control rate dcr of 55 2 the ftd expedites the development and review of drug candidates to treat serious diseases conditions that present urgent unmet clinical needs this ftd for alrizomadlin will lead to a series of benefits that could accelerate the clinical development and review for

sept 22 reuters u s federal reserve chair jerome powell said on wednesday he was displeased with the active investing carried out by two fed regional bank presidents and pledged the central bank s ethics rules will be tightened after a thorough review we need to make changes and we are going to do that powell said at a televised press conference after the fed s latest policy meeting though rules limiting the trading activities of fed policymakers are somewhat stricter than those for government employees generally the current framework is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public s trust asked if he still trusted dallas fed president robert kaplan and boston fed president eric rosengren to do their jobs powell said in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing i think no one is happy no one on the federal open market committee is happy to have these questions raised his comments come amid criticism of the two officials and public calls for their resignation following revelations they traded actively in stocks and other investments last year when millions of americans lost their jobs and the fed was taking historic steps to bolster financial markets and the economy advertisement both kaplan and rosengren have said their ethics officers had signed off on their trading but have since pledged to divest their holdings by the end of this month to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest powell said he had not been aware of their trading activities before they were reported earlier this month by the wall street journal and others powell was also asked about his own holdings which include municipal securities like those the fed bought last year as part of efforts to stave off a financial market collapse powell said that he had owned them for years and was not an active trader munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a fed person to invest because as you know the lore was that the fed would never buy municipal securities he said but then the crisis hit and the fed began backstopping vast swaths of the financial markets powell said he checked with the office of government ethics which found he did not have a conflict powell said he was reluctant to get ahead of the process and signal what changes might be ahead when we have things to announce we will go ahead and do that he said reporting by dan burns howard schneider lindsay dunsmuir ann saphir editing by chris reese and andrea ricci
toast s three co founders previously worked together at endeca which oracle acquired for 1 billion in 2011 after toast s market cap topped 30 billion in its debut wednesday each of the founders owns shares worth over 1 billion they are among a long and growing roster of tech founders who have joined the three comma club in 2021 toast s surge past 30 billion in market cap in its stock market debut on wednesday turned all three of its co founders into billionaires steve fredette aman narang and jonathan grimm started the company in 2012 after their prior employer endeca was sold to oracle for 1 billion they stayed home in cambridge massachusetts where endeca was based and built their restaurant hardware and software system by testing products on local bars restaurants and cafes get

billion as of wednesday s close grimm the company s chief technology officer controls 26 8 million shares worth 1 7 billion while narang the chief operating officer owns 24 6 million shares for a stake valued at just over 1 5 billion the three founders and other insiders are restricted from selling stock for 180 days as part of the lockup agreement so the value of their stakes could go up or down dramatically by the time they can start cashing out but based on the stock s debut price wednesday the trio joins a growing list of tech executives and founders who are seeing their net worth swell during a booming year for ipos and expanding tech valuations the founders of coinbase uipath roblox and robinhood are among others who have joined the three comma club in 2021 at least 19 tech companies that have gone public this year are now worth at least 10 billion according to factset full circle to mobile payments toast s initial product almost a decade ago focused on mobile payments allowing consumers to pay for meals from their devices however the point of sale systems at restaurants made integrations difficult if not impossible at that time to make real headway in an industry with low margins and tight budgets toast decided it needed to rebuild the entire tech stack including all the hardware and software that restaurants use to manage their operations toast the founders also sought out more experienced help from their endeca network hiring chris comparato as ceo he was previously an executive vice president at endeca and after that spent over two years running customer success at acquia comparato s stake in toast jumped to over 700 million in value on wednesday by the time comparato joined toast had made a critical decision that seemed risky at the time but turned out to be critical in the long run some payments start ups were using ipads as their business cash registers but toast chose to build on android even though the technology was clearly inferior early on ios was the better platform fredette said in an interview on wednesday from the new york stock exchange the devices were more expensive and higher grade but as sleek as ipads looked and felt toast recognized a number of potential problems if they followed the apple route most important apple s system is locked down it owns all of the hardware and software as a third party developer the best toast would be able to do is build a killer app android s technology though plagued by buggy software and frequent updates was all open source that meant toast could design its own hardware and go deep into the software using a core operating system that google originated but that nobody really controlled that gave toast immense flexibility to meet customer demand over time as we got greater scale we could go direct to manufacturers to build whatever we needed to for the industry fredette said the company s offerings which include a full point of sale terminal handheld devices for waitstaff and mobile ordering and payment software used by consumers are now deployed by 29 000 customers in 48 000 restaurant locations over the last year consumers have become much more familiar with toast for reasons the founders never could have predicted covid 19 initially hammered the business which is almost entirely dependent on a thriving dine out industry but as restaurants grappled with pandemic restrictions and tried to find ways to satisfy consumer demand for takeout options and contactless ordering toast showed up with a suite of options that most upscale eateries had never considered one of the most popular products has been mobile ordering which consumers use from their device to avoid physical menus and to pay automatically without waiting for a check it s exactly what the company wanted to do eight years ago when the technology was far from ready we certainly see it as something that s come full circle narang said on wednesday it s amazing to see some of the growth watch toast goes public at 20 billion valuation

nearly two thirds of consumers are sustainability minded drivers rating themselves as very or extremely environmentally concerned which will require automakers to evolve their offerings to meet increased demand for automotive sustainability according to a report by accenture nyse acn based on a survey of 8 500 consumers from the u s china and eight countries in europe the report busting automotive sustainability myths looks at the challenges facing automakers considering the demand for sustainability and digitization related to mobility the report is part of accenture s what digital drivers want series a key finding sustainability is no longer a secondary concern for car buyers and drivers not only are 64 of the respondents sustainability minded drivers but most prefer that their next vehicle be a new energy vehicle nev i e battery electric hybrid electric natural gas plug in hybrid electric flexible fuel or fuel cell electric they don t want new vehicles with internal combustion engines and it s not just sustainability minded drivers who would prefer an nev for their next vehicle as more than half 53 of less sustainability minded drivers also say they would prefer nevs the report also showed that no brand is perceived as the undisputed leader for the best sustainability concept globally in fact nearly as many drivers believe that bmw or audi has the best sustainability concept 11 each as believe that tesla does 12 in many cases respondents were more likely to pick automakers based in their home markets as having one of the best sustainability concepts so americans lean toward teslas and europeans toward bmws and audis for example even in service and repairs more than one quarter 28 of sustainability minded drivers don t have a clear preference for a brand with the best sustainability concept despite popular belief the race for becoming and being seen as a sustainable car brand isn t over yet said axel schmidt a senior managing director at accenture who leads its automotive industry practice globally the market for electric vehicles was the only significantly growing segment in 2020 drivers are ready for sustainable mobility but there are still some hurdles starting from the charging infrastructure to the still relatively high price per kwh in sustainability the brand takes a back seat sustainability minded drivers are not committed to a particular brand in fact 97 of them would change brands for a more sustainable vehicle and 99 would do so for greater sustainability in service and repairs the report notes that automakers that fail to compete for the hearts and minds of sustainability minded drivers i e by not making the necessary sustainability investments will lose customers to competitors that have shown a stronger focus on and commitment to sustainability drivers are increasingly challenging long held beliefs amongst many top executives and marketeers in the automotive industry that consumers would never be willing to pay a premium for sustainability said peter lacy chief responsibility officer and global sustainability services lead at accenture in one of the most disrupted industries globally in the face of connected technologies electrification of transport and autonomous vehicles embracing and helping sustainability minded drivers translate their values into their purchases is and will be a major competitive battlefield for the future drivers will pay a premium for sustainability among the many automotive myths the report busts is that most drivers are very price sensitive and won t pay more for greater sustainability the report finds that sustainability minded drivers are not only willing to switch to nevs but would pay a higher price for a sustainable vehicle for instance 30 of sustainability minded drivers are willing to pay 1 to 5 more for a sustainable vehicle with an additional 60 willing to pay at least 6 more including 4 who surprisingly say they would pay 25 more sustainability minded drivers are also willing to accept certain other trade offs for a sustainable vehicle with more than six in 10 willing to accept a car with a less attractive more functional design 63 or a car with reduced performance 62 in other words sustainability minded drivers are willing to accept trade offs on factors that many in the automotive industry believe are critical non negotiable purchase criteria for more information and to view a copy of the report please visit accenture com autosustainabilitymyths

updated september 23 2021 at 1 21 pm et an outside ethics group filed ethics complaints wednesday against seven u s house lawmakers four democrats and three republicans over failing to report stock trades one of the members of congress democratic rep tom suozzi of new york failed to file required reports on approximately 300 transactions according to the complaint from the campaign legal center five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a law to provide transparency and show lawmakers aren t profiting from their jobs members of congress are ignoring the disclosure law under the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge act lawmakers must file a report when they buy or sell stock the form known as a periodic transaction report or ptr must be submitted within 45 days for every trade valued at over 1 000 the ptr is then made public to date most allegations of stock act violations involve members filing months or in some cases more than a year after the required window for submitting a report what makes the complaints filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and republican rep roger williams of texas the lack of accountability we ve seen in regard to stock act compliance is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center said in a written statement axne davidson gooden san nicolas and williams all sit on the house financial services committee john minchillo ap ap rep tom suozzi d n y failed to file required reports on approximately 300 stock transactions according to a complaint from the campaign legal center the values and number of transactions vary in the seven complaints from the campaign legal center according to center s legal filings axne didn t file any ptrs in 2019 and 2020 and the center s complaint indicates it found more than 40 assets with a total value of 43 043 to 645 000 the complaint against davidson lists the sale of workhorse group stock worth between 50 000 and 100 000 in 2020 but notes no disclosure form was filed gooden s annual financial disclosure reflects a dozen stock purchases american airlines apa corp royal caribbean cruises delta hertz luckin coffee marathon oil occidental ovintiv plains all american pipeline sotherly hotels and united american holdings that were valued between 60 019 and 376 000 in 2020 but no ptrs were filed disclosing the initial investments according to the complaint san nicolas failed to file reports for two trades according to the complaint one in 2019 for a call option in yamana gold and one in 2020 for livent stock valued between 15 000 and 52 370 scott did not disclose four stock transactions in 2020 worth between approximately 4 004 and 60 000 these were purchases for air products and chemicals carlisle cos linde plc and rpm international according to the complaint suozzi failed to disclose about 300 transactions from 2017 to 2020 according to the campaign legal center complaint with a value of 3 2 million to 11 million this included roughly 64 transactions in 2017 valued between 456 064 and 1 868 000 31 transactions in 2018 valued between 528 031 and 1 445 00 104 transactions in 2019 worth 1 1 million and 3 8 million and 104 in 2020 worth between 1 1 million and 4 million he disclosed the trades on annual disclosures but did not file ptrs williams did not file ptrs for three stock sales in 2019 the complaintlists sales of three assets by a spouse in 2019 general electric nvidia and the walt disney co worth a total value of approximately 3 003 to 45 000 npr reached out to all seven members for a response to the complaints in a written statement to npr gooden dismissed the complaint saying there were no transactions above the reporting threshold for ptrs which is why none were filed i would encourage anyone filing frivolous ethics complaints to consult page 41 of the 2020 financial disclosure guide regarding the rule on ptrs christine ravold a spokeswoman for davidson told npr that the ptr was filed but an error on the house clerk s website failed to publish it so it was visible to the public npr contacted the clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on others including democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey who transferred his assets to a blind trust after he faced questions about not reporting dozens of trades npr learned malinowski paid a 200 fine proposal to ban lawmakers from trading stocks drew angerer getty images getty images sen jeff merkley d ore thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley told npr dryly merkley said he thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is a huge conflict of interest for someone to be trading in say pharmaceutical stocks at the same time as making policy for pharmaceutical companies he said he has introduced a bill that would require members to divest within six months of taking office and limit investments to mutual funds it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley said dryly he said without a change members keep themselves open to new allegations i can guarantee you that every year there ll be a scandal related to stock trading he has support from some of his democratic colleagues in the senate including gillibrand but she also said there s a need for a stock act 2 0 to look at all the different ways members may benefit financially from their work one new development she flagged is that lawmakers received small business loans from the covid 19 relief bills there were several examples of members of congress who were first in line to get those payouts gillibrand said that is not what the american public would expect members of congress to be doing and she said she thinks transparency regarding investments needs to go beyond capitol hill gillibrand said she has deep concerns about the judiciary and the supreme court she noted that justices are allowed to take privately funded trips paid for by people who have interests before the court congress created the stock act to ensure transparency but if nothing changes and more lawmakers keep failing to report their investments it will be tough for the public to know whether the people they elected are making decisions to benefit their constituents or themselves

new york ap melvin van peebles the groundbreaking playwright musician and movie director whose work ushered in the blaxploitation wave of the 1970s and influenced filmmakers long after has died he was 89 his family said in a statement that van peebles father of the actor director mario van peebles died tuesday evening at his home in manhattan dad knew that black images matter if a picture is worth a thousand words what was a movie worth mario van peebles said in a statement wednesday we want to be the success we see thus we need to see ourselves being free true liberation did not mean imitating the colonizer s mentality it meant appreciating the power beauty and interconnectivity of all people sometimes called the godfather of modern black cinema the multitalented van peebles wrote numerous books and plays and recorded several albums playing multiple instruments and delivering rap style lyrics he later became a successful options trader on the stock market but he was best known for sweet sweetback s baadasssss song one of the most influential movies of its time the low budget art house film which he wrote produced directed starred in and scored was the frenzied hyper sexual and violent tale of a black street hustler on the run from police after killing white officers who were beating a black revolutionary watch below with its hard living tough talking depiction of life in the ghetto underscored by a message of empowerment as told from a black perspective it set the tone for a genre that turned out dozens of films over the next few years and prompted a debate over whether blacks were being recognized or exploited all the films about black people up to now have been told through the eyes of the anglo saxon majority in their rhythms and speech and pace van peebles told newsweek in 1971 the year of the film s release i could have called it the ballad of the indomitable sweetback but i wanted the core audience the target audience to know it s for them he told the associated press in 2003 so i said ba ad asssss like you really say it made for around 500 000 including 50 000 provided by bill cosby it grossed 14 million at the box office despite an x rating limited distribution and mixed critical reviews the new york times for example accused van peebles of merchandizing injustice and called the film an outrage but in the wake of the its success hollywood realized an untapped audience and began churning out such box office hits as shaft and superfly that were also known for bringing in such top musicians as curtis mayfield marvin gave and isaac hayes to work on the soundtracks many of hollywood s versions were exaggerated crime dramas replete with pimps and drug dealers which drew heavy criticism in both the white and black press what hollywood did they suppressed the political message added caricature and blaxploitation was born van peebles said in 2002 the colored intelligentsia were not too happy about it in fact civil rights groups like the national association for the advancement of colored people and the congress of racial equality coined the phrase blaxploitation and formed the coalition against blaxploitation among the genre s 21st century fans was quentin tarantino whose oscar nominated django unchained was openly influenced by blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns after his initial success van peebles was bombarded with directing offers but he chose to maintain his independence i ll only work with them on my terms he said i ve whipped the man s ass on his own turf i m number one at the box office which is the way america measures things and i did it on my own now they want me but i m in no hurry van peebles then got involved on broadway writing and producing several plays and musicals like the

del rio texas three hours after being freed from a giant migrant camp under an international bridge mackenson veillard stood outside a gas station and took stock of his sudden good fortune as he and his pregnant wife waited for a greyhound bus to take them to a cousin in san antonio the couple camped with thousands for a week under the bridge in del rio texas sleeping on concrete and getting by on bread and bottled water i felt so stressed veillard 25 said this week but now i feel better it s like i m starting a new life many haitian migrants in del rio are being released in the united states according to two u s officials undercutting the biden administration s public statements that the thousands in the camp faced immediate expulsion to haiti haitians have been freed on a very very large scale in recent days one official said tuesday the official who was not authorized to discuss the matter and thus spoke on condition of anonymity put the figure in the thousands many have been released with notices to appear at an immigration office within 60 days an outcome that requires less processing time from border patrol agents than ordering an appearance in immigration court and points to the speed at which authorities are moving advertisement the releases come despite a massive effort to expel haitians on flights under pandemic related authority that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum a third u s official not authorized to discuss operations said there were seven daily flights to haiti planned starting wednesday ten flights arrived in haiti from sunday to tuesday in planes designed for 135 passengers according to haitian officials who didn t provide a complete count but said six of those flights carried 713 migrants combined the camp held more than 14 000 people over the weekend according to some estimates texas gov greg abbott during a visit tuesday to del rio said the county s top official told him the most recent tally was about 8 600 migrants u s authorities have declined to say how many have been released in the u s in recent days the homeland security department has been busing haitians from del rio a town of 35 000 people to el paso laredo and the rio grande valley along the texas border and this week added flights to tucson arizona the official said they are processed by the border patrol at those locations criteria for deciding who is flown to haiti and who is released in the u s are a mystery but two officials said single adults were a priority if previous handling of asylum seekers is any guide the administration is more likely to release those deemed vulnerable including pregnant women families with young children and those with medical issues the biden administration exempts unaccompanied children from expulsion flights on humanitarian grounds advertisement wilgens jean and his wife junia michel waited in del rio this week for relatives to send the 439 in bus fare to get to springfield ohio where jean s

with the robert f kennedy center for justice and human rights who was in del rio right now we have no official access to understand what processes are underway what protections are being provided for the migrants accounts of wide scale releases some observed at the del rio bus station by associated press journalists are at odds with statements monday by homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas who traveled to del rio to promise swift action if you come to the united states illegally you will be returned your journey will not succeed and you will be endangering your life and your family s life he said at a news conference advertisement homeland security asked to comment on releases in the united states said wednesday that migrants who are not immediately expelled to haiti may be detained or released with a notice to appear in immigration court or report to an immigration office depending on available custody space the biden administration has reiterated that our borders are not open and people should not make the dangerous journey the department said in a statement individuals and families are subject to border restrictions including expulsion meanwhile mexico has

riots and stringent covid 19 regulations caused significant damage to the south african economy at the start of the third quarter according to new data released on wednesday more than 300 people were killed and hundreds of businesses were robbed as some of the worst violence seen in south africa since the end of apartheid erupted shortly after the arrest of former president jacob zuma in july according to capital economics the retail sales statistics along with weak july manufacturing data released last week increase the possibility that the economy could shrink during the third quarter as a whole putting the recovery from the coronavirus epidemic on shaky ground with this background in mind the central bank is unlikely to be in a hurry to follow the lead of its counterparts in other parts of the developing world and increase interest rates according to a research note in a note to clients on tuesday jpmorgan said that a number of indicators including worsening in key terms of trade indicated that the rand was at risk stocks on the johannesburg major exchange edged higher on wednesday but sluggish chinese industrial production and retail sales held gains in check as they did elsewhere on the world s stock markets the fate of several major south african corporations such as tech investor naspers luxury goods manufacturer richemont and mining businesses are intimately tied to the fortunes of chinese companies for the most part trading on the johannesburg stock exchange was quiet but two important indexes concluded the day in positive territory the blue chip top 40 index which ended the day up 0 2 percent at 58 230 points and the all share index which finished the day up 0 13 percent at 64 385 points what s the impact of rand depreciation on industries when it comes to the effect on the industry however the picture is not as bleak as it seems south africa s economy was expected to lose r7 5 billion per year as a consequence of new visa regulations nevertheless according to statistics gathered from entry ports the number of visitors over the holiday season in 2015 increased by 7 when measured against the same period in 2014 foreign exchange depreciation according to south african forex brokers has always been a good element for the outsourcing sector since it allows purchasers of outsourced services to get them at a lower cost than they would otherwise be able to the same has been true for major outsourcing centers both established and developing in recent years a number of variables that are comparable to those that exist in india may help to develop the local outsourcing sector in south africa as part of its efforts to establish outsourcing as a significant source of job creation in the nation the south african government is collaborating with business process enabling south africa bpesa a south african business process investment and networking organization additionally the south african government has launched a slew of measures to encourage the use of outsourcing services in order to encourage international investment the administration has even relaxed restrictions approximately 2 million visitors visited the nation over the five week period from the first of december 2015 to the seventh of january 2016 the continent of asia received the greatest number of these tourists 15 percent wine tourists flock to south africa which is the world s seventh biggest wine producer and the most visited country in the world similarly the business process outsourcing bpo industry has benefited from the devaluation of the rand because of the depreciation of the rand south africa has emerged as a cost competitive outsourcing destination for businesses located outside of the united states and the european union it is a significant advantage that the nation shares time zone and cultural commonalities with these geographical areas as well what will be in the future in fact the vast bulk of the profits generated by jse listed businesses are earned outside of south africa nevertheless headwinds in the global environment may also affect the local exchange and a worsening fiscal position as well as structural economic problems could have a negative impact on the prospects of businesses that exclusively operate in south africa as a result investors should seek exposure to businesses that have some kind of protection from the local environment additionally although the jse has historically served as a good proxy for emerging markets as more and more developing countries become increasingly focused on the asian market investors should consider adding additional emerging market exposure to achieve real diversity investors should instead consider withdrawing profits or even going underweight in the bond market in order to avoid becoming overconfident yields have now recovered to 9 percent apparently oblivious to the reality that our fiscal position has worsened considerably as the result of the epidemic and that our fiscal deficit will be double the amount predicted at the start of 2020 because of this he believes that the local bond market will be unable to maintain its present levels for an extended period of time

report to congress on capitol hill in washington on wednesday sept 22 2021 powell said that the central bank will overhaul its financial ethics policies in response to growing questions about investing and trading decisions by high ranking fed officials that raise potential conflicts of interest ap photo jose luis magana file washington federal reserve chair jerome powell said wednesday that the central bank will overhaul its financial ethics policies in response to growing questions about investing and trading decisions by high ranking fed officials that raise potential conflicts of interest it is now clearly seen as not adequate in sustaining the public s trust powell said at a news conference after the fed s interest rate setting committee ended a two day policy meeting we need to make changes and we re going to do that as a consequence of this recommended videos powell stopped short of saying explicitly that the trading moves made by the fed officials were inappropriate and he offered few details about what the fed might do or how it would conduct its ethics review the issue arose after it was revealed that robert kaplan president of the federal reserve bank of dallas traded millions of dollars worth of individual stocks such as amazon chevron facebook and johnson johnson in 2020 at the same time that the fed was taking extraordinary measures to boost the economy the fed s moves likely lifted stock prices and other financial assets similar financial disclosures showed that eric rosengren president of the boston fed invested last year in real estate investment trusts that held mortgage backed bonds of the type the fed itself is buying as part of its broad efforts to lower borrowing rates and powell himself owns municipal bonds which the fed bought last year for the first time ever to prevent a collapse in the muni bond market a move that could have driven up the value of such bonds the presidents of the 12 regional banks participate in the fed s private policymaking meetings in which they discuss the central bank s interest rate policies and are privy to economic data not always available to the public the fed s decisions can cause sharp swings in financial markets so can the presidents speeches and comments to the media dennis kelleher president of better markets a watchdog group suggested that powell s comments wednesday fell far short of what is needed to reassure the public he also criticized powell s remark that the fed follows ethics rules similar to those of other government agencies that for example bar trades made with inside information the fed is not like other agencies kelleher asserted it has the most sensitive market moving information of any federal agency kelleher suggested that the central bank should direct an outside agency to investigate all the trading practices of fed presidents and should require additional information from its officials the fed s disclosure forms for example don t specify when fed regional presidents kaplan and rosengren made their trades the fed cannot investigate itself just like wells fargo cannot investigate itself kelleher said referring to that bank s regulatory troubles in recent years only an external independent investigation will have any credibility a fed spokesman said last week that the central bank is taking a fresh and comprehensive look at its trading policies the investments in question were permitted under the fed s current rules and rosengren and kaplan said that lawyers at their fed banks had approved their trades they have also both pledged to sell their holdings and to reinvest the proceeds into index funds and cash at his news conference wednesday powell said fed officials are subject to the central bank s own trading restrictions on top of those that all federal agencies follow officials for example may not trade in the 10 days before a policymaking meeting when it makes critical decisions about interest rates and other issues they re also barred from owning bank stocks because the fed regulates the banking sector one likely change powell said would be for the fed to bar officials from owning any security that the central bank is itself buying that s because the fed s purchases can often and are intended to shore up the prices of such securities such a stricture has been harder for the fed to follow as it has significantly expanded its purchases since last year to stabilize financial markets in the face of the pandemic recession it bought corporate bonds for the first time as well as municipal bonds to steady markets in those securities powell said that his own ownership of municipal bonds was a a real coincidence because he had owned them for many years without expecting that the fed would one day buy them he said he cleared his ownership with the office of government ethics and hasn t sold any since the fed began buying muni bonds sen elizabeth warren a democrat from massachusetts wrote to the 12 regional fed bank presidents last week urging that they bar all stock holdings by top officials she asked that they report by oct 15 on what steps they plan to take

chair jerome powell said the fed could announce a pullback in bond buying as soon as its next meeting in november washington federal reserve chair jerome powell signaled wednesday that the fed plans to announce as early as november that it will start withdrawing the extraordinary support it unleashed after the coronavirus paralyzed the economy 18 months ago powell said that if the job market maintained its steady improvement the fed would likely begin slowing the pace of its monthly bond purchases those purchases have been intended to lower longer term loan rates to encourage borrowing and spending i think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations the fed chair said at a news conference i think we can easily move ahead at the next meeting in november at the same time the fed s policymaking committee indicated wednesday that it expects to start raising its benchmark rate sometime next year earlier than the members had envisioned three months ago and a sign that they re concerned that high inflation pressures may persist powell stressed though that a rate hike would occur only after the fed had ended its bond purchases a process that he said would likely last through the middle of next year taken together the fed s plans reflect its belief that the economy has recovered sufficiently from the pandemic recession for it to soon begin dialing back the emergency aid it provided after the pandemic erupted as the economy has steadily strengthened inflation has also accelerated to a three decade high heightening the pressure on the fed to pull back the central bank s pullback in bond purchases and its eventual rate hikes whenever they happen will mean that some borrowers will have to pay more for mortgages credit cards and business loans stock and bond traders took the fed s message wednesday in stride the dow jones industrial average which had been up more than 400 points before the fed issued a policy statement closed up 338 points or a full 1 the yield on the 10 year treasury note was all but unchanged at roughly 1 31 the economy has recovered faster than many economists had expected though growth has slowed recently as covid 19 cases have spiked and labor and supply shortages have hampered manufacturing construction and some other sectors the u s economy has returned to its pre pandemic size and the unemployment rate has tumbled from 14 8 soon after the pandemic struck to 5 2 at the same time inflation has surged as resurgent consumer spending and disrupted supply chains have combined to create shortages of semiconductors cars furniture and electronics consumer prices according to the fed s preferred measure rose 3 6 in july from a year ago the sharpest such increase since 1991 in its updated quarterly projections fed officials now expect to raise their key short term rate once in 2022 three times in 2023 one more than they had projected in june and three times in 2024 that benchmark rate which influences many consumer and business loans has been pinned near zero since march 2020 when the pandemic erupted the central bank had signaled last year that it would likely start tapering its 120 billion a month in purchases of treasurys and mortgage bonds once the economy had made substantial further progress toward the fed s goals of maximum employment and 2 average annual inflation if progress continues broadly as expected the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted the fed said in the statement it issued after its two day meeting ended inflation has risen enough to meet the fed s test for substantial progress and powell said at his news conference that in his view employment has all but met that test too the fed hasn t hinted at how fast it will taper the purchases but it is widely expected to pare its purchases of treasurys by 10 billion a month and mortgage backed securities by 5 billion powell has repeatedly expressed his belief that the current high level of inflation will fade as the economy normalizes and in part for that reason has said the central bank isn t yet close to raising rates but the changes in the fed s interest rate projections suggest that it s moving gradually closer to doing so in march the 18 officials who make up its policymaking committee predicted that they wouldn t raise rates at all until after 2023 in june the committee revised its forecast to two rate hikes in 2023 now it foresees a rate hike as soon as next year in its latest forecasts the policymakers also indicate that they expect the economy to grow more slowly this year at 5 9 down from its june projection of 7 it sees inflation at 4 2 by the end of this year but raised its projection for inflation next year to just 2 2 from 2 1 powell is also grappling with a major ethics issue surrounding the investments and trading of some fed regional bank presidents robert kaplan president of the federal reserve bank of dallas revealed in financial disclosures that he traded millions of dollars worth of such individual stocks as amazon chevron facebook and google in 2020 while the fed was taking extraordinary measures to boost the economy eric rosengren president of the boston fed invested last year in real estate investment trusts that held mortgage backed bonds of the type the fed is buying as part of its efforts to lower borrowing rates and powell himself owns municipal bonds which the fed bought last year for the first time to shore up that market a spokesman said last week that the fed is taking a fresh and comprehensive look at its rules surrounding its officials financial holdings the investments were permitted under the fed s current rules and rosengren and kaplan have pledged to sell their holdings and reinvest the proceeds into index funds and cash asked about the topic at his news conference powell said we need to make changes and we are going to do that as a consequence of this this will be a thorough going and comprehensive review we are going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards the fed s expected policy changes follow similar steps by other central banks in the developed world as growth and inflation have picked up in many countries the european central bank said earlier this month that it would reduce its bond purchases though it has yet to say that it will fully end them the central banks of canada and australia have also scaled back bond purchases ___
there is a bidding frenzy underway in australia for listed infrastructure assets fuelled by record low interest rates and a thirst for reliable income big super overseas pension funds and private equity have got their chequebooks out in the space of a few months three of the major asx listed infrastructure companies have received takeover bids sydney airport was the first and looks set to fall to a consortium comprising australian super qsuper ifm investors and global infrastructure management the revised all cash bid of 8 75 per shares values sydney airport at 23 6bn spark infrastructure which is an electricity distributor and retailer in victoria and south australia owner of 15 of nsw high voltage transmissions company transgrid and operator of a portfolio of renewable assets received its first approach from kohlberg kravis roberts kkr and the ontario teachers pension plan board on 15 july the bid has since been revised twice and at an effective 2 8875 per share has received the blessing of the spark infrastructure board it values the company at a fraction over 5bn the latest to receive an offer is ausnet services which owns and operates the victorian electricity transmission network one of five electricity distribution networks and one of three gas distribution networks in victoria brookfield asset management the preferred bidder and asx listed gas infrastructure business apa group are in a bidding war for ausnet with apa announcing on tuesday a cash and scrip offer potentially worth 2 60 per share this values ausnet at 10bn if apa succeeds with its bid for ausnet then through apa investors will at least be able to access these assets otherwise as seems likely all companies will be privatised and disappear from the asx private infrastructure investors and smaller super funds won t be left with many investment options excluding power station owner agl they will have three listed infrastructure alternatives the biggest is toll road company transurban owner and operator of most of the toll roads in sydney melbourne and brisbane transurban is currently finalising its purchase of the remaining 49 of the westconnex motorway in sydney and is raising 4bn through an entitlement offer at 13 00 a share the brokers are forecasting a full year distribution of around 40c in fy22 rising to 60c in fy23 putting transurban on an unfranked yield of 2 8 for fy22 and 4 3 for fy23 auckland international airport aia is the second option since the takeover of sydney airport was announced in early july its shares have surged by 10 7 at 7 41 the major brokers see them as moderately overvalued with the consensus target price sitting just over 7 00 the third is apa which owns and operates about 22bn of energy infrastructure assets this includes 15 425km of gas transmission pipelines 29 500km of gas mains and pipelines that connect to 1 4m gas consumers gas fired power generators wind and solar energy generators gas storage and gas processing facilities and electricity transmission lines if apa beats brookfield in the race for ausnet it will need to raise about 1 5bn in fresh equity knowing this the market has beaten apa s share price down to 8 55 considerably below the consensus broker target price of 10 06 prior to the bid for ausnet apa had guided to a distribution of 53c per unit which means it is now trading on a forecast yield of 6 2 in addition to the local companies investors may wish to consider the two global infrastructure funds listed on the asx they invest in infrastructure assets from across the spectrum toll roads energy infrastructure communications airports ports water and railways and from different geographies argo global listed infrastructure limited ali is a listed investment company lic that invests in a

one of former united states president donald trump s legacies will probably be his creation of a new branch of the united states armed forces space force army navy air force marines remember the old recruitment commercial that played back in the 80s imagine if they would have thrown in a scene from battlestar galactica that would have probably had sci fi fans lined up at the recruiter s office universal it was president ronald reagan who first talked about a defense system designed for use in space it was the strategic defense initiative and after an artist s rendering of a laser taking out a soviet missile was distributed the program was soon dubbed star wars unlike president reagan s star wars program trump s space force didn t have to start from the ground and build up there were already existing agencies in place under the thumb of the air force that fit right into the space force nicely according to defense news the space force is fundamentally a rebranding of the air force s legacy space organizations specifically the now defunct air force space command how important is the newest branch of the united states armed forces as it turns out it could be very important photo by ethan miller getty images according to time just before former president trump announced the creation of the space defense agency the russians deployed a new satellite which has been dubbed moscow s nesting doll satellite our defense and intelligence agencies were aware of the launch of the rocket and the deployment of the satellite and were keeping an eye on the satellite when something surprising happened it gave birth the satellite split in two hence the nesting doll nickname and after a couple of months our eyes in the sky watched as both satellites closed in on one of our spy satellites nasa gov washington contacted moscow and said отвали so they did the satellites backed away and started to do what satellites do somewhere else spinning around the globe seemingly minding their own business until time reports that the new satellite the one that split off from the other fired a projectile of some sort into space like something out of star wars or star trek or buck rogers or something things just got real was that satellite planning on using that projectile another satellite or a space tool to try to take out our spy satellite or maybe capture it we don t know lucasfilm our government is still watching all three of moscow s nesting doll satellites to see if anything else happens why did i go through all of that before i showed you the new prototype for the space force uniforms because i thought it was important that we are aware of what is going on in the world that s all you have to admit it sounds like a great storyline for a new james bond movie am i right did the united states need a space force many people feel that the air force space command was doing a great job others feel that an agency that can concentrate on space without the added responsibility of patrolling the terrestrial skies terrestrial skies did i just do that would be better one way or another we have a space force and its proposed dress uniforms look awesome kind of a cross between the current air force dress uniform and a fire chief s dress uniform the new space force dress prototype has the internet talking richard daborn likens the uniform to babylon 5 and battlestar galactica adam i jokes about the service ribbons across the breast of the jacket above the name tag in another reply to the space force tweet twitter user roro admits that at first he was okay with the uniform until he saw the pants yikes the pants in yet another post janet hough shared a photo of both a man and a woman wearing the new uniform and she made an interesting observation about the woman s pants her pants do seem to be slightly misfitting robert j agrees and feels that the uniform will make the space force the laughing stock of all space forces others are saying that if the agency is going to borrow from star trek they might as well go all the way jason butler is not happy with the appropriation either and finally this may be the best comment anyway regardless of what the uniform looks like the space force will be continuing the important work some members of the air force were doing and we d like to thank all of our service members for helping to keep us safe
despite a still menacing pandemic and a cascade of other domestic and international threats to the u s economy federal reserve policymakers on wednesday expressed confidence in the recovery and said they could soon start withdrawing stimulus programs supporting financial markets and the economy fed officials however were split in their thinking about when they would start raising interest rates with about half predicting liftoff next year and the other half in 2023 advertisement the fed s decisions were broadly welcome in the business community with stocks rising after days of losses nonetheless fed policies showed the limitations of the central bank s weapons for attacking the economic problems of less affluent less well educated and less highly skilled americans and the sagging incomes and covid related job losses of that segment of the population remain a major drag on recovery low interest rates supporting prices of stocks and bonds and other staples of central bank monetary policy make it cheaper and easier for companies to expand their operations and for start ups to try new ventures advertisement that in turn can gradually open the way for new jobs and other opportunities often for the well educated and highly skilled segment of the population much of which has largely avoided the economic damage inflicted by the pandemic but monetary policy has proved to have only indirect and slow acting effect on the less affluent segments of the population including black and latino americans whose unemployment rates are considerably higher we have famously broad and blunt tools said jerome h powell the fed s chairman speaking at a virtual news conference wednesday i think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies frankly education policies and that kind of thing are better at focusing on advertisement fed officials at the conclusion of their two day meeting kept their main interest rate near zero where it has been since the pandemic hit the u s in march 2020 the fed had been contemplating plans to start reversing its nontraditional stimulus program large scale government bond purchases meant to spur lending and investment some officials have wanted a faster withdrawal in response to higher inflation on wednesday the fed said moderating those bond purchases may soon be warranted which analysts interpreted as probably occurring later this fall advertisement at the top of fed officials concerns is the virulent delta variant of the coronavirus which appears to be slowly trending down in terms of new cases but has hit parts of the country very hard overall the variant has damped consumer sentiment and economic activity including hiring adding to policymakers worries are uncertainties over the perennial washington problem of the debt limit which could lead to a u s government default by the end of october if the u s treasury is unable to borrow more and can t pay its bills that s never happened and chances are that lawmakers won t allow such a catastrophic event to occur now but in the past even taking it close to the wire has been costly to markets and the economy advertisement investors also have been anxious about how china will deal with the world s most indebted property developer evergrande and the potential damage to global financial markets if it should default on repaying billions of dollars in loan debts the private company s travails have sparked protests in china and reflect beijing s decision to move away from an economic model based on growth through real estate development in its place beijing has moved toward policies that would foster more productive and sustained growth in other areas of china s economy but the new strategy partly reflecting its desire to be less reliant on u s and western technologies is certain to cause short term pain and will probably slow china s growth which will be felt broadly as china is the world s second largest economy advertisement moreover the u s economy is still struggling with supply bottlenecks and various hiring constraints adding to inflationary pressures all as support from the massive covid 19 federal relief program is ebbing fed officials in their policy statement wednesday focused on the delta variant saying progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remain the fed like most private analysts marked down economic growth for this year it now expects gross domestic product to expand 5 9 this year from 7 in its june projections its gdp growth forecast for 2022 however was raised to 3 8 compared with 3 3 earlier advertisement the fed also tempered the expected progress in lowering unemployment it now sees the jobless rate at 4 8 at the end of the year whereas its previous forecast was 4 5 the latest unemployment rate for august was 5 2 despite the array of challenges the economy has some important things going for it there were 10 9 million job openings at the end of july by far the highest number recorded by the labor department that suggests employers expect consumer demand to be strong and although businesses are struggling to recruit workers due to lack of child care covid concerns and early retirements among other factors analysts expect most of the openings to be filled over time advertisement another plus for the economy is the enormous amount of savings accumulated by households over the last 18 months of the pandemic moody s analytics estimates excess savings at around 2 4 trillion as of the first quarter most of that is held by higher income households but the extra cushion has sustained many people without jobs and means there s a large reservoir of cash available to support spending in the future especially if consumers feel more comfortable going out and traveling

the printing paper market remains in turmoil as print providers serving all markets scramble to secure various paper grades at affordable pricing levels and with reasonable lead times from mills and distributors that have reduced manufacturing capacity and enacted supply allocations now it appears a cloud of uncertainty remains over u s based coated paper supplier verso corp miamisburg ohio based verso announced sept 21 that its board of directors has entered into a confidentiality agreement with private equity firm atlas holdings llc to further negotiate the unsolicited 20 per share takeover bid atlas made on july 11 2021 in a prepared statement which also indicated a deal is not imminent or may never be consummated verso said the special committee of the board of directors of verso previously communicated to atlas its determination made in consultation with its financial and legal advisors that atlas previously disclosed 20 00 per share all cash offer to acquire verso was insufficient and that the special committee would only consider a potential transaction if atlas meaningfully increased its offer from 20 00 the two parties agreed to exchange additional information under the terms of the agreement to facilitate ongoing discussions regarding a potential transaction with atlas on mutually acceptable terms last july atlas initially offered to acquire publicly held verso for 20 per share in cash putting an enterprise value of the paper manufacturer at approximately 886 million according to a july 12 schedule 13d filing with the securities exchange commission sec the 20 per share offer represented a 15 9 premium over the closing price of verso common stock on july 9 2021 greenwich connecticut based private equity firm atlas holdings along with affiliates lapetus capital and blue world capital advisors already controls 9 12 of the voting power of verso and has been an activist investor seeking control since acquiring outstanding shares in the company atlas already owns printer lsc several paper suppliers what makes the takeover attempt by atlas holdings even more intriguing are its existing print provider and paper company holdings atlas holdings acquired the assets of former 2016 rr donnelley spin off lsc communications in early december 2020 the lsc communications transaction took the publicly held book catalog and magazine printing specialist which had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection private atlas holdings portfolio within the paper sector includes finch a paper manufacturer specializing in uncoated papers twin rivers paper a manufacturer of lumber specialty packaging label and publishing papers marcal a paper towel and tissue products manufacturer and millar western an alberta based pulp producer in the packaging sector atlas owns asg agi shorewood a specialized packaging company with facilities in europe npx one a manufacturer of absorbent pads and expanded polystyrene foam trays for u s food processors and saxco a north american distributor of rigid packaging for the wine spirits craft beer and food markets although the 2019 acquisition of lsc by quad was blocked by the u s department of justice antitrust concerns over the potential verso acquisition by atlas seem unlikely given the fragmented nature of the paper industry as such if the takeover of verso does happen atlas will have control over a major coated paper supplier in verso uncoated paper specialist finch pulp making capabilities from verso and millar western as well as ownership of lsc communications one of the largest book catalog and publication printers in the country on the printing side this ostensibly would give atlas greater supply chain control with the ability to readily provide coated and uncoated grades to meet lsc s print production output needs potentially giving lsc a competitive advantage in the marketplace a similar vertical integration scenario happened last month when glendale calif based pressure sensitive materials manufacturer avery dennison announced an agreement to acquire vestcom from a private equity firm in an all cash 1 45 billion transaction with roughly 400 million in annual sales vestcom operates 11 u s production facilities serving multiple u s retail channels including grocery drug and dollar stores vestcom s solutions include stackz pre cut pre sorted self adhesive shelf labels shelfstrips shelf edge planogram displays adsigns signage kits and shelfadz branded marketing displays it will remain to be seen if these types of vertical supply chain consolidations intensify throughout the printing and packaging space both as large publicly held industry suppliers try to bolt on higher profit margin entities and by private equity firms seeking to grow large integrated platforms that they can eventually divest what print markets does verso serve verso which filed for chapter 11 protection in january 2016 produces graphic specialty and packaging paper and market pulp its graphic paper products are designed primarily for commercial printing advertising and marketing applications including direct mail catalogs corporate collateral books and magazines verso s specialty paper products include release liner papers and label face stock for pressure sensitive glue applied and laminate applications the company also produces packaging paper used in packaging and printing applications such as greeting cards book covers folders labels and point of purchase displays verso has also reduced mill capacity and sold off assets it blamed covid 19 and the subsequent drop in demand for graphic paper used to produce advertising materials as the main driver for the july 2020 shutdowns of its mills in wisconsin rapids wis and duluth minn its jay androscoggin maine mill and its stevens point wis based specialty papers business were also divested to pixelle specialty solutions in early 2020
advertisement trump sues niece new york times over records used for 2018 story on taxes share copy link copy former president donald trump on tuesday sued his estranged niece and the new york times over a 2018 story about his family s wealth and tax practices that was partly based on confidential documents she provided to the newspaper s reporters trump s lawsuit filed in state court in new york accuses mary trump of breaching a settlement agreement by disclosing tax records she received in a dispute over family patriarch fred trump s estate the lawsuit accuses the times and three of its investigative reporters susanne craig david barstow and russell buettner of relentlessly seeking out mary trump as a source of information and convincing her to turn over documents the suit claims the reporters were aware the settlement agreement barred her from disclosing the documents the times story challenged trump s claims of self made wealth by documenting how his father fred had given him at least 413 million over the decades including through tax avoidance schemes mary trump identified herself in a book published last year as the source of the documents provided to the times trump s lawsuit alleges mary trump the times and its reporters were motivated by a personal vendetta against him and a desire to push a political agenda the defendants engaged in an insidious plot to obtain confidential and highly sensitive records which they exploited for their own benefit and utilized as a means of falsely legitimizing their publicized works the lawsuit said in a statement to nbc news mary trump said of her uncle i think he is a loser and he is going to throw anything against the wall he can it s desperation the walls are closing in and he is throwing anything against the wall that he thinks will stick as is always the case with donald he ll try and change the subject a times spokesperson danielle rhoads ha said the lawsuit is an attempt to silence independent news organizations and we plan to vigorously defend against it the times coverage of trump s taxes she said helped inform citizens through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest one of the times reporters craig responded in a tweet i knocked on mary trump s door she opened it i think they call that journalism trump is seeking 100 million in damages trump filed his lawsuit almost a year to the day after mary trump sued him over allegations that he and two of his siblings cheated her out of millions of dollars over several decades while squeezing her out of the family business that case is pending mary trump 56 is the daughter of donald trump s brother fred trump jr who died in 1981 at age 42 mary trump was 16 at the time trump s lawsuit focuses only on the times 2018 story a pulitzer prize winner for explanatory reporting it makes no mention of another times scoop on trump s taxes last year which found he paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years according to the lawsuit mary trump came into possession of more than 40 000 pages of highly sensitive proprietary private and confidential documents through a legal case involving fred trump s will the documents including financial records accountings tax returns bank statements and legal papers pertaining to donald trump fred trump and their businesses trump s lawsuit said in 2001 about two years after fred trump died mary trump and other family members entered into a settlement agreement with confidentiality and non disclosure clauses that barred them from sharing information about fred trump s estate in among other venues newspaper stories trump s lawsuit said the agreement also covered the estate of fred s wife mary anne trump who died in 2000 trump who bashed the times repeatedly during his presidency as the failing new york times noted in the lawsuit that the 2018 article was viewed more online than any previous times article and that the new york times company s stock price jumped 7 4 the week it ran the times story said that donald trump and his father avoided gift and inheritance taxes by methods including setting up a sham corporation and undervaluing assets to tax authorities the times says its report was based on more than 100 000 pages of financial documents including confidential tax returns from the father and his companies mary trump s book too much and never enough how my family created the world s most dangerous man debuted in the midst of donald trump s re election campaign last year donald trump s brother robert tried unsuccessfully to have a court block the book s publication citing the 2001 settlement agreement ruling in mary trump s favor a judge said the confidentiality clauses viewed in the context of the current trump family circumstances in 2020 would offend public policy as a prior restraint on protected speech in the book mary trump recounted providing the family financial records that underlaid the times reporting the book sold more than 1 3 million copies in its first week and soaring to no 1 on the times bestseller list in an interview connected with the release of the book mary trump told abc she didn t feel the non disclosure agreement mattered one way or the other because what i have to say is too important
washington ap the idea of the u s government breaching its debt limit sounds scary but what exactly are lawmakers in washington fighting about the debt limit is a nearly century old artificial cap that congress placed on the u s government s ability to borrow lawmakers have raised or suspended it nearly 80 times since 1960 but there is a deepening partisan standoff this time underscoring how the debt limit has evolved into a political weapon house democrats voted tuesday to suspend the debt limit through the end of 2022 that proposal is likely to meet fierce resistance in the evenly split senate where republican lawmakers say president joe biden and the democrats in power should go it alone as they also try to move on a multitrillion dollar package of tax increases on the wealthy and new spending on children health care infrastructure and the environment the biden administration insists on bipartisanship on the issue it is not a partisan issue to want to protect the full faith and credit of the united states white house press secretary jen psaki said wednesday aboard air force one the issue is time sensitive because the extraordinary measures used by the treasury department to keep the government running would be exhausted in october if congress fails to act it creates the possibility of a default that could send financial markets crashing and the economy plunging into a recession the house passed bill also ties the suspension to a measure that would continue to fund the federal government through dec 3 republicans despite their refusal to help agree with democrats that a default must be avoided america must never default we never have and we never will senate republican leader mitch mcconnell declared wednesday as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase here is an explainer on the problem why is there a debt limit before world war i congress needed to approve each bond issuance the debt limit was created as a workaround to finance the war effort without needing a constant series of votes since then a tool created to make it easier for the government to function has become a source of dysfunction stoking partisan warfare and creating economic risk as the debt has increased in size over the past 20 years the congressional budget office estimates that annual budget deficits of 1 trillion or more will be routine for the next decade so the issue will be recurring the debt rose in large part to fund the recoveries from the great recession and the coronavirus pandemic the imbalance over the coming years increasingly reflects government expenses for programs such as medicare and social security that are outstripping tax revenues how big is the debt limit the cap is now 28 4 trillion during the trump administration the debt limit was suspended three times the last suspension passed on a bipartisan basis in 2019 when the debt stood at 22 trillion ended in july the treasury department has since been engaging in what it calls extraordinary measures to keep the government operating the 28 4 trillion debt is bigger than the yearly u s gross domestic product the biden administration and congressional democrats say the next debt limit suspension should be bipartisan because it applies to previous spending approved by the government it s akin to paying a credit card bill and a signal to the financial markets that the united states will be fiscally responsible estimates from moody s analytics say that a potential recession from government cuts if the cap stays in place could lead to 6 million job losses and stock market declines that could eliminate 15 trillion of household wealth why do republicans oppose an increase put simply they re out of power and they dislike biden s policy agenda while the administration notes that the debt ceiling reflects prior spending choices mcconnell and the republicans are linking any increase to biden s multitrillion dollar plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations in order to fund programs and tax breaks that could aid the middle class mcconnell has said the tax hikes would ultimately hurt the middle class and lead to a socialist transformation of the country democrats control the senate the house and the white house mcconnell said wednesday if they want to ram through another reckless taxing and spending spree that hurts working families and helps china without any republican input they will need to raise the debt limit on their own democrats helped republicans suspend the debt limit when republicans controlled congress after democrats retook the house in 2019 speaker nancy pelosi negotiated a broader spending package with the trump administration that included a debt ceiling hike who is to blame for the rising debt everyone the debt limit was suspended three times under trump who used debt to fund his 2017 tax cuts and then needed to borrow even more when the economy tanked last year with covid 19 both biden and obama took office amid weakened economies and passed ambitious aid packages that required the government to borrow more investors enabled congress to run higher deficits because low interest rates made it easier to fund the government through debt interest rates on 10 year u s treasury notes are lower now than in fiscal 2001 when the government last ran an annual surplus polling by the pew research center suggests voters became less concerned about the debt as the pandemic raged just 47 last year said the deficit was a very big problem down from 55 in 2018 why not just get rid of the limit one easy fix would be to completely repeal the debt limit so that it can no longer be used as leverage in congressional fights that step would allow the spending and taxes approved by congress and the president to determine how much debt the government issues instead of a legally binding but otherwise superfluous cap a biden administration official insisting on anonymity to discuss private conversations said the white house would only weigh in on the elimination if congress showed there was support for the idea there is some bipartisan backing among those who have previously dealt with this challenge harvard university professor jason furman formerly the top economist in obama s white house and rohit kumar a former aide to mcconnell advocated for removing the cap in a 2017 wall

washington ap federal reserve chair jerome powell said wednesday that the central bank will overhaul its financial ethics policies in response to growing questions about investing and trading decisions by high ranking fed officials that raise potential conflicts of interest it is now clearly seen as not adequate in sustaining the public s trust powell said at a news conference after the fed s interest rate setting committee ended a two day policy meeting we need to make changes and we re going to do that as consequence of this powell stopped short of saying explicitly that the trading moves made by the fed officials were inappropriate and he offered few details about what the fed might do or how it would conduct its ethics review the issue arose after it was revealed that robert kaplan president of the federal reserve bank of dallas traded millions of dollars worth of individual stocks such as amazon chevron facebook and johnson johnson in 2020 at the same time that the fed was taking extraordinary measures to boost the economy the fed s moves likely lifted stock prices and other financial assets similar financial disclosures showed that eric rosengren president of the boston fed invested last year in real estate investment trusts that held mortgage backed bonds of the type the fed itself is buying as part of its broad efforts to lower borrowing rates and powell himself owns municipal bonds which the fed bought last year for the first time ever to prevent a collapse in the muni bond market a move that could have driven up the value of such bonds the presidents of the 12 regional banks participate in the fed s private policymaking meetings in which they discuss the central bank s interest rate policies and are privy to economic data not always available to the public the fed s decisions can cause sharp swings in financial markets so can the presidents speeches and comments to the media dennis kelleher president of better markets a watchdog group suggested that powell s comments wednesday fell far short of what is needed to reassure the public he also criticized powell s remark that the fed follows ethics rules similar to those of other government agencies that for example bar trades made with inside information the fed is not like other agencies kelleher asserted it has the most sensitive market moving information of any federal agency kelleher suggested that the central bank should direct an outside agency to investigate all the trading practices of fed presidents and should require additional information from its officials the fed s disclosure forms for example don t specify when fed regional presidents kaplan and rosengren made their trades the fed cannot investigate itself just like wells fargo cannot investigate itself kelleher said referring to that bank s regulatory troubles in recent years only an external independent investigation will have any credibility a fed spokesman said last week that the central bank is taking a fresh and comprehensive look at its trading policies the investments in question were permitted under the fed s current rules and rosengren and kaplan said that lawyers at their fed banks had approved their trades they have also both pledged to sell their holdings and to reinvest the proceeds into index funds and cash at his news conference wednesday powell said fed officials are subject to the central bank s own trading restrictions on top of those that all federal agencies follow officials for example may not trade in the 10 days before a policymaking meeting when it makes critical decisions about interest rates and other issues they re also barred from owning bank stocks because the fed regulates the banking sector one likely change powell said would be for the fed to bar officials from owning any security that the central bank is itself buying that s because the fed s purchases can often and are intended to shore up the prices of such securities such a stricture has been harder for the fed to follow as it has significantly expanded its purchases since last year to stabilize financial markets in the face of the pandemic recession it bought corporate bonds for the first time as well as municipal bonds to steady markets in those securities powell said that his own ownership of municipal bonds was a a real coincidence because he had owned them for many years without expecting that the fed would one day buy them he said he cleared his ownership with the office of government ethics and hasn t sold any since the fed began buying muni bonds sen elizabeth warren a democrat from massachusetts wrote to the 12 regional fed bank presidents last week urging that they bar all stock holdings by top officials she asked that they report by oct 15 on what steps they plan to take christopher rugaber the associated press
updated september 23 2021 at 1 21 pm et an outside ethics group filed ethics complaints wednesday against seven u s house lawmakers four democrats and three republicans over failing to report stock trades one of the members of congress democratic rep tom suozzi of new york failed to file required reports on approximately 300 transactions according to the complaint from the campaign legal center five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a law to provide transparency and show lawmakers aren t profiting from their jobs members of congress are ignoring the disclosure law under the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge act lawmakers must file a report when they buy or sell stock the form known as a periodic transaction report or ptr must be submitted within 45 days for every trade valued at over 1 000 the ptr is then made public to date most allegations of stock act violations involve members filing months or in some cases more than a year after the required window for submitting a report what makes the complaints filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and republican rep roger williams of texas the lack of accountability we ve seen in regard to stock act compliance is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center said in a written statement axne davidson gooden san nicolas and williams all sit on the house financial services committee john minchillo ap ap rep tom suozzi d n y failed to file required reports on approximately 300 stock transactions according to a complaint from the campaign legal center the values and number of transactions vary in the seven complaints from the campaign legal center according to center s legal filings axne didn t file any ptrs in 2019 and 2020 and the center s complaint indicates it found more than 40 assets with a total value of 43 043 to 645 000 the complaint against davidson lists the sale of workhorse group stock worth between 50 000 and 100 000 in 2020 but notes no disclosure form was filed gooden s annual financial disclosure reflects a dozen stock purchases american airlines apa corp royal caribbean cruises delta hertz luckin coffee marathon oil occidental ovintiv plains all american pipeline sotherly hotels and united american holdings that were valued between 60 019 and 376 000 in 2020 but no ptrs were filed disclosing the initial investments according to the complaint san nicolas failed to file reports for two trades according to the complaint one in 2019 for a call option in yamana gold and one in 2020 for livent stock valued between 15 000 and 52 370 scott did not disclose four stock transactions in 2020 worth between approximately 4 004 and 60 000 these were purchases for air products and chemicals carlisle cos linde plc and rpm international according to the complaint suozzi failed to disclose about 300 transactions from 2017 to 2020 according to the campaign legal center complaint with a value of 3 2 million to 11 million this included roughly 64 transactions in 2017 valued between 456 064 and 1 868 000 31 transactions in 2018 valued between 528 031 and 1 445 00 104 transactions in 2019 worth 1 1 million and 3 8 million and 104 in 2020 worth between 1 1 million and 4 million he disclosed the trades on annual disclosures but did not file ptrs williams did not file ptrs for three stock sales in 2019 the complaintlists sales of three assets by a spouse in 2019 general electric nvidia and the walt disney co worth a total value of approximately 3 003 to 45 000 npr reached out to all seven members for a response to the complaints in a written statement to npr gooden dismissed the complaint saying there were no transactions above the reporting threshold for ptrs which is why none were filed i would encourage anyone filing frivolous ethics complaints to consult page 41 of the 2020 financial disclosure guide regarding the rule on ptrs christine ravold a spokeswoman for davidson told npr that the ptr was filed but an error on the house clerk s website failed to publish it so it was visible to the public npr contacted the clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on

updated september 23 2021 at 1 21 pm et an outside ethics group filed ethics complaints wednesday against seven u s house lawmakers four democrats and three republicans over failing to report stock trades one of the members of congress democratic rep tom suozzi of new york failed to file required reports on approximately 300 transactions according to the complaint from the campaign legal center five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a law to provide transparency and show lawmakers aren t profiting from their jobs members of congress are ignoring the disclosure law under the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge act lawmakers must file a report when they buy or sell stock the form known as a periodic transaction report or ptr must be submitted within 45 days for every trade valued at over 1 000 the ptr is then made public to date most allegations of stock act violations involve members filing months or in some cases more than a year after the required window for submitting a report what makes the complaints filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and republican rep roger williams of texas the lack of accountability we ve seen in regard to stock act compliance is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center said in a written statement axne davidson gooden san nicolas and williams all sit on the house financial services committee john minchillo ap ap rep tom suozzi d n y failed to file required reports on approximately 300 stock transactions according to a complaint from the campaign legal center the values and number of transactions vary in the seven complaints from the campaign legal center according to center s legal filings axne didn t file any ptrs in 2019 and 2020 and the center s complaint indicates it found more than 40 assets with a total value of 43 043 to 645 000 the complaint against davidson lists the sale of workhorse group stock worth between 50 000 and 100 000 in 2020 but notes no disclosure form was filed gooden s annual financial disclosure reflects a dozen stock purchases american airlines apa corp royal caribbean cruises delta hertz luckin coffee marathon oil occidental ovintiv plains all american pipeline sotherly hotels and united american holdings that were valued between 60 019 and 376 000 in 2020 but no ptrs were filed disclosing the initial investments according to the complaint san nicolas failed to file reports for two trades according to the complaint one in 2019 for a call option in yamana gold and one in 2020 for livent stock valued between 15 000 and 52 370 scott did not disclose four stock transactions in 2020 worth between approximately 4 004 and 60 000 these were purchases for air products and chemicals carlisle cos linde plc and rpm international according to the complaint suozzi failed to disclose about 300 transactions from 2017 to 2020 according to the campaign legal center complaint with a value of 3 2 million to 11 million this included roughly 64 transactions in 2017 valued between 456 064 and 1 868 000 31 transactions in 2018 valued between 528 031 and 1 445 00 104 transactions in 2019 worth 1 1 million and 3 8 million and 104 in 2020 worth between 1 1 million and 4 million he disclosed the trades on annual disclosures but did not file ptrs williams did not file ptrs for three stock sales in 2019 the complaintlists sales of three assets by a spouse in 2019 general electric nvidia and the walt disney co worth a total value of approximately 3 003 to 45 000 npr reached out to all seven members for a response to the complaints in a written statement to npr gooden dismissed the complaint saying there were no transactions above the reporting threshold for ptrs which is why none were filed i would encourage anyone filing frivolous ethics complaints to consult page 41 of the 2020 financial disclosure guide regarding the rule on ptrs christine ravold a spokeswoman for davidson told npr that the ptr was filed but an error on the house clerk s website failed to publish it so it was visible to the public npr contacted the clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on others including democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey who transferred his assets to a blind trust after he faced questions about not reporting dozens of trades npr learned malinowski paid a 200

updated september 23 2021 at 1 21 pm et an outside ethics group filed ethics complaints wednesday against seven u s house lawmakers four democrats and three republicans over failing to report stock trades one of the members of congress democratic rep tom suozzi of new york failed to file required reports on approximately 300 transactions according to the complaint from the campaign legal center five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a law to provide transparency and show lawmakers aren t profiting from their jobs members of congress are ignoring the disclosure law under the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge act lawmakers must file a report when they buy or sell stock the form known as a periodic transaction report or ptr must be submitted within 45 days for every trade valued at over 1 000 the ptr is then made public to date most allegations of stock act violations involve members filing months or in some cases more than a year after the required window for submitting a report what makes the complaints filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and republican rep roger williams of texas the lack of accountability we ve seen in regard to stock act compliance is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center said in a written statement axne davidson gooden san nicolas and williams all sit on the house financial services committee john minchillo ap ap rep tom suozzi d n y failed to file required reports on approximately 300 stock transactions according to a complaint from the campaign legal center the values and number of transactions vary in the seven complaints from the campaign legal center according to center s legal filings axne didn t file any ptrs in 2019 and 2020 and the center s complaint indicates it found more than 40 assets with a total value of 43 043 to 645 000 the complaint against davidson lists the sale of workhorse group stock worth between 50 000 and 100 000 in 2020 but notes no disclosure form was filed gooden s annual financial disclosure reflects a dozen stock purchases american airlines apa corp royal caribbean cruises delta hertz luckin coffee marathon oil occidental ovintiv plains all american pipeline sotherly hotels and united american holdings that were valued between 60 019 and 376 000 in 2020 but no ptrs were filed disclosing the initial investments according to the complaint san nicolas failed to file reports for two trades according to the complaint one in 2019 for a call option in yamana gold and one in 2020 for livent stock valued between 15 000 and 52 370 scott did not disclose four stock transactions in 2020 worth between approximately 4 004 and 60 000 these were purchases for air products and chemicals carlisle cos linde plc and rpm international according to the complaint suozzi failed to disclose about 300 transactions from 2017 to 2020 according to the campaign legal center complaint with a value of 3 2 million to 11 million this included roughly 64 transactions in 2017 valued between 456 064 and 1 868 000 31 transactions in 2018 valued between 528 031 and 1 445 00 104 transactions in 2019 worth 1 1 million and 3 8 million and 104 in 2020 worth between 1 1 million and 4 million he disclosed the trades on annual disclosures but did not file ptrs williams did not file ptrs for three stock sales in 2019 the complaintlists sales of three assets by a spouse in 2019 general electric nvidia and the walt disney co worth a total value of approximately 3 003 to 45 000 npr reached out to all seven members for a response to the complaints in a written statement to npr gooden dismissed the complaint saying there were no transactions above the reporting threshold for ptrs which is why none were filed i would encourage anyone filing frivolous ethics complaints to consult page 41 of the 2020 financial disclosure guide regarding the rule on ptrs christine ravold a spokeswoman for davidson told npr that the ptr was filed but an error on the house clerk s website failed to publish it so it was visible to the public npr contacted the clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on others including democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey who transferred his assets to a blind trust after he faced questions about not reporting dozens of trades npr learned malinowski paid a 200 fine proposal to ban lawmakers from trading stocks drew angerer getty images getty images sen jeff merkley d ore thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley told npr dryly merkley said he thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is a huge conflict of interest for someone to be trading in say pharmaceutical stocks at the same time as making policy for pharmaceutical companies he said he has introduced a bill that would require members to divest within six months of taking office and limit investments to mutual funds it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley said dryly he said without a change members keep themselves open to new allegations i can guarantee you that every year there ll be a scandal related to stock trading he has support from some of his democratic colleagues in the senate including gillibrand but she also said there s a need for a stock act 2 0 to look at all the different ways members may benefit financially from their work one new development she flagged is that lawmakers received small business loans from the covid 19 relief bills there were several examples of members of congress who were first in line to get those payouts gillibrand said that is not what the american public would expect members of congress to be doing and she said she thinks transparency regarding investments needs to go beyond capitol hill gillibrand said she has deep concerns about the judiciary and the supreme court she noted that justices are allowed to take privately funded trips paid for by people who have interests before the court congress created the stock act to ensure transparency but if nothing changes and more lawmakers keep failing to report their investments it will be tough for the public to know whether the people they elected are making decisions to benefit their constituents or themselves

the first hour to more than wipe out tuesday s attempted comeback but at 11am the mood changed no it was nothing to do with local case counts but all about china evergrande announced it had resolved one of its two interest payments due today that being us 35 9m equivalent on an rmb denominated 2025 bond as to what resolved means is not clear and the company has another payment due today of us 83 5m on a usd denominated bond and another next week for us 47 5m in each case evergrande has thirty days to make payment before the bonds default meanwhile the pboc announced it had injected rmd120bn into china s banking system it should be noted that while evergrande is china s second biggest property developer it is also a diversified conglomerate with fingers in many other pies from retail to evs it is thus feared the collapse of the company would reverberate through the wider chinese economy in a lehman style meltdown hence the pboc s actions with the chinese back from holiday the property sector jumped 3 5 on the shanghai exchange and somewhat ironically the chinese saved the day a bit for iron ore by day s end in singapore the spot price had rebounded 14 4 to us 107 55 t so no surprise the local market saw investors piling back into iron ore miners yesterday with the big three seeing low single digit percentage gains but smaller miners jumping into double digits all miners ex gold had crashed on monday on wider chinese economic fears so they were all bought back again yesterday the materials sector rose 2 0 and given the same story for oil energy rose 2 3 the next best performer was property 0 9 but still financials are being slammed down another 0 6 insurers led the charge down yesterday with yet another natural disaster shaking sentiment by lunchtime yesterday the asx200 had turned a 32 point open into a 65 point gain but excitement faded into the close with a fed decision pending that decision did little to upset wall street with the s p500 closing up 1 but given wall street had actually been higher ahead of the fed release on the back of the evergrande news our futures this morning are only up 14 points the evergrande story is not yet over no tantrum the dow was up 520 points at its peak last night ahead of the fed release and all three major indices were uniformly up well over 1 at that point on the reasons noted above at 2 30pm it surprised no one that the statement suggested a tapering schedule will likely be announced at the next meeting november jay powell did not confirm an announcement in case anything untoward happens in the meantime he did suggest tapering would be gradual ending by mid 2022 wall street is assuming the announcement will come in november and tapering will kick off from the december meeting but some found that timeframe not quite as gradual as one might have expected ending by mid next year and then there was the matter of the infamous dot plots the dot plots are anonymous predictions from all fomc members as to where interest rates will be in one two three years and longer term based on last night s predictions nine members see the first rate hike coming in 2022 nine in 2023 and one in 2024 which was powell s original timeline in the wake of the covid crash that is a lot more hawkish than the tone persistently set by the fed chair informing the dots are a balance of inflation and labour market assumptions they are by no means a commitment and will be recast at the march fed meeting when a lot more data has flowed through to that point us homebuilder kb homes reported a miss on revenues in the aftermarket last night the miss was blamed on the slow delivery of completions on a combination of supply shortages and labour shortages while there is little surprise forecasts for september quarter us gdp growth have been reined in in the wake of delta including the fed last night corporate earnings forecasts are now being wound back as well on the assumption the quarter will feature a notable margin squeeze as so many businesses across many sectors grapple with the same issues facing kb homes the us bank sector enjoyed a 1 5 boost from the fed last night looking toward rate hikes down the track the us ten year yield lifted only one basis point to 1 34 reflecting no surprise in other news the house voted last night to keep the government funded suspend the federal

filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and

clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on others including democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey who transferred his assets to a blind trust after he faced questions about not reporting dozens of trades npr learned malinowski paid a 200 fine proposal to ban lawmakers from trading stocks drew angerer getty images getty images sen jeff merkley d ore thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley told npr dryly merkley said he thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is a huge conflict of interest for someone to be trading in say pharmaceutical stocks at the same time as making policy for pharmaceutical companies he said he has introduced a bill that would require members to divest within six months of taking office and limit investments to mutual funds it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley said dryly he said without a change members keep themselves open to new allegations i can guarantee you that every year there ll be a scandal related to stock trading he has support from some of his democratic colleagues in the senate including gillibrand but she also said there s a need for a stock act 2 0 to look at all the different ways members may benefit financially from their work one new development she flagged is that lawmakers received small business loans from the covid 19 relief bills there were several examples of members of congress who were first in line to get those payouts gillibrand said that is not what the american public would expect members of congress to be doing and she said she thinks transparency regarding investments needs to go beyond capitol hill gillibrand said she has deep concerns about the judiciary and the supreme court she noted that justices are allowed to take privately funded trips paid for by people who have interests before the court congress created the stock act to ensure transparency but if nothing changes and more lawmakers keep failing to report their investments it will be tough for the public to know whether the people they elected are making decisions to benefit their constituents or themselves

five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a

the limit also known as the debt ceiling applies to all federal debt both debt held by the public money borrowed from sources outside the government and intragovernmental holdings money that the government owes itself most intragovernmental debt is held by federal trust funds such as the social security trust funds since 1960 congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise temporarily extend or revise the definition of the debt limit 49 times under republican presidents and 29 times under democratic presidents treasury says on its website under president donald trump congress passed three spending bills in 2017 2018 and 2019 that suspended the debt limit in each case the debt limit was then raised at the end of the suspension period to account for the cumulative borrowing that occurred during the suspension as explained in an april report by the nonpartisan congressional research service president joe biden and the democrats are now seeking to do what trump and the republicans did in 2017 2018 and 2019 resolve the debt limit issue in a bipartisan manner what is the deadline to act now soon as early as october in late july the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated treasury would probably run out of cash in october or november if the debt limit isn t increased the bipartisan policy center also estimated the x date when the government could no longer fully meet his obligations would be this fall in a sept 21 analysis moody s analytics said its best estimate is that treasury would default on oct 20 if congress didn t act treasury secretary janet yellen said in an aug 2 letter to congress that a debt issuance suspension period would last through sept 30 allowing treasury to use extraordinary measures which are accounting strategies to manage cash and debt in a follow up letter on sept 8 yellen said the most likely outcome is that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted during the month of october the treasury secretary said how long the extraordinary measures would last is subject to heightened uncertainty due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic yellen s letters said treasury had suspended the sale of state and local government securities it stopped investments credited to the civil service retirement and disability fund and the postal service retiree health benefits fund and suspended certain investments in the federal employees retirement system all of which will be made whole once the debt limit is increased or suspended yellen has urged congress to take action on a bipartisan basis as it has in the past to protect the full faith and credit of the united states in addition to the debt limit situation congress needs to pass legislation to fund the government after sept 30 when this fiscal year ends if it doesn t there could be a partial government shutdown with some services and even federal worker paychecks being cut off what is the disagreement between republicans and democrats on sept 21 the house passed a continuing budget resolution that would fund the government through dec 3 suspend the debt limit through dec 16 2022 and reset the limit at the amount it will be on dec 17 2022 the bill includes emergency disaster relief and funding to assist refugees and others arriving from afghanistan it passed with a straight party line vote with zero republican support in a sept 20 statement house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer said the bill is needed to prevent a partial government shutdown when the fiscal year ends on sept 30 n extension of government funding through december will provide an appropriate amount of time needed to pass a full fiscal year 2022 spending package they said but republicans in the senate have vowed to reject the continuing resolution seeking to link a vote on the debt limit solely to the democrats senate republicans would support a clean continuing resolution that includes appropriate disaster relief and targeted afghan assistance senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said in a sept 20 floor speech we will not support legislation that raises the debt limit the republicans accuse the democrats of suspending the debt limit to fund their partisan 3 5 trillion budget resolution and reconciliation plan which passed the house along party lines in august they are increasing the debt ceiling to make room for a 5 5 trillion democratic party wish list sen bill cassidy said on sept 19 on meet the press using a higher figure that a budget watchdog group says is the true cost of the 3 5 trillion plan although that assumes the policies in the democratic plan would become permanent in future legislation after suspending the debt ceiling the senate democrats hope to approve their 3 5 trillion spending bill through a procedure known as reconciliation which would require only 51 votes in the senate the democrats control 50 senate seats and vice president kamala harris would provide the tie breaking 51st vote the bare minimum needed to pass a bill through reconciliation in his sept 20 floor speech mcconnell urged the democrats to also raise the debt limit without republican votes through reconciliation democrats want to build a partisan future without our input so democrats will not get bipartisan facilitators for their purely partisan spending binge mcconnell said later adding one party controls the entire government they have the power to address this alone democrats accuse the republicans of hypocrisy this is the same leader mcconnell who urged democrats and republicans to support raising the debt ceiling when donald trump was president and he was majority leader schumer said in a floor speech on sept 20 noting that the democrats gave support for all three of those bills and adding that at least one of those times was when the house the senate and the presidency were controlled by republicans in september 2017 democrats did support suspending the debt limit when republicans controlled congress and the white house raising the debt limit democratic leaders say is needed to allow the federal government to pay for past spending bills not future spending as republicans have claimed addressing the debt limit is about meeting obligations the government has already made like the bipartisan emergency covid relief legislation from december as well as vital payments to social security recipients and our veterans schumer and pelosi said in their sept 20 statement in a floor speech that day schumer said anyone who says this is democratic debt is not talking fact they re talking fiction how might this be resolved democrats would need to convince 10 senators to support the continuing resolution which includes disaster relief aid to states hit by hurricanes republican sen john kennedy of louisiana said he would probably vote for the bill because of the relief funding but the state s other senator cassidy hasn t said how he ll vote without sufficient republican support in the senate democrats would have to pass the continuing resolution through reconciliation however instead of suspending the debt limit a reconciliation bill would have to raise the debt limit by a specific amount making it a vote democrats don t want to solely own roll call s paul m krawzak outlined another possibility reopening the fiscal 2022 budget resolution which democrats in both houses of congress already passed to add debt limit language but that wouldn t be easy it s just complicated it s not clear the senate parliamentarian would allow it and time is short with estimates that the treasury department could run out of funds to meet u s financial commitments within weeks krawzak wrote in a sept 22 analysis what happens if it isn t resolved by oct 1 as we said if congress doesn t pass legislation to keep funding the government beyond sept 30 some government services could be curtailed as for the debt limit politicians of both parties agree the economic and political fallout would be significant the government would default on its obligations yellen warned congress that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence raise short term borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the united states in 2011 during another political battle over the debt limit standard poor s downgraded the u s government s credit rating a delay that calls into question the federal government s ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the u s economy and global financial markets yellen said in her sept 8 letter moody s said if congress doesn t act before the treasury runs out of cash and defaults on its obligations interest rates will spike with enormous costs to taxpayers consumers and the economy its analysis warns of a recession for both u s and global economies still trying to recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic the budget watchdog committee for a responsible federal budget wrote in a july 28 post that there is no option beyond getting lawmakers to act some believe the treasury department could buy more time by engaging in other unprecedented actions such as selling large amounts of gold minting a special large denomination coin or invoking the fourteenth amendment to override the statutory debt limit crfb said whether any of these tools is truly available is in question and the potential economic and political consequences of each of these options are

this time it s going to be different well maybe yes maybe no the second day of the marine money climate conference featured a group of excellent high level presentations looking at the overall capital landscape for participants in the maritime de carbonization space combined with a handful of company specific information slots which were also highly informative one presenter evan efstathiou the founder of boston based skysail advisors presented a chart reminiscent of the dotcom bubble two decades ago around 1999 into early 2001 mapping exactly who was doing what in which segment of the maritime information business circa late 2021 another presenter jesper bo hansen with the analytics advisory side of maersk broker located in denmark one of the company specific presenters briefly drew some analogies albeit imperfect likening to developments of today s the environmental regulatory profile with the advent of opa 90 three decades ago clearly the shipping business is facing down what can be described as a decarbonization wave indeed one of mr hansen s excellent presentation slides had some words to the effect of better get onboard before it overwhelms your company he said we should all aim to be on the right side of history noting that the effects of decarbonization demands could happen faster than expected as client demand change presumably the clients are charterers who are driven by social pressure to maintain and disclose publicly reduced carbon or at some point carbon free supply chains the regulators also driven by social pressures may be in the same basket big picture investment in maritime information and technology driven by high doses of data companies is seeing a mini explosion that has gathered velocity during the past two three years with more deals and bigger values mr evan efstathiou a denizen of boston s intersection of maritime technology and capital raising along with another mit alumnus nikos petrakakos a pioneer in banking maritime sustainability deals offered a high level view of present developments mr efstathiou pointed to several big factors providing a real good tailwinds for sustainability related tech in this view the eruption of the last 24 months has been fueled by decarbonization being identified as a global priority by the new and ever changing regulatory seascape with some industry initiatives and high frequency analytics thrown in for good measure by the role of customers looking at the sustainability bona fides of vendors including shipowners with hefty portions of quantification analytics and optimization all thrown into the mix he pointed to three examples illustrative of investment styles and templates first nyse listed spire global self described as provider of space based data analytics and space services which recently acquired exact earth a leading provider of ais data provided via satellites in the iridium network is illustrative of how access to capital markets can accelerate merger and acquisition activity it s not all about bulkers and tankers he next cited the role of private equity pe investors in enabling the roll up of companies specifically mentioning navis a leading provider of terminal operations software tos serving the container sector moving outward beyond the truck gates into broader land side infrastructure applications earlier this year navis was acquired by a technology fund run by pe behemoth kkr the third type of company is signal ocean a tanker owner linked to the martinos family with bigtime boston connections on both sides of the charles river building out a widely used vessel chartering platform initially developed internally mr petrakakos in his remarks pegged the size of the maritime decarbonization market with aims of meeting 2050 targets for removing carbon as a 1 4 1 8 trillion with a t opportunity he offered a taxonomy of investors including shipping commodity specialists cleantech venture capitalists and various family offices he noted that big kahunas like pension funds and infrastructure funds are out there but are looking for big projects with big assets and long term contracts with speakers throughout the marine money event talking about the need to build out fueling infrastructures these guys may just be the ticket

it s impossible to chronicle the fullness of nascar s history without a few words about jeff gordon maybe a chapter in a book or even a few chapters perhaps a book all to itself even a full shelf of books about one of racing s most accomplished drivers after all the driver once referred to as wonder boy helped change the sport for all time jeff gordon s next act evernham on why gordon move is great for nascar gordon s career stretched a quarter century and produced some of the cup series most enduring and endearing moments it s likely that only a few competitors will ever be considered in his class maybe a half dozen whose influence helped mold the sport into what we have today jeffery michael gordon stands amidst them from california by way of indiana the hall of famer came to stock cars after success on espn s thursday night thunder in the mid to late 1980s those telecasts gave many americans their first look at usac s sprint car midget and silver crown stars and gordon certainly was among them he was young handsome personable and articulate a rock star teen idol clearly headed for bigger and better things fairfax media archives getty images jeff gordon with sprint car circa 1989 at first nascar wasn t prominent on his radar he honed his skills and built his reputation in open wheel so indycar and the indy 500 seemed logical destinations but he fell into the clutches of nascar because he and his family couldn t marshal the funds to buy a competitive indycar ride history has recorded open wheel s loss as stock car s gain he took a friend s advice and attended the buck baker driving school at the north carolina speedway at rockingham there performing well and blessed by fate he met stock car devotees who introduced him to mechanics who introduced him to team reps who introduced him to team owners a couple of successful xfinity series seasons with owner bill davis led to an incomparable career in cup with owner rick hendrick for most of those years crew chief ray evernham guided the no 24 program to unprecedented heights brian cleary getty images jeff gordon and richard petty talk racing in 1994 from a one off in 1992 at age 20 until his retirement at age 44 in 2016 gordon made 805 cup starts won 81 poles and 93 races had 21 top 10 points seasons hoisted four championship trophies and won almost every significant race at least once he s in every meaningful motorsports hall of fame and is generally considered the first in the new wave of drivers who were as socially and commercially savvy in the boardroom as they were talented behind the wheel richard petty and david pearson had brought nascar to the country s attention in the 1960s and 1970s darrell waltrip and dale earnhardt had led the way in the 1980s and 1990s gordon dominated throughout the 1990s and into the new century a litany of well backed well connected aggressive young kids eventually moved into gordon s turf marking the end of another era the first of his 93 victories that s third all time behind petty s 200 and pearson s 105 came in the 1994 coca cola 600 at charlotte motor speedway in their 40 previous starts gordon and evernham had finished top 5 in nine races and top 10 in five more showing the potential that would soon blossom they had been second to earnhardt in the 1993 coca cola 600 and fifth in that season s fall race at cms and had two xfinity victories there both from the pole plus they had started on pole for two of their three cup races at the 1 5 mile track clearly charlotte was theirs for the taking racingone getty images jeff gordon leads the field at the 1994 coca cola 600 rusty wallace and geoffrey bodine dominated the 400 lapper wallace leading 197 laps and bodine 101 but both made late race pit stops for four tires and fuel evernham waited as long as possible leaving his chevrolet lumina out until everyone else had stopped knowing they had only one chance evernham called for a splash of fuel and only right side tires the two tire stop for 8 65 seconds got gordon back out ahead of wallace whose four tire stop had taken about 16 seconds gordon rode that strategy to his breakthrough victory over wallace by almost four seconds it wasn t really a gamble evernham said at the time almost overcome by the emotion of his first victory we really didn t have any choice sometimes you ve just gotta go for it if you can t beat em one way you have to beat em another i just can t believe this gordon concurred two was the absolute best decision he said as tears covered his cheeks we didn t need a full fuel load and the two rights actually balanced the car and kept me fast we weren t about to beat rusty otherwise nobody was he was that good all night but sometimes the fastest car doesn t win later when the impact of the moment cleared evernham explained his strategy we could have changed two or four or done a gas and go he said it made my decision easier when rusty and geoffrey took four ahead of us we figured the time we d save with a two tire stop would be worth it in the long run hey i ll always bet on my guy when he s leading with 10 laps left racingone getty images the winning strategy left wallace s crew chief second guessing his four tire call we never dreamed they would do what they did buddy parrott said of the rainbow warriors we figured we d be racing bodine for the win not gordon it was a chancy move for them to take just two because i never thought it would work looking back we should have taken two tires and won by a ton we really had everybody beat bad that night gordon s second career win came later that year in the inaugural brickyard 400 at indianapolis motor speedway he won 10 10 and 13 races in 1996 1997 and 1998 and was winless only three times in his 23 full seasons he won the 600 again in 1997 and 1998 and the brickyard 400 again in 1998 2001 2004 and 2014 he was an overwhelming choice although not unanimously for the 2019 nascar hall of fame but wait there s more most fans remember earnhardt as nascar s dominant figure during the eight years he and gordon were rivals but between 1993 and 2000 gordon had more than twice as many victories and two more championships each beat the other four times in the final standings gordon was the seventh cup series driver to get his breakthrough nascar victory in the 600 david pearson did it in 1961 gordon in 1994 bobby labonte in 1995 matt kenseth in 2000 casey mears in 2007 david reutimann in 2009 and austin dillon 2017 three crew chiefs ran the show when gordon won his five brickyard 400s evernham in 1994 and 1998 robbie loomis in 2001 and 2004 and alan gustafson in 2014 nbc getty images jeff gordon on saturday night live gordon s on track fame led to several notable off track opportunities he was among the first athletes to host saturday night live and was a popular and well received repeat guest on the morning show co hosted by regis philbin and kelly ripa he also appeared on among others taxi david letterman jay leno the today show jimmy kimmel ellen degeneres 60 minutes rachael ray and jimmy fallon even with his career at its height gordon strongly urged rick hendrick to add a relatively unknown xfinity driver to his cup lineup he suggested some california surfer kid off road racer named jimmie johnson

joe in the end has always been there he s always been with me i think we can work something out president biden franklin roosevelt is remembered for the new deal and lyndon b johnson the great society what will joe biden be remembered for it likely depends on the fate of two pieces of legislation that encompass nearly the entirety of his once in a generation agenda including infrastructure climate voter rights higher taxes for the wealthy equal justice for people of color and low incomes healthcare and greater assistance for low income families and children should biden s agenda emerge from congress relatively unscathed it will mark a generational change in how the federal government is viewed and what s expected of it it would be a change evocative of the new deal and the great society standing between president biden and his date with history are a pace of conservative congressional democrats the most prominent of whom is west virginia senator joe manchin d manchin is calling for a strategic pause in democratic efforts to rush through a multi trillion dollar reconciliation bill to have it on the president s desk within weeks the climate related provisions of the reconciliation bill together with those in the 1 2 trillion infrastructure program passed by the senate in august and awaiting house action would be the most comprehensive package of integrated energy and environmental policies and programs in us history what does manchin hope to accomplish by pausing the dash to reconciliation in a wall street journal op ed he explains instead of rushing to spend trillions on new government programs and additional stimulus funding congress should hit a strategic pause on the budget reconciliation legislation a pause is warranted because it will provide more clarity on the trajectory of the pandemic and allow us to determine whether inflation is transitory or not i believe that making budgetary decisions under artificial political deadlines never leads to good policy or sound decisions emphasis added how long the pause should be is unclear the senator has been reported as saying until next year without specifying exactly when next year manchin s inflation concerns are legitimate the annual inflation rate in the us decreased from 3 2 percent in 2011 to 1 2 percent in 2020 in july 2021 the rate jumped to 5 4 percent two causes of inflation are government spending and deficits both are on the rise according to the bipartisan policy center the federal government ran a deficit of 3 1 trillion in fiscal year 2020 more than triple the deficit for fy2019 this fiscal year s cumulative deficit of 2 7 trillion as a share of gdp is the largest since 1945 the possibility of inflation shouldn t be an excuse not to act treasury secretary yellen wall street economists and the federal reserve board anticipate that inflation will cool as temporary factors like supply chain issues and shortages of goods and labor subside congressional democrats too are mindful of the potential inflationary pressure attendant to biden s build back better plan house and senate committees are looking at programs that might be cut or reduced in size to lower the nation s monthly nut the house ways and means and senate finance committees are looking to raise in the neighborhood of 2 trillion in new tax revenues higher tax rates for wealthy individuals and corporations are being targeted how high the new rates should be is a matter of some debate the white house has asked for rate increases higher than congressional tax writers currently appear willing to go conservative democrats in the senate and members of the house blue dog coalition are advising against new taxes in an election year on the surface manchin desire for a cooling off period is reasonable after all what s a few more months especially if in those months the 1 2 trillion infrastructure starts to be implemented moreover isn t manchin right to seek bipartisan support for both the infrastructure and reconciliation bills manchin s doggedness in the pursuit of bipartisanship has already had the type of response he and other moderate democrats including president biden had hoped for and promised led by senators sinema d az and portman r oh a bipartisan group of 21 senators ten democrats and eleven republicans put together the 1 2 trillion bill that passed the senate by a vote of 69 to 31 the negotiators are to be congratulated for coming up with a bipartisan bill however the actual proof of progress is whether the 19 republican senators will still support the bill when a final vote is taken all they ve done so far is to support the senate version there s anecdotal evidence suggesting that the 19 senators are now getting pushback from their party and constituents to fully appreciate the position president biden and congressional democrats find themselves on climate matters it s helpful to compare what s to be gained by a strategic pause with what might be lost in all honesty i can t think of anything of real value that s to be gained by waiting particularly in the case of climate change congressional republicans will never sign on to biden s climate change agenda certainly not in an election year when they are hoping to retake either or both chambers of congress so what would be lost by waiting the first thing that would be lost is time how much time is not simply the sum of days or weeks between now and when in 2022 manchin might like to restart or finish the reconciliation debate in fact the answer isn t numerical at all unless it s the number of democrats to republicans who will be sworn in as members of the 118th congress in january 2023 the second thing that has a high probability of being lost is the democrats control of either or both chambers of congress as i ve written before history is not on the side of a president s party in terms of gaining or keeping congressional seats in a midterm election say what you will about the democrats the reality is most republicans don t see or are unwilling to say that climate change is even a problem let alone the greatest existential crisis facing the us and every other nation in the world we re talking about a party that is willing to put personal opinion over scientific fact a party increasingly populated by voters and leaders willing to give meaning to a lie not just any lie mind you but a lie that undermines our democracy and has been disproven based on physical evidence and rejected by tens of dozens of judges in every case that s been filed in a state or federal court former president trump has made it quite clear in recent weeks that he is the face of the republican party and is willing to purge it of anyone who would refuse to kiss his ring his impact on next year s midterm election is being seen in places like ohio s 16th congressional district where he s endorsed a primary challenger to the incumbent anthony gonzalez gonzalez had the audacity to vote to impeach trump following the january 6 assault on the capitol gonzalez has since thrown in the towel deciding it just wasn t worth the abuse he would undoubtedly be subjected to from the former president and the likes of marjorie taylor greene r ga and matt gaetz it should be noted that greene has such a penchant for lying that she was stripped of her committee assignments by her own congressional caucus the other nine republican votes to impeach are also in trump s sights notwithstanding who wins the fought over nominations trump will continue to infuse chaos into the internal workings of the party making collaboration difficult the third thing that s likely to be lost is unity within democratic ranks stress fractures are already very visible it s telling that both speaker pelosi and senate majority leader schumer seem to be on the side of the progressives when it comes to climate policy for the two years following the 2018 elections there was visible tension between the speaker and progressives in her caucus it was especially apparent in her dealings with the squad the group comprised of representatives ocasio cortez ny ilhan omar of minnesota rashida tlaib of michigan and ayanna s pressley of massachusetts during a press conference in 2019 a new york times reporter asked pelosi about the squad s fury over the border aid package that passed the house with specific restrictions placed on how the trump administration could spend the money there was an evident edginess in pelosi s response all these people have their public whatever and their twitter world but they didn t have any following they re four people and that s how many votes they got times have changed pelosi in particular appears much more intense when it comes to climate policy and the reconciliation and infrastructure bills it s as if she s not sure there will be a tomorrow at least a democratic tomorrow on capitol hill house and senate progressives have played well with their more moderate colleagues since 2018 and joined ranks around biden once it was clear that sanders wasn t going to be nominated it s earned them pelosi s respect as well as schumer s and the president s tensions between manchin and ocasio cortez aoc have been seen in recent twitter feeds and sunday talk shows on september 2nd in response to manchin s announcement that he would oppose the 3 5 trillion price tag on the reconciliation package aoc posted although manchin denies the allegation a lobbyist for exxon mobil was caught on undercover footage saying he speaks with manchin s office weekly manchin is on record opposed to continuing production and investment tax credits for clean energy sources like solar and wind he claims that they are now competitive in many places and don t need any assistance although manchin is right about the competitiveness of solar and wind the reason for continuing the credits is no longer just about helping them to get a foothold in the private marketplace these days the objective is to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as possible to slow the rate of earth s warming and its consequences manchin is hardly perceived as a neutral mediator when it comes to energy sources the senator receives more campaign contributions from coal oil and gas interests than any other senator according to open secrets a research organization that follows the money in politics coral davenport a highly respected journalist on energy and environment issues reports that manchin profits personally from polluting industries he owns stock valued at between 1 million and 5 million in enersystems inc a coal brokerage firm which he founded in 1988 he gave control of the firm to his son joseph after he was elected west virginia secretary of state in 2000 last year mr manchin made 491 949 in dividends from his enersystems stock according to his senate financial disclosure report let me be clear no one is accusing mr manchin of anything improper however being the only democrat elected to high office in a coal state who shows little understanding of the urgency of responding to earth s warming by swapping out fossil fuels for available clean alternatives doesn t exactly commend to be the poster boy for sustainability then there was his campaign ad in 2010 where he s seen shooting a rifle bullet into a copy of hr 2454 the cap and trade bill popularly known as the waxman markey the bill passed the house however it was never brought to the senate floor for a vote even though the senate was under democratic control at the time it s likely speaker pelosi remembers what happened the last time she trusted the senate to pass critical climate legislation its memory undoubtedly plays into her current congressional strategy of tying the infrastructure and reconciliation bills together as a package using one to lever the other the fourth and perhaps greatest loss should the president s climate plan not be put into force are the significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that would result passage of the reconciliation bill s current climate related provisions proposed by president biden and favored by congressional progressives like representative jayapal d wa and senator bernie sanders is critical to defending against earth s warming and as an example to other nations an analysis released by senate majority leader schumer estimates that climate related provisions of the proposed reconciliation bill would reduce us greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent by 2030 see figure 1 time has never been more of the essence the bottom line the next 60 to 90 days promise to be among the most contentious on record yes things can get worse the end of the current federal fiscal year is a week away and the debt ceiling needs to be raised senate minority leader mcconnell r ky is giving every indication that he s asking his caucus members not to cooperate with the democrats something that even the democrats didn t do during the trump administration when it came to preserving the nation s credit rating and keeping the government going if ever there was a time for the democrats to circle their wagons and act in a unified manner it s now holding the needed climate related elements of the reconciliation package hostage to bipartisan discussions in a congressional election year is to toss them away manchin sinema and other conservative democrats have to know this it s time for them to take loosen their grip on speaker pelosi and senate majority leader schumer let s leave the niceties of bipartisanship action at the door for at least a little while longer after two decades of hyper partisanship can another few months really matter

updated september 23 2021 at 1 21 pm et an outside ethics group filed ethics complaints wednesday against seven u s house lawmakers four democrats and three republicans over failing to report stock trades one of the members of congress democratic rep tom suozzi of new york failed to file required reports on approximately 300 transactions according to the complaint from the campaign legal center five of the seven lawmakers sit on the powerful house financial services committee it s the latest example of a bipartisan trend that has emerged almost 10 years after congress overwhelmingly passed a law to provide transparency and show lawmakers aren t profiting from their jobs members of congress are ignoring the disclosure law under the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge act lawmakers must file a report when they buy or sell stock the form known as a periodic transaction report or ptr must be submitted within 45 days for every trade valued at over 1 000 the ptr is then made public to date most allegations of stock act violations involve members filing months or in some cases more than a year after the required window for submitting a report what makes the complaints filed wednesday different is that it appears these members never filed reports at all the campaign legal center learned about the issues after reviewing financial disclosure forms for all members of congress it compared the 2019 forms with the 2020 forms and discovered discrepancies with these lawmakers holdings but it did not find any ptrs to reflect the new transactions a spokesperson for suozzi said the congressman s investments are managed through independent advisors with discretion over all transactions every transaction has been reported on his annual financial disclosure and all proper periodic disclosures will be filed on a going forward basis still the campaign legal center is asking the office of congressional ethics the outside nonpartisan entity that screens cases and can make referrals to the house ethics committee to look into these members activities group says members of congress are flouting the law the ethics complaints filed wednesday are against suozzi democratic rep cindy axne of iowa republican rep warren davidson of ohio republican rep lance gooden of texas democratic delegate michael san nicolas of guam democratic rep bobby scott of virginia and republican rep roger williams of texas the lack of accountability we ve seen in regard to stock act compliance is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the campaign legal center said in a written statement axne davidson gooden san nicolas and williams all sit on the house financial services committee john minchillo ap ap rep tom suozzi d n y failed to file required reports on approximately 300 stock transactions according to a complaint from the campaign legal center the values and number of transactions vary in the seven complaints from the campaign legal center according to center s legal filings axne didn t file any ptrs in 2019 and 2020 and the center s complaint indicates it found more than 40 assets with a total value of 43 043 to 645 000 the complaint against davidson lists the sale of workhorse group stock worth between 50 000 and 100 000 in 2020 but notes no disclosure form was filed gooden s annual financial disclosure reflects a dozen stock purchases american airlines apa corp royal caribbean cruises delta hertz luckin coffee marathon oil occidental ovintiv plains all american pipeline sotherly hotels and united american holdings that were valued between 60 019 and 376 000 in 2020 but no ptrs were filed disclosing the initial investments according to the complaint san nicolas failed to file reports for two trades according to the complaint one in 2019 for a call option in yamana gold and one in 2020 for livent stock valued between 15 000 and 52 370 scott did not disclose four stock transactions in 2020 worth between approximately 4 004 and 60 000 these were purchases for air products and chemicals carlisle cos linde plc and rpm international according to the complaint suozzi failed to disclose about 300 transactions from 2017 to 2020 according to the campaign legal center complaint with a value of 3 2 million to 11 million this included roughly 64 transactions in 2017 valued between 456 064 and 1 868 000 31 transactions in 2018 valued between 528 031 and 1 445 00 104 transactions in 2019 worth 1 1 million and 3 8 million and 104 in 2020 worth between 1 1 million and 4 million he disclosed the trades on annual disclosures but did not file ptrs williams did not file ptrs for three stock sales in 2019 the complaintlists sales of three assets by a spouse in 2019 general electric nvidia and the walt disney co worth a total value of approximately 3 003 to 45 000 npr reached out to all seven members for a response to the complaints in a written statement to npr gooden dismissed the complaint saying there were no transactions above the reporting threshold for ptrs which is why none were filed i would encourage anyone filing frivolous ethics complaints to consult page 41 of the 2020 financial disclosure guide regarding the rule on ptrs christine ravold a spokeswoman for davidson told npr that the ptr was filed but an error on the house clerk s website failed to publish it so it was visible to the public npr contacted the clerk s office ravold shared a copy of the form that includes a digital signature from march 25 2021 and maintained the congressman is in full compliance and places a premium on transparency and accountability and in an email response a spokesperson for axne said that the congresswoman does not personally manage or execute trades and that she has submitted all required disclosures during her time in office if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law the story will be updated with any additional responses questions about enforcement remain in early 2020 ptr disclosures revealed investment activityby several senators followed briefings on the pandemic before the markets collapsed and the emerging public health threat the senators investment actions came under intense scrutiny the justice department reviewed allegations of insider trading butclosed the cases without any charges democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york who was an attorney before entering public office helped write the stock act she points to the justice department investigations as proof the law is working we ve had several examples where members of congress bought or sold stocks that pertain to their work and there actually were follow up investigations to see whether or not they bought or sold those stocks based on nonpublic inside information gillibrand told npr she maintains that the authority the statute gave the justice department to prosecute members is the primary method to ensure the law is working she said the ethics committees have oversight roles but the purpose of the stock act was to make it very clear that these are criminal violations democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon who voted for the 2012 law is blunt about how it s working now the stock act is pretty much useless merkley told npr he said he believes the major issue is enforcement it s extremely difficult to know when a person in congress has traded stocks because of information they heard publicly versus information that they ve heard privately it s not just lack of enforcement when it comes to information lawmakers may gain one republican member told npr that at an ethics training an incoming member inquired how to avoid filing ptrs and was advised to keep all trades under 1 000 before the campaign legal center filed its latest complaints the group had already lodged about a half dozen other complaints to the ethics committees about possible violations of the stock act in the senate the organization pressed the ethics committee in august to look into gop sen rand paul of kentucky who reported his wife s purchase of pharmaceutical stock for a manufacturer of an antiviral drug over a year later this drug was later approved to treat covid 19 paul noted that his wife lost money on the trade and that it was an oversight the form was not filed on time the campaign legal center also filed a complaint against republican sen tommy tuberville of alabama over improper disclosure over 100 transactions tuberville said he was unaware of the late reports but submitted the information at least 15 members from the house and senate have not complied with the requirement to disclose their stock trades but we are not aware of any fines that the ethics committees have required these members to pay the campaign legal center s payne said the ethics panels can launch their own reviews but so far no lawmaker in the house or senate has faced any formal sanction related to the stock act and while they may get fined those fines are not made public payne worries the scrutiny following the senators investments after the pandemic briefing appears to have given some members pause about filing forms on time right now it seems to be a trend that members just wait until the end of the year file the report and completely ignore the stock act so they are circumventing this rule and doing it without any consequence instead it s fallen to watchdog groups such as payne s or media outlets such as business insider to bring violations to light insider found republican rep blake moore of utahfiled late he said that was an oversight and npr confirmed he has paid a fine the news sitealso has reported on others including democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey who transferred his assets to a blind trust after he faced questions about not reporting dozens of trades npr learned malinowski paid a 200 fine proposal to ban lawmakers from trading stocks drew angerer getty images getty images sen jeff merkley d ore thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley told npr dryly merkley said he thinks it s time to ban all lawmakers from trading individual stocks altogether it is a huge conflict of interest for someone to be trading in say pharmaceutical stocks at the same time as making policy for pharmaceutical companies he said he has introduced a bill that would require members to divest within six months of taking office and limit investments to mutual funds it is not a popular topic among my colleagues merkley said dryly he said without a change members keep themselves open to new allegations i can guarantee you that every year there ll be a scandal related to stock trading he has support from some of his democratic colleagues in the senate including gillibrand but she also said there s a need for a stock act 2 0 to look at all the different ways members may benefit financially from their work one new development she flagged is that lawmakers received small business loans from the covid 19 relief bills there were several examples of members of congress who were first in line to get those payouts gillibrand said that is not what the american public would expect members of congress to be doing and she said she thinks transparency regarding investments needs to go beyond capitol hill gillibrand said she has deep concerns about the judiciary and the supreme court she noted that justices are allowed to take privately funded trips paid for by people who have interests before the court congress created the stock act to ensure transparency but if nothing changes and more lawmakers keep failing to report their investments it will be tough for the public to know whether the people they elected are making decisions to benefit their constituents or themselves

menafn globenewswire nasdaq exploration results from drilling completed during the first half of 2021 identified three new deposits for a total of seven deposits at copper world confirmed the size and quality of the previously discovered copper world broad top butte peach and elgin deposits expanded hudbay s private land package to support an operation entirely on private land drill hole 186 intersected 263 feet of 1 11 copper starting from surface drill hole 190 intersected 205 feet of 1 39 copper starting from surface drill hole 191 intersected 404 feet of 1 50 copper starting from surface drill hole 139 intersected 125 feet of 1 34 copper drill hole 177 intersected 121 feet of 1 32 copper drill hole 118 intersected 160 feet of 1 15 copper toronto sept 22 2021 globe newswire hudbay minerals inc hudbay or the company tsx nyse hbm today announced the intersection of additional high grade copper sulphide and oxide mineralization at its copper world project located on wholly owned private land in arizona the copper world project is located within seven kilometres of hudbay s rosemont copper project and has mineralization located closer to surface than rosemont the results are from drilling completed between january and june 2021 following an initial program conducted in 2020 to confirm historical drilling in this past producing copper region the 2021 drilling has identified three new deposits for a total of seven deposits at copper world covering a combined seven kilometers with mineralized occurrences our 2021 drill program at copper world proved that the previously discovered deposits remained open along strike and we are highly encouraged by the identification of three new deposits in the area said peter kukielski hudbay s president and chief executive officer copper world is growing into an attractive copper development project in our organic pipeline and we remain on track for an initial inferred resource estimate before the end of the year and a preliminary economic assessment in the first half of 2022 located on expanded private land package the copper world deposits are located on private land parcels adjacent to the rosemont deposit as shown in the plan view in figure 1 to date seven deposits have been identified with a combined strike length of over seven kilometres representing a significant increase in mineralization compared to the results from the 2020 program hudbay recently increased its private land package to approximately 2 400 acres in the west which together with patented mining claims now totals approximately 4 500 acres to support an operation entirely on private land please refer to figure 2 the mineralization continues to occur at depths shallower than at rosemont as shown in figure 3 indicating the possibility of lower strip ratios at copper world hudbay is also drilling a 1 500 foot area along strike where there has been no previous drilling coverage between the newly discovered bolsa deposit and the rosemont deposit an updated three dimensional visualization of the copper world drill results can be found at the link below this visual shows the location of the seven deposits the drill holes from 2020 and 2021 the historical mine sites and historical drilling coverage the results of which are under review and will be reported once the data is validated by hudbay in accordance with ni 43 101 as well as new geophysical targets identified from the 2021 winter ground surveys 2021 drill program discovers three new deposits and confirms the size and quality of existing deposits hudbay s 2021 drill program has consisted of condemnation exploration and confirmation drilling over the company s patented private land claims at copper world as of june 30 2021 approximately 166 holes were completed totaling over 91 000 feet of drilling as of august 31 2021 hudbay has received and validated the assay results for 130 of these holes and the results continue to exceed the company s expectations the program resulted in the discovery of three new deposits including significant volumes of high grade copper sulphide and oxide mineralization starting in most cases near surface or at shallow depth these three new deposits are called bolsa south limb and north limb the program also confirmed and increased the confidence in the size and quality of the copper world broad top butte peach and elgin deposits bolsa deposit drill hole 186 intersected 263 feet of 1 11 copper starting at surface drill hole 190 intersected 205 feet of 1 39 copper starting at surface drill hole 191 intersected 404 feet of 1 50 copper starting at surface the 2021 drilling completed to date resulted in the discovery of the bolsa deposit located between the broad top butte and rosemont deposits the results confirmed the occurrence of significant shallow copper oxide and sulphide mineralization this mineralization occurs in the footwall zone of the lower paleozoic sequence composed of skarn in limestone and quartzite which is also found at rosemont where this footwall zone hosts approximately 10 of the rosemont mineral resource a significant portion of the copper oxide mineralization in this zone occurs in rocks with lower carbonate content than is typical at rosemont and is expected to be recoverable by proven low cost leaching technology drill holes 186 190 and 191 intersected very high grade copper zones starting from surface with grades above 1 0 please refer to figure 4 for a visual of the bolsa deposit and select drill core there also remains the potential for continuity between the bolsa discovery and the rosemont deposit as highlighted by three new holes drilled on the western edge of rosemont which intersected high grade copper mineralization similar to the mineralization intersected at bolsa drill hole 177 intersected 833 feet of 0 40 copper including 121 feet at 1 32 copper similarly hole 194 intersected 602 feet at 0 53 copper as shown in figure 5 there remains a 1 500 foot gap in drilling coverage between these three holes and the bolsa discovery and hudbay is actively developing additional access roads and drill pads to test this unexplored area south north limb deposits drill hole 72 intersected 105 feet of 0 69 copper drill hole 132 intersected 77 feet of 0 88 copper drill hole 139 intersected 125 feet of 1 34 copper one focus of the 2021 drill program was to test an area between the elgin and copper world deposits surrounding a porphyry intrusive where several small mines operated in the past but for which no historical drill results were available hudbay s drill program intersected two new mineralized areas called the south and north limbs each occurring at or near surface in skarn at the contact between the porphyry intrusive and limestone units similar to the ones found elsewhere on the property please refer to figure 6 for visuals of the deposits and drill core broad top butte deposit drill hole 117 intersected 751 feet of 0 60 copper starting at surface including 450 feet of 0 72 copper drill hole 195 intersected 630 feet of 0 48 copper including 220 feet of 0 77 copper starting at surface the 2021 drilling at broad top butte continued to intersect significant shallow copper oxide and sulphide mineralization in a quartz monzonite porphyry intrusive and in surrounding skarns at the contact with carbonate units in a similar geological setting as rosemont drill hole 195 intersected 630 feet of 0 48 copper starting at surface including 220 feet of 0 77 copper in a massive sulphide zone with chalcopyrite and bornite in skarn please refer to figure 7 for a visual of the deposit and select drill core copper world deposit drill hole 70 intersected 270 feet of 0 69 copper including 145 feet of 1 0 copper starting at surface drill hole 73 intersected 230 feet of 0 62 copper including 115 feet of 0 94 copper drill hole 118 intersected 290 feet of 0 75 copper including 160 feet of 1 15 copper the 2021 drilling at the copper world deposit confirmed the results from the previous program copper oxide mineralization continued to be found in the upper portion of the mineralized zones in the hanging wall of a regional fault that runs along the west side of the rosemont bolsa and broad top butte deposits known as the backbone fault drill hole 73 intersected 230 feet of 0 62 copper with 77 of the copper in oxides this intersection included 115 feet of 0 94 copper with 76 of the copper in oxides a visual can be found in figure 8 the ongoing drill program includes some additional isolated intercepts that have not yet been incorporated into the interpretation of the known deposits for example drill hole 106 is located near the old leader mine and intersected 91 feet at 1 50 copper which indicates a separate zone exists in the footwall of the backbone fault field mapping confirmed the potential extension of this mineralization to the southeast in a trend parallel to the copper world deposit figure 9 shows the historical underground workings at the leader mine and the location of hole 106 geophysical surveys have also identified several new targets north and south of copper world a large portion of hudbay s property in this prolific region has yet to be explored and provides the potential for further discoveries peach and elgin deposits drill hole 76 intersected 130 feet of 0 87 copper drill hole 86 intersected 295 feet of 0 53 copper starting at surface at the peach and elgin deposits the 2021 drilling confirmed shallow mineralization at or near surface and slightly extended the known mineralization to the east drill hole 76 intersected 130 feet of 0 87 copper and hole 86 intersected 295 feet of 0 53 copper from surface on track to deliver upcoming catalysts at copper world given the continued positive results from the exploration program at copper world the 2021 drill program was expanded from an original 70 000 feet of drilling to over 200 000 feet to be completed by the end of the year with four drill rigs continuing to operate at site the company is testing the opportunity to use reverse circulation drilling to fast track future infill drilling programs this drilling is intended to delineate and upgrade the resource for the seven deposits while focusing on bridging the gap between the bolsa discovery and the area west of the rosemont deposit the drill program will also continue to explore prospective areas outside of the known deposits hudbay expects to publish an initial inferred mineral resource estimate for the seven deposits at copper world before the end of 2021 these mineral resource estimates will form the basis for a preliminary economic assessment pea expected to be released in the first half of 2022 mineralogical studies and metallurgical testing programs are underway and the preliminary results are expected to be incorporated into the pea the company continues to progress geotechnical and hydrogeological studies over the copper world area the exploration budget for copper world in 2021 is expected to total approximately 34 million which increased from the original 10 million budget to fund the larger drill program and complete the various technical studies hudbay will also continue to examine future potential synergies with an operation at rosemont

father of the actor director mario van peebles died tuesday evening at his home in manhattan dad knew that black images matter if a picture is worth a thousand words what was a movie worth mario van peebles said in a statement wednesday we want to be the success we see thus we need to see ourselves being free true liberation did not mean imitating the colonizer s mentality it meant appreciating the power beauty and interconnectivity of all people sometimes called the godfather of modern black cinema the multitalented van peebles wrote numerous books and plays and recorded several albums playing multiple instruments and delivering rap style lyrics he later became a successful options trader on the stock market but he was best known for sweet sweetback s baadasssss song one of the most influential movies of its time the low budget art house film which he wrote produced directed starred in and scored was the frenzied hyper sexual and violent tale of a black street hustler on the run from police after killing white officers who were beating a black revolutionary with its hard living tough talking depiction of life in the ghetto underscored by a message of empowerment as told from a black perspective it set the tone for a genre that turned out dozens of films over the next few years and prompted a debate over whether black people were being recognized or exploited all the films about black people up to now have been told through the eyes of the anglo saxon majority in their rhythms and speech and pace van peebles told newsweek in 1971 the year of the film s release i could have called it the ballad of the indomitable sweetback but i wanted the core audience the target audience to know it s for them he told the associated press in 2003 so i said ba ad asssss like you really say it made for around 500 000 including 50 000 provided by bill cosby it grossed 14 million at the box office despite an x rating limited distribution and mixed critical reviews the new york times for example accused van peebles of merchandizing injustice and called the film an outrage van peebles who complained fiercely to the motion picture association over the x rating gave the film the tagline rated x by an all white jury but in the wake of the its success hollywood realized an untapped audience and began churning out such box office hits as shaft and superfly that were also known for bringing in such top musicians as curtis mayfield marvin gaye and isaac hayes to work on the soundtracks many of hollywood s versions were exaggerated crime dramas replete with pimps and drug dealers which drew heavy criticism in both the white and black press what hollywood did they suppressed the political message added caricature and blaxploitation was born van peebles said in 2002 the colored intelligentsia were not too happy about it in fact civil rights groups like the naacp and the congress of racial equality coined the phrase blaxploitation and formed the coalition against blaxploitation among the genre s 21st century fans was quentin tarantino whose oscar winning django unchained was openly influenced by blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns on wednesday a younger generation of black filmmakers mourned van peebles death barry jenkins the moonlight director said on twitter he made the most of every second of every single damn frame after his initial success van peebles was bombarded with directing offers but he chose to maintain his independence i ll only work with them on my terms he said i ve whipped the man s ass on his own turf i m number one at the box office which is the way america measures things and i did it on my own now they want me but i m in no hurry van peebles then got involved on broadway writing and producing several plays and
