the country was cheerful when the central bank of nigeria cbn announced it would be piloting its version of the central bank digital currency cbdc on 1 october 2021 surprisingly the apex bank decided to skip the pilot scheme to launch the enaira on 25 october 2021 fully for the country that will host the headquarters of the african central bank when the common currency in africa materialises this is a monumental feat research shows that global central banks are taking their time to study the cbdc before they fully launch it for example the people s bank of china has been working on a digital currency since 2014 but is yet to launch fully in july 2021 the european central bank ecb confirmed that it will begin a two year study of the digital euro with sights set on a 2026 launch between 2014 and 2018 ecuador operated its digital currency for before its parliament voted to abolish it worryingly the hasty decision to launch the enaira feels like the cold war s race to the moon the decision by the cbn governor is either very rash or under orders from an external force on balance and it is a close thing i think it is the latter of course we all tend to be wiser after an event image the race to the moon was about proving which country is applying the knowledge of their best scientists and technology given the country s economic position one struggles to see the rationale if any country were supposed to rush to launch a cbdc it would have been the u s for fear of chinese dominance there is an argument that the e cny could overthrow the u s dollar s primacy as the global reserve currency and destabilise its financial dominance notably the u s federal reserve fed is the furthest behind in developing a cbdc amongst the four largest central banks i e the fed ecb boe and bank of japan in the world traditionally monumental innovations tend to get endorsements from the national assembly surprisingly the presidency did not send the enaira proposal to the house of assembly for advice and due process it was surprising to see a lack of public engagement before launching the enaira even in quasi authoritarian settings like china saudi arabia and russia public engagement is held for the cbdc at the announcement the cbn governor only thanked the minister of digital economy it was strange what about the minister of finance a global example within the digital currency context will classify nigeria s case as an anomaly currently in the u k the bank of england is collaborating with their ministry of finance h m treasury to explore the potential of a cbdc they plan to engage widely with stakeholders to introduce a digital currency s benefits risks and practicalities a committee is already taking evidence on the central issues it will examine how a cbdc might affect the bank s role monetary policy and the financial sector this practice is the same across developed and developing economies let s compare with previous cbn events without judging anyone by another s standards back in 2007 prof soludo had to present a proposal to redenominate the naira to the federal executive council and later the presidential committee led by the minister of finance he also engaged in several public discussions including a speech at the bank of international settlement at one point the national assembly requested his resignation and suggested he was going against the law for not engaging with them in 2011 sanusi lamido had to appear before the senate to explain the rationale behind introducing islamic banking in nigeria it is also not new for the current governor to present a policy before the national assembly the last one was in february to justify why they banned cryptocurrency without any exaggeration previous national assembly leaders would have invited the cbn governor by now the public remains optimistic that an invitation is on its way as there is no reason to think the intelligence and leadership standards in the national assembly has gone down over the years the public will be interested in hearing answers on not just why the launching of the enaira was rushed although that too like all innovations rigorous investigations are conducted to understand what is being proposed for the cbdc the process starts from researching to developing to piloting before a full launch cbn achieved this feat by skipping all the stages that is why nigeria is only one of the seven countries to launch a central bank digital currency cbdc others are the bahamas st kitts and nevis antigua and barbuda st lucia st vincent and the grenadines and grenada these countries will not compare with nigeria s economy population education market etc together with the seven countries above there are eighty seven economies in the world researching developing or piloting a version of cbdc according to the american think tank atlantic council seventeen countries are at the pilot stage these include countries like china malaysia south africa and saudi arabia the central banks of canada turkey russia and japan are among the 15 countries at the development stage the 39 economies at the research stage include the u s u k e u india ghana and kenya china is currently issuing 200 digital yuan e cny to randomly selected citizens in its pilot scheme at the same time senegal had abandoned its quest after a trial the monetary authority of singapore and the ecb also announced that they engaged in a successful cross border payment and settlement experiment through the sole use of cbdc many more economies engage in cross border payment tests such as partnerships between south africa singapore malaysia and australia the countries piloting and researching cbdc are aware that careful considerations are required to mitigate all challenges for example new research shows the existing regulations are not updated to deal with the new forms of money thus rules need to be made more robust before adopting this technology unlike the informed economies the cbn did not see this as a challenge still the public hopes the national assembly will appraising the enaira it is designed to coexist with the naira but only in a digital form the enaira requires a wallet a digital storage that holds the enaira opening a wallet requires vital personal information like name date of birth e mail address bank account and bank verification number bvn bank customers can move money from their bank account to their enaira wallet they can monitor their enaira wallet check balances and view transaction history they can make in store payments using their enaira wallet by scanning q r codes and can send money to one another through a linked bank account or card technically the enaira account is similar to the conventional bank account system in which the cbn guarantees the deposits if appropriately designed the enaira could bring much good for the digital economy the enaira can be a powerful tool to address an economic recession the cbn could charge a lower or negative interest rate on these accounts making saving money less attractive the accounts could be used to distribute cash to citizens like the trader money allocated around the country that is similar to the chinese government s pilot scheme where an expiry date to spend the digital currency is given unlike the chinese economy there is a lack of clarity on how the enaira will include the estimated 40 million unbanked adults customers know that enaira is fundamentally safer than the regular cash in a commercial bank since it is deposited in the nation s central bank if the cbn allows customers to convert a lot of cash to enaira it could trigger a run on commercial banks potentially commercial banks customers could move their deposits to enaira which will kill off commercial banks business models conventional banks are modelled to take a stable depositor base leverage it and extend loans into the real economy if deposit the base shrinks and becomes less stable lending will reduce given the scenario above there is an issue whether the cbn will provide all the lending in the economy the cbn could convert the enaira deposits that left commercial bank accounts and then lend them back to the bank that way the cbn has become a lender of first resort instead of a lender of last resort for this to happen several risk analyses will have to be done to determine which banks they should give how many deposits again the central bank does not want to get involved in that business another worry about using the enaira is that consumers and fintech firms expecting cheaper services might not get it tech services are affordable for customers due to the high number of suppliers in the market the cbn s enaira will remove that competition it will essentially be a monopsony and the bank will be required to break even the enaira benefits are designed to enhance anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing efforts through blockchain or other distributed ledger technology however two days after the launch the cbn alerted the public to be careful of fake enaira social media accounts attempting to defraud trick users without new standards and careful coordination nigeria s financial system may face momentous interoperability problems in the future the existing cbn act of 2007 does not include many aspects of financial technology fintech the risk of cybersecurity and lack of privacy worry users as the government centralises the system currently software developers have pointed out privacy issues and loopholes for money laundering with the speed wallet financial institutions are unclear how the cbn plans to inject the newly created money in the stock wallet by every user knowing that asset swaps will be involved some clarity about the degree of collateralisation would be good the technical issues with enaira can cause reputational risk technology may be exposed to glitches cyber attacks or human error reflecting poorly on the central bank central banks worldwide will be closely watching how things progress with the enaira dr nasir aminu is a senior lecturer in economics at cardiff metropolitan university

supporters of fossil fuels in australia s media and political classes have been gleefully echoing greta thunberg s claims that the glasgow climate summit has been a failure yet both european and american politicians have been busily working on other plans to discipline climate change bludgers these involve measures such as taxing carbon intensive goods imported from countries without equivalent emission control policies and also choking off finance to high polluting industries the morrison government s recently released long term emissions reduction plan claims that it will protect us from such actions stating the plan will ensure australian exporters are not targeted by trade action and australian businesses do not face cost of capital premiums while scott morrison might be able to fool voters there is little chance the us and european governments will fail to notice this is a plan to freeload off their hard work the government has been busily rearranging and rebadging funding to the clean energy finance corporation and the renewable energy agency like its announcement on wednesday but foreign climate policy observers know this is largely just a shuffling around of old money allocated to these institutions by the gillard labor government given what this liberal national government has claimed in the past it would be political suicide for them to acknowledge we should implement a carbon price still there is a five step plan open to morrison where he could still claim their climate policy was all about technology not taxes while also restoring australia s reputation as a lifter rather than a leaner 1 accept the court verdict that the environment minister has a duty of care to prevent harm to children it might stagger you to hear about a judge s finding that australia s environment minister should seek to protect australia s children from harm this case brought by eight children argued that the environment minister should consider the potential harm new projects such as coalmines could have on children by exacerbating climate change before granting an approval under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act instead of arguing the indefensible the government could amend the act to require all major carbon emitting facilities install best available technology for containing carbon emissions within 10 years 2 require landlords to meet minimum standards for rental property thermal comfort and energy efficiency to be eligible for tax concessions the poor level of thermal comfort and energy efficiency of australia s rental housing stock is a national disgrace renters energy bills could be cut in half while reducing emissions and improving people s health by requiring landlords to ensure their rental homes meet basic standards of energy efficiency this could be met through straightforward upgrades like better insulation efficient heating and cooling via reverse cycle air conditioners efficient water heaters and solar power landlords receive large tax concessions which multiple economists have pointed out hinder economic growth while doing little to help renters why can t we at least ask that in return landlords provide housing with reasonable levels of comfort for tenants with affordable energy costs to completely remove any financial and political sting from such a reform the clean energy finance corporation could provide finance at a concessional interest rate for such upgrades 3 amend the existing solar support scheme to drive uptake of batteries australia leads the world in the uptake of solar systems at the household level around a quarter of dwellings nationally have a solar system however within the next few years we ll reach the point where increasing amounts of solar generation will be spilled and wasted during midday hours because it exceeds overall power demand and its market value will be very low yet once the sun goes down over the hours of 4pm until 8pm more expensive gas fired generators push the price up dramatically to flatten prices in the evening and fully exploit the potential of solar the government needs to amend the solar support scheme known as the small scale renewable energy scheme to encourage the uptake of batteries the level of government support provided to solar systems has been structured to decline over time and will be completely phased out after 2030 the rebate is now a quarter of what was provided per kilowatt 10 years ago and a third less than what it was five years ago to drive significant uptake of batteries all the government needs to do is restore the solar rebate back to 2016 levels if the household also installs a battery meanwhile the rebate provided to those that install solar only will continue to decline enhancing the incentive over time to couple batteries with a solar system green energy markets estimates that such a reform has the potential to drive the installation of as much as 10 000mw of home battery capacity by 2030 equal in size to five liddell coal fired power stations 4 follow california s lead on vehicle emission standards morrison s claim at the last federal election that labor s target to increase electric vehicle sales would steal the weekend is looking more and more ridiculous as each day passes he has since tried to cover up for this embarrassing claim via a future fuels strategy unfortunately within hours of its release the electric vehicle council labelled it a fizzer that left australia as a dumping ground for the world s dirtiest vehicles morrison could make an about face explained away by a change in policy in california for many decades california has been allowed to impose its own emission standards on motor vehicles that go beyond those regulated on a national basis in the us in addition a further 14 states within the us choose to impose the californian standard instead of the federal government s standard all up these states represent over a third of the us motor vehicle market this is a market that by 2035 will only allow the sale of zero emission passenger cars by announcing australia will follow the californian standard morrison can claim he is merely responding to changing circumstances that have made electric vehicles a vastly more practical and affordable option for australians at the same time he will ensure australian consumers aren t saddled with obsolete oil fuelled cars which by around 2035 will become increasingly expensive and difficult to service and fuel 5 implement a green gas target both the morrison government and the oil and gas industry among others are claiming hydrogen will be a miracle cure to our emission problems while it s theoretically possible that it could provide weather independent energy at large scale and affordable cost a heck of a lot of improvement is required in order fulfil its potential feasibility studies and pilot hubs won t deliver this improvement if there s anything we ve learnt about effective climate policy in the past 20 years it s that to get the cost of low carbon technologies down we need to deploy them in the field and steadily build up manufacturing scale so if industry and government are genuinely serious about delivering affordable hydrogen at scale they should be willing to back it with a legislated target that would steadily grow the amount of hydrogen we use according to the gas industry it is possible to blend hydrogen into the existing gas supply infrastructure at levels as high as 10 without significant modification to existing equipment if this is accurate then this is what suppliers should be required to deliver by 2030

stamp on products ranging from jet engines to lightbulbs kitchen appliances to x ray machines the conglomerate which traces its lineage back to thomas edison was once the pinnacle of business success renowned for its steady returns corporate prowess and relentless pursuit of growth but ge s expansive reach has come to haunt it in recent years as it struggled to slim its business operations and pay

advertisement but ge has fallen out of favor with investors and struggled to evolve as the nation s tech giants have taken up the mantle of innovation apple microsoft alphabet and amazon whose products have become integral to the fabric of modern american life claim market capitalizations in the trillions meanwhile ge has been eroded by years of debt badly timed acquisitions and underperforming operations it now claims a market value of about 122 billion dan ives managing director at wedbush securities said that wall street sees the breakup as long overdue traditional stalwarts like ge gm ibm have all had to adjust with the times as these us companies looked in the mirror and saw the lagging growth and lack of corporate efficiency ives told the washington post tuesday in an email it s another chapter in the long storied history of ge and a sign of the times in this new digital world at its height ge was synonymous with innovation and corporate exceptionalism jack welch its bigger than life leader slashed head counts and grew the company aggressively through acquisitions according to fortune ge was worth 14 billion when welch took over in 1981 and more than 400 billion when he stepped down about 20 years later he came to personify corporate power in an era where executives were admired for being laser focused on profits rather than scrutinized for the social cost of their businesses the financial times called him the father of the shareholder value movement and fortune named him manager of the century in 1999 one of his mottos was face reality advertisement in 2001 the reins were handed over to jeffrey r immelt who overhauled much of what welch built and had to contend with enormous losses related to the company s power and financial services operations under immelt s 16 year run ge shares lost more than a quarter of their value by the time culp took over in 2018 ge had already spun off its home appliances plastics and financial services businesses the move to further break down the company is reflective of culp s ongoing strategic focus wayne wicker chief investment officer at missionsquare retirement he continues to focus on ways to simplify the complex set of businesses he inherited and this move appears to provide a way for investors to value each of these business units on a standalone basis wicker told the

by rachel metz cnn business in february zillow appeared so confident in its ability to use artificial intelligence to estimate the value of homes that it announced a new option for certain homes its so called zestimate would also represent an initial cash offer from the company to purchase the property the move touted by a company exec at the time as an exciting advancement was intended to streamline the process for homeowners considering selling to zillow as part of its home flipping business zillow promoted this option as a way to make it convenient to sell a home while minimizing interactions with others during the pandemic just eight months later however the company is shutting down that business zillow offers entirely the decision announced last week marks a stunning defeat for zillow the real estate listing company took a 304 million inventory write down in the third quarter which it blamed on having recently purchased homes for prices that are higher than it thinks it can sell them the company saw its stock plunge and it now plans to cut 2 000 jobs or 25 of its staff the fallout from this business venture doesn t just point to the challenges in buying and selling homes for profit however it also highlights how hard it is to use ai to help make expensive real world decisions particularly in an ever changing market that can be hard to predict months or even weeks out and with prices that can be based as much on feel as on clear data points zillow ceo and cofounder rich barton explained the shuttering of zillow offers by citing unpredictability in forecasting home prices that far exceeds what the company had expected the ibuyer model used by zillow and other other real estate companies entails purchasing homes directly from sellers and then re listing them after doing minor work for zillow one of the first steps in its decision to purchase any home is the zestimate a machine learning assisted estimate of a home s market value that is calculated by taking into account oodles of data about the property gathered from sources including tax and property records homeowner submitted details such as the addition of a bathroom or bedroom and pictures of the house rival platforms such as redfin have their own estimates that take similar data into account the zestimate facts you provided and comparable homes nearby are used to calculate an estimated sale price zillow explained on its zillow offers webpage to homeowners who may be interested in selling their property to the company the page now notes the company is winding down the service and isn t making new offers on homes after that estimate the page explained zillow conducts an in person evaluation of a property determines the amount it deems necessary for repairs before it could resell the house and then makes a final offer zillow has bought tens of thousands of homes since the launch of zillow offers but has sold many fewer than it snapped up according to its quarterly results it purchased 27 000 homes from april 2018 through september 2021 and sold nearly 17 000 zillow declined a request for an interview with krishna rao the company s vice president of analytics in a statement zillow spokesperson viet shelton told cnn business the company used the zestimate for zillow offers the same way we encourage the public to use it as a starting point the challenge we faced in zillow offers was the ability to accurately forecast the future price of inventory three to six months out in a market where there were larger and more rapid changes in home values than ever before shelton said indeed since zillow entered the home flipping business in 2018 real estate markets have changed in wildly unpredictable ways the pandemic led to a temporary housing market freeze followed by a supply and demand imbalance that caused an unprecedented rise in home prices this may only have complicated the company s decision to include the zestimate which zillow points out is not an appraisal but a computer generated estimate of the value of the home today given the available data as part of the zillow offers process in more than 20 cities artificial intelligence can look at far more information far more quickly than a single human could when considering a fair price for a home weighing factors like comparable home sales in an area how many people are looking in a specific neighborhood and so on still you can have a real estate agent look at a house and in one second pick out one critical factor of the valuation that just doesn t exist as ones and zeroes in any database said mike delprete a real estate technology strategist and scholar in residence at the university of colorado boulder a key part of zillow the zestimate has been a key part of zillow s brand since the company first launched its website in 2006 the term is featured prominently on millions of zillow s home listings it s trademarked by the company and it s mentioned 61 times in its ipo paperwork from 2011 three times a week we create more than 500 000 unique valuation models built atop 3 2 terabytes of data to generate current zestimates on more than 70 million us homes the company wrote in a securities filing in 2011 more than 10 years later the company publishes zestimates for more than 100 million us homes if you re looking up homes on zillow s website or app the zestimate is featured prominently in each listing whether the home is for sale or not if the house is currently for sale a red dot is shown next to the words house for sale and the zestimate if it s available for that home will appear on the same line though the company points out that the zestimate is not a home appraisal the feature s accuracy has been called into question over the years for example it became the subject of a lawsuit brought by homeowners in 2017 that suit was dismissed zillow has spent years improving the zestimate going so far as to run a multi year data science competition to improve the accuracy of the algorithm behind it the company awarded a three person team the 1 million prize in early 2019 the zestimate currently has a median error rate of 1 9 for homes that are on the market shelton said meaning zillow s estimates for half the homes on the market come within 1 9 of the actual selling price that percentage of error is much higher 6 9 according to shelton for off market homes being off by as little as 1 9 on a property with a zestimate of 500 000 is still nearly 10 000 that figure multiplies over many many homes in different cities across the united states an art not just a science it s one thing to build a model on a website that s often reasonably accurate it s another to then try to use that model in the real world to make very costly bets and do so at scale according to nima shahbazi a member of the team that won the zestimate algorithm competition and ceo of mindle ai which helps companies use ai to make predictions for instance if any homes zillow purchased had hidden problems such as a missed crack in the foundation the zestimate would not be able to predict those issues he said there are many different parts between a very decent model and deploying the model into production that can go wrong he said zillow was using the zestimate to help it make purchasing decisions for homes it hoped to make a profit off of over time but nikhil malik an assistant professor of marketing at the university of southern california said algorithms tend to be good at making fine grained short term predictions such as for predicting stock prices a second in advance but there simply isn t enough data for an algorithm to learn about longer busts and booms according to malik who researches algorithmic pricing and has studied the zestimate in particular there are also many unquantifiable aspects of putting a price tag on a home delprete noted such as the value of living in the same neighborhood you grew up in or down the street from your parents these can vary from person to person which makes it even harder to outsource a home valuation process to a computer it s a good tool for what it is delprete said of the zestimate but it s a mistake to think it can be used to accurately predict house prices now or in the future he sees it as almost a toy meant more for piquing your curiosity when looking up your home or your neighbor s home online if you want to do ibuying and you re going to make thousands of offers every day you have to be really good at valuing homes not only today but three to six months in the future he said and that s an art and a science cnn s anna bahney contributed to this report the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

rapper s rowdy past raises red flags in astroworld lawsuits jamaal ellis houston chronicle via ap lawsuits are piling up less than a week after the deadly crowd crush at the astroworld concert and legal experts say the risk of liability is mounting for rapper travis scott and the companies behind the tragic event in houston several legal experts told the associated press that scott s past incitement of concertgoers offers a history that could make it easier to pursue negligence claims against companies that planned and managed the show which killed eight people and left hundreds injured and although the investigations have just begun experts expect dozens more lawsuits seeking damages that could climb into hundreds of millions of dollars at the center of the legal maelstrom is scott a 30 year old rapper famous for whipping fans into a frenzy who has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges tied to stirring up crowds at previous concerts this put everyone on notice this is what has happened and there is no reason it can t happen again said john werner a lawyer in beaumont texas who is not involved in astroworld cases they know this is a situation that can get out of hand this tragedy was months if not years in the making wrote houston lawyer steve kherkher in a lawsuit demanding more than 1 million for a man trampled in the melee which he said was predictable and preventable given the rapper s history more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed so far against scott and several companies including entertainment giant live nation concert promoter scoremore a nonprofit managing the houston owned venue the complaints allege that organizers failed to take simple crowd control steps to staff properly and to act on early signs of trouble at the sold out concert at nrg park that attracted 50 000 fans the way the concert was set up planned organized and the way things were handled once there was a problem it boggles the mind lawyer tony buzbee said this week in announcing that he was suing on behalf of three dozen victims including 21 year old axel acosta who died buzbee s news conference played directly to the court of public opinion with the tone of an opening statement complete with slides and video clips he and other attorneys have seized on an early clue of trouble that came hours before the concert began when throngs of fans rushed past security and metal detectors through a fence whatever security they had was wholly insufficient said former federal prosecutor philip hilder a houston lawyer not involved in any astroworld case the crowd went right through hilder also criticized the event s 56 page planning document which was submitted to the city for approval he said the plans were boilerplate with too few details about the safety of the parking lot where the performance was held which had no seating or aisles and no pens to contain the crowds the planning document obtained by the associated press and shared with hilder mentions the possibility of tornadoes bomb threats active shooters civil disobedience and riots but makes no mention of a possible crowd surge several lawyers say litigation is also likely to focus on an unexplained delay between the time city officials declared a mass casualty event and when the concert organizers finally stopped the show a 37 minute gap during which fans kept pushing toward the stage collapsing and getting crushed the band kept going on and on long after the problem existed said frank branson a personal injury lawyer in dallas it s hard to believe that wasn t a conscious disregard to the audience to safety and welfare it s not clear what scott could see from the stage as his fans were getting pushed punched pinned and trampled some screaming out to stop the show on video posted to social media scott is seen at one point stopping the music pointing into the audience and asking for aid for someone security somebody help jump in real quick in an instagram post on saturday the rapper said he was devastated by the deaths and suggested he was unaware of the carnage below him anytime i can make out what s going on i stop the show and help them get the help they need he said i could just never imagine the severity of the situation representatives of scott did not respond to an email from the ap seeking comment on tuesday scott is famous for encouraging fans to ignore security and crowd surf and stage dive in the mosh pit below him a commercial for this year s astroworld event since removed from youtube shows fans breaking through barricades and storming the concert grounds at the 2019 event in 2015 chicago officials said scott encouraged fans at the lollapalooza music festival to vault security barricades the rapper was sentenced to one year of court supervision after pleading guilty to reckless conduct charges in 2017 scott was arrested after he encouraged fans to bypass security and rush the stage during a concert in arkansas leaving a security guard a police officer and several others injured scott faced several misdemeanor charges including inciting a riot he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid a fine scott is also being sued by a concertgoer who says he was partially paralyzed when he was pushed from a third floor balcony at a new york city concert in 2017 an incident the man says happened after scott encouraged people to jump dallas lawyer ellen presby said scott s past will help make a case against him but his likely defense will be to argue that he is just a performer who leaves the security details to other people which will make it more difficult to attach blame defense lawyers will argue what he does is hop on the stage and do his thing and it s all set up for him she said if she were defending him she added she would try to find facts that he was as surprised and horrified as everyone else houston attorney c j baker said a criminal filing against scott is possible given his past behavior but it would be a difficult case because it would have to establish intent not just carelessness you would need to show that he acted in a way that he sort of knew what was happening and acted that way anyway he said that is a much bigger much steeper hill to climb than the lawsuits houston lawyer joel androphy said most law firms are likely to focus on civil suits that pile on defendants with resources to pay out big damages aside from scott the biggest legal target is live nation a publicly traded company whose stock has soared as fans rush to more concerts and festivals now that many pandemic restrictions have been lifted the company has declined to comment on what went wrong but issued a statement monday that it is helping police with a criminal investigation and will address all legal matters at the appropriate time the company reported it held 4 6 billion in cash as of september its stock fell 1 tuesday afternoon after plunging more than 5 a day earlier suing houston and harris county for negligence would be difficult given that both enjoy broad protection under the doctrine of sovereign and government immunity but there are exceptions several lawyers said they re mostly protected but their conduct is going to be looked at with a critical eye said houston lawyer randy sorrels past president of the texas state bar association ___ condon reported from new york associated press writers juan lozano and robert bumsted in houston and gary hamilton in new york contributed to this report

it seemed like a cute way to show off your pet and help the environment a recent instagram sticker campaign promised a tree would be planted for each pet picture instagram users posted unsurprisingly the sticker rapidly went viral to date more than 4 million people have shared it but what was supposed to be an altruistic campaign to contribute to trees being planted simply by sharing pet pics belies something more sinister the account that created the sticker has a lengthy history of being accused of running instagram scams as the trees for pet pics sticker spread far and wide over the weekend people wondered who created it as it didn t link to or credit an account on monday the mystery was solved when plant a tree co claimed credit on instagram where it has 1 million followers it wrote a lighthearted post claiming that what was supposed to be a fun tree planting campaign where we can show off our awesome pets quickly got out of hand we immediately realized the post would grow too big and that we didn t have the resources to plant that many trees so we deleted it 10 minutes later plant a tree co wrote even after it deleted the post it said the sticker continued spreading it also said its credit for creating the sticker was removed due to an instagram bug but because it really does want to plant all those trees plant a tree co said it was launching a fundraiser to benefit the nonprofit trees for the future it noted that it s not affiliated with the nonprofit which trains farmers in sub saharan africa to create sustainable agroforestry systems called forest gardens the post urged people to share it and tag friends celebrities and instagram so they can see this and so we can actually plant 4 million trees this all sounds like a harmless mistake plant a tree co wouldn t be the first social media user to try to make a positive impact and have it spread far further than anticipated dig beneath the surface and the plot thickens however trees for the future the supposed beneficiary of the fundraiser says it has nothing to do with plant a tree co or the fundraiser trees for the future is not affiliated with plant a tree co a spokesperson told the daily dot via email when the fundraiser came to our attention we immediately reached out to the group asking them to clarify the nature of the fundraiser and we reported the post to instagram they added that trees for the future has planted nearly a quarter billion trees to date and its goal is to plant 1 billion trees by 2030 we re happy to report that we are on track to meet that goal it also bears mention that plant a tree co s instagram post for the so called fundraiser doesn t include a link to donate funds plant a tree co responded to the daily dot s inquiries but did not provide any information outside what was included in its instagram post explaining what had happened this isn t the first time plant a tree co has been the subject of controversy it s been accused of being a scam or faketivist operation for years exposing instagram scams first posted about the account in 2019 writing plantatreeco is fake as proof it pointed out that the account was unverified new offered no information about its partners or finances and said its website was thrown together within minutes and they are selling merchandise the picture of a tree is a random stock photo you can find by searching tree on google it added since then exposing instagram scams has endeavored to expose plant a tree co on multiple occasions last year it victoriously posted a screenshot purporting that instagram had suspended plant a tree co for violating its community guidelines the post didn t specify what guidelines plantatreeco will scam no more it wrote instagram didn t respond to the daily dot s request to confirm the suspension and question about what guidelines were violated the suspension didn t last however much to exposing instagram scams chagrin two months ago in what appears to be its coup de grâce exposing instagram scams posted a compilation of information about plant a tree co it accused the account of lying about being affiliated with a legitimate organization and not living up to its promises to plant trees plant a tree co s website claims to have planted 6 500 trees towards its goal of 1 million trees according to exposing instagram scams that s not true it says the company has been making the same claim for three years an internet archive of the website shows that plant a tree co has been claiming to have planted 6 500 trees for at least a year exposing instagram scams also said whoever s behind plant a tree co hasn t taken kindly to its efforts after having exposed them multiple times the owner of the account started digging for info on all sorts of accounts trying to disprove their statements myself included it wrote it said plant a tree co threatened to sue then blocked everyone who tried to expose them via instagram direct message exposing instagram scams told the daily dot they believe that plant a tree co bit off more than they could chew 50 000 people falling for their trick is manageable but 4 million will lead to some people batting an eye and that s why they re saying it was a mistake they constantly take advantage of instagram features to grow their online store and instagram account via tricking people into thinking they re donating making a difference but since it doesn t really happen it ends up doing more harm than good exposing instagram scams added like the pet photo sticker campaign plant a tree co s early posts vowed to plant trees based on engagement its core business however is selling necklaces well sort of in order to achieve our goal of planting 1 million trees we sell necklaces each necklace funds the planting of one tree its website says but the necklaces which it claims are valued at 29 95 are each on sale for zero dollars that s right they re free plus shipping the daily dot put in address information for locations on opposite coasts of the united states and each time shipping for the delicate lead tin alloy necklaces was calculated at 8 95 the shipping costs exposing instagram scams claims is how plant a tree co makes money it does not cost 8 dollars to ship something with virtually no production costs via two month snail mail it wrote two months ago it claims that plant a tree co whose necklace brand shares the name of an apparently unaffiliated jeweler in california makes 6 profit per necklace 1 of which it s supposed to donate to planting trees or other various causes the daily dot found google records in which the company promised to donate 1 for each necklace purchased to a nonprofit dedicated to elephants and one to combat hate crimes against asians fake website buster which says plant a tree co is a fake says it s claimed to raise funds for other environmental and social causes including australian bushfires and black lives matter plant a tree co claims its raised 500 000 total in charity funds social media is a powerful tool to raise awareness and funds for worthwhile causes it s an equally powerful means of taking advantage of people s desire to make a positive impact simply by sharing a cute picture of their pets this post has been updated to note that plant a tree co responded to the daily dot

summary i have anxiety i feel stress i am affected mentally that moment comes to my mind every day i always remember that day tirhas s not her real name 44 year old sexual violence survivor tigray march 16 2021 the armed conflict that began in november 2020 in the tigray region of ethiopia has involved numerous grave abuses committed by ethiopian and eritrean armed forces and regional amhara militias allied to the ethiopian army including massacres rape and other sexual violence against women and girls attacks on refugee camps and destruction of crops and civilian infrastructure including healthcare facilities and schools tigrayan militia forces have also committed serious abuses including sexual violence against eritrean refugees in the region and in the amhara region as the fighting has expanded the armed conflict has also been characterized by the ethiopian government s obstruction of humanitarian assistance in tigray which the united nations has characterized as a de facto blockade the government is unlawfully restricting and denying desperately needed food medical supplies and fuel to the population of tigray the government has imposed unpredictable bureaucratic obstacles for aid agencies to obtain visas and permissions for goods engaged in harassment attacks and expulsion of humanitarian workers and shut down basic services in the region including banking electricity and telecommunications since tigrayan forces retook control of most of the region in late june 2021 the ethiopian government has effectively besieged tigray raising concerns that it is using starvation as a weapon of war which is a violation of the ethiopian criminal code and a war crime under international humanitarian law play video read a text description of this video sexual violence was used as a weapon of war in tigray but the abuse didn t end there ethiopian forces and allies destroyed and pillaged health centers the ethiopian government blocked access to medical aid food and basic services sexual violence survivors need critical health care and psychosocial support ethiopia should allow aid into tigray this report documents the health impacts of conflict related sexual violence in tigray as described by humanitarian agencies and other service providers it details the devastation of the healthcare system in tigray and the lack of availability of post rape health care and related psychosocial support services it documents how insecurity armed men s presence in health settings and ethiopian government restrictions on communications electricity and humanitarian assistance have impeded the access to care for sexual violence survivors including girls and women from 6 to 80 years old it also describes how the government s blocking of food medical supplies and fuel to the region has stymied the rehabilitation of the health sector and the ramping up of a comprehensive response to gender based violence an analysis of the prevalence and patterns of sexual violence in tigray and more recent abuses in the afar and amhara regions is beyond the scope of this report for this report between june and november 2021 human rights watch interviewed over secure channels 21 local and international healthcare workers service providers humanitarian aid workers members of community organizations and government donor agencies we reviewed 43 additional individual cases of sexual violence as documented through anonymized medical notes intake notes and written transcripts of interviews between sexual violence survivors and service providers we drew from previous human rights watch interviews conducted between january and june 2021 with two eritrean refugee sexual violence survivors and five health workers service providers and witnesses human rights watch conducted four written and telephone interviews with members of the tigray regional health bureau and the sexual and gender based violence assessment and rehabilitation committee of the tigray women s affairs bureau on october 15 2021 human rights watch sent a summary of findings and requests for information to the ethiopian ministry of health the ministry of justice the ministry of peace the ministry of women and social affairs and the national disaster risk management commission but did not receive replies by the time of publication click to expand image 2021 human rights watch gender based violence in the tigray conflict the armed conflict between the ethiopian government and allied forces with the tigray people s liberation front tplf has been accompanied by reports of widespread sexual violence across the region in areas controlled by different warring parties including rape gang rape sexual slavery and torture sexual violence took place alongside killings of family members beatings and psychological violence sexual violence often accompanied with degrading and ethnic based slurs has been used as a weapon of war particularly by ethiopian eritrean and amhara forces against tigrayan women and girls these reports first emerged in late 2020 from community networks healthcare workers and humanitarian aid providers by february 2021 conflict related rape had been confirmed and condemned by ethiopian authorities and un officials reliable estimates of the prevalence of sexual violence in the conflict and comprehensive incident data do not exist while information on numbers of survivors can contribute to understanding the scale of abuse and support the planning and provision of services an overemphasis on establishing the extent of sexual violence or disclosing incident data can be counterproductive including by putting pressure on survivors to report priority should be placed on developing safe spaces and confidential services where survivors can seek support voluntarily and at the time of their choosing the november 3 2021 report from the joint investigation by the ethiopian human rights commission ehrc and the un office of the high commissioner for human rights ohchr on human rights abuses in tigray committed by parties to the armed conflict found a continuous rise in the use of sgbv services by survivors it cites data between november 2020 and may 2021 provided by ethiopia s ministry of women children and youth and the ministry of health indicating 1 324 visits to hospitals in tigray by survivors of sexual and gender based violence including in the cities and towns of mekelle adigrat axum adwa shire and maichew according to information provided to human rights watch in october from the tigray bureau of health a regional government entity now under tplf control 2 204 survivors sought services for sexual violence at health facilities a broader category inclusive of hospitals and health centers across tigray from november 2020 through june 2021 insecurity deeply rooted social stigma and the lack of functioning healthcare facilities mean that the actual number of cases of sexual violence far exceeds the number reported in addition certain groups of sexual violence survivors including men boys older people and people with disabilities typically have fewer channels to seek confidential help from trained personnel equipped to provide support to them and for their specific needs during the first nine months of the conflict ethiopian and eritrean government forces as well as amhara militias pillaged and destroyed health facilities in tigray reducing survivors access to essential post rape health care and mental health and psychosocial support services mhpss an april 2021 un humanitarian assessment reported that the emergency coordination center established by the ethiopian government found that only 29 of the nearly 230 health centers in tigray were fully functional human rights watch research showed that the healthcare needs of sexual violence survivors able to seek services have included testing treatment and termination of pregnancy testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections including hiv and hepatitis b and physical trauma including broken bones bruises stab wounds and traumatic fistula they have also sought support for depression anxiety post traumatic stress and other mental health conditions a doctor working in a hospital in an urban center told human rights watch one day ethiopian military men came to the hospital with a girl we checked her and found that she was pregnant she was one of the sex slaves in the gereb giba military camp that was the first day in early december we she was hepatitis positive with her consent we terminated her pregnancy gave her anti hepatitis drugs after that quite a lot of women and girls were coming in seeking medication and to terminate their pregnancies raped by conflict actors mainly by eritrean troops and ethiopian forces as of april 2021 the un population fund unfpa which is coordinating humanitarian response to gender based violence in tigray reported that only 1 percent of health facilities in tigray had the capacity to provide comprehensive gender based violence services it also identified critical shortages in medical supplies used in the clinical management of rape the presence of soldiers at checkpoints on the roads and near or inside health facilities also deterred survivors from seeking health services the doctor above noting both the military presence in the hospital where he worked and the lack of transportation for survivors said they only came if they had severe injuries or suspected pregnancy they really feared to come he said we didn t find anyone coming the day they were raped after two weeks after a month and service providers described soldiers coming into health facilities searching for specific rape survivors or health records one humanitarian worker said in a survivor was admitted the alleged perpetrators the eritrean defense forces came into the hospital a few times looking for her human rights watch also collected reports of at least five instances in which armed groups threatened harassed or detained tigrayan aid workers supporting sexual violence survivors or providing reproductive health services for local organizations or international organizations health workers and humanitarian aid providers said that government imposed restrictions on telecommunications banking and fuel along with insecurity impeded their ability to expand their operations alongside insecurity due to active fighting the presence of ethiopian eritrean and amhara forces within communities in tigray in the first half of 2021 also impacted the work of mobile clinics and community outreach programs humanitarian workers described situations in which soldiers warned community members of reprisals if they spoke to aid workers they said they struggled to adhere to best practices for supporting survivors of gender based violence including to provide private and safe spaces for women and girls ethiopian government shutdowns of telecommunications and electricity also affected survivors access to health information and services without functioning mobile phones survivors could not find out from family or community members where they could go to seek help call health facilities for information or gather information on safe travel routes the lack of safety information health facilities medications trained staff and transport prevented survivors of sexual violence from seeking or receiving time sensitive treatments including during the critical 72 hour window to administer post exposure prophylaxis to prevent hiv and the 120 hour window for emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy a humanitarian aid provider told human rights watch that of the sexual violence cases handled by their agency more than 80 percent of victims and survivors didn t present within the 72 hour window human rights watch interviews showed that social stigma around sexual violence undermined survivors ability and willingness to access psychosocial support and health care when available navigating social stigma is a pressing issue for women and girls who have become pregnant due to rape and for children born of rape a representative of a safehouse for women said they had 13 babies born of rape residing at the safehouse and as of october only 1 of these mothers had been able to return to the community with the support of the woman s relatives the other 12 women were afraid of returning home due to stigma and to worries about financially supporting and feeding their babies another humanitarian worker said in november there is definitely abandonment of babies there is a lot of stigma mental health care and psychosocial support services including community based support and specialized services are massive gaps in tigray as well as other conflict affected regions the need for mental health support also extends to healthcare providers who have treated and worked with distressing cases with little support amidst enormous challenges tigrayan health workers have done so in the context of having their own lives and communities disrupted by conflict displacement and loss and the shutdown of essential services ethiopian government response and obstruction of aid the ethiopian government has acknowledged reports of sexual violence but its response has been mixed in january it created a joint governmental taskforce team to investigate allegations of conflict related sexual violence and has since referred the findings to the attorney general s office however the investigations have been slow and while senior officials including prime minister abiy ahmed and attorney general gedion timothewos have personally acknowledged the occurrence of rape senior officials have also downplayed media reporting around rape as sensational referencing it as tplf propaganda the joint investigation by the ehrc and ohchr collected evidence of sexual violence accompanied by particular brutality including gang rape and intentional transmission of hiv and found that in many cases rape and other forms of sexual violence have been used to degrade and dehumanize the victims it noted that these abuses due to their widespread and systematic nature may amount to crimes against humanity the ethiopian government responded to the report findings by defending the ethiopian military s disciplinary record and despite the report s evidence of significant increases in sexual violence survivors seeking assistance and identifying armed forces as perpetrators suggested that sexual violence had been a major problem in the region prior to the conflict the ethiopian government has engaged with the aid community on medical and psychosocial support for example through initially co chairing the humanitarian coordination cluster focusing on protection issues including gender based violence the coordinated response included expanding one stop centers provision of dignity kits for nongovernmental organization ngo distribution creation of women and girls safe spaces and rebuilding the health infrastructure human rights watch requested information from the ethiopian government to learn more about their response to conflict related sexual violence but had not received a reply by time of publication however these efforts pale in comparison to the effects of the severe restrictions to access and essential services that the ethiopian government has imposed repeatedly on the tigray region since the beginning of the conflict these have included closing access to roads in and out of the region and shutting down telecommunications electricity and banking since tigrayan forces retook control of the region on june 28 the government has tightened these restrictions by limiting access to tigray to one route through afar region cutting off all basic services and blocking humanitarian assistance effectively besieging the region the humanitarian community has been able to deliver only a small fraction of needed food medical supplies and fuel to civilians in the region or to scale up their staffing and operations the restrictions have remained in place despite an escalating crisis of food insecurity affecting 90 percent of tigray s population with 350 000 people already facing famine like conditions before the government blocked aid to the region the ethiopian government has also obstructed the access of senior international humanitarian officials and humanitarian agencies providing aid in the region on july 30 the government ordered a three month suspension on médecins sans frontières doctors without borders msf holland and the norwegian refugee council after accusing them of misinformation and failure to obtain appropriate work permits on september 30 the government declared seven senior un officials including the country leads for the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha and the un children s fund unicef and a lead ohchr investigator as persona non grata or unwelcome in the country further jeopardizing humanitarian operations the ethiopian government s obstruction of aid has severely constrained the rehabilitation of the health sector on september 16 ocha reported that proper case management of gender based violence including mental health and psychosocial support services remain insufficient in most locations in tigray in late september ocha reported that health partners have not been able to rehabilitate and re equip health facilities following the systematic looting by parties to the conflict and in mid october said that the government continued to block medical supplies and life saving medicines in october healthcare workers and service providers working in tigray told human rights watch they did not have adequate medicines and medical supplies and could not expand outside of urban centers for community based outreach and services due to the lack of cash transportation and fuel they described their challenges with confidential case management of gender based violence cases and data protection from the lack of electricity and computers meaning that some service providers had to rely on handwritten notes and files humanitarian groups have been hobbled by the obstruction of aid and told human rights watch they have found it difficult to meet the minimum standards of care to ensure an appropriate and quality humanitarian response as laid out in the sphere standards and other international guidelines international humanitarian law applicable in tigray requires parties to the conflict to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded impartial aid to civilians in need the parties must consent to allow relief operations and may not refuse such consent on arbitrary grounds they may take steps to control the content and delivery of humanitarian aid for example to ensure it does not include weapons the movement of relief workers may be temporarily blocked for reasons of imperative military necessity such as security concerns in the midst of a military operation the ethiopian authorities onerous restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the tigray region which has blocked food medical supplies and fuel without valid justification is in violation of international humanitarian law moreover the government s curtailment of food aid may amount to the use of starvation as a weapon of war which is a war crime warring parties may take military action to restrict electricity or communications to opposing forces so long as such actions do not cause disproportionate civilian harm the government s cutting off electricity and telecommunications in tigray has had an enormous negative impact on the population in addition to its international obligations the ethiopian government should immediately provide full and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid to the tigray region and restore essential services to meet the pressing healthcare and psychosocial support service needs of sexual violence survivors since mid 2021 the european union eu united states and united kingdom have made increasingly stronger calls for investigations into alleged abuses and unimpeded humanitarian aid the us government authorized a targeted sanctions regime in september allowing the us government to deny visas to and freeze the assets of individuals and entities responsible for or complicit in serious abuses and obstructing access to humanitarian aid on september 3 the african union au urged the ethiopian government to step up efforts to ensure humanitarian access into tigray on october 7 the european parliament adopted a resolution calling on national regional and local actors to allow immediate and unimpeded relief into tigray and an end to the de facto blockade on humanitarian assistance and critical supplies including food medicine and fuel as well as targeted sanctions against those responsible for actions prolonging the conflict and exacerbating the humanitarian situation the united nations security council did not hold its first public meeting on ethiopia until june 2021 and has not placed ethiopia including the crucial issue of humanitarian access on its formal agenda on november 5 as the fighting in northern ethiopia escalated and spread the security council released a statement that called for the respect of international humanitarian law for safe and unhindered humanitarian access the re establishment of public services and the scaling up of humanitarian assistance human rights watch research from conflicts around the world including the central african republic iraq myanmar and south sudan have repeatedly documented the profound and long term impacts of conflict related sexual violence on women and girls including their mental and physical health and ability to fully resume working studying participating in public life and caring for their families the availability accessibility and quality of support both in the immediate aftermath of violence and in the long term are essential for survivors healing and rebuilding their lives international donors should commit support and resources for the long term rehabilitation of the healthcare system including for clinical management of rape across the region and for the short and long term mental health and psychosocial service needs for survivors of gender based violence their families and communities this includes an emphasis on community based outreach and services and referrals and availability of specialized care given the grave and expanding abuses by all parties to the conflict in tigray the united nations human rights council should urgently establish an independent international

international law including by enforcing a zero tolerance policy for sexual violence and ensuring that anyone responsible for sexual violence be appropriately held to account they should uphold international humanitarian law prohibitions against attacks on health workers and humanitarian aid personnel health facilities and medical transport allow immediately rapid full safe and unfettered access to humanitarian aid all warring parties should urgently allow access to humanitarian aid throughout conflict affected areas in compliance with international law this includes supplies and staff necessary for the rehabilitation of healthcare and psychosocial support infrastructure the federal ethiopian government in particular should lift broad restrictions on banking telecommunications fuel electricity food medicines and humanitarian access in the tigray region tigrayan forces should also ensure humanitarian access to areas under their control strengthen and expand a comprehensive approach to preventing and responding to gender based violence across tigray and conflict affected areas including at the regional woreda district and village levels the ethiopian government and regional authorities including the tplf should cooperate fully with humanitarian agencies to ensure the availability accessibility and quality of sexual and reproductive health services including clinical management of rape without discrimination they should also ensure the availability accessibility and quality of mental health and psychosocial support services without discrimination including community level trainings on psychological first aid and provision of specialized services and counseling for sexual violence survivors and their families un member countries should increase pressure on parties to the conflict to allow rapid and unfettered access to humanitarian aid and should establish and support an independent international investigation into human rights abuses and war crimes in the tigray conflict the united nations human rights council should establish an independent international investigation into human rights abuses and war crimes in conflict affected areas of tigray afar and amhara regions to ensure credible scrutiny investigate and report on violations collect and preserve evidence for future trials and facilitate genuine accountability the investigation should include all forms of gender based violence including rape as a weapon of war attacks on health facilities and obstruction of humanitarian assistance including starvation as a weapon of war methodology this report focuses on access to health care and psychosocial support services for survivors of conflict related sexual violence in the tigray region of ethiopia this research includes documentation of the barriers that sexual violence survivors have faced in obtaining care and services during periods of active armed conflict as well as due to the ethiopian government s blocking of aid to the region since mid 2021 this research investigated healthcare and mental health and psychosocial support service needs as documented by service providers obstacles faced by healthcare providers and humanitarian aid workers in delivering and expanding post rape care and individual cases of sexual violence as documented through anonymized medical notes interview transcripts with service providers and direct witness accounts attempts to quantify the prevalence of conflict related sexual violence or to describe patterns of sexual violence by location or timeline are beyond the scope of this report documentation of conflict related sexual violence in the amhara region is also outside the scope of this report this research did not set out to review or evaluate legal accountability efforts community based gender based violence and domestic violence linked to the conflict and displacement are also outside of the scope of this report due to physical access constraints and the government imposed shutdown in telecommunications in tigray interviews were conducted remotely for ethical and logistical reasons particularly in a context with few functioning or accessible referral pathways for support services we chose to focus the research on service providers and did not seek interviews with sexual violence survivors for this report from june through november 2021 human rights watch researchers interviewed over secure channels 21 healthcare workers service providers humanitarian aid workers members of community organizations and international donors fifteen of the interviewees directly provided services to survivors of gender based violence or helped to coordinate and oversee the response of their respective organizations in tigray to gender based violence in the period november 2020 to november 2021 three were members of informal networks and community organizations responding to human rights abuses including sexual violence in tigray and three were staff members of international government donor agencies this report also draws from previous human rights watch research conducted between january and june 2021 including interviews with two eritrean refugee women about other topics who voluntarily disclosed their experiences of rape and interviews with five health workers service providers and witnesses altogether the organizations and health providers that we interviewed had treated more than 1 000 cases of sexual violence perpetrated by members of armed forces and non state armed groups the research included review and analysis of 43 individual cases of sexual violence reported to and treated by service providers through anonymized intake notes medical notes and interview transcripts with survivors of sexual violence provided to human rights watch these cases included 38 women and 5 girls under the age of 18 information from the anonymized intake notes and medical notes were reviewed for patterns and human rights watch did not disclose any individual information in this report survivors whose accounts were documented in the interview transcripts provided consent for their public use illustrative quotes using pseudonyms that do not reflect survivors real names from three of these interview transcripts have been included in this report due to privacy and security considerations human rights watch has anonymized the names and identifying details of most interviewees including specific locations of where they were providing health and gender based violence support services in tigray human rights watch also reviewed internal and published reports from humanitarian organizations on gendered impacts of the crisis media reports official statements made by governmental and intergovernmental authorities and publicly available data on humanitarian needs and response human rights watch conducted four written and telephone interviews with members of the tigray regional bureau of health and the sexual and gender based violence sgbv assessment and rehabilitation committee of the tigray women s affairs bureau human rights watch sent a summary of our research findings and written requests for information to federal ethiopian authorities on october 15 2021 including to the ministry of health the ministry of justice the ministry of peace the ministry of women and social affairs and the national disaster risk management commission as of the date of publication we had not received any responses background armed conflict in tigray in the early hours of november 4 2020 following years of growing tensions between ethiopia s federal government and the ruling party administering the tigray region the tigray people s liberation front tplf ethiopia s prime minister abiy ahmed acknowledged on state television that he ordered the ethiopian national defense forces endf to commence a law and order operation in tigray in response to attacks by tplf forces on ethiopian military bases and federal forces in the regional capital of mekelle and at other camps in the tigray region at the onset of fighting the tplf supported by tigray s regional special police and local militias said that it took over the assets of the ethiopian military s northern command in tigray the ethiopian military soon carried out military operations in tigray which were supported by amhara regional special police asf amhara militias and irregular militia groups known as fano reports soon emerged that eritrean defense forces edf were participating in the conflict in support of the endf and its allied forces from the neighboring amhara region human rights watch documented that on november 9 artillery attacks launched from eritrea hit the tigrayan town of humera in western tigray on november 14 tplf officials acknowledged launching rockets at eritrea s capital asmara asserting they were in retaliation for the edf s involvement in the fighting on june 28 tigrayan forces recaptured the regional capital of mekelle that same day the federal government unilaterally declared a ceasefire citing many reasons including to allow essential aid into tigray since then ethiopian federal and regional forces have blocked roads into the region and limited humanitarian access in july the fighting expanded into the neighboring amhara and afar regions with reports of civilian casualties and thousands displaced and increasing reports of serious abuses against civilians in the amhara region by tigrayan forces including sexual violence and summary killings the conflict which is ongoing at time of writing has been marked by serious violations of international humanitarian law including large scale massacres summary executions widespread rape and other sexual violence indiscriminate shelling pillage attacks on refugee camps destruction of crops and civilian infrastructure such as factories schools and healthcare facilities and the obstruction of humanitarian assistance the blocking of humanitarian assistance has included bureaucratic obstacles to getting visas and permissions for goods attacks against harassment of and expulsion of humanitarian workers and shutdowns of basic services in the region including banking electricity and telecommunications gender based violence in the tigray conflict the conflict in tigray has involved widespread sexual violence against tigrayan women and girls accompanied by brutal beatings and psychological violence reports first emerged at the end of 2020 from community networks healthcare workers and humanitarian aid providers the existence of conflict related rape has since been confirmed and condemned by ethiopian authorities and un officials although the scale of abuses remains unknown amnesty international published a report in august 2021 that provides the most comprehensive documentation to date of rape gang rape sexual mutilation and sexual slavery against tigrayan women and girls perpetrators include the eritrean defense forces edf the ethiopian national defense force endf the amhara regional police special forces asf and fano an informal amhara militia group human rights watch has also documented incidents of sexual violence perpetrated by tigrayan militias against eritrean refugees in october the tigray regional bureau of health provided human rights watch with data from the one stop center in shire which showed that of 173 women and girls seeking health services for rape between november 2020 and june 2021 125 identified the profile of their attackers of these 113 named eritrean forces fano militia and ethiopian forces the amnesty international report documented 63 individual accounts of sexual violence that corroborated media and other reports of rape and gang rape that were accompanied by killings beatings death threats and use of ethnic slurs in some cases perpetrators held tigrayan women and girls for days or weeks in conditions of sexual slavery some survivors were raped in front of their children and other family members a joint investigation by the ethiopian human rights commission ehrc and the un office of the high commissioner for human rights ohchr into abuses committed by parties to the armed conflict released its findings on november 3 2021 and found that all parties to the conflict had perpetrated sexual and gender based violence and that in many cases rape and other forms of sexual violence have been used to degrade and dehumanize the victims the joint investigation team interviewed 30 survivors of rape gang rape and other forms of sexual violence the report concludes that sexual violence in the conflict may further constitute war crimes and in view of their widespread and systematic nature crimes against humanity the report had shortcomings although it documented instances of women being held captive and repeatedly raped over long periods it did not use the term sexual slavery to appropriately characterize these abuses it documented brutal sexual violence by all warring parties but did not acknowledge the scale of abuses by ethiopian eritrean and amhara forces targeting tigrayan women and girls human rights watch independently reviewed information from 43 cases of sexual violence provided by the health and service providers that assisted the survivors directly each of these cases some of which are described in detail below shared consistent patterns as those acknowledged in official statements and documented by media reports and amnesty international service providers told human rights watch that many rape survivors reported gang rapes according to one more than 25 percent of reports involved multiple perpetrators or gang rape the tigray women s affairs bureau provided information to human rights watch that of 166 survivors admitted to a safehouse between april and august 2021 the majority reported gang rape from anywhere between 3 and 21 assailants of 125 women and girls providing information about their attackers at the one stop center in shire during the period between november 2020 and june 2021 59 reported gang rape by armed forces personnel a significant number of the survivors reporting sexual violence are girls under the age of 18 one health worker noted that of more than 500 rape cases coming to their facility roughly 150 included children under age 18 of 166 rape survivors admitted to a safehouse between april and august 2021 40 were under 18 96 were between 19 and 25 and 30 were between 36 and 65 in early november a humanitarian worker working in cooperation with the one stop centers supporting survivors of gender based violence said that at least one third of those seeking help were children the reports by amnesty international and journalists have included accounts from survivors and the doctors who treated them that indicated an ethnic motivation for the sexual assault these accounts describe soldiers telling their victims they wanted to infect them with hiv to cleanse the tigrayan bloodline and that girls can make amhara babies a health worker in tigray told human rights watch that survivors told her that eritrean soldiers who had used objects to rape them would use bad words about their identity that tigrayan women must be sterile sexual violence against men boys older people and people with disabilities there is limited information on sexual violence against men and boys older people and people with disabilities in the tigray conflict in a march 2021 un briefing the deputy humanitarian coordinator for ethiopia at the time wafaa said stated they had received accounts of men being forced to rape their own family members under threat of violence the ehrc ohchr joint investigation report described three incidents of rape and gang rape of men and boys including a 16 year old boy who later died by suicide it also documented sexual violence against older people and against a woman with a physical disability healthcare providers interviewed by human rights watch said the rape survivors they treated included older women including between 65 and 80 years old sexual violence involving men and boys either by forcing them to rape family members or other forms of sexual assault by armed soldiers and fighters carries deep social stigma and impedes reporting or seeking out health services and psychosocial support community members aid workers healthcare providers and law enforcement may have little awareness or training about sexual violence against men and boys research on various conflicts around the world shows that in conflict and forced displacement settings men and boys are subject to rape and other forms of sexual violence including forced nudity genital violence enforced rape of others forced witnessing of sexual violence threat of rape castration and sterilization given that the vast majority of victims are women and girls many community outreach and health programs focusing on sexual violence are not accessible to men and boys for example through women and girls safe spaces or through reproductive health services men and boy survivors of sexual violence typically have fewer channels to seek confidential help from trained personnel equipped to provide support to them and for their specific needs people with disabilities also may be at high risk of being undercounted because they do not have support to reach protection services and they may face obstacles to accessibility and confidentiality in seeking services one humanitarian organization operating in tigray documented through individual and focus group interviews cases of older people and people with disabilities being left behind during episodes of violence because they were unable to flee and hide along with their family members human rights watch has documented the heightened risk that people with different types of disabilities and older people may face in armed conflict due to specific obstacles to fleeing violence including lack of availability of assistive devices such as wheelchairs finding accessible refuge and obtaining basic services estimates of sexual violence given the lack of access in tigray to functioning healthcare facilities insecurity and social stigma the number of cases of sexual violence reported to health facilities or legal authorities is most likely a significant underestimate of the actual number the ethiopian government regional authorities international bodies donors humanitarian agencies community organizations and the media may feel pressure from each other and from the public to assess the prevalence of sexual violence or to collect and disclose the number of sexual violence survivors seeking legal or health assistance while this information can help establish the scale of abuse and support the planning and provision of services an overemphasis on reporting and numbers may be counterproductive including through pressure on survivors to report survivors should not feel pressured to disclose their experience and it may take years for them to choose to do so the women s refugee commission which has longstanding expertise on prevention and response of gender based violence in humanitarian settings states it is not essential for survivors to explicitly disclose sexual victimization to enable healing or recovery the priority is to create a safe supportive and trusting environment where confidentiality and non judgement are prioritized and where staff are trained in receiving disclosures and do not pressure force or rush a survivor to disclose disclosure if when how and to whom is an individual preference even prior to the conflict in tigray social stigma and other factors have meant only a fraction of sexual violence survivors come forward to seek assistance in the tigray sample of a 2016 demographic and health survey of women and girls ages 15 49 only 24 percent of those who had experienced physical or sexual violence sought help 14 percent told someone but did not seek help and 62 percent did not tell anyone and did not seek help no comparable data is available for older women girls under 15 people with disabilities or men and boys in the context of the current conflict including insecurity fear of retaliation from perpetrators displacement and the devastation of healthcare facilities described below the obstacles to reporting sexual violence and seeking support have only increased avenues to report sexual violence have been limited the police were not functioning in conflict affected areas during the first half of the year and one humanitarian assessment noted that official reporting at medical facilities remains limited it is expected that many cases remain unreported amnesty international reported that most of the rape survivors they interviewed had not sought or received treatment at health facilities and would not be counted in available numbers the ehrc ohchr joint investigation report notes the government a un agency and service providers reporting a continuous rise in the use of sgbv services by survivors since the beginning of the conflict it cites data between november 2020 and may 2021 provided by the ministry of women children and youth and the ministry of health indicating 1 324 visits to hospitals by survivors of sexual and gender based violence including in the cities and towns of mekelle adigrat axum adwa shire and maichew in october the tigray bureau of health said that 2 204 survivors reported sexual violence to health facilities a broader category inclusive of hospitals and health centers across tigray from november 2020 through june 2021 written communication from personnel who had worked at ayder referral hospital in mekelle said they treated 553 survivors of rape between november 2020 and june 2021 these included girls as young as 6 and up to 80 years old a medical worker in another part of tigray said that they treated between 76 and 80 cases of sexual and gender based violence between the end of march and early june the media reported that the public hospital in adigrat treated at least 174 rape survivors between early november and march 2021 in its humanitarian briefings ocha reported at least 504 cases of gender based violence including rape in may 2021 including 69 cases against girls under 18 and 129 cases during the first week of june 2021 alone the total number of people subject to conflict related rape and other gender based violence may well be much higher because many survivors do not report their abuse a humanitarian worker noted that in one area they were receiving about 30 women and girls reporting sexual violence per month however they suspected that others who sought family planning or counseling services were survivors of conflict related rape but not counted in these numbers because they did not report the abuse factors that impede survivors from seeking support including lack of availability and access to health care and the social stigma surrounding rape are discussed in greater detail below ethiopian government response to conflict related sexual violence the ethiopian government s response to reports of sexual violence has been mixed it created a joint taskforce team to investigate allegations of conflict related sexual violence and has referred the findings to the attorney general s office on february 11 2021 the then ethiopian minister of women children and youth filsan abdullahi was the first federal official to confirm conflict related rape in the region tweeting that we have received the report back from our taskforce team on the ground in the tigray region they have unfortunately established rape has taken place conclusively and without a doubt her twitter thread urged domestic and international partners to support the government in providing mental health and social assistance in a february 18 statement ethiopian president sahle work zewde also confirmed conflict related sexual violence in the region public statements by other government officials however raise concerns about the government s commitment to acknowledge and seriously address the scale and severity of reports of sexual violence committed by armed forces in tigray including by government forces on march 23 2021 prime minister abiy ahmed told parliament and tweeted regardless of the tplf propaganda of exaggeration any soldier responsible for raping our women looting communities in the region will be held accountable there is little information about the timeline of the investigations and other senior officials have downplayed media reporting around rape in a written response to reuters in april 2021 the ethiopian information minister yemane gebremeskel accused tplf activists of coaching sympathizers to create false testimonies in august the ministry of foreign affairs released a statement in response to amnesty international s report documenting sexual violence acknowledged that some members of the armed forces engaged in conduct that is contrary to the rules of engagement and the orders they were given but accused the organization of sensationalized attacks and smear campaigns against the government in a june 3 2021 press conference attorney general gedion timothewos stated that criminal investigations into rape were being carried out by the military court and prosecutors regional police and prosecutors and federal police and investigators he added that military prosecutors had pressed charges against 25 soldiers for sexual violence and their trials were underway while three soldiers had been convicted of rape he did not share information about their sentences the governmental ehrc released a brief monitoring report in february recognizing the absence of local structures and health facilities where survivors of sexual violence could turn to report abuses in march it launched the joint investigation with ohchr on abuses in tigray in november the ethiopian government responded to the ehrc ohchr joint investigation report findings on sexual and gender based violence by defending the ethiopian military s disciplinary record and alleging that sexual and gender based violence had been a major problem in the region prior to the conflict it asserted that the release of prisoners following the outbreak of conflict aggravated the situation and the scale of crimes the assertion that sexual violence had been a problem before the conflict does not address the evidence presented in the report of significantly increased numbers of sexual violence survivors seeking services during the reporting period with the vast majority identifying members of warring parties as the perpetrators in its response the government said a small number of rogue endf members have been convicted of the heinous crimes affirmed its commitment to ending impunity and made a point of noting the report made no claims that the endf systematically used rape to dehumanize civilians finally the government underscored its cooperation with stakeholders to provide medical and psychosocial support to survivors including through one stop centers and a safehouse the ethiopian government engaged with the aid community for example through initially co chairing the humanitarian coordination cluster focusing on protection issues including gender based violence the coordinated response included expanding one stop centers the provision of dignity kits for ngo distribution the creation of safe spaces for women and girls and rebuilding the health infrastructure human rights watch requested information from the ethiopian government including the ministry of health and the ministry of women and social affairs to learn more about their response to conflict related sexual violence but had not received a reply at the time of publication however other actions by the ethiopian government and armed forces deeply undermined and ran counter to these efforts including access restrictions to the region prolonged shutdowns on telecommunications electricity and banking humanitarian agencies described how these affected their response and reported bureaucratic challenges in obtaining visas including for experts on protection issues conflict related devastation of health infrastructure in tigray a huge amount of destruction of healthcare facilities in most places we looked at a half to a third being completely destroyed or demolished or looted to the extent that it s a shell of a building and can t be used as a health post anymore one third being degraded so that they could only be used for a few things and traveling for outreach was limited because of insecurity the area of coverage shrinks to right around the health post humanitarian worker august 17 2021 the destruction pillage and military use of hospitals and health centers by ethiopian and eritrean federal forces and amhara forces in tigray between november 2020 and late june 2021 has severely curtailed civilian access to functioning health care in early 2021 ongoing looting and insecurity hampered the proper functioning of remaining health facilities the rehabilitation of the health sector and the ability of humanitarian organizations to expand the geographic reach of their operations witnesses described eritrean forces looting health facilities such as st mary s hospital in axum and the adigrat referral hospital and a pharmaceutical factory in adigrat in march 2021 msf teams in northwestern tigray found destroyed equipment smashed doors and windows and medicine and patient files scattered across floors in april 2021 ocha reported twelve incidents of looting of health facilities by armed personnel in a two week period and the delay or halting of several humanitarian missions in january 2021 doctors from mekelle adigrat and elsewhere in tigray described the shortages of medicines and medical supplies one doctor said we didn t have antibiotics we didn t have gloves iv fluid insulin cancer drugs everything a doctor in adigrat said that we were in difficulty to take care of patients of chronic medical illnesses like hiv dm and tb patients as there was no way of providing medical supplies nearly for 40 days since the onset of war and the hospital drug was stock out ongoing assessments throughout 2021 by the world health organization who and humanitarian organizations have documented the damage to buildings and equipment and lack of staffing medical supplies and medications in march 2021 the who found that 141 of the 198 assessed hospitals and health centers were either partially or fully damaged an april assessment found that only 29 of the nearly 230 health centers in tigray were fully functional and that they all urgently needed more medical supplies drugs and equipment as of may only 7 out of 40 referral hospitals in tigray were fully functional a doctor in tigray said we faced a shortage of equipment and medications and even for primary healthcare services one humanitarian worker noted it will take years to rebuild the healthcare system of tigray it s really dependent on external support to do so when going through facilities here were literally pillboxes opened and emptied really deliberate destruction obstruction of humanitarian aid fuel and medical supplies are still denied entry into tigray lack of fuel is one of the major impediments for delivering humanitarian assistance consequently several un and ngo partners had to severely reduce or suspend humanitarian response activities northern ethiopia humanitarian update ocha september 30 2021 between november 2020 and late june 2021 the ethiopian government repeatedly imposed restrictions on access and services in the region cutting off tigray from essential services and infrastructure including by closing roads in and out of the region and shutting down telecommunications electricity and banking since tigrayan forces retook control of most of the region at the end of june the government has tightened these restrictions by limiting access to tigray to one route through afar cutting off all these basic services and blocking humanitarian assistance that has obstructed the delivery of fuel food and all medical supplies the government claims these measures are to prevent the flow or diversion of resources to tigrayan forces in july the state minister for foreign affairs redwan hussein accused aid agencies of arming rebel groups on october 18 the ministry of foreign affairs released a statement claiming that the diversion of humanitarian resources by the tplf for its military purposes has sputtered the delivery of humanitarian aid into the region and accused the international community of placing sole blame on the government these statements were viewed with alarm by humanitarian agencies which defended its neutrality and cited the risk such statements created for their staff these restrictions on aid have rendered humanitarian agencies unable to deliver a fraction of the needed food fuel and essential medical supplies to the civilian population or to scale up their staffing and operations the blocking of commercial supplies has also led to shortages and price hikes for essential commodities including food and fuel the shutdown of banking has meant many tigrayan health workers have been working without salaries for months several humanitarian organizations are halting or significantly reducing their programs due to operational constraints caused by lack of fuel cash and supplies the restrictions have remained in place despite escalating food insecurity affecting 90 percent of tigray s population and 350 000 already feared starving as of june a september assessment diagnosed 79 percent of screened pregnant and lactating women with moderate malnutrition and 18 percent of screened children under 5 exceeding global emergency thresholds the ethiopian government has mounted administrative and political obstacles impeding humanitarian access on july 30 the government ordered a three month suspension of msf holland and the norwegian refugee council after accusing them of misinformation and failure to obtain appropriate work permits in a september statement msf noted that patients have been discharged from msf clinics leaving people in these locations with even further limited access to health care a team of nearly 1 000 ethiopian staff are also on standby at home on september 30 the ethiopian government declared seven senior un officials including the country leads for ocha and unicef as persona non grata or unwelcome in the country in november an aid worker told human rights watch that the un had begun reducing and relocating some of its staff from tigray due to safety concerns the expulsion of top officials from lead agencies coordinating and implementing the global humanitarian effort and the need to evacuate un staff further jeopardizes aid operations international response on september 13 2021 the un high commissioner for human rights michelle bachelet said that the ehrc ohchr joint investigation had documented human rights violations including attacks on civilians killings and torture and that exual and gender based violence has been characterised by a pattern of extreme brutality including gang rapes sexualised torture and ethnically targeted sexual violence she also emphasized the need for government transparency around the prosecutions of sexual and gender based violence several other international bodies and governments have also acknowledged and condemned the reports of sexual violence in january 2021 pramila patten the un special representative to the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict confirmed her office had received reports of sexual violence perpetrated by combatants in uniform including holding women and girls captive for days and repeatedly assaulting them and forcing individuals to watch the attack of family members despite condemnations of the atrocities in the tigray conflict political action from the au un and influential governments has been slow and mixed the united nations security council did not hold its first public meeting on ethiopia until june 2021 and has not placed ethiopia including the crucial issues of humanitarian access on its formal agenda the secretary general has yet to adequately engage mechanisms on sexual violence in conflict for example by deploying a team of experts on sexual violence in conflict or by establishing monitoring and reporting arrangements mara through pramila patten s office in june the african commission on human and peoples rights established a commission of inquiry in september the au appointed former nigerian president olusegun obasanjo as the au high representative for the horn of africa on september 3 the au urged the ethiopian government to step up efforts to ensure humanitarian access into tigray since mid 2021 the eu us and uk have made increasingly stronger calls for investigations into alleged abuses and unimpeded humanitarian aid the us government authorized a targeted sanctions regime in september allowing the us government to deny visas to and freeze the assets of individuals and entities responsible for or complicit in serious abuses and obstructing access to humanitarian aid on october 7 the european parliament adopted a resolution calling on national regional and local actors to allow immediate and unimpeded relief into tigray and an end to the de facto blockade on humanitarian assistance and critical supplies including food medicine and fuel as well as targeted sanctions against those responsible for actions prolonging the conflict and exacerbating the humanitarian situation on november 5 as the conflict in northern ethiopia escalated and spread the security council released a statement that called for the respect of international humanitarian law for safe and unhindered humanitarian access the re establishment of public services and the scaling up of humanitarian assistance humanitarian response there was a lag in analysis and identifying the issues the extent of violations the extent of needs again largely the politics around the conflict the international response was not appropriate for the crisis unfolding there was significant dysfunction in responding in the first three to four months humanitarian aid provider august 3 2021 human rights watch interviewed aid workers and donors who said that the initial humanitarian response in tigray particularly from the un was slow and disorganized they attributed this partly to insecurity but also to the orientation of many existing organizations toward economic development instead of humanitarian intervention they compared the response in tigray to their experiences working in other humanitarian emergencies and expressed outrage at the sluggishness in the scaling up of operations and getting staff with appropriate training experience and skills on the ground a humanitarian specialist with a government donor agency said some un agencies were in a development mindset and couldn t transition quickly emergency access was difficult this was an excuse these are humanitarian organizations that should have scaled up more quickly these critiques do not apply to all humanitarian organizations some showed greater agility in expanding the reach of their aid operations early in the conflict in july the emergency directors group edg including representatives of operational un agencies and some ngos and tasked with advising on humanitarian coordination traveled to tigray their internal report found communities indicate a lack of assistance and protection across the board some communities indicated receiving only one round of assistance in eight months the gradual improvement in the deployment of senior emergency experienced staff to lead operations in tigray by some agencies are positive steps however there is need for further enhanced capacities to lead coordinate and deliver humanitarian assistance in the deep field staff in tigray are exhausted often junior and without necessary tools and enablers to function including cash communication and fuel and feel since then most interviewees have described significant improvements in the humanitarian response including in the profile of deployed staff amidst an extremely difficult operating environment health impacts of conflict related sexual violence the impacts of conflict related sexual violence can include physical and psychological trauma pregnancy sexually transmitted infections short and long term disabilities and social stigma and exclusion in some settings a healthcare provider may be the first and only contact that a survivor has with services providing care for gender based violence clinical management of rape response to gender based violence should include the availability of skilled healthcare workers and relevant supplies in all primary healthcare centers and mobile teams as well as referrals for additional health psychological legal and social services time sensitive care includes provision of post exposure prophylaxis within 72 hours of exposure to prevent hiv and emergency contraception with 120 hours to prevent pregnancy other essential supplies and services include treatment of wounds pregnancy testing pregnancy options information including safe abortion referrals treatment of sexually transmitted infections and prevention of hepatitis b health services sought by rape survivors healthcare providers said that survivors of sexual violence who came to functioning clinics or hospitals for care had primarily been requesting abortions testing for sexually transmitted infections treatment for hiv and hepatitis and mental healthcare support a doctor working in a hospital in an urban center said when the conflict started in november we saw lots of women and girls coming to the hospital asking for abortions we didn t realize there was widespread rape in the region initially one day ethiopian military men came to the hospital with a girl they told us she needed medication we checked her and found that she was pregnant she was one of the sex slaves in the gereb giba military camp that was the first day in early december then we ask her and she was hepatitis positive with her consent we terminated her pregnancy gave her anti hepatitis drugs after that quite a lot of women and girls were coming seeking medication and to terminate their pregnancies raped by conflict actors mainly by eritrean troops and ethiopian forces another healthcare provider said that survivors of gender based violence were approaching them seeking three main types of services physical trauma and emergency gynecology sexual and reproductive health consultations to check for infection and ask for contraception and abortions after rape a medical worker described treating increasing numbers of rape survivors in march through the end of april one was a 45 year old lady who was raped by eritrean troops and she came for termination of pregnancy and another lady was pregnant with excessive vaginal bleeding at the time we didn t have an established operation theater and she needed immediate referral to mekelle healthcare providers working across different parts of tigray reported that they were receiving survivors with similar types of health needs injuries and infections these include pregnancy hiv hepatitis psychological trauma and physical injuries a doctor at a referral hospital said some of them sustained injuries some were raped by up to 15 individuals also sodomized we give them a bed and give treatment of fistula at least a quarter of them had psychological disturbance and psychiatric problems according to the tigray bureau of health a significant proportion of women and girls seeking services at one stop centers between november 2020 and june 2021 were seeking pregnancy testing and termination of pregnancies at the shire one stop center 69 out of 173 women and girls reporting sexual violence were pregnant and 65 of them received abortions at the adigrat one stop center 255 out of 499 survivors seeking health services were pregnant of whom 252 received abortions in axum out of 168 survivors seeking health services 148 tested positive for pregnancy data on how many sought and obtained abortions was not provided or available the shire one stop center recorded that all 173 survivors seeking services during this period were tested for hiv hepatitis b and other sexually transmitted infections of these 3 tested positive for hiv 13 tested positive for sexually transmitted infections and none tested positive for hepatitis b from the medical notes of 10 cases a doctor described specific injuries including vaginal bleeding bruises perineal tears lacerations in the vulva and removal of foreign objects from the vagina including nails a condom and a metal rod a health worker outlined at least 80 cases of rape survivors out of more than 500 who came for treatment who had tested positive for sexually transmitted infections including hiv the worker also noted that some survivors are psychologically disturbed they can t sleep walk some have started psychiatric medications they are not stable they are still in suffering service providers reported that rape survivors often sustained physical injuries due to the violence of the rapes and gang rapes for example they described women with bruises all over their bodies and survivors who could not control their bladder or bowel movements one of the common consequences of traumatic fistula from rape other examples include stab wounds from knives requiring stitches injuries from being stepped on and bone fractures injuries and consequences of rape and gang rape have long term health implications one service provider noted there are women having a lifetime injury some are pregnant and they couldn t get an abortion others are hiv positive survivors of sexual violence reported ongoing symptoms and injuries months after the rape seble g a 22 year old woman originally from eritrea said that on december 16 2020 they forced us to have sexual intercourse and because of that i am still bleeding my wound is not in a normal situation there is bleeding right now service providers noted that there was a high fear of rape in the civilian population including when the region saw an uptick in fighting prior to the tigrayan forces gaining control of much of tigray at the end of june the fear of rape was associated with demands for contraception in outreach sites quite a high demand for family planning a lot of women afraid they would be raped by soldiers and wanted to have family planning to protect them from getting pregnant if they were raped service providers also told human rights watch they suspected that many survivors sought family planning services and testing for sexually transmitted infections without reporting the rape one service provider noted girls if they were accessing medical services were asking for emergency contraception without mentioning they because of assault mental health and psychosocial support services needs many people in tigray have experienced trauma related to the widespread abuses committed during the conflict and suffering from the humanitarian crisis mental health and psychosocial support services addressing the specific needs of survivors of rape and gang rape as well as family members including spouses and children who witnessed the assaults is an important part of the mental health response mental health and psychosocial support services mhpss international guidelines on mental health and psychosocial support services emphasize a multi layered response including 1 basic services and security including food shelter water and essential healthcare 2 community and family supports including family tracing and reunification 3 focused non specialized supports for example primary healthcare workers and community workers who can provide psychological first aid and livelihood supports and 4 specialized services including specialized psychological or psychiatric care see appendix for more information psychological first aid pfa is a supportive response to someone who is experiencing emotional upset following extremely distressing events it includes providing practical care and support assessing needs and concerns helping people to address basic needs listening to people but not pressuring them to talk comforting people and helping them to feel calm connecting people to information services and social support and protecting them from further harm intake notes from service providers described survivors who were distraught unable to focus sometimes unable to talk or move and who expressed hopelessness and depression in the individual cases that human rights watch reviewed survivors of sexual violence expressed deep and ongoing anguish seble g quoted above said what makes me cry is always i remember the situation i can see the blood i can see the way they raped us i remember thatʼs why i am crying if i talk about the situation i feel like i am in that situation a 27 year old eritrean woman who was raped by tigrayan militia along with her 17 year old sister said because of what happened to us we have nightmares we have found a psychologist he has given us and we feel a bit better i hope with time that we will feel better tirhas s a tigrayan woman said that a soldier and civilians gang raped her in november three months prior to the interview and says she feels anxiety guilt and shame i am still praying to god it has not helped i repent but it has not helped difficult situations overlap and i have anxiety i feel stress i am affected mentally that moment comes to my mind every day i always remember that day a humanitarian worker expressed concern about adherence to standards in the combined ethiopian government and humanitarian response response has to be in line with protocols the mhpss protocols the government the ministry of health for mental and psychosocial support reportedly send psychologists from addis to tigray from the ethnic group that terrorized the population to offer support and in a different language this is not in line with humanitarian workers interviewed consistently underlined the lack of and urgent need for community based culturally sensitive mental health and psychosocial support services to address the trauma experienced by survivors of sexual violence their families and communities service providers described several survivors who had to choose between access to ongoing psychosocial support services available in urban settings and returning home to their families and community a humanitarian aid worker said that scaling up community based services is a priority noting how widespread psychosocial trauma is doing community based pss and psychological first aid trainings spread skillsets into community community elders women s development groups and community based health workers continue to hold trust among communities and can play a positive role in disseminating health and counseling information and messages many rape survivors whose cases human rights watch reviewed recounted additional profound traumas that happened alongside the sexual violence including women and girls seeing parents spouses and children killed in front of them or being separated from their families service providers and health providers also raised concerns about the trauma experienced by family members of sexual violence survivors particularly children and spouses some are raped in front of family husbands the whole family is disturbed a member of a community organization commented that psychosocial services are also needed for the children made to witness this very brutal act they are also the victims a few interviewees mentioned the need for culturally specific counseling and psychosocial support that could address the suicidal thoughts that survivors of gender based violence may be feeling many women want to suicide what kind of services can we give for those who want to do suicide needs religious and cultural context usually people don t take these measures but people may be terrified traumatized these sentiments were echoed by another humanitarian worker women and girls sufficiently afraid to suicide in the local tradition they can t be buried with their families in the case of suicide the current services are not equipped to deal with this dr godefay hagos the head of the tigray regional health bureau called for quality and culturally sensitive mental health support for survivors and the community and suggested engaging with traditional and religious healers as well as availing non specialized ental health and psychosocial service to rape survivors and the community through capacitating the health care workers working at the primary health care in addition strengthening the referral of those in need specialized service several interviewees noted a comprehensive response to gender based violence means taking into account the impact of displacement disruption of community networks loss of livelihood and economic pressures a doctor said most have lost what they have property family support financially to continue their life the need for mental health support also extends to healthcare providers who have treated and worked with distressed people with little support amidst enormous challenges the doctor cited above said i have difficulty sleeping for a whole month i could not sleep i dropped my weight a service provider spoke of her colleagues working closely with survivors of gender based violence of course they are really traumatized i ve been asking whether some organizations can them they have seen all kinds of cases a humanitarian organization noted that health extension workers reported difficulty doing their jobs because of the stress and trauma from their work effects of stigma at that time when the rape happened to me i didn t tell anybody because i am afraid people will insult me i didn t even tell my brother tirhas s 44 year old woman sexual violence survivor they say they have lost value some say they want to do suicide many will point fingers she has been raped she cannot find a future husband we must teach our community are victims of conflict everyone has to embrace them doctor formerly at a referral hospital in tigray august 12 2021 social stigma around sexual violence has a range of consequences for survivors of sexual violence their families and their communities these include keeping the acts of sexual violence private undermining a survivor s ability or willingness to access social support and health care it can also result in further stress for survivors including for girls who fear their prospects for marriage are destroyed for married women who are rejected or abandoned by their husbands or for men and boy survivors including those who were forced to rape their family members the individual cases that human rights watch reviewed included women who sought help from healthcare providers but hid the rape from their families and sometimes did not stay for full health care or follow ups fearing their families would suspect something was wrong human rights watch did not review individual cases of men or boys who were sexually assaulted during the conflict social stigma the lack of general awareness or training around such abuses and the lack of specific services may contribute to few survivors having a supportive environment to seek help an aid worker said their organization had found that in the communities they were working in there are generalized stigmatization and negative coping mechanisms imposed by family members or relatives girls were afraid no one would marry them if they were known to be raped this was echoed by other interviewees i heard multiple times that for girls mid teens families and communities really tried to protect them and keep it really quiet so that girls wouldn t be affected similarly other healthcare providers reported situations in which girls sought emergency contraception but did not report a rape the healthcare providers said they suspected that several of these cases may have been due to rape but that the girls were not reporting it for fear of stigma and losing their future prospects of marriage as discussed later women and girls safe spaces are a critical strategy to creating supportive environments and combating the harmful impacts of stigma several health workers and service providers mentioned that married women may face harsh judgment and even blame from their families and communities one humanitarian worker said that in community consultations several women mentioned those who became pregnant by rapists are turned out by their husbands because the husband doesn t want anything to do with them another humanitarian worker said that that some of the women that she and colleagues had helped the husband would leave if she had been attacked or raped if they were married almost their fault a tigrayan woman with a community based organization said some women hiding don t want husbands or families to know they walked for days say i m pregnant i need to get this out before family finds out stigma and fear of these women are huge a doctor observed that after receiving treatment most of girls without pregnancy return to their families those who are women really fear stay away because husband relatives kids they will feel shameful to go back to the community fear of stigma could also prevent women from seeking support from religious leaders in their communities tirhas s who described herself as religious and who spent time praying after her rape said i went to a priest a religious father in axum i don t want to talk in my hometown to a priest i am afraid they can insult me navigating social stigma is a pressing issue for women and girls who have become pregnant due to rape and for children born of rape human rights watch interviewed several service providers and healthcare workers who highlighted this concern a service provider said they had 13 babies born of rape at a safehouse and only 1 of these had been able to return to the community due to the support of the woman s relatives safehouse staff said that the other 12 women were afraid of returning home due to stigma and due to worries about financially supporting and feeding their babies another humanitarian worker said in november that there is definitely abandonment of babies we are hearing about these cases in coordination meetings there is a lot of stigma she added in the longer term a very local solution where you re supporting family based care alternative family based care or family based care in the bigger kinship family in tigray is the best solution it requires a peacebuilding intervention around it because of the stigma a tigrayan gender based violence specialist said we need to have organizations working from now to raise awareness in the community so children are not stigmatized one service provider noted if it s not addressed straight away it s on hold for another three years or months there will be more issues more problems experiences from other conflicts show that support for mothers community sensitization and stigma reduction are key for improving social acceptance and integration of children born of rape one worker from a community based organization said that there have also been positive responses and support knowing the culture and the stigma that comes with being a sexual violence survivor in our society there have been husbands who had their wives held hostage for weeks and come back home the husbands say it s okay it s not your fault you re home now a health worker at a referral hospital also said that some husbands were accompanying and supporting their wives to seek post rape care availability and accessibility of health services limited availability of services for survivors of gender based violence the widespread destruction of health facilities in tigray during the fighting has played a significant role in preventing many women and girls from accessing essential sexual and reproductive health care as one humanitarian aid worker stated there were only 13 percent of health facilities functioning it means family planning maternal health care didn t exist many reports of women delivering at home for example one doctor said that for survivors who managed to reach the hospital where he worked the medications required for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases including hiv were not available and the hospital was understaffed as many of the workers fled to a nearby village after frequently intimidated and terrorized by the forces a humanitarian aid worker said in the beginning it was tricky we had to improve in the first medical order that we re doing everything with sexual violence drugs for safe abortion care contraceptives the package t was done but not realizing the volume and the spread of sexual violence there was a shortage in places the issue of not being able to offer the treatment because we didn t have medicine or contraceptives a man who assisted women from his community who were raped by amhara militia said that some who went to sheraro were able to get medical services but those who returned to their hometown had not been treated we haven t been able to get care in hospitals and medical centers sometimes we get care from mobile healthcare in april 2021 international humanitarian organizations expressed concern that their analysis of the situation in tigray is that the response remains wholly inadequate to the scale of need in the first half of 2021 response to conflict related sexual violence was heavily concentrated in mekelle with an identified urgent need for partners to start and scale up response across the region as of april 2021 only 1 percent of health facilities in tigray had the capacity to provide comprehensive gender based violence services unfpa coordinates the humanitarian protection response to gender based violence they identified gaps in essential medical supplies in mekelle for clinical management of rape and in may 2021 noted that the continuing lack of medical supplies 43 and medical equipment 16 due to the looting and vandalism of health facilities has left access to life saving commodities highly inadequate with critical shortages of essential drugs like antibiotics family planning commodities or anti retroviral therapy for hiv patients these supplies are essential for post rape care as highlighted above specialized services including time sensitive health care to prevent pregnancy and hiv infection from rape and both short and long term treatments for physical and mental health traumas are critical for post rape care the health resources and services availability monitoring system herams reported that out of 72 facilities with information 15 percent did not previously provide clinical management of rape 56 percent were not providing them at all and 29 percent were providing them partially thirty seven out of 72 health facilities were able to provide post exposure prophylaxis fully and 27 out of 72 health facilities were able to provide emergency contraception during this period healthcare workers also grappled with shortages in medications one health worker at a referral hospital described the situation in june there are many many shortages especially with medications hepatitis prophylaxis is very expensive one vial is 600 ethiopian birr it s too expensive they can t before the war 30 to 40 a month now it s 200 to 300 a month now there is a shortage of medication staffing as of june 2021 only 26 percent of health services were fully functioning and only 29 percent offer clinical management of rape nineteen of the 28 organizations providing some sort of gender based violence response such as creating safe spaces community outreach on gender based violence or clinical management of rape were operating in and around mekelle while other parts of the region remain severely under served the destruction of healthcare infrastructure through which mental health support services are typically provided has contributed to a lack of specialized psychosocial support services in a may 2021 update unfpa pointed to assessments conducted by the who on health infrastructure and highlighted that of particular concern is also the lack of comprehensive mental health and psychosocial support mhpss by gbv survivors with only 7 of health facilities having the full capacity to provide psychosocial first aid there is an urgent need to increase capacity of the existing health facilities re stocking of medical supplies and equipment as well as expansion of comprehensive gbv and mhpss services to survivors across the region these shortages are particularly pronounced outside of mekelle while updated figures are challenging to obtain for specific health facilities as of may 2021 there was only one psychiatrist at mehoni hospital located near maychew presence of armed personnel and intimidation in health settings health and service providers interviewed by human rights watch shared several instances of harassment and intimidation by ethiopian and eritrean soldiers and amhara fighters over the first six months of 2021 these included their presence at checkpoints and health facilities and because they took targeted actions against rape survivors health workers and other service providers the presence of soldiers at health facilities also deterred survivors from seeking health services as their presence was frightening and retraumatizing one doctor said we were not allowed to work in the hospital because it was a military base so i started working in a health center i saw it with my naked eye that was a military base by endf an aid worker recounted what a colleague said about an encounter with a shopkeeper in the area of the organization s office the shopkeeper told a member of their team that she was being bribed to provide info to about who on our team working on sexual violence this made our health workers really scared made community health workers terrified of doing their job the aid worker also noted challenges with ethiopian and eritrean forces our difficulties were with both hospital intrusions harassment of hospital staff that has been run of the mill several interviewees described soldiers coming into health facilities searching for specific rape survivors or health records one humanitarian worker said a couple times in hospital soldiers came in looking for specific people sometimes patients sometimes staff in tigray where were working this happened multiple times soldiers looking for victims of violence another humanitarian worker described similar incidents in late february and early march 2021 there were some visits to hospitals to ask for medical records in a survivor was admitted there was a breach of confidentiality which put her at risk the alleged perpetrators the eritrean defense forces came into the hospital a few times at the beginning two or three people came in pretending to do consultations next day more coming looking for her we realized how hard it was to find a safe space for them the same worker also described a few instances in early march at another location of soldiers asking for medical records of sexual violence survivors but said that the medical director and succeeded in not sharing with them several interviewees noted that the lack of ambulances or other transport the fear of meeting soldiers on the way to health centers and the presence of armed soldiers in many health centers deterred survivors from seeking help right away or at all a member of a community organization described talking to a survivor who had been given a referral for treatment in mekelle he said i we can help with transportation she said i am afraid on my way they will stop the car she was referring to ethiopian or eritrean soldiers they will check and find the referral paper they will read i am a victim of rape they will kill me because they think i will speak to the media i don t want to risk my life i will stay here in january unicef said there were only 30 functional ambulances in the region compared to 280 prior to the conflict with the rest damaged or looted in adigrat for example 20 ambulances were taken from the hospital and nearby health centers and msf teams reported seeing some of them being used by soldiers to transport goods in some instances humanitarian workers received reports of tigrayans seeking health care who were stopped at checkpoints threatened with death and turned away one service provider talking about the period before tigrayan forces retook control of mekelle on june 28 2021 said it was difficult for them to send rape survivors to ayder referral hospital ayder was surrounded by soldiers some turned back by soldiers others did not want to approach human rights watch interviews with health workers and review of service provider intake notes described the fear and suspicion that survivors would exhibit due to the presence of soldiers around the health center the presence of armed soldiers in some hospitals and health facilities deterred not only patients but also health workers who were afraid to go to work a doctor said that our hospital was occupied by the military it was a base of the military sometimes at night there were gunshots in the hospital that frustrated the colleagues they asked not to at night only during the daytime health workers also became victims to violence in march 2021 federal police raped two medical students at ayder hospital according to a health worker who spoke with the students one said you look tigrayan we are allowed to rape you a doctor brought a complaint and the two federal police were removed from the hospital but it was unclear whether they were investigated or faced prosecution the ehrc ohchr joint investigation report did not pay sufficient attention to the deliberate and extensive destruction and pillaging of health facilities and did not document military use of and interventions into hospitals and health centers delays in seeking treatment between march and mid july 2021 only 40 rape cases had been clinically managed in tigray within the recommended 72 hour window unfpa ethiopia response to the tigray crisis situation report 1 to 15 july 2021 the devastation of health centers combined with the fear created by the presence of armed personnel on the roads and near or in many health facilities deterred survivors of sexual violence from seeking help for time sensitive treatments within the necessary timeframe including the critical 72 hour window to administer post exposure prophylaxis to prevent hiv transmission and the 120 hour window for emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy one aid provider said that of the sexual violence cases handled by their agency more than 80 percent of victims and survivors didn t present within 72 hour window immediately after incidents of sexual violence survivors were sometimes fleeing or in hiding also delaying their access to health care sexual violence survivors also delayed seeking treatment for fear of retaliation from perpetrators a doctor in adigrat said i witnessed around six women who came to the hospital psychologically traumatized after they were sexual abused by the eritrean forces upon asking why they came late they reported that they were told not to report to anyone or seek medical help otherwise their life will be in danger some survivors were raped while in detention and could not access services until they were released zewdi t a 30 year old tigrayan woman said she was detained in a prison in november 2020 in where she was gang raped by three amhara special forces fighters she was only able to seek health care after her release at the end of february the shutdown in telecommunications has been another major obstacle to obtaining care without mobile phones survivors of rape are not able to receive or share critical information such as finding out from family or community members where they could go to seek help calling health facilities for information or finding out about safe routes to travel for example one humanitarian worker said when you cut down the telecommunications networ

lawsuits are piling up less than a week after the deadly crowd crush at the astroworld concert and legal experts say the risk is mounting that juries could decide against rapper travis scott and the companies behind the tragic event in houston several legal experts told the associated press that scott s past incitement of concertgoers offers a history that could make it easier to pursue negligence claims against companies that planned and managed the show which killed eight people and left hundreds injured and although the investigations have just begun experts expect dozens more lawsuits seeking damages that could climb into hundreds of millions of dollars at the center of the legal maelstrom is scott a 30 year old rapper famous for whipping fans into a frenzy who has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges tied to stirring up crowds at previous concerts this put everyone on notice this is what has happened and there is no reason it can t happen again said john werner a lawyer in beaumont texas who is not involved in astroworld cases they know this is a situation that can get out of hand this tragedy was months if not years in the making wrote houston lawyer steve kherkher in a lawsuit demanding more than 1 million for a man trampled in the melee which he said was predictable and preventable given the rapper s history more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed so far against scott and several companies including entertainment giant live nation concert promoter scoremore a nonprofit managing the houston owned venue the complaints allege that organizers failed to take simple crowd control steps to staff properly and to act on early signs of trouble at the sold out concert at nrg park that attracted 50 000 fans advertisement the way the concert was set up planned organized and the way things were handled once there was a problem it boggles the mind lawyer tony buzbee said this week in announcing that he was suing on behalf of three dozen victims including 21 year old axel acosta who died buzbee s news conference played directly to the court of public opinion with the tone of an opening statement complete with slides and video clips he and other attorneys have seized on an early clue of trouble that came hours before the concert began when throngs of fans rushed past security and metal detectors through a fence whatever security they had was wholly insufficient said former federal prosecutor philip hilder a houston lawyer not involved in any astroworld case the crowd went right through hilder also criticized the event s 56 page planning document which was submitted to the city for approval he said the plans were boilerplate with too few details about the safety of the parking lot where the performance was held which had no seating or aisles and no pens to contain the crowds the planning document obtained by the associated press and shared with hilder mentions the possibility of tornadoes bomb threats active shooters civil disobedience and riots but makes no mention of a possible crowd surge advertisement several lawyers say litigation is also likely to focus on an unexplained delay between the time city officials declared a mass casualty event and when the concert organizers finally stopped the show a 37 minute gap during which fans kept pushing toward the stage collapsing and getting crushed the band kept going on and on long after the problem existed said frank branson a personal injury lawyer in dallas it s hard to believe that wasn t a conscious disregard to the audience to safety and welfare it s not clear what scott could see from the stage as his fans were getting pushed punched pinned and trampled some screaming out to stop the show on video posted to social media scott is seen at one point stopping the music pointing into the audience and asking for aid for someone security somebody help jump in real quick in an instagram post on saturday the rapper said he was devastated by the deaths and suggested he was unaware of the carnage below him anytime i can make out what s going on i stop the show and help them get the help they need he said i could just never imagine the severity of the situation advertisement representatives of scott did not respond to an email from the ap seeking comment on tuesday scott is famous for encouraging fans to ignore security and crowd surf and stage dive in the mosh pit below him a commercial for this year s astroworld event since removed from youtube shows fans breaking through barricades and storming the concert grounds at the 2019 event in 2015 chicago officials said scott encouraged fans at the lollapalooza music festival to vault security barricades the rapper was sentenced to one year of court supervision after pleading guilty to reckless conduct charges in 2017 scott was arrested after he encouraged fans to bypass security and rush the stage during a concert in arkansas leaving a security guard a police officer and several others injured scott faced several misdemeanor charges including inciting a riot he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid a fine scott is also being sued by a concertgoer who says he was partially paralyzed when he was pushed from a third floor balcony at a new york city concert in 2017 an incident the man says happened after scott encouraged people to jump dallas lawyer ellen presby said scott s past will help make a case against him but his likely defense will be to argue that he is just a performer who leaves the security details to other people which will make it more difficult to attach blame advertisement defense lawyers will argue what he does is hop on the stage and do his thing and it s all set up for him she said if she were defending him she added she would try to find facts that he was as surprised and horrified as everyone else houston attorney c j baker said a criminal filing against scott is possible given his past behavior but it would be a difficult case because it would have to establish intent not just carelessness you would need to show that he acted in a way that he sort of knew what was happening and acted that way anyway he said that is a much bigger much steeper hill to climb than the lawsuits houston lawyer joel androphy said most law firms are likely to focus on civil suits that pile on defendants with resources to pay out big damages aside from scott the biggest legal target is live nation a publicly traded company whose stock has soared as fans rush to more concerts and festivals now that many pandemic restrictions have been lifted the company has declined to comment on what went wrong but issued a statement monday that it is helping police with a criminal investigation and will address all legal matters at the appropriate time the company reported it held 4 6 billion in cash as of september its stock fell less than 1 tuesday afternoon after plunging more than 5 a day earlier suing houston and harris county for negligence would be difficult given that both enjoy broad protection under the doctrine of sovereign and government immunity but there are exceptions several lawyers said they re mostly protected but their conduct is going to be looked at with a critical eye said houston lawyer randy sorrels past president of the texas state bar association send questions comments to the editors previous next
electric vehicle startup workhorse group is hemorrhaging money during the company s third quarter earnings call workhorse reported an 81 million loss blaming an increase in operating costs and a suspension of production due to recalls revenue is also in the negative to the tune of 576 600 which is largely related to refunds issued to customers who had their c 1000 cargo delivery vans recalled due to safety issues workhorse sold 41 vans this year before it had finished ensuring the design was in compliance with federal safety standards set by the national highway transportation and safety administration nhtsa the company was forced to suspend sales in order to complete testing recall all of the vehicles and slow production to two trucks per week workhorse ceo rick dauch admitted on tuesday that aside from federal safety issues the c 1000 just might not be up to the task of heavy duty deliveries the company is performing additional testing of the current truck design which dauch said is presently not robust nor is it profitable what s more likely to happen is that workhorse will scrap it and reconfigure the van s design altogether something the company said it might do back in august workhorse said it expects to provide a production forecast early next year even going so far as to promise delivery of best in class vehicles for the commercial electric vehicle market starting in 2023 that might be hard to do without raising more money from investors who are likely wary of empty promises dauch took the helm of workhorse in july when the company was chaotically trying to ship its non compliant vehicles that were built with parts bought via online auctions from asia dauch acknowledged that he inherited a company plagued by poor leadership and a lack of communication with a cash burn rate that was not only unsustainable but also downright detrimental workhorse s supply chain was and remains not yet tier 1 qualified and it lacks a range of systems for production which in all fairness is common for a startup says dauch workhorse is also currently under investigation by both the securities and exchange commission and the justice department the company said in a regulatory filing on monday the sec probe is related to trading in the company s securities before the award of a united states postal service contract to build the agency s next generation mail truck workhorse ended up not winning that bid which caused its shares to plummet the justice department s investigation is related to the sec probe according to the new york times despite powerful headwinds dauch thinks workhorse is still poised for success in large part due to macroeconomic trends and regulatory factors that are driving future growth the pandemic only solidified the importance in e commerce that the entire world is experiencing with tightening government emissions regulations and the passing of the u s infrastructure bill the need for electric delivery vans will only grow no one has yet cornered this market so workhorse thinks it still has time to get itself together and take a slice of that pie we have near term financial flexibility based on our improved balance sheet and reduced monthly cash consumption rate said dauch during the conference call also noting workhorse s solid purchase orders and strong customer support in the third quarter of 2021 workhorse s selling general and administrative expenses which include higher compensation related costs due to increased headcount severance pay stock based compensation legal costs and insurance costs increased to 10 6 million compared to 6 million in the same period last year in june workhorse filed suit in the u s court of federal claims against the usps for awarding its contract to defense contractor oshkosh defense workhorse had been fighting for this coveted spot since 2015 the startup dropped the lawsuit in september probably after it had a look at its balance sheet and realized it couldn t afford to take usps to court indeed during the earnings call workhorse cfo greg ackerson pointed to dropping the lawsuit as one of the key actions taken to reduce spending workhorse also converted 172 5 million of debt into equity slowed inbound material eliminated air freight and reduced consulting by adding in house expertise according to ackerson that said the startup s r d expenses increased to 2 8 million compared to 1 6 million in q3 of 2020 which was related mainly to increased headcount and higher consulting costs presumably workhorse needs to spend a little more on talent in order to get a functioning and safe electric van that s ready for production before the company loses its loyal customer base

being a full fledged member of any society was an important thing in many of the world s oldest cultures to be a part of the community of the tribe or the family is one of the strongest human needs because those that are left ostracized and unaccepted will suffer hardships and possibly death but in remote corners of the world not everyone was deemed fit to become a part of the society that s why complex and often brutal initiation rites were invented these were tests of prowess manhood or womanhood those who passed these difficult initiation rites were accepted as full fledged members of the family but these tests were simple or peaceful often enough they were straight out horrifying initiation rite 1 surviving stinging ants in the amazon the sateré mawé people are one of the oldest native tribes of brazil they live deep in the amazon and nowadays number a little over 10 000 people like many of the tribesmen living in the amazon jungle they have complex and intriguing initiation rites and theirs is by far the most brutal one the sateré mawé devised a complex test of manhood those who pass this initiation rite would become full fledged warriors with a fearsome reputation to boot the rite involves surviving ant stings the elders of the tribe catch a whole bunch of bullet ants paraponera clavata which are known for their extremely painful bite equal to a bullet shot hence their name the elders proceed to render the ants unconscious they do so by placing them into a natural sedative they create this allows them to handle the insects easily following this each ant is woven into a pair of specially crafted gloves made out of palm leaves the gloves resemble large oven mitts hundreds of ants are densely packed into these gloves their stings pointed towards the inside and then the young boys of the tribe enter the initiation rite by wearing these gloves for more than five minutes the ants sting his hands repeatedly and the boy is exposed to extreme agony it is said that such pain is unlike anything a man can experience when the ordeal is done the boy is in terrible agony the ant venom courses through his body numbing it and causing hallucinations because of the intense pain his hands become paralyzed and violent tremors shake his body continuously sometimes for days but that s just the first part of the initiation rite to become a warrior the boy must complete the same process twenty times over the course of several months a sculpture of maasai warriors on a lion hunt which was also an initiation rite for individual potential warriors transitions abroad initiation rite 2 africa s maasai lion hunt the maasai are one of africa s best known ancient tribes dwelling near the african great lakes these people pride themselves on their unique dress traditions and a very old way of life and one of the most important parts of their culture is a complex tradition historical practice and an initiation rite the lion hunt a very demanding rite of passage the lion hunt was meant to initiate skilled boys into the rank of brave warriors but the challenge was immense those who undertook it would show great bravery and this would be a sign of personal achievement in ancient times before contact with the outside world populations of both lions and the maasai were very high that s why the elders encouraged young men to go on solo lion hunts without anyone s help a warrior would expose himself to incredible danger facing a male lion with little more than a spear only the bravest future warriors would succeed in this task to make things more challenging the rule stated that the warrior could not hunt lions that were sick poisoned snared or otherwise incapacitated what is more the rules prohibited the hunting of lionesses the maasai considered them the bearers of life in every species so only the most dangerous male lions were hunted however over the years the lion populations shrunk considerably and hunting them became difficult thus the maasai developed olamayio the group hunt that ensured more success but even so the practice remains one of the most terrifying initiation rites in history just imagine yourself facing a raging lion armed with a spear you ll quickly understand why this would be a rite reserved only for the bravest the deadly vanuatu land diving platform with a young boy ready to leap paul stein cc by sa 2 0 initiation rite 3 the deadly vanuatu land diving ritual the country of vanuatu is an archipelago comprising 83 islands of various sizes on one of these pentecost island the tribesmen perform a death defying initiation rite that is listed amongst the world s deadliest tribal practices the rite can very easily end in death it is best described as the earliest form of and a precursor to bungee jumping as an initiation rite it is a sure way for a young man to prove his masculinity and to be initiated into the rank of the bravest warriors as a ceremony it is considered as a way to enhance the health and the abilities of all who jump the ceremony is also believed to cure illnesses and physical ailments that come with the annual wet season the rite begins with the construction of a tall tower it is made over the course of five weeks and can be up to 20 to 30 meters 66 to 98 feet high when finished essentially it is a series of scaffolding platforms and the jumpers can choose a height that is suited to their age once they commit they tie special vines around their ankles which are designed to prevent them from hitting the ground and dying as an added precaution the ground at the bottom of the platform is tilled to soften the impact the men who jump are defying death their goal is to brush their shoulders against the ground after plummeting down to the ground from an extreme height the ramshackle tower creaks and bends and the barely elastic vines tug violently on the man s legs in the end their bodies stop just barely off the ground and they are able to walk away safely but one simple mistake and all can end in death and disaster this initiation rite can be undertaken by both boys and grown men when boys receive their ritual circumcision around age seven they become eligible to make the jump by completing this incredible challenge they prove their masculinity to all the members of their tribe the four stage initiation rite of the matsë tribe in the brazilian jungle involves injecting the poison of the giant monkey frog into a tribe member s blood xapiriground initiation rite 4 the excruciating trials of the matsë tribe the matsë indians also known as matis are one of brazil s most remote amazonian tribes living deep in the isolated jungle areas of western brazil the matis were only discovered in the 1970s up to that point the tribesmen believed that the passenger planes flying high above the tree canopies were the spirits of their ancestors and the smaller two man planes that flew lower were considered to be harmful demon spirits outside contact nearly wiped the tribe out as smallpox was something their immune systems couldn t endure luckily the tribe managed to survive although in small numbers their straight out terrifying initiation rites take place in four separate stages before reaching manhood a boy of the matis tribe needs to prove himself worthy of hunting alongside other men to do so he needs to pass their initiation rites a complex four stage trial that places him in great danger and great pain the first part of the trial consists of temporary self blinding the boy puts a concoction of bitter and dangerous poison straight into his eyes the elders believe that once the sight returns if at all it is enhanced and will make the boy a better hunter enhancing the senses and improving vision next the boy endures a series of brutal whippings and beatings by the other men these are done with the stems of the rattan plant the whipping is supposed to help remove laziness the next step of the four stage trial is even more extreme the young man is injected with the poison of phyllomedusa bicolor giant monkey frog a small poisonous frog native to the jungles of brazil the poison is placed directly into the bloodstream and its effects are brutal if the boy proves his courage and does not vomit at once he is injected again what follows is light headedness violent vomiting and uncontrolled bowel movements in the end it is believed that the frog poison will greatly increase the man s strength and endurance finally in the fourth stage the initiate is body rubbed with the leaves of a poisonous plant this causes a heavy painful rash that lasts for hours and is believed to help the man with patience only after completing these demanding initiation rites are the men deemed worthy of accompanying others in the hunt the only catch is that these trials are repeated many times before every important hunting trip the mandan okipa spirit ceremony depicted in this painting by george catlin involved hanging initiates by their muscles and beating them george catlin public domain initiation rite 5 the mandan okipa spirit ceremony the mandan tribe of the great plains region of america is one of the best known and best documented tribes of the continent they lived in the area of what is now north dakota and were one of the great trading tribes and excelled in corn production they also had a complex set of traditions and beliefs all of which were well documented by european explorers in the late 1700s and early 1800s one of these was the okipa or sun dance ceremony it was a religious ceremony that was of the highest priority for the tribe but it was also an initiation rite offering a chance for young warriors to become respected and admired members of the tribe there were at least three purposes to the okipa the annual commemoration of the tribe s salvation from the primordial flood according to their myths to communicate with ancient spirits and summon buffalos and to give the chance for individuals usually men to complete vows given to the almighty spirit to prove their bravery and dedication but not everyone could endure this brutal ceremony only the bravest of warriors could get through this violent rite of passage before the ordeal chosen warriors would not eat drink or sleep for four days afterwards they were led to the great hut where the ordeal began they were required to sit smiling while elders pierced their shoulders and chest thrusting skewers behind the muscles next ropes were tied to the skewers and the warriors suspended in mid air hanging there until they fainted elders would add more weight to their legs in order to increase agony and tension on their muscles next they were removed from the skewers and upon awakening the approval of the great spirits was confirmed in gratitude the warriors would offer their left little finger which was cut off as a sacrifice with a hatchet in the last step of the ordeal the men would race around the village dragging their weights behind them until they ripped out of the skin alongside the skewers this marked the end of a grueling ordeal men who completed the rite twice in their life would gain everlasting fame in their tribe the hamar people of southwestern ethiopia are famous for their bull jumping initiation rite which is also dangerous and sometimes deadly this photo shows them preparing for this rite veleknez adobe stock what would you do to become a part of your community in primitive societies young braves and would be warriors were ready to complete anything just so they could become a proven member of the community it was the adventure of a lifetime the annual event that everyone spoke of in hushed voices men and women who didn t complete these tests would be looked down upon lacking bravery and the attributes of their sex there s no doubt that these initiation rites required great courage and endurance and that they left the initiates tougher and bolder for the rest of their lives but they were also foolish and dangerous and put the young people at great risk sometimes these rites of initiation would end in death but for the people who practiced these rites death was the will of the great spirits top image the super painful initiation rite of the sateré mawé people one of the oldest native tribes of brazil

production and planning for cash flow self sufficiency at keno hill all major ppe expenditures for the site are complete and our q4 focus is on completing underground development to achieve concurrent ore production from the bermingham and flame moth mines early development ore from the 1150 level at bermingham was stockpiled in september and is now moving through the district mill and producing a high grade silver concentrate as anticipated underground advance rates this quarter were up approximately 26 over q2 2021 which has allowed us to reach the first two ore access levels at flame moth with initial ore production anticipated in late q4 2021 once the flame moth alimak raise is completed in early 2022 we will be able to fill the mill and sustainably reach our targeted production levels this quarter also saw us complete drilling on the bermingham northeast deep exploration target which has returned some exceptional interim results with composite assays to 1 681 g t ag over 20

lawsuits are piling up less than a week after the deadly crowd crush at the astroworld concert and legal experts say the risk is mounting that juries could decide against rapper travis scott and the companies behind the tragic event in houston several legal experts told the associated press that scott s past incitement of concertgoers offers a history that could make it easier to pursue negligence claims against companies that planned and managed the show which killed eight people and left hundreds injured and although the investigations have just begun experts expect dozens more lawsuits seeking damages that could climb into hundreds of millions of dollars at the center of the legal maelstrom is scott a 30 year old rapper famous for whipping fans into a frenzy who has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges tied to stirring up crowds at previous concerts this put everyone on notice this is what has happened and there is no reason it can t happen again said john werner a lawyer in beaumont texas who is not involved in astroworld cases they know this is a situation that can get out of hand this tragedy was months if not years in the making wrote houston lawyer steve kherkher in a lawsuit demanding more than 1 million for a man trampled in the melee which he said was predictable and preventable given the rapper s history more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed so far against scott and several companies including entertainment giant live nation concert promoter scoremore a nonprofit managing the houston owned venue the complaints allege that organizers failed to take simple crowd control steps to staff properly and to act on early signs of trouble at the sold out concert at nrg park that attracted 50 000 fans the way the concert was set up planned organized and the way things were handled once there was a problem it boggles the mind lawyer tony buzbee said this week in announcing that he was suing on behalf of three dozen victims including 21 year old axel acosta who died buzbee s news conference played directly to the court of public opinion with the tone of an opening statement complete with slides and video clips he and other attorneys have seized on an early clue of trouble that came hours before the concert began when throngs of fans rushed past security and metal detectors through a fence whatever security they had was wholly insufficient said former federal prosecutor philip hilder a houston lawyer not involved in any astroworld case the crowd went right through hilder also criticized the event s 56 page planning document which was submitted to the city for approval he said the plans were boilerplate with too few details about the safety of the parking lot where the performance was held which had no seating or aisles and no pens to contain the crowds the planning document obtained by the associated press and shared with hilder mentions the possibility of tornadoes bomb threats active shooters civil disobedience and riots but makes no mention of a possible crowd surge several lawyers say litigation is also likely to focus on an unexplained delay between the time city officials declared a mass casualty event and when the concert organizers finally stopped the show a 37 minute gap during which fans kept pushing toward the stage collapsing and getting crushed the band kept going on and on long after the problem existed said frank branson a personal injury lawyer in dallas it s hard to believe that wasn t a conscious disregard to the audience to safety and welfare it s not clear what scott could see from the stage as his fans were getting pushed punched pinned and trampled some screaming out to stop the show on video posted to social media scott is seen at one point stopping the music pointing into the audience and asking for aid for someone security somebody help jump in real quick in an instagram post on saturday the rapper said he was devastated by the deaths and suggested he was unaware of the carnage below him anytime i can make out what s going on i stop the show and help them get the help they need he said i could just never imagine the severity of the situation representatives of scott did not respond to an email from the ap seeking comment on tuesday scott is famous for encouraging fans to ignore security and crowd surf and stage dive in the mosh pit below him a commercial for this year s astroworld event since removed from youtube shows fans breaking through barricades and storming the concert grounds at the 2019 event in 2015 chicago officials said scott encouraged fans at the lollapalooza music festival to vault security barricades the rapper was sentenced to one year of court supervision after pleading guilty to reckless conduct charges in 2017 scott was arrested after he encouraged fans to bypass security and rush the stage during a concert in arkansas leaving a security guard a police officer and several others injured scott faced several misdemeanor charges including inciting a riot he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid a fine scott is also being sued by a concertgoer who says he was partially paralyzed when he was pushed from a third floor balcony at a new york city concert in 2017 an incident the man says happened after scott encouraged people to jump dallas lawyer ellen presby said scott s past will help make a case against him but his likely defense will be to argue that he is just a performer who leaves the security details to other people which will make it more difficult to attach blame defense lawyers will argue what he does is hop on the stage and do his thing and it s all set up for him she said if she were defending him she added she would try to find facts that he was as surprised and horrified as everyone else houston attorney c j baker said a criminal filing against scott is possible given his past behavior but it would be a difficult case because it would have to establish intent not just carelessness you would need to show that he acted in a way that he sort of knew what was happening and acted that way anyway he said that is a much bigger much steeper hill to climb than the lawsuits houston lawyer joel androphy said most law firms are likely to focus on civil suits that pile on defendants with resources to pay out big damages aside from scott the biggest legal target is live nation a publicly traded company whose stock has soared as fans rush to more concerts and festivals now that many pandemic restrictions have been lifted the company has declined to comment on what went wrong but issued a statement monday that it is helping police with a criminal investigation and will address all legal matters at the appropriate time the company reported it held 4 6 billion in cash as of september its stock fell less than 1 tuesday afternoon after plunging more than 5 a day earlier suing houston and harris county for negligence would be difficult given that both enjoy broad protection under the doctrine of sovereign and government immunity but there are exceptions several lawyers said they re mostly protected but their conduct is going to be looked at with a critical eye said houston lawyer randy sorrels past president of the texas state bar association by bernard condon associated press condon reported from new york associated press writers juan lozano and robert bumsted in houston and gary gerard hamilton in new york contributed to this report

bank of canada governor says central bank s role includes reducing inequality ottawa the governor of the bank of canada has laid down an argument for the central bank s actions during the pandemic hours after the country s opposition leader suggested the bank stay in its inflation targeting lane the bank of canada enacted extraordinary measures during the pandemic to keep credit flowing and encourage low interest rates to spur demand its program to purchase government bonds known as quantitative easing encouraged low rates on things such as mortgages and business loans while keeping borrowing costs low for a federal government spending historical amounts on emergency aid speaking to a conference of central banks tiff macklem said creating an inclusive recovery was fundamental to the central bank s role in helping to manage the economy macklem echoed calls earlier in the day by his american counterpart that leaving untouched entrenched inequalities holds back some citizens and economies from realizing their full potential macklem also said talk about how to create an inclusive recovery shouldn t be seen as an expansion of central bank mandates but rather it is already part of their marching orders this conversation in central banks has sparked a debate about whether central banks are expanding their mandates whether we re overreaching and getting distracted from our focus on inflation targeting and even a criticism that we should stay in our lane he said tuesday my own view is that we are tasked with serving our citizens not some of our citizens macklem made the comments to end the conference on diversity and inclusiveness organized jointly by the bank of canada the u s federal reserve the bank of england and the european central bank the bank of canada is set to host the conference next year but before that the federal government has to renew the bank of canada s mandate which has happened every five years over the last three decades the bank has been charged with anchoring inflation to between one and three per cent a range that often sees it target price increases to roughly two per cent the pandemic upended the central bank s inflation framework first by dropping inflation in 2020 to 0 7 per cent and now sending the consumer price index to an 18 year high the annual inflation rate was 4 4 per cent in september amid supply chain issues that macklem has warned will push up inflation rates further keeping them higher for longer the inflationary roller coaster has sparked calls on parliament hill from the opposition conservatives that the central bank s own actions coupled with historic deficits are driving up the cost of living speaking to reporters earlier in the day conservative leader erin o toole warned prime minister justin trudeau that the central bank s marching orders should focus only on inflation targeting and nothing more we re really worried about our economic future o toole said after unveiling pierre poilievre a frequent critic of the central bank as his new finance critic we also don t think the mandate of the bank should be extended we ve been very clear on that to include a range of other factors we have to focus on our fundamentals a decision on the central bank s mandate should be made by the end of this year or early next the tories have also taken aim at the central bank s quantitative easing program which reduced returns on short term government bonds and likely made buyers think more about long term bonds that lock in debt at today s low interest rates macklem said tuesday that the bond buying program challenged public perceptions of the bank of canada s independence from political influence he also said it is more important than ever for central banks to be clear about their actions and objectives trust comes when everyone understands the actions we are taking and why he said this report by the canadian press was first published nov 9 2021

many people remember the winter storm in february last year power and water went out across the state of texas winter is just a month or so away so students need to start thinking about preparing for the worst for about a week many texans had no power and no water some people s homes were almost at freezing temperatures families huddled in single rooms together trying to keep warm from the fatal outside temperatures pet owners prayed their pets would survive especially people with cold blooded animals like reptiles some households didn t prepare with canned foods or water and had to ration the power outages are said to have caused 700 deaths it was a horrible time and it was more horrible to learn that it could have been avoided by preparing the power grid thankfully power plants are now required to prepare their facilities for the winter and extreme conditions which hasn t been done or been required by a governing body in texas before it s a work in progress but hopefully the changes will be evident in the winter while texas lawmakers have passed legislation to make the power grid better people shouldn t solely rely on the government and power companies to figure everything out they should prepare to make it on their own in case the worst happens it s important for students to have non perishable food on hand in case of an emergency like extreme weather canned and dry food is the best since you may not be able to warm up frozen food in the microwave if you lose power even many on campus residence halls last year lost power during the winter storm of course uh dining will take care of you if you have a meal plan but their food may be be prepackaged sandwiches and chips if campus loses water and the staff can t cook uh dining may have to change locations too if the dining halls lose power it s good to have food of your own just in case water is another thing you should stock up on water since many neighborhoods didn t have it for residential students uh will provide water but it may take time for them to get supplies so you want to make sure you have extra water to wash your hands and drink until then students should also make sure they have portable chargers lanterns flashlights and candles if their building allows them to make sure they have light as well as a way to charge their electronics in case the power goes out one of the most important things is to make sure you keep warm if the heat goes out having plenty of blankets is good and handwarmers can be useful a tent can also be used to trap heat inside having all the household members sleep in one room is also a good idea to maximize body heat it s important to make sure you re prepared this winter in case things go awry with the grid again however make sure not to overbuy and hoard these items as other people need them just buy a few items every time you go grocery shopping winter is just a couple months away and in order to avoid the disaster of last year students should make sure they re prepared well in advance anna baker is an english senior who can be reached at

clynt nauman chairman and ceo with ore extraction completed at bellekeno and our team now completely focused on our two new mines bermingham and flame moth we are rapidly moving closer to full production and planning for cash flow self sufficiency at keno hill all major ppe expenditures for the site are complete and our q4 focus is on completing underground development to achieve concurrent ore production from the bermingham and flame moth mines early development ore from the 1150 level at bermingham was stockpiled in september and is now moving through the district mill and producing a high grade silver concentrate as anticipated underground advance rates this quarter were up approximately 26 over q2 2021 which has allowed us to reach the first two ore access levels at flame moth with initial ore production anticipated in late q4 2021 once the flame moth alimak raise is completed in early 2022 we will be able to fill the mill and sustainably reach our targeted production levels this quarter also saw us complete drilling on the bermingham northeast deep exploration target which has returned some exceptional interim results with composite assays to 1 681 g t ag over 20 37 meters true width we are currently advancing the work required to develop a new mineral resource estimate for the bermingham deposit to include the northeast deep zone to be completed later this

lawsuits are piling up less than a week after the deadly crowd crush at the astroworld concert and legal experts say the risk is mounting that juries could decide against rapper travis scott and the companies behind the tragic event in houston several legal experts told the associated press that scott s past incitement of concertgoers offers a history that could make it easier to pursue negligence claims against companies that planned and managed the show which killed eight people and left hundreds injured and although the investigations have just begun experts expect dozens more lawsuits seeking damages that could climb into hundreds of millions of dollars at the center of the legal maelstrom is scott a 30 year old rapper famous for whipping fans into a frenzy who has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges tied to stirring up crowds at previous concerts this put everyone on notice this is what has happened and there is no reason it can t happen again said john werner a lawyer in beaumont texas who is not involved in astroworld cases they know this is a situation that can get out of hand this tragedy was months if not years in the making wrote houston lawyer steve kherkher in a lawsuit demanding more than 1 million for a man trampled in the melee which he said was predictable and preventable given the rapper s history more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed so far against scott and several companies including entertainment giant live nation concert promoter scoremore a nonprofit managing the houston owned venue the complaints allege that organizers failed to take simple crowd control steps to staff properly and to act on early signs of trouble at the sold out concert at nrg park that attracted 50 000 fans advertisement the way the concert was set up planned organized and the way things were handled once there was a problem it boggles the mind lawyer tony buzbee said this week in announcing that he was suing on behalf of three dozen victims including 21 year old axel acosta who died buzbee s news conference played directly to the court of public opinion with the tone of an opening statement complete with slides and video clips he and other attorneys have seized on an early clue of trouble that came hours before the concert began when throngs of fans rushed past security and metal detectors through a fence whatever security they had was wholly insufficient said former federal prosecutor philip hilder a houston lawyer not involved in any astroworld case the crowd went right through hilder also criticized the event s 56 page planning document which was submitted to the city for approval he said the plans were boilerplate with too few details about the safety of the parking lot where the performance was held which had no seating or aisles and no pens to contain the crowds the planning document obtained by the associated press and shared with hilder mentions the possibility of tornadoes bomb threats active shooters civil disobedience and riots but makes no mention of a possible crowd surge advertisement several lawyers say litigation is also likely to focus on an unexplained delay between the time city officials declared a mass casualty event and when the concert organizers finally stopped the show a 37 minute gap during which fans kept pushing toward the stage collapsing and getting crushed the band kept going on and on long after the problem existed said frank branson a personal injury lawyer in dallas it s hard to believe that wasn t a conscious disregard to the audience to safety and welfare it s not clear what scott could see from the stage as his fans were getting pushed punched pinned and trampled some screaming out to stop the show on video posted to social media scott is seen at one point stopping the music pointing into the audience and asking for aid for someone security somebody help jump in real quick in an instagram post on saturday the rapper said he was devastated by the deaths and suggested he was unaware of the carnage below him anytime i can make out what s going on i stop the show and help them get the help they need he said i could just never imagine the severity of the situation advertisement representatives of scott did not respond to an email from the ap seeking comment on tuesday scott is famous for encouraging fans to ignore security and crowd surf and stage dive in the mosh pit below him a commercial for this year s astroworld event since removed from youtube shows fans breaking through barricades and storming the concert grounds at the 2019 event in 2015 chicago officials said scott encouraged fans at the lollapalooza music festival to vault security barricades the rapper was sentenced to one year of court supervision after pleading guilty to reckless conduct charges in 2017 scott was arrested after he encouraged fans to bypass security and rush the stage during a concert in arkansas leaving a security guard a police officer and several others injured scott faced several misdemeanor charges including inciting a riot he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid a fine scott is also being sued by a concertgoer who says he was partially paralyzed when he was pushed from a third floor balcony at a new york city concert in 2017 an incident the man says happened after scott encouraged people to jump dallas lawyer ellen presby said scott s past will help make a case against him but his likely defense will be to argue that he is just a performer who leaves the security details to other people which will make it more difficult to attach blame advertisement defense lawyers will argue what he does is hop on the stage and do his thing and it s all set up for him she said if she were defending him she added she would try to find facts that he was as surprised and horrified as everyone else houston attorney c j baker said a criminal filing against scott is possible given his past behavior but it would be a difficult case because it would have to establish intent not just carelessness you would need to show that he acted in a way that he sort of knew what was happening and acted that way anyway he said that is a much bigger much steeper hill to climb than the lawsuits houston lawyer joel androphy said most law firms are likely to focus on civil suits that pile on defendants with resources to pay out big damages aside from scott the biggest legal target is live nation a publicly traded company whose stock has soared as fans rush to more concerts and festivals now that many pandemic restrictions have been lifted the company has declined to comment on what went wrong but issued a statement monday that it is helping police with a criminal investigation and will address all legal matters at the appropriate time the company reported it held 4 6 billion in cash as of september its stock fell less than 1 tuesday afternoon after plunging more than 5 a day earlier suing houston and harris county for negligence would be difficult given that both enjoy broad protection under the doctrine of sovereign and government immunity but there are exceptions several lawyers said they re mostly protected but their conduct is going to be looked at with a critical eye said houston lawyer randy sorrels past president of the texas state bar association send questions comments to the editors previous next

the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allied producers opec has shrugged off pressure from president joe biden for higher production yesterday the group reaffirmed its plans to add 400 000 barrels per day to the market each month the biden administration is deeply concerned about gasoline prices and broader inflationary pressures and escalating rhetoric suggests it feels compelled to act unfortunately presidents have few good options to counteract high gasoline prices and most market interventions could backfire for several weeks the biden administration has blamed opec for high gasoline prices in the united states white house officials have pressured saudi arabia the united arab emirates and other opec states to pump more oil but on november 4 opec brushed off pressure from the united states and other major consumers for even higher production the group is content with higher oil prices in the fourth quarter and pleased that the supply deficit has been draining inventories most importantly opec is wary of oversupplying the market heading into 2022 citing downside demand risks from covid 19 and new non opec supplies expected next year saudi energy minister abdulaziz bin salman attributes high gasoline prices in the united states to low inventories refinery outages from hurricane ida and high ethanol prices he even tried to argue yesterday that opec is acting as a responsible regulator of the oil market the biden administration criticized opec and suggested it will act but most options are risky and could bring unintended consequences the white house has made several small moves but could consider a sale of strategic reserves moves to relax ethanol blending requirements for refiners or the nuclear option of restricting exports of crude oil it is worth examining the impact and risks of each option small toolkit blunt instruments a strategic petroleum reserve spr sale is biden s most likely move the spr established after the 1973 oil shock to counter disruptions to crude supplies currently holds about 613 million barrels as of june 2020 sour crude sulfur content greater than 0 5 percent made up about 60 percent of spr barrels and sweet crude the remaining 40 percent typically presidents have authorized spr emergency releases only in response to disruptions such as the first gulf war 1991 hurricane katrina 2005 and outages in libya 2011 the department of energy has also conducted spr exchanges to address short term supply disruptions from hurricanes effectively loaning crude to refiners to be repaid with interest in the form of additional barrels an spr sale of 20 million barrels is already underway this fall as part of plans approved by congress in 2015 to hold non emergency sales to help meet spending needs an spr sale potentially as part of a coordinated release under international energy agency auspices is probably the least cost option for biden a sale of up to 30 million barrels could be completed within two weeks and would show that the white house wants to cool prices but the spr is meant to cope with short term market disruptions not structural or longer term supply issues the impact of a sale would be short lived and it is not clear that releasing strategic stocks would help the market to adjust any faster than it would otherwise at the moment gulf coast refineries might welcome more sour crude following the outages associated with hurricane ida but generally the u s refining system is not short of crude and as always gasoline prices in the united states reflect global market conditions the biden administration could also try to support refiners the price of renewable identification numbers rins the credits generated by producers of renewable fuels that are traded as the currency of the renewable fuels standard have climbed rapidly mostly due to costlier feedstocks for renewable fuels rin prices have lifted renewable volume obligation costs and probably added 15 cents to the per gallon price of gasoline in october according to esai energy the biden administration has limited recourse to control rin prices but it could slow walk efforts to introduce blending requirements for 15 percent ethanol blend e15 gasoline generally the white house might be inclined to take actions to lower compliance costs associated with renewable fuels especially for small refiners oil market chatter has suggested a potential white house move to restrict crude oil exports largely based on one comment last month by energy secretary jennifer granholm but this is very unlikely the international emergency economic powers act gives the president the authority to restrict crude oil exports in the event of a national emergency the 2015 legislation that repealed the crude oil export ban also allows some exceptions under extraordinary circumstances for example if the president finds that crude oil exports have led to shortages or harmed u s workers but 80 per barrel crude hardly constitutes a national emergency and reimposing a ban on crude exports could backfire banning exports could potentially help u s refiners to access cheaper domestic crude but would create a quality mismatch for refineries configured to run heavier rather than light sweet crude east coast refineries also price petroleum products based on brent and higher input prices would lead them to pass on costs to consumers in the form of higher gasoline prices moving crude or products from the gulf coast to the east coast is constrained by jones act requirements and waivers are complicated and controversial a move to restrict crude oil exports would also be a political minefield with intense backlash in energy producing states where producers and coastal refineries want export options in short reimposing a crude oil export ban could have disastrous effects time for a recalibration presidents seeking to tame gasoline prices have few options but rhetoric from the white house probably has a bigger impact than risky short term market interventions biden defending his calls for opec to produce more oil has noted that the energy transition will take time but his administration could use this opportunity to soften its messages on energy it is unfair to blame biden for the run up in oil prices killing the keystone xl pipeline had nothing to do with the current market and despite its efforts to restrict new leasing his administration is approving drilling permits on public lands at a healthy clip the argument that the environmental social and governance movement climate activists and a sympathetic white house are killing off investment in the oil patch does not hold up under scrutiny still the biden administration has taken oil and gas investment for granted and is now discovering that the shale sector is simply not as elastic as it used to be after years of delivering poor returns oil and gas companies face investor pressure to maintain capital discipline and prioritize debt repayments and shareholder returns u s oil production will grow in 2022 but not at the breakneck speed of previous years it is riskier to impose restrictions on a leaner industry the administration s best move would not be an spr sale or tweaks to renewable fuel standards or a crude export ban but rather a recalibration biden can make the case that in order to accelerate the energy transition we need continued investment in oil and gas to meet energy security needs not just from opec states but on public and private lands prices at this level are a headache
