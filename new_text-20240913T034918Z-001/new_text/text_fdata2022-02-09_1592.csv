sanctions threats are not even worth responding to the foreign ministry has said washington s rhetoric about the possibility of imposing colossal sanctions on russia is so outrageous that moscow sees little point in even responding one of the country s top diplomats has said in an interview with ria novosti on tuesday deputy foreign minister alexander pankin was asked about the possibility of washington imposing unprecedentedly harsh measures on the russian energy and financial sectors including additional sanctions on the nord stream 2 pipeline linking the gas fields of siberia to consumers in germany it s long been clear to everyone that american legislators have lost touch with reality and are living in a kingdom of their own phobias regarding our country churning out obscurantist plans to deter russia on all fronts with any justification or without one pankin replied i don t see the point in reacting to the capitol s routine initiatives about this we can only repeat once more our regret about what has happened and confirm that there will inevitably be negative consequences from the harsh restrictions laid on us by the western initiators of such measures the diplomat added asked whether russia is prepared for the possibility of being cut off from the swift banking system which some american and european leaders have threatened if moscow decides to invade ukraine pankin said our hope is that as opposed to washington s completely unjustified movement towards the sanction field reason will still prevail in brussels and these measures will not happen which would damage the stability of the international finance system itself as well as global economic recovery and the possibility of fulfilling the sustainable development goals on time last month the us congress and the biden administration announced that they were considering imposing unprecedented economic sanctions on russia if it attacks ukraine including measures that could cause a stock market crash and financial pain for millions of families moscow has insisted that it has no plans to invade its neighbor and has called for security agreements that would limit the activity of nato the us led military bloc in eastern europe rt com
when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is a part of that but i don t think we re there yet and we do have to be vigilant about what s coming next npr s allison aubrey contributed to this report copyright 2024 npr to see more visit missing

beijing china the viewership for the beijing winter olympics opening ceremony broadcast by nbc averaged only 16 million u s viewers 43 percent below the 2018 games in south korea that saw 28 3 million viewers this year saw a record low for the opening ceremony with the previous low being 20 1 million at the 1988 calgary games nbc said the 16 million viewers was a total audience delivery and includes all of its networks and streaming alternatives meaning the television only audience was below 14 million viewers for the day while more viewers eventually tune in for the competitions the host country china is a serious problem for nbc efforts to increase its viewership many countries including the u s are staging a diplomatic boycott of these games due to china s oppression of the uyghurs a minority ethic group of mostly muslims in the far northwest part of the country china denies the charge but has also banned united nations human rights officials from entering the region also its severe anti covid measures have made life inside its closed loop a stressful and near joyless experience for athletes who have complained about the fear of positive tests substandard conditions in isolation centers and guarding against local authorities hacking their phones and computers the opening ceremony at the famed bird s nest stadium in beijing was scaled back to just over two hours and was a far cry from the expansive welcoming and celebratory show that opened the 2008 summer games it also contained what many could consider as propaganda such as a speech delivered by international olympic committee president thomas bach the opening events ended with china displaying cross country skier dinigeer yilamujiang who the state run media said has uyghur heritage as one of the cauldron lighters meant to be a clear counter to the claims of genocide
facebook meta stocks plummet has facebook peaked facebook now living under its new parent company meta may not be the media darling it once was photo by omar marques sopa images sipa usa via ap images social media has facebook peaked bu experts on the plummeting stock of parent company meta and facebook s first drop in daily users the financial news headlines on february 3 were dire meta erases 251 billion in value biggest wipeout in history bloomberg announced the verge declared facebook lost daily users for the first time ever last quarter michael nathanson an analyst at brokerage moffett nathanson wrote in his note facebook the beginning of the end not so fast facebook now living under its new parent company meta may not be the media darling it once was but it s hardly on the brink of bankruptcy the company made 40 billion in profit last year mostly from advertising janna greenberg a college of communication professor of the practice photo by jackie ricciardi and while the main facebook app lost a million daily users in north america alone last quarter the company still has 1 9 billion users around the world the stock plummet came five months after facebook founder mark zuckerberg meta chief executive said the company would switch its focus to the metaverse virtual reality headsets augmented reality glasses and virtual worlds the market losses might not hold especially given the recent wild fluctuations in the tech market bloomberg noted when it comes to meta facebook the company and its users says digital advertising expert janna greenberg things are complicated the college of communication professor of the practice began her career in advertising in silicon valley bu today talked with greenberg and another university expert marshall van alstyne a questrom school of business professor of information systems and a questrom professor in management about meta facebook s latest travails what s driving them and what lies ahead q a with janna greenberg and marshall van alstyne bu today how do you interpret meta facebook s huge drop in market value what s behind it and what does it mean for meta s future marshall van alstyne i think this drop is born of some surprises some business model shifts and some long term pent up frustration with facebook the surprise was a first ever fall in monthly average users despite numerous past challenges facebook has always managed to grow its user base a drop off is a sign of weakness that is new the business model shift is both internal and external internally facebook has shifted focus toward the metaverse a direction that is unlikely to pay off for many years to come mobile was already mainstream when facebook made that jump not so for virtual reality which is still very niche externally apple changed its privacy policy so users need to opt in this has hurt facebook likely shaving 10 billion off its future income and shifting advertising away from facebook toward apple and google firms that have other ways to track users from operating systems search maps entertainment etc google is even the default search engine in safari so it has not been hurt as much by apple s privacy changes marshall van alstyne a questrom school of business professor of information systems and a questrom professor in management photo by david sella the pent up frustration has been a long time coming facebook has become the worst of the bad boys among big tech ever since cambridge analytica the problem is that the news of bad behavior just keeps coming with its role in election interference promoting negative body image among teenage girls antivax messaging from the disinformation dozen promoting ethnic violence in myanmar and of course its role in enabling coordination among the insurrectionists the continuing placement of profits over people has led to public departures of key employees who have become concerned about the ethics of it all fixing the ethical issues putting people over profits surely will not improve facebook s bottom line in the short run janna greenberg i think what happened last thursday has to do with apple versus facebook there s the facebook user experience what you and i know and then there s the back end of facebook which is the advertiser experience that s what contributed to the stock decline last week facebook serves as an advertising placement engine for small businesses meaning you go into a portal and you say here s my communication objective here s the audience i m going after here s how much i m willing to spend on that audience here s the goal i m driving purchases those four things are measurable inside facebook what a powerful tool facebook allowed a lot of small brands think of warby parker and away luggage to launch themselves and become successful they had facebook as a powerful and effective tool what made this tool so powerful was its self serve nature and how precise the data was in terms of targeting and measurement the cost of that is privacy in july apple updated its operating system which allowed consumers to opt in to being tracked while in ios most people opted out leaning into a privacy stand and apple can do that without a single dollar being lost so what facebook lost is the ability to see what goes on outside its platform in the safari browser or in ios and that makes facebook s ability to target measure and attribute its performance less accurate that s what contributed to the value drop the performance aspect but the stock price didn t drop enough to be wow we really should examine why facebook doesn t matter anymore bu today do you think the market is getting tired of mark zuckerberg as kara swisher suggests in her recent new york times column van alstyne i think kara is right about this she might however underestimate mark s resilience he is bright and savvy and it s his company he pushes extremely hard for it to succeed as whistleblower francis haugen suggests however he has just been too willing to put profits ahead of ethics bu today is this about meta facebook losing influence and younger users to tiktok and how might they turn that around or is too late van alstyne yes meta facebook is losing influence among younger users and to tiktok specifically but the issues go beyond that it extends to the internal and external business model shifts as well as the larger social frustrations the latter will make it harder for folks to willingly come back another challenge is that antitrust scrutiny is making it harder for facebook to grow by acquisition instagram and whatsapp were great purchases from an investor perspective these opportunities will be harder to pursue with a newly activist federal trade commission source comscore magna 2021 greenberg facebook said that for the first time their daily users declined by half a million people the total number of daily active users is 1 9 billion people so it s not over for facebook what facebook reports for monthly active users rose 4 percent compared to a year ago maus are roughly 2 9 billion what s important are maus this is the key metric that meta uses to gauge its global user size on facebook this includes people that visit facebook on a website mobile device messenger app anytime during the 30 day period a 4 percent increase is not an impressive number but it s not irrelevant either the younger generation uses facebook but a lot less than their older counterparts they re on instagram which is owned by facebook there s so much to say about all this tiktok is exceptionally entertaining it s had this very very deep impact on what people like how they re viewing content the role of influencers the role of dynamic atomized content students love tiktok everyone loves tiktok we re in a world where anyone is a content creator tiktok is putting some competitive pressure on facebook if you look at social media usage in terms of monthly active users facebook is in the top five it s facebook youtube what s app facebook messenger and instagram four of those are owned by facebook blanket statements about media and trends are complicated to make in this day and age things require a closer look

off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is a part of that but i don t think we re there yet and we do have to be vigilant about what s coming next npr s allison aubrey contributed to this report copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

chunyip wong e via getty images the investment thesis in nov 2021 i published an article entitled â 80 target price supported with oil price well above breakevenâ for exxon mobil nyse xom the main arguments were a the oil prices were well above exxonâ s breakeven price about 45 per barrel based on my analysis b even at its compressed valuation 8x price to cash flow multiple each additional 1 of oil price increase should boost the stock price by about 1 6 per share therefore supporting an 80 target price c key catalysts include the resurgent petroleum demand for travel recovery post covid 19 and also the expected supply shortage in the near future and now xomâ s price has already reached 82 surpassing my prediction sooner these above catalysts have actually played out better than i expected however these catalysts are far from done and are still unfolding the shortage turns out to be more severe and president bidenâ s ability to influence oil prices is rapidly diminishing as a result i m still bullish about xom and you will see that investment in xom not only provides good odds for a sizable return i now anticipate a 115 target price but also serves as a hedge against inflation and political uncertainties seeking alpha short term issues and long term oil commodity cycle according to the latest fuel data from the american automobile association the average gasoline price at gas stations in the us has risen to 3 435 per gallon the highest in the united states since 2014 president biden is working hard to curb the rise in oil prices biden is trying to keep crude oil at around 80 and gasoline at around 3 30 but the oil price hikes suggest that biden s ability to influence oil prices is rapidly diminishing he could choose to release the strategic petroleum reserves â sprâ to fight the surging oil prices the spr is a u s government complex of four sites with deep underground storage caverns created in salt domes along the texas and louisiana gulf coasts but currently the use of spr is a tough decision for several reasons a the build up of geopolitical tensions in the russia region and b at the same time the us spr stocks are at their lowest level since october 2002 according to the department of energy inventory the current spr inventory is only at 587 million barrels to put things under perspective the spr was filled to its then 727 million barrel authorized storage capacity on december 27 2009 the inventory of 726 6 million barrels was the highest ever held in the spr american automobile association expanding our horizon to the longer term the oil price rally is overdue and now might be the starting point of a new oil commodity cycle the oil price has been consistently beaten inflation in the past until it stopped for the past 10 years or so as you can see from the following chart crude oil price is now where it was 10 years ago as a result a rally in oil prices is overdue the recent rally to 90 per barrel is only the beginning and oil prices have more catch up to do in the near future especially as inflation is surging author and yahoo finance oil prices have been consistently rising faster than inflation in the past as shown by the long term data tracked by the u s energy information administration â eiaâ in the next chart in this chart the orange shows the prices of oil unadjusted for inflation and the blue line shows the real prices adjusted for inflation and according to eia these prices are adjusted in the following way the real prices are computed by dividing the nominal price in a given month by the ratio of the consumer price index in that month to the cpi in some base period the real petroleum prices spreadsheet and charts are updated every month so that the current month is the base period in the monthly price series consequently all real prices are expressed in current dollars and any current month price may be compared directly with any past or projected real prices as now you can see the nominal oil prices over the past 50 plus years have been rising at 5 9 cagr over this same period of time inflation has been 3 9 cagr on average so as a result oil prices have consistently beaten inflation by a whole 2 however commodity prices are notoriously cyclical and oil is no exception as you can see from the second chart oil prices stopped rising not even keeping up with inflation for the past 10 years or so crude oil price today is where it was more than 10 years ago it should be at least 125 per barrel now even if it just kept pace with the average inflation the recent oil price rally marks the beginning of the next cycle and there s more catch up left to do in the near future eia a 115 target price the next table shows how much stock price change can be driven by a 1 change in oil price currently the stock is valued at about 10x cash flow right around its historical average as long as the oil price is above the breakeven point every 1 increase in oil price would contribute 2 3m of additional income per day for xom at its current production rate and on an annual basis this translates into about 0 84b of additional income or 0 2 per share as shown below therefore at this average valuation each additional 1 of the oil price increase can still boost the stock price by about 2 0 per share 0 2 per share of additional cash flow 10x cash flow multiple hence at this average valuation multiple another 15 oil price rally i e around 105 would send the stock price above 110 and recall that oil price should be at least 125 per barrel now even if it just kept pace with the average inflation over the past decade the table below considers more combinations of possible effects of oil price and valuation multiples on the target price the color in the background shows the possibility of each combination the darker the background color the more probable the scenario is expected to materialize and the numbers highlighted in red are the most likely scenario given the business fundamentals and catalysts in the near term as seen even with a combination of a modest 105 per barrel oil price and a stagnant valuation of 10x cash flow a target price near 115 can be supported conservatively author based on seeking alpha data risks upside risks this analysis only considers the profits driven by oil price and ignores all the other profit drivers such as natural gas and its downstream chemicals as two notable examples downside risks there are some downside risks too the biggest one as i can see is the pace and degree of the post covid economy recovery although the vaccination is progressing extensively and the economy is re opening at a good pace however the pandemic is far from over yet and uncertainties like the delta and omicron variant still exist which can trigger another wave of travel restrictions and contraction of fuel demand another near term risk involves domestic political uncertainties research from bank of america shows that biden s approval ratings are being impacted by inflation they re showing a divergent trend as seen as inflation surged from 1 4 in january last year to 7 in january this year biden s approval is falling from 56 to 42 with oil being a key component in the inflation index and restrictions biden faces in using the spr such political uncertainty could cause market fear and impact xom however given xom s very reasonable valuation and the temporary shortage of oil supply the impact of such political uncertainties on xom should be smaller than those on other stocks in the general market so xom effectively can serve as a hedge against such uncertainties in the long term our world needs to and is moving away from fossil fuels it is uncertain how soon the world can totally transitions into a carbon free future and how effective xom can adapt in the meantime bank of america conclusion and final thought my last article argued an 80 target price for xom as oil price well above breakeven based on a few near term catalysts including its compressed valuation 8x price to cash flow multiple at that time resurgent petroleum demand of travel recovery post covid 19 and also the expected supply shortage in the near future these catalysts have played out better and xom price reached 80 sooner than i expected however these catalysts are far from done and are still unfolding the shortage turns out to be more severe and president bidenâ s ability to influence oil prices is rapidly diminishing as a result i m still bullish about xom investment here not only provides good odds for a sizable return i now anticipate a 115 target price but also serves as a hedge against inflation and political uncertainties
when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in

contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the

when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each

2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing

keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the

and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus

the delaware court of chancery recently issued a significant ruling involving common special purpose acquisition company spac practices and disclosures that occur when a business combines with a spac see in re multiplan corp stockholders litigation c a no 2021 0300 lww del ch jan 3 2022 the stockholder plaintiffs alleged that the spac s sponsor and directors failed to disclose material information and breached their fiduciary duties by prioritizing their own interests when approving an unfair merger and that the stockholders were deprived of the right to make a fully informed decision about whether they should exercise their rights of redemption plaintiffs claims are based in part on alleged inadequate disclosures about the value of multiplan s business and the failure to disclose that multiplan s largest customer was creating an in house product that would make multiplan s services unnecessary the court denied defendants motion to dismiss and held that the plaintiffs claims involved direct and cognizable harm to spac stockholders from the alleged damage to their redemption rights and could go forward in reaching its conclusion the court had to determine which standard of review was appropriate to analyze whether the plaintiffs had properly alleged a breach of the fiduciary duty of disclosure was it the deferential business judgment standard which establishes a presumption that directors decisions are based on sound business judgment or the entire fairness standard which places the burden on the defendants to prove that the challenged transaction was entirely fair to the company s stockholders in multiplan the court determined that the entire fairness standard of review applied for two separate reasons first the spac s ceo and chairman michael klein controlled the spac through his relationship with the sponsor and he would receive a unique benefit from the de spac transaction specifically the court noted that klein s stocks and warrants had value if the merger resulted in a share price well below 10 04 the common stockholders however only received value if the shares were worth 10 04 or more the court said that this constituted a special benefit second each of the directors held founder s shares and would enjoy unique benefits different from other stockholders importantly the court found that this was true even though the founder s shares were converted in the de spac transaction to the same consideration as the public shareholders shares because of this the court found that a majority of the spac directors could not independently consider the de spac transaction because they were self interested in the business combination significantly the court reached this conclusion while acknowledging that the structure of the de spac and the directors incentives and benefits had been properly disclosed to spac stockholders and that the spac shareholders understood the general structure of the transaction the court found that the shareholders did not however agree that they did not require all material information to decide whether to redeem or accept post closing public shares specifically the court held that plaintiffs properly alleged that the definitive merger proxy contained false and misleading disclosures because it did not disclose that multiplan s largest customer was developing in house technology that would eliminate the need for multiplan s services and ultimately would be a competitor of multiplan the court noted that their analysis and outcome may have been different if the de spac disclosures had been adequate suggesting that shareholder claims arising from a fully informed decision to redeem in a de spac may be dismissed key takeaways and things to consider while the delaware chancery court s decision reinforces the importance of full and adequate disclosure of the details of a de spac transaction like in the context of traditional mergers the court left many unanswered questions for another day will other courts adopt the entire fairness standard of review to challenge de spac transactions or will this standard will be limited to fact patterns similar to multiplan what disclosures are adequate to address the court s concern about founder s shares are there specific fact patterns for de spac transactions that could invoke the business judgment standard of review when will plaintiffs be able to successfully challenge a de spac based on the board s actions and when will they be able to successfully challenge the disclosures each of these questions is important to consider in future structuring and transactional decisions for spacs this information is intended to inform firm clients and friends about legal developments including recent decisions of various courts and administrative bodies nothing in this practice update should be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion and readers should not act upon the information contained in this practice

amidst a recent uproar that nearly 10 of san francisco housing stock is still just sitting vacant supervisors dean preston kicked off a campaign to get a vacancy tax on this november s ballot when a city report dropped last week showing that nearly 10 of sf housing units are vacant 40 458 total housing units vacant according to the city s budget and legislative analyst s office it was widely assumed in media coverage that this report would be a prelude to supervisor dean preston kicking off a campaign to get a vacancy tax on the ballot barely a week after that report was released preston s vacancy tax campaign is underway on the steps of city hall tuesday morning preston and supporters did indeed announce their intention to get that vacancy tax on your november 2022 sf ballot calling it the empty homes tax announcing empty homes tax with a few friends let s do this pic twitter com jpt61ttxw0 dean preston deanpreston february 8 2022 in a city with a chronic shortage of affordable housing and more than 8 000 people living on our streets it is unconscionable that we have tens of thousands of homes sitting empty preston said in a release the empty homes tax will incentivize property owners to do the right thing and turn vacant units into places san franciscans can call home image dean preston s office preston s office predicts in the release that said vacancy tax would raise more than 38 million annually by taxing owners with three or more vacant units that have been empty for longer than six months the chart above shows the proposed tax rate in terms of how this money would theoretically be used the chronicle reports that half of its revenue would fund rental subsidies for seniors and low income families while the other half would support a new program to help the city buy empty buildings and convert them into affordable housing this is a tax increase in san francisco which means voters would have to approve it the empty homes tax campaign would need 9 000 valid signatures by july 11 to make the november ballot the measure would only need a simple majority to pass and implement the tax that simple majority is not a foregone conclusion as nbc bay area notes the legislative analyst s housing data is from 2019 so opponents will surely call its current accuracy into question the proposed tax would surely draw the ire of the california association of realtors and other large lobbies so it s a fair bet that opponents of the tax will significantly outspend supporters of the tax and some voters may just feel it s a bad idea a vacancy tax makes no sense tenderloin housing clinic executive director randy shaw told the chronicle last week it creates this false sense that we don t need to build more housing a few other cities have tried vacancy taxes sometimes successfully preston s office notes that a 2016 vacancy tax in vancouver is credited with bringing more than 18 000 units online since it went into effect that said san francisco is not vancouver though hollywood often uses vancouver as a backdrop to depict san francisco why because market forces are different in vancouver so it s cheaper to make a movie there and that may be an issue for the vacancy tax too some cities may look like san francisco at first blush but our economies behave differently so a san francisco vacancy tax might not produce the same 18 000 available units that it did in vancouver related report 10 of san francisco s housing stock is just sitting vacant and empty image belle co via pexels

working interests and slightly greater activity the company encountered a delay on a five well pad in january that will impact the timing of production until later in the year while whiting has shifted operations to the sanish field the company s continued focus on sustainability through increasing its high gas capture percentage will result in production volumes not entirely replacing those lost by the delay the 2022 plan is to reinvest approximately 40 of the expected ebitda for the period which is consistent with the prior year low double digit inflation has also been built into the projections the rigs will operate in mountrail mckenzie and williams counties north dakota while the company has had success with three mile laterals in its sanish field whiting plans to drill

propx to optimize liberty platform with enhanced technology and scale record revenue proppant and stages pumped in 2021 best safety performance in company history in 2021 2021 was a record year for liberty work performed whether measured by revenues frac stages or pounds of sand pumped we also set many operational records during 2021 all of this was achieved in challenging times and executed with our best safety performance in company history commented chris wright chief executive officer in 2021 the focus was the integration of onestim and its customers into liberty we acquired onestim to strengthen our platform and technology portfolio during a downturn to position us for today s rising tide and all future cycles in our eleven year history we have seen two deep downturns 2015 to 2016 and the recent covid induced downturn and we have executed transformative transactions during both investment decisions at liberty are always made with a long term time horizon continued mr wright business integrations are always challenging this time exacerbated by covid impacted supply chain and difficult labor challenges however the prize was large and our team worked in overdrive to bring nearly 2 000 new team members into liberty while continuing to deliver superior service performance to all of our customers both legacy and new in the fourth quarter we estimate integration and transition activities negatively impacted adjusted ebitda by over 20 million we were simply not willing to sacrifice customer service employee satisfaction and safety each of which is critical to long term financial success even though there was a financial cost to our 2021 financial results integration related costs are still with us today impacting our bottom line results however january was a significant turning point in moving these cost pressures behind us continued mr wright outlook the transformative work our team accomplished in 2021 positions us well as our industry begins an upcycle driven by rapidly tightening markets for oil gas seven years of subdued global investment in upstream oil and gas production is now colliding with record global demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids today and likely record global demand for oil later this year oil and gas are central to the global economy which is well along the way of recovering from the global pandemic the severe energy crisis that has wracked europe over the last several months demonstrates the danger of underinvestment in our industry e p operators are responding to oil and gas price signals the public operators are maintaining discipline and will show only modest production growth this year while the private operators are reacting more robustly to strong commodity prices within the frac market two years of supply attrition and cannibalization plus constraints from labor shortages and a secular shift towards next generation frac fleet technologies has led to tightness in the frac space liberty has focused on finding the right long term partnerships for the coming years and has been very disciplined in holding our active frac fleet count steady until returns are strong in the first quarter we expect high single digit sequential revenue growth and strong improvement in our margins as integration costs start to fade away we are benefiting from increased pricing in 2022 driven by a pass through of inflationary costs and higher net service pricing we expect continued modest rises in frac pricing in subsequent quarters we also expect margin growth as our new strategic efforts begin to pay dividends in lowering our cost of operations and increasing efficiency commented mr wright we are excited for the opportunity ahead and are investing to build truly differential competitive advantages in frac fleet technology digital systems and logistics optimization bolstered by the propx acquisition we expect that our investments today will lead to strong returns in the coming years

of asset acquisitions gain or loss on the disposal of assets bad debt reserves and non recurring expenses that management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance our board of directors

when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think

maryland governor larry hogan a moderate republican has announced that he will not run as a gop challenger against sen chris van hollen d md dashing hopes that the seat could be flipped because hogan s second term the final term allowed to him under the maryland state constitution ends in 2023 and because of his significant popularity in the otherwise blue state some republicans saw a unique opportunity to flip the seat if hogan had run and won the race it would be a historic reversal in the 2016 election hillary clinton received 60 33 percent of the vote compared to only 33 91 percent for trump in the 2020 election trump fared even worse receiving only 32 15 percent of the vote compared to biden s 65 36 percent the state has not elected a republican to the senate in over four decades its last gop senator the late charles mathias was reelected to a final term in 1980 since then maryland s two u s senate seats have remained solidly in the hands of democrats still while democrats perform exceedingly well in maryland s national elections state level elections there are as in other states more nuanced despite maryland s heavily democrat leaning political landscape hogan was elected as governor in the state by an approximately four point margin in 2014 in 2018 hogan ran for and won a second term receiving an impressive 12 point lead still few other state level republicans have had such success as such van hollen had little to fear under normal electoral circumstances but republicans and democrats alike recognized that hogan could throw a wrench into van hollen s reelection campaign and could have turned his easy glide to reelection into a tense politically fraught battle during a press conference on tuesday hogan made the announcement that he would not pursue the option he thanked the people who have been encouraging me to consider it but he continued as i have repeatedly said i don t aspire to be a senator and that fact has not changed hogan s final decision does not come as a surprise as he has made clear in the past that he was not considering it very seriously it s not something that i m really taking a serious look at hogan said on cnn s state of the union when asked if he would run for the senate though his centrist political positions were a necessary ingredient for victory in maryland they may have been more polarizing if hogan had moved into the arena of national politics in oct 2018 shortly before he was reelected as governor hogan signed a law that significantly restricted gun ownership in the state in addition to barring convicted domestic abusers from owning firearms the bill controversially banned bump stocks a rifle attachment which stabilizes the gun and can help to increase its rate of fire depending in part on the experience and skill of the user after signing the law hogan made a public break with the national rifle association nra which has itself been criticized by gun rights activists for its historical acquiescence to regulations that many other gun rights groups argue violate the 2nd amendment though he was endorsed by the nra in 2014 hogan said that he would not accept an endorsement from the group in 2018 hogan has also often broken with president donald trump over immigration issues hogan criticized trump s efforts to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca program a holdover from president barack obama s time in office critics of the policy have argued that the program which came into being through an executive action rather than through the legislature was an illegal use of presidential power hogan also recalled maryland national guard troops from the u s border with mexico over disagreements with the trump administration s zero tolerance policy hogan has also said that while he opposes abortion he would make no effort to change abortion law as early as the 1990s well before some democrats had accepted abortion hogan is on the record stating that he does not think that abortion should be outlawed these attitudes while perhaps necessary ones to win moderate marylanders put hogan in stark contrast to many other republicans if he had run for the senate his position on these and other issues likely would have spawned significant criticism from other republicans and could have left hogan ostracized from the party still hogan could have been a welcome improvement over van hollen for republicans particularly ahead of a senate race that is expected to be slightly favorable to democrats in november 34 senators including 20 republicans and 14 democrats are up for election or reelection despite wide expectations that the gop will take back the house the battle for the senate will be a tough one for both parties democrats are desperate not to find themselves in another evenly split senate during the 118th congress since neither joe manchin d w va nor kyrsten sinema d ariz are up for reelection in november the moderate duo has brought to a halt many of the democrats most expansive political aspirations during the 117th congress democrats will need to pick up a net gain of two seats in november to meet their political goals republicans are just as desperate to avoid this scenario which would potentially allow democrats to overturn the filibuster and pass wide reaching legislation to retake the majority they need only a net gain of one seat but they also have several more seats on the defensive than democrats
when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think

when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is

share facebook twitter linkedin pinterest while the american lamb checkoff rate is not changing how the mandatory assessments are collected for animals sold through market agencies is changing the change applies to animals sold through auctions including sale barns video online sales and sales at shows and fairs these auctions will now collect both live weight assessments and per head first handler assessments the change was implemented in january however the delayed enforcement date for submitting these assessments is march 22 2022 this allows time for auctions to adjust their systems without a penalty for late payments if a producer or feeder sells animals to a first handler and has already paid the checkoff at an auction a refund will be issued to receive a refund documentation will be required from the time of sale the national lamb checkoff directed by the american lamb board alb is funded by mandatory assessments checkoff paid by all segments of the sheep industry by federal law all sheep or lambs of any age including ewes rams feeder and market lambs breeding stock and cull animals are subject to the national lamb checkoff assessment at the time of every sale the mandatory american lamb checkoff assessment rates do not change the live weight assessment is 007 cents per pound and the first handler assessment is 42 cents per head it s important to remember that the sheep industry passed the mandatory american lamb checkoff so it would be equitable and beneficial for both those owning the lambs prior to slaughter and those who harvest the meat that s why there are both live weight and per head assessments and these collections are only from u s born animals allowing funds to specifically promote american lamb this does not change said peter camino alb chairman buffalo wy the changes had to go through a vigorous usda process to fully understand the value of these changes a refresher about this particular checkoff helps when the mandatory american lamb checkoff was enacted in 2002 most lambs were marketed through traditional channels the lamb industry has evolved considerably in the past 20 years particularly the growth of non traditional markets for example direct sales to consumers ethnic and farmers markets and butcher shops now participate to a larger degree in the purchasing and processing of lamb and lamb products the 2002 lamb promotion research and information order mandates that live weight assessments be collected from producers or feeders and be forwarded to the next purchaser if applicable at the end of the process the first handler usually the processor or exporter is responsible for submitting all live weight and per head assessments to the alb this is known as a pass through method with the bulk of collections made at the end of the process alb listened to industry input and it became clear that changes to the collection process were necessary to maintain a fair and efficient mandatory american lamb checkoff for the entire industry and to reduce the burden on those collecting it assessments need to be collected at the time of sale instead of the original pass through method more information on how the mandatory american lamb checkoff works and how to pay or request refunds is at lambresourcecenter com the usda agricultural marketing service website on the lamb program is also a good resource the american lamb board was put into place by the 2002 lamb promotion order alb is an industry funded national research promotion and information checkoff program that works on behalf of all american producers feeders seedstock producers direct marketers and processors to build awareness and demand for american lamb alb conducts promotion and research programs with the goal of creating greater demand and profitability for the entire industry alb does not promote imported lamb it does not promote wool alb is not funded by dues and is forbidden by law to influence legislation it exists to promote lamb to consumers and provide information to help producers raise lamb more efficiently and effectively

when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is a part of that but i don t think we re there yet and we do have to be vigilant about what s coming next npr s allison aubrey contributed to this report copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
bloomberg senate majority leader chuck schumer endorsed banning stock trading by members of congress giving additional momentum to an idea that s being pushed by progressive democrats and conservative republicans alike we have different bills from a variety of different members and i ve asked our members to get together and try to come up with one bill schumer told reporters tuesday when asked if he d like to see a stock trading ban on the senate floor this year but i would like to see it done senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he hasn t yet given much thought to banning securities trading though he added that he has invested in mutual funds rather than individual stocks that s what i advise members to do because i think it prevents such suggestions that you are engaged in insider trading he said we ll take a look at that kind of legislation and see what may be appropriate proposals to ban lawmakers from holding individual securities have percolated in congress for several years without getting very far yet over the past several weeks in the wake of revelations about tardy disclosures by members and stock trading by federal reserve officials democrats and republicans in the house and senate have proposed new legislation schumer s backing puts him at odds with house speaker nancy pelosi who favors disclosure of trades but opposes a ban she asked the committee on house administration to examine compliance with the current law and possibly stiffen penalties current law prohibits members of congress and other government employees from using nonpublic information gleaned in the course of their duties for personal benefit and requires disclosure of securities trades by members spouses or dependent children of more than 1 000 critics say the law is too easily skirted the disclosure requirements too loosely enforced and the penalties too lenient senator jon ossoff a georgia democrat spearheading one such effort said tuesday he wants to collect feedback from colleagues on his bill by the end of the week in hopes of getting prompt senate consideration this is like a five page bill ossoff said in an interview this is not complex so let s hammer it out let s put it on the floor in the next few weeks let s keep it moving senator mark kelly an arizona democrat who is working with ossoff on the bill however cautioned against moving too quickly i think it s more important to get it right than to get things done based on an arbitrary timeline kelly said other senate democrats who have pushed a ban on stock trading by senior government officials include banking chairman sherrod brown and elizabeth warren of massachusetts republicans who have introduced their own versions include senators ben sasse of nebraska and josh hawley of missouri house members supporting a stock ban include an eclectic mix that includes progressive democrats like alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and pramila jayapal of washington state moderate democrats like jared golden of maine and abigail spanberger of virginia as well as republicans such as chip roy of texas and brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania 2022 bloomberg l p

bloomberg even after a correction in tech stocks and surging yields on u s government bonds investors still don t understand the risks they re taking in equity and debt markets according to mark spitznagel manager of the best known fund protecting against so called black swan events there s a profound lack of appreciation for how dangerous the market is and how embedded all of this liquidity is in the financial system spitznagel the founder and chief investment officer at miami based universa investments said in an interview tuesday on bloomberg television like others such as gmo s jeremy grantham spitznagel says asset prices have been grossly inflated by years of rock bottom interest rates and quantitative easing where he differs is in his approach to an impending crash spitznagel said he doesn t believe in trying to time the market instead universa tells clients to think of hedges not as a source of profit but rather as a kind of catastrophe insurance they should have at all times with the knowledge that they re protected in the event of a meltdown those investors can in theory take risk without the need for traditional diversification in the form of treasuries gold or hedge funds he said i don t agree that we can tactically trade this that we can time this he said grantham calls the market a super bubble and said a collapse has been underway since november he advises getting out of u s stocks owning commodities and gold and holding some cash wild though they may have felt the gyrations in stocks through the early weeks of this year haven t been sharp enough to trigger the hedges that produced a windfall for universa clients at the outset of the pandemic markets move a lot more than last month spitznagel said those types of moves those aren t the kinds of things that are really important those aren t the things that are consequential back in march 2020 as stocks collapsed and volatility soared universa was able to reap enormous profits on its option trades it told clients they made a 3 612 return that month and 4 144 in the first quarter of 2020 the california public employees retirement system had been one of those clients but it infamously scrapped one of those hedges and so missed out on a 1 billion payout at the time universa protected some 6 billion in client asset that has since grown to more than 15 billion 2022 bloomberg l p
sanctions threats are not even worth responding to the foreign ministry has said washington s rhetoric about the possibility of imposing colossal sanctions on russia is so outrageous that moscow sees little point in even responding one of the country s top diplomats has said in an interview with ria novosti on tuesday deputy foreign minister alexander pankin was asked about the possibility of washington imposing unprecedentedly harsh measures on the russian energy and financial sectors including additional sanctions on the nord stream 2 pipeline linking the gas fields of siberia to consumers in germany it s long been clear to everyone that american legislators have lost touch with reality and are living in a kingdom of their own phobias regarding our country churning out obscurantist plans to deter russia on all fronts with any justification or without one pankin replied i don t see the point in reacting to the capitol s routine initiatives about this we can only repeat once more our regret about what has happened and confirm that there will inevitably be negative consequences from the harsh restrictions laid on us by the western initiators of such measures the diplomat added asked whether russia is prepared for the possibility of being cut off from the swift banking system which some american and european leaders have threatened if moscow decides to invade ukraine pankin said our hope is that as opposed to washington s completely unjustified movement towards the sanction field reason will still prevail in brussels and these measures will not happen which would damage the stability of the international finance system itself as well as global economic recovery and the possibility of fulfilling the sustainable development goals on time last month the us congress and the biden administration announced that they were considering imposing unprecedented economic sanctions on russia if it attacks ukraine including measures that could cause a stock market crash and financial pain for millions of families moscow has insisted that it has no plans to invade its neighbor and has called for security agreements that would limit the activity of nato the us led military bloc in eastern europe rt com

when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is a part of that but i don t think we re there yet and we do have to be vigilant about what s coming next npr s allison aubrey contributed to this report copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
as investors catch their breath after a volatile start to the year a report from richardson wealth offers a warning if the reversals in january were tough to stomach it may be time to revisit your risk profile the firm s investor report for february released on tuesday noted that even well balanced portfolios suffered last month with bonds and equities down and international markets highly correlated after a formidable run since march 2020 with the s p 500 nearly doubling and the tsx up over 80 markets finally answered the volatility door in january that had been knocking repeatedly the report said news headlines and data that could have derailed equities throughout 2021 were finally heard leading to massive selloffs in many markets and sectors did the first month of 2022 mark the death of the buy the dip ethos the report suggested certain secular shifts could be underway a natixis investment managers survey of investment professionals late last year also pointed to shifts in asset allocation eight in 10 respondents in north america said investors have taken on too much risk in pursuit of yield during the prolonged low rate environment and now call for portfolio repositioning there were pockets of relief from last month s selloff the richardson report said while the s p 500 finished down more than 5 in january the s p tsx s large concentration in energy and financials helped it to almost eke out a positive month the report s authors said this points to the decade long trend of growth outperforming value finally running out of steam pandemic consumer trends focused on social isolation and goods are likely to crest this year it said with spending shifting back to services at the same time economic growth and earnings growth should remain above average while high inflation will continue to hobble growth stocks while the authors don t expect growth to go quietly into the night after a dominant decade a longer term rotation to value would create new winners and losers canada and europe would be favoured the report said while the s p 500 has become more concentrated on the growth side within the u s tilting more towards dividend paying companies reduces the growth exposure the report said even using an equal weighted etf has helped to reduce the impact of the growth names that have grown to be giants over the past decade of outperformance the report also noted that the u s led the economic recovery from the pandemic induced recession closing its output gap last year while some slack remains in canada and europe this so called catch up trade is another case for paring back overweight u s positions the managers surveyed by natixis also saw a rotation coming almost seven in 10 expect better returns from value over growth and 58 favour small cap companies over large cap however almost three in four expected big tech to grow unabated the richardson report also addressed fixed income investments at a time when rate hikes and an end to quantitative easing make bonds a scary proposition however the authors said they re starting to see decent value in bond markets again investment grade bonds over five years and long provincial bonds have yields around 3 and some long corporates are even higher this is providing decent real returns given long term inflation expectations still below 2 the authors wrote therefore it is time for investors to consider looking at fixed income again especially longer duration bonds the returns from the asset class will likely remain shy of what equity markets may return but they should exceed the returns on cash the natixis survey found investors remained committed to the role of fixed income in portfolios however 88 emphasized the importance of countering duration risk as rates begin to normalize and almost three in four recommended alternative strategies to generate yield with rates still historically low

spotify had been down 27 in jan given wider tech selloff so natural to see a relief rally while it looks like the idea that the controversy will have a lasting effect on spotify is unproven or false traders have shown that the mere notion of this happening can affect trading performance leading financial source dailyfx looks at whether people who are considered influential can directly change economic policy from a stock market point of view twitter traders whether you re a millennial on tiktok hoping to become the next viral sensation or someone who scrolls endlessly through instagram social media has fundamentally changed the way that we interact with each other and disseminate new information since the creation of twitter in 2006 the micro blogging platform has seen its user base grow significantly becoming a well renowned source of breaking news updated instantly by those who are closest to the event ranging from journalists government officials company executives or even a bored multi billionaire looking at you elon financial decisions of the masses aren t just informed by high ranking execs or ceos but also come from popular celebrities such as kylie jenner plenty of users and investors turned away from the snapchat brand in 2018 when the teen dissed the platform on twitter with stock prices dropping by 7 shares struggled to recover and a year later stocks were still down 50 from where it was before the tweet has twitter caused influential figures to have too much of a voice and the masses simply follow when it comes to the market justin mcqueen analyst at dailyfx comments for me this is a tough one to really pinpoint given that i have only been in markets since 2014 although looking back a key moment that provided a stark reminder of twitter s growing importance on financial markets had come after the hack crash in 2013 according to the associated press ap a false message stated that there had been two explosions at the white house with the president at the time barack obama being injured this saw around 130bln temporarily wiped from us indices before retracing in a matter of minutes shortly after the false tweet the white house spokesman noted that the president was fine while ap later stated that they had been hacked consequently with the impact seen by all that a tweet can have on financial markets this had sped up the process of traders adopting twitter as a means for monitoring breaking news however this example also highlights the fact that twitter is an unfiltered newswire where the authenticity of news can often come into question tammy da costa analyst at dailyfx also adds over the past decade tesla inc nasdaq tsla ceo and spacex founder elon musk have become a global icon of industry disruption as musk tests the technological boundaries his radical ideas combined with his desire to change the world have secured him a spot as one of the most well known social influencers who regularly exhibits how impactful social media and crowd psychology can be for global markets with over 50 million twitter followers and a growing brand it comes as no surprise that when the billionaire expresses his opinion on the social platform people listen and react and so do markets for those who don t recall elon musk s tweets played a major role in fueling the cryptocurrency rally last year after a number of key market participants followed musk in adopting bitcoin as an alternative method of payment while also adding 1 5 billion in the cryptocurrency to tesla s balance sheet likewise it was another one of musk s optimistic tweets that sparked a rapid surge in the demand for dogecoin allowing the meme based cryptocurrency to surge approximately 500 in a week although nobody can predict which market elon musk may tweet about next crowd psychology currently places a large amount of emphasis on elon musk s tweets his social media actions are unpredictable and serve as a poignant reminder of the importance of incorporating risk management into a trading strategy to help address what is unpredictable updated on feb 8 2022 3 18 pm
sanctions threats are not even worth responding to the foreign ministry has said washington s rhetoric about the possibility of imposing colossal sanctions on russia is so outrageous that moscow sees little point in even responding one of the country s top diplomats has said in an interview with ria novosti on tuesday deputy foreign minister alexander pankin was asked about the possibility of washington imposing unprecedentedly harsh measures on the russian energy and financial sectors including additional sanctions on the nord stream 2 pipeline linking the gas fields of siberia to consumers in germany it s long been clear to everyone that american legislators have lost touch with reality and are living in a kingdom of their own phobias regarding our country churning out obscurantist plans to deter russia on all fronts with any justification or without one pankin replied i don t see the point in reacting to the capitol s routine initiatives about this we can only repeat once more our regret about what has happened and confirm that there will inevitably be negative consequences from the harsh restrictions laid on us by the western initiators of such measures the diplomat added asked whether russia is prepared for the possibility of being cut off from the swift banking system which some american and european leaders have threatened if moscow decides to invade ukraine pankin said our hope is that as opposed to washington s completely unjustified movement towards the sanction field reason will still prevail in brussels and these measures will not happen which would damage the stability of the international finance system itself as well as global economic recovery and the possibility of fulfilling the sustainable development goals on time last month the us congress and the biden administration announced that they were considering imposing unprecedented economic sanctions on russia if it attacks ukraine including measures that could cause a stock market crash and financial pain for millions of families moscow has insisted that it has no plans to invade its neighbor and has called for security agreements that would limit the activity of nato the us led military bloc in eastern europe rt com
when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is a part of that but i don t think we re there yet and we do have to be vigilant about what s coming next npr s allison aubrey contributed to this report copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is a part of that but i don t think we re there yet and we do have to be vigilant about what s coming next npr s allison aubrey contributed to this report copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

delivery driver left through the back door of downing street on december 11 2020 while indoor socialising was banned he said i can confirm that no such public expenditure was accrued in relation to the matters considered in the investigations by the second permanent secretary or connected with associated media reports on this matter last month a picture emerged of a 142 chiller being delivered to the backdoor of downing street on december 11 2020 staff attending regular wine time fridays throughout the pandemic invested in the fridge to keep their bottles of white wine prosecco and beer cool sources told the daily mirror last month that the prime minister encouraged aides to let off steam despite indoor socialising being banned under lockdown rules reports that staff took a suitcase

different households from meeting indoors unless reasonably necessary for work purposes sue gray delivered her interim report into the downing street lockdown gatherings last week she said there was a failure of leadership and organisational change was needed in downing street mr ellis pictured last month ruled out that any public finds were spent on the now infamous wine time fridays fridge that was pictured being wheeled into number 10 during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown it also said at least some of the gatherings were a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected

london snubbed as tech giant arm eyes us float bosses set to pick wall st after collapse of 50bn deal british chip designer arm looks set to join the stock market in new york following the collapse of a 50billion takeover by american suitors in a bitter blow to the city of london the company s owner masayoshi son said he plans to float the cambridge firm on the technology heavy nasdaq exchange speaking last night after the takeover by nvidia was abandoned son said i believe that arm is about to enter its golden age we think that the nasdaq stock exchange in the us which is at the centre of global high tech would be most suitable for a listing the deal with nvidia fell apart amid opposition from regulators around the globe over concerns that it could damage competition but son whose company japanese giant softbank bought arm for 23billion in 2016 has come under mounting pressure to return it to the london stock market in a so called initial public offering ipo in a sign that britain would roll out the red carpet to bring the company home business secretary kwasi kwarteng told the daily mail personally i welcome a listing in london for arm and arm co founder hermann hauser said london is where arm belongs it s a uk company but whether london has a deep enough market to get an ipo of that size away is an issue the sale of arm nvidia fell apart amid opposition from regulators around the globe over concerns that it could damage competition others still believe there is time for arm to be courted and urged london officials to get a move on it is understood senior london stock exchange lse figures have had discussions with softbank bosses but executives at the nasdaq in new york are notoriously pushy when it comes to securing companies to list on the exchange russ shaw founder at tech london advocates said the race is on with new york and the clock is ticking if lse officials have not held talks already then they should be on the next flight to tokyo if arm made new york its home it would be a hammer blow for the uk last year chancellor rishi sunak launched two reviews to make london more attractive to technology firms tycoons hold firm s fate in their hands where arm floats is a decision for new chief executive rene haas and softbank chairman masayoshi son american haas replaced simon segars and has spent most of the last eight years in cambridge where arm is based he joined in 2013 and since 2017 has been president of arm ip products group arguably the firm s most important division it is likely he wants to keep the company as close to its cambridge roots as possible but son the second richest man in japan leans towards new york son chose a sale over a flotation as he believed it would be quicker but regulators scuppered that he studied economics in california but his experience on the us stock markets has been mixed and he has been burnt in 2019 son had tried to list one of softbank s major investments wework in the us but it quickly unravelled amid growing investor concerns over its corporate governance valuation and outlook son will look for advice from japanese bankers at mizuho sources say he has not ruled out tokyo or hong kong and arm could have a secondary listing on one of these stock exchanges he is said to be politically savvy and likely to listen to approaches from business secretary kwasi kwarteng or even the chancellor rishi sunak to come to london tech executives and investors have urged the government to speed up and deepen reforms to the uk listings regime to ensure fast growing firms come to london given concerns that momentum could slow this year last week bosses of tech groups such as checkout klarna and graphcore were invited to downing street to meet city minister john glen and officials to discuss the progress made in attracting founder led tech companies by the number arm 1990 arm setup in cambridge arm setup in cambridge 1998 joins london stock market joins london stock

struggling susannah streeter analyst at hargreaves lansdown said if the uk s largest home grown tech firms shuns london for new york it will be a major blow to london s ambitions and will pile pressure on the government to speed up reforms it may be seen as a vote of no confidence for london where newly listed tech companies have had a distinctly rocky ride over the past year softbank blamed significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction with nvidia the demise of the deal also brought a management shake up at arm with chief executive simon segars replaced by rene haas head of the company s intellectual property unit analysts say the deal was doomed after the federal trade commission in the us stepped in over christmas it followed uk digital and culture secretary nadine dorries ordering a probe into the takeover in november

20 2022 vic richey chairman and chief executive officer thanks kate and thanks everybody for joining today s call at the risk of being redundant i d like to start to call off again i think in our employees across the company for their ongoing efforts to manage the business there continues to be a lot of challenges to overcome on a regular basis we continue to see supply chain challenges with delivery cost inflation and the omicron variant of covid impacting our businesses despite of that our team continue to demonstrate tremendous resilience our employees are working very hard in doing all they can to support our customers and drive the business forward and for that i m very appreciative the business has continued to gain momentum as we start fiscal 22 two of our three business segments delivered organic sales growth in the first quarter we expect all three segments will deliver organic growth in the remaining three quarters we have a lot of confidence in that outlook due to our continued strong order output if you recall the fourth quarter of fiscal 21 had order growth of more than 30 while for the first quarter of 22 we achieved order growth of more than 40 compared to prior q1 our backlog is at a record level and that bodes well for the balance of fiscal 22 and beyond chris will get into some of the financial details in a few minutes i ll start off with some top level commentary on each of our business segments starting with a d we see the recovery continuing for this business we continue to monitor the commercial aerospace markets closely there ll likely be some more disruptions with travel as a pandemic situation continues we re undoubtedly seeing higher levels of business activity from our commercial aerospace customers 2020 and 2021 were really tough years in this market so we re glad to see the growth returning for a d overall we saw enter orders grew by 38 admittedly we were kind of coming off a low base but it is great to see the backlog rebounding like this you saw in a press release a mention of challenges regarding supply chain performance and labor availability those challenges are definitely being felt by the a d group in particular our california based businesses abaco pti and crissair are seeing challenges as we work to ramp to higher levels of business activity we did miss some sales in the quarter because of these challenges but the teams are highly focused on increasing capacity to meet our customer demand and we re confident that these are just timing issues within the year the last thing i wanted to mention regarding a d was our acquisition of neco which we were able to close in the first quarter and we re excited about what the neco brings to our portfolio this business will fold into our pti subsidiary bringing a solid management team with great product technologies we re very happy to have them on board similar to a d our test business also had a great orders performance in the first quarter quarters were nearly 68 million for the first quarter compared to 43 million in the prior year first quarter so the growth is significant and broad based with double digit increases in all global markets sales growth was a little lighter in q1 which we expected and we re planning to see strong sales performance over the coming quarters for test we continue to face some challenges with profit margins during the first quarter for test the margins were slightly down compared to what we had in our internal plans and as you saw in the press release you re also down versus prior year this has been a key focus for us no doubt the inflation challenges are acute for test so we have programs around cost management and price realization to help drive the margins as we move forward this segment is our largest user of freight services as we all know they are higher cost increases in this area which is also impacting our margins margin expansion needs to come as we grow this business that s a key part of our value story here and we re focused on achieving that result usg the story in q1 was a bit mixed we have the expected sales contributions from the recent acquisitions so it was nice to see that coming through integration of acquired businesses is going well and is on track we also saw another strong quarter for nrg so they continue to go very well in a renewable space we did experience some challenges at doble approximately 3 million of the sales shortfall was related to supply chain challenges with our contract manufacturer we also had tough comps over last year s q1 when customers release some funding for calendar year end purchases we didn t see a repeat of that during this first quarter but the comparison ease for doble over the coming quarters and we expect the growth to kick back in during q2 and q3 we continue to feel strongly that utility markets have very favorable growth characteristics over the long term and we also feel that the portfolio of companies that we put together will be very well positioned to take advantage of this growth overall the quarter came in right on top of the internal projections we had when the quarter started the high order activity supported a higher level of sales but we couldn t get that out the door given the supply chain and labor challenges at the end of the day we re on track for the 22 expectations that we laid out in november the plan is back end loaded that s consistent with our original projections and supported our backlog bottom line we feel good about where we are after the first quarter now i ll turn it over to chris chris tucker chief financial officer thanks vic i ll start with an overview of the consolidated financial performance in the quarter sales in the first quarter were up 9 compared to last year excluding the impact of acquisitions sales were down 1 with growth from the aerospace defense and test businesses being offset by a decline in the utility solutions group the acquisitions added 15 million to sales in the first quarter adjusted ebit margins were 9 3 in the quarter compared to 11 1 in the prior year quarter the margin decline was driven by decreases in the test and usg businesses interest expense in the quarter was 733 000 compared to 541 000 in the prior year due to higher borrowing levels taxes were 22 3 in q1 compared to 22 5 in the prior year all these items delivered adjusted eps of 0 46 per share below prior year s 0 52 per share but consistent with our internal forecast operating cash flow in the quarter was 1 9 million compared to 24 8 million last year the decrease was mainly due to milestone payments received last year which did not repeat this year and also payoffs of accrued expenses that exceeded prior year amounts inventory increases were unfavorable to cash in the quarter but this was more than offset by good performance on accounts receivable and accounts payable capital expenditures were 14 1 million in the quarter compared to 6 million in the prior year quarter this increase was driven by the purchase of the nrg headquarters building in q1 we were presented with a unique opportunity to purchase the building at a favorable price relative to annual rents and drive a cost reduction for this business turning to segment performance highlights in the quarter are as follows a d did see a return to growth in the quarter with reported sales up 5 4 excluding the impact of the neco acquisition these businesses delivered 4 1 sales growth in q1 we saw return the return of growth in the commercial aerospace markets with an increase of 11 driven by our pti subsidiary military aerospace was very strong with 36 growth crissair and mayday were key drivers of this growth the navy business grew 4 while sales to industrial customers which are a smaller part of the overall segment were down 43 as vic mentioned previously we did see very strong order growth by the a d group in q1 orders were up 38 with good activity across the military and commercial aerospace markets as well as navy business pti crissair mayday and westland all posted significant order gains and were the drivers of the 38 increase for the business usg saw reported sales growth of 16 4 in the quarter excluding the impact of the altanova and phenix acquisitions revenues were down 10 2 this decline was driven by doble which saw sales come in approximately 7 million below prior year about 3 million of this was driven by the supply chain challenge as vic mentioned earlier with the balance related to soft end markets the renewables business at nrg had another strong quarter and delivered 21 growth adjusted usg ebit margins in the quarter were 21 8 compared to 24 5 in the prior year q1 the reductions were driven by deleverage on the sales decline at doble and dilution from acquisitions orders for usg in q1 came in at 66 2 million which was a 36 increase backlog finished at 94 4 million compared to 44 9 million in the prior year quarter approximately 34 million of this increase was driven by the acquisitions for the test business we saw sales growth of 4 2 in the quarter the growth was led by strength in china which is continuing to see very high levels of activity for test and measurement projects we did see margin pressure in this business during the quarter as adjusted ebit margins went from 12 9 in the prior year to 9 2 in the current quarter the business is experiencing inflation driven by materials labor and freight as they manage increasing demand we re very focused on driving cost containment productivity and price increases to offset these impacts as we move forward on the orders front we saw continued strength in the pace of business for test orders were 67 9 million in the quarter which is an increase of over 50 compared to last year the top line outlook for this business is strong with order strength being experienced in all world areas that represents the summary for q1 financial performance as vic mentioned it looked like we could get a little better do a little better than our internal projections as the orders were so strong during the quarter but with persistent supply chain and labor challenges we ended up a bit constrained on the top line but we are still on track to deliver the year as laid out during our november earnings announcement and call if we turn to the guidance in the release we reiterated the earnings per share guidance for fiscal 22 calling for adjusted eps in the range of 3 10 to 3 20 or growth of 20 to 24 this year this earnings per share range assumes 2022 sales in the range of 815 million to 835 million or growth of 14 to 17 we re not breaking out guidance by quarter for 22 but we do expect only modest eps growth in the second quarter and very strong growth in q3 and q4 we are watching closely as the omicron variant was disruptive across the economy in january creating more employee absences and supplier disruptions as well it appears that things are stabilizing and as you can see we certainly have the backlog in place to drive to the guidance range so now i ll turn it back over to vic vic richey chairman and chief executive officer thanks chris since i touched on quite a few of my thoughts earlier in my commentary just offer a few more comments before we move into q a we feel good about the start of 2022 we re excited about the forecast we have out there lots of growth coming as we move into the second quarter and beyond backlog supports the outlook and we feel that esco is a good place right now the cycle of our different businesses are starting to kick in and that bodes well not just for 22 but the future years as well all our subsidiary management teams will be here in st louis next week i can ensure you will be focused on all the activities that must take place to get 22 delivered we see the businesses again in april for session more focused on long term growth and profitability it s always a fun time of the year knowing we ll have two in depth touch points coming up this allows us to drive proper alignment with the operating leadership it moves us toward our ultimate goal of profitable growth officially use the capital and higher returns so with that i think we re ready for q a questions answers operator our first question from the line of tom moll from stephens your line is open tom moll stephens inc analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions i wanted to start on doble today if i heard you correctly chris i think you said for the quarter the change was down 7 million which was the 3 million from supply chain issues at your contract manufacturer and then another 4 million on the tough compares from the budget flush at the end of the last calendar year so did i hear those numbers right and can you give any more context around it chris tucker chief financial officer yes you got it right i would say last year in q1 the growth wasn t explosive in the segment i think it was around 3 and but we were still kind of newer into the pandemic at that point and honestly we expected the numbers to be a fair bit lower last year we did see that kind of flush of year end stuff you mentioned that kind of gave us that growth a year ago so that s kind of the reference to that and the softer end markets this year where we didn t see a similar kind of activity but you had it right on the 7 million and the 3 million tom moll stephens inc analyst and just in terms of any context you can share on the issue there with the contract manufacturer does it feel like some all of that has been resolved as you go into q2 or that might be a nagging headwind for some time vic richey chairman and chief executive officer i would say more is going to resolve itself over the next six months i mean i d like to say it s all behind us but it s almost all chip issues i mean the boxes are built to ready to go but we do have some chip shortage at those places but i do want to make sure everybody understands we re not sitting on our hands just waiting for things to happen i mean we redesigned about 90 boards at doble last year to make sure we could keep up with this so we can get all the way there but have we not gone through that process over the past 12 months i think the impact of the supply chain would have been much more significant and that s probably something that we re going to continue to do i mean i d say through the first half of this year as these things kind of flush themselves out tom moll stephens inc analyst just moving to the higher level here again around usg and maybe doble specifically in the release you pointed to some of the themes that are probably become a little better known at this point just in terms of the overall electric utility market impacted by some of the reduced consumption potentially pandemic related at the same time in your outlook i think it s pretty safe to assume you re implying growth for doble on a full year basis so if you could just help us reconcile those two data points or provide any context that would be appreciated thank you chris tucker chief financial officer yes i think if you go back to last year a little bit tommy again it s a little bit i hate to talk about the comps too much but we had quite a soft second quarter there and then even in the third and the fourth we didn t see the business kind of recover the way we are expecting from those prepay endemic levels so we expect growth really as we go into the second quarter just based on kind of how weak it was a year ago and then again we feel like the second half of the year the overall activity levels should continue to stabilize and i would tell you in the fourth we have pretty conservative numbers in so overall it s just a little bit of easier comps as we move through the year and kind of continuing to get into it let s say hopefully a more normalized environment in those markets vic richey chairman and chief executive officer yes i would just add i mean i think it s not i d like to say those are all really hard things that we can point to we ll really get our comfort that we re going to see that kind of growth over the remainder of the year is really talk from the customers and so we have a lot of people that are constantly interfacing with the customers and so we kind of can gauge where when their summit is what kind of buying activity they see the other thing i think is going to be really important for us is over the past year everything that we did with the customer was virtual and so we ve got at our client conference last year we didn t have the life of the transport former in personal as we re doing that this year and so while i think attendance will be certainly less than it s been historically given any people in the same room getting excited having them see our new products and i think it s just kind of important to remember we did introduce a number of new products over the second half of last year and i think those will get traction in the remainder of this year so i do think that although the overall utility space is picking up as quickly as we hoped i think for us with the areas that we re in we re going to see some growth this year tom moll stephens inc analyst appreciate it appreciate it chris i ll turn it back chris tucker chief financial officer thanks tommy operator our next question will come from now john franzreb from sidoti you may begin john franzreb sidoti and company analyst good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my questions given the recent increases you re seeing in material and labor costs where are you having the most success among your businesses in raising prices to offset those costs and by what magnitude can you do it by vic richey chairman and chief executive officer yes so probably the two biggest places are in our test business although it takes some time to pick that up to be able to realize that because increase the price we already have contracts and at such a quick firm business that you don t necessarily get on one contract or maybe on an action so we had some success there it s on the aerospace side as well i think we ve seen a good bit of opportunity and then pieces of our utility business but i would say that s led less broad based john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok and when you look at the portfolio in a broad sense which businesses are you most concerned that there s still excess inventory in the channel that you have to work through before you reach maybe a revenue equilibrium vic richey chairman and chief executive officer i don t really view that there s a lot of inventory finished inventory that the customer has they have to work through for the most part i think the fact that our order levels have been so high over the past two quarters is kind of evidence of that i mean there s probably some where people are just like we re trying to get ahead of things and buying more product buying more raw material i m sure there s some of that with our customers i think the vast majority of it is just the pickup of the business so i don t think there s a lot of inventory out there that has to be worked through you have to remember particularly on some of the commercial aerospace they stopped buying for a while i mean if you look at 737 they just stop buying and so now as that ramps up they wanted yesterday so that s the other challenge you always have when you have these kind of quick upticks john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok and just one more in light of the recent acquisitions were there any cost savings benefits that you might be able to realize in the coming year that you want to call out and let us know about vic richey chairman and chief executive officer so yes we re looking at i would say on the utility side i don t think as much cost savings as it is leveraging the technology and the sales force that we have the rep network and those type of things so i think what we re going to see there is more throughput we re going to get more orders as a result of having those together because again as we ve talked about some of the last calls it truly is a matter of having a stronger presence in europe and asia and i think that s going to help not only the businesses that are already serving that market but we think there ll be some pull through of doble products in those markets and vice versa they re some of the products that are being sold currently in europe will be able to bring some of those back in the u s so i think that s really the play on that side with neco which is a relatively small acquisition we are going to move them out of their current facility into pti facility so we ll be able to take some significant costs again although in a small business out of that business john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok great thanks i ll get back into the queue operator our next question will come from the line of jon tanwanteng from cjs securities you may begin jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst hi thanks for taking my question i actually just wanted to follow up on that previous question just about altanova and how you re expanding in europe how is that going kind of have you seen that pull through of your products yet or is it still going to take some time to realize those kinds of revenue synergies vic richey chairman and chief executive officer i think it s going to take a little bit we need a little bit of time and we ve assumed some pick up across the business this year but it really kicks in next year because the big thing we ve done so far is kind of rationalized the organization and the sales force and again kind of making sure we have the best reps in each of the areas making sure people are focused on the right thing he s getting them trained on each other s products and so that s a bit of a process if you will the next step will be kind of looking at the products making sure we re selling the best products of each company in each location so i think you ll see the big pickup with that combination in late this year and going into the next year jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst understood and then just moving on to the test business what s driving the strength and the activity that you re seeing there that s a pretty big orders number is that sustainable number one and then number two i guess when do you get back to your historical margins there with the inflation the way it is and the offsets that you re trying to ramp up vic richey chairman and chief executive officer sure so i d say the biggest and i think we talked about on the last call are these filters that we re making for the emp filters that we re making for data centers and we do those for some commercial customers but the largest driver right now is the u s government and so they re putting a lot of data centers in and it s not like they re shared data centers so each of the different agencies have their own data centers that s been a big big driver for us this year and everything they re telling us and i think they have good insight into the next couple of years is that piece of the business is pretty sustainable going forward the interesting thing which is different than what we ve seen in past years is we typically would have a very large project kind of flowing through right we d have a large automotive project or large defense projects that are flowing through coming out of backlog going through the sales channel and right now we don t have those yet we re able to grow the business now some of those opportunities are still out there but it s very encouraging to me that we re able to grow the business at the same time not pulling those big projects through the second half of your question as i mentioned earlier i think it s it s going to take a little time we re now pricing some of those cost increases into the bids and so i think you re going to see pretty steady margin growth throughout the year for two reasons one i think we have a higher level of volumes are going to be leveraging our overhead and then the other one is some of these price increases have should be hitting next quarter and then i think even more so in the subsequent two quarters jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst ok great and then lastly just a higher level question what s giving you the confidence to reiterate your guidance for the year i think i get the demand side that seems pretty evident but what s your thinking about when and how the supply chain issues resolved or is it more of a pricing pass through that you re aiming for it as opposed to seeing a relief from the inflation and labor and supply chain issues vic richey chairman and chief executive officer so it s both of those and i would say the other thing is we re putting in additional capacity to be able to ramp up the business and so for instance in our test business because it is going to be outsized growth that we re seeing so we ve leased additional facilities we ll have that up and running in the second half of the year we re moving some of the lower end products into a different location to make sure that we have all these filters in one place where we can perform on those we re adding another shift and in our facility in mexico to be able to manage some of the growth so it s really a combination of more capacity pricing should be better particularly in the second half of the year the supply chain i think we re understanding it better and so i think as you understand it better you make some of the changes you have to make to be able to work through that process jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst thank you for that vic richey chairman and chief executive officer thanks jon operator and i m not showing any further questions in the queue at this moment i d like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any closing remarks vic richey chairman and chief executive officer ok well thank you everybody for their interest and we ll end the call now and look forward to talking to you in our next call operator duration 30 minutes call participants kate

the ukrainian currency has recently shown an upward trend after sliding in april amid russia s military escalation so should ukrainians worry about the hryvnia exchange rate in the coming period of summer holidays the ukrainian currency in the last weeks of spring pleased citizens with stability after a temporary weakening in april when the hryvnia crossed the uah 28 usd mark the situation improved and throughout may the national currency strengthened by 50 kopiykas on the last day of spring the national bank set the official rate at uah 27 50 per dollar april s weakening of the ukrainian currency was associated with the escalation of military conflict in the east of the country when putin s russia started pulling troops to the ukrainian border видео дня under such conditions non resident investors who had previously been actively buying domestic government loan bonds expectedly reduced demand for ukrainian securities national bank governor kyrylo shevchenko also noted an increase in demand for foreign currency in the ukrainian market on the part of non residents due to the rising geopolitical tensions before the amassing of russian troops investors and non residents had been actively buying government bonds even despite the delay in the imf program review following the news of the escalation we felt additional demand from non residents to buy foreign currency the nbu accordingly went in with interventions and thanks to the actions by the national bank we managed to smooth this demand out the top banker said situation improving following the news about the withdrawal of part of the russian troops from ukrainian borders the situation on the national currency market stabilized and the hryvnia exchange rate gradually went up experts with the icu financial group favorably assess hryvnia s position on the foreign exchange market and predict its strengthening in the first half of the year to uah 27 usd and the rate of uah 27 5 28 to the dollar by year end analysts point out that high real rates rapid recovery of the national economy and favorable external conditions are supporting the hryvnia rate favorable terms of trade with foreign counterparts and the restriction of international tourism as it objectively hinders the purchase of foreign currency by ukrainian citizens as well as the restoration of the inflow of portfolio investments continue to positively influence the external balance of ukraine this helps expand the nbu s international reserves which reached 29 billion by the end of 2020 the highest level over the last eight years the main risks experts say are currently associated with a slowdown in reform and uncertainty in relations with the key creditor the international monetary fund summer outlook some ukrainians in the coming months will go on vacation abroad and be interested in buying foreign currency also large part of ukrainians will spend the summer in their native country and perhaps some will be forced to sell dollar savings in order to pay for a well deserved holiday or a long delayed home refurbishments both categories are interested in the behavior of the ukrainian currency during the holidays wondering whether it s set to strengthen or fall according to roboforex analyst andriy hoilov summer is the most favorable period for the national currency of ukraine on the interbank market following the decision of the russian federation to withdraw troops from the border with ukraine the hryvnia began to regain ground first of all non residents stopped selling government bonds on the secondary market however they are in no hurry to actively increase their portfolios in these securities over the past week their investments grew only by uah 280 million to uah 97 53 billion hoilov said the analyst notes that the state regulator has not entered the interbank market with interventions for more than two months already and expects the nbu to appear at the auction only in the event of a rapid beef up of the hryvnia there will be no large payments on ukraine s external debts which would lead to a reduction in the country s foreign exchange reserves until september so the regulator will remain relatively calm considering the current dynamics of global prices for ukrainian exports i suppose an increase in the supply of foreign currencies from steelmakers and farmers this will have a positive effect on the hryvnia exchange rate and allow the nbu to replenish foreign exchange reserves demand from importers will remain at the current level hoilov emphasized the expert predicts that in case no new political risks arise the hryvnia exchange rate against the dollar and the euro will remain in narrow ranges throughout the summer the hryvnia against the u s dollar will probably not go beyond the boundaries of the uah 27 50 27 95 usd channel the single european currency i believe will be in the corridor of uah 33 50 33 85 eur hoilov said savings tips serhiy saroyan head of performance management also believes that no dramatic changes in the foreign exchange market are expected in the summer until the end of summer the situation on the foreign exchange market shouldn t change now investors expect continued ultra low rates in the united states and tightening of monetary policy in developing economies resulting in a flow of capital into risky instruments this dynamics will contribute to the weakness of the dollar and support the rate of local currencies like the hryvnia saroyan said the expert notes that there are no serious grounds for hryvnia strengthening besides the inflow of foreign capital into government bonds but no tangible fall is worth expecting either since the ukrainian economy is gradually recovering from crisis and there are no negative sentiments we expect the rate to move in the range of uah 27 50 28 00 usd it should be borne in mind that this year uah 585 13 billion must be paid on the state debt moreover the peak of payments will be in september 20 37 billion of domestic debt and 81 4 billion of external debt this means that the nbu has no motivation to strongly support the rate in other words in order to save money it is better to choose a strong currency for example the depreciated dollar saroyan recommends external factors and prospects of overcoming coronacrisis according to experts the situation in the planet s largest economy the united states will remain the main driver of the global financial market there large scale fiscal incentives have begun to bear fruit in the first quarter the country s gdp grew by 6 4 if the american economy develops at such a pace it will soon be able to return to the pre coronacrisis level as the economy recovers federal reserve system officials will increasingly speak out about the need to change monetary policy and fight inflation this should be accompanied by growing nervousness in the markets and an influx of money into defensive instruments mainly the dollar thus at the current levels the american currency looks quite attractive for those who are going to keep buying it for a long time saroyan said ukrainian financiers agree that the summer should be calm for the hryvnia in the absence of force majeure no significant fluctuations are expected on the foreign exchange market we also see that the situation with the coronavirus pandemic has somewhat stabilized in the country the incidence rate has declined while the vaccination campaign goes on albeit at a modest pace the national economy starts to revive businesses are adjusting to new conditions and export oriented industries continue to perform pro actively the spring filled with rains gives hope for a rich harvest in 2021 which means that the exports of ukrainian agricultural products will increase and together with high global food prices will provide ukraine with additional forex earnings therefore ukrainians can make plans for the summer and enjoy a long awaited vacation with a stable hryvnia exchange rate not forgetting about observing health safety measures of course kateryna zhyriy
politics government greenwich elected officials unite against 8 30g statute greenwich s delegation to hartford announced tuesday that it will introduce legislation aimed at reforming affordable housing statute 8 30g from left to right state rep kimberly fiorello anthony johnson and sam romeo from greenwich communities state sen ryan fazio first selectman fred camillo state rep stephen meskers richard kaufman patch greenwich ct elected officials and members from greenwich communities formerly known as the greenwich housing authority gathered on tuesday at armstrong court in byram to unite against connecticut s affordable housing statute 8 30g the statute which has been in place since 1989 requires all municipalities in connecticut to have 10 percent of housing designated as affordable greenwich has yet to meet the goal at 5 3 percent and needs roughly 1 200 units to be in compliance developers can come into towns that aren t in compliance and ignore local planning and zoning regulations and build large developments as long as 30 percent of the units in the development are designated as affordable housing lawmakers said there have also been recent bills at the state level which greenwich has objected to because officials said they would strip local control away from the town to that end in order to keep local control and protect the architectural character of towns greenwich s delegation to hartford said on tuesday that it will introduce legislation this week that aims to reform 8 30g we re deeply concerned about efforts at the state level to undermine local control of town planning and zoning said state sen ryan fazio r 36 the 8 30g law in particular is imposing an undue burden on our town and allows developers to basically ignore and run roughshod over a lot of the local planning and zoning rules which seek to have the interest of the whole community at heart the primary idea of the legislation looks to expand what is included in 8 30g and what s counted for example country clubs private schools and greenwich hospital provide workforce housing but none of it is counted as affordable we are convinced we have well in excess of that 10 percent it s just not being counted as long as we don t reach the 10 percent in the eyes of the state of connecticut we re going to have this gun over our head called 8 30g which does threaten to fundamentally change what our town looks like said first selectman fred camillo adding that 8 30g has failed every town and that a one size fits all approach doesn t work camillo noted that greenwich has seen more 8 30g applications for developments in the last year than in the previous 29 he also said the proactive legislation has an eye towards the environmental side and protecting against flooding that could result from construction projects and having soil replaced by impervious surfaces state rep kimberly fiorello r 149 said it s time to reexamine the statute and make changes i think it s perfectly reasonable for the people of connecticut and the people of greenwich to seek for the bills to be tweaked so they make sense and they are workable for the community and it is not a cajole for out of state developers to come in and make permanent changes to the beauty of our towns she said state rep stephen meskers d 150 said affordability and inclusiveness are goals that need to be worked on continuously the issue we re facing with 8 30g is a density issue for growth of the housing stock versus getting to an agreed upon level of affordable housing i believe that our workforce our people in our community our seniors all deserve decent and affordable housing he said armstrong court served as a poignant backdrop for tuesday s gathering groundbreaking on phase ii of the public housing redevelopment spearheaded by greenwich communities took place last may we ve made tremendous strides in redeveloping our properties over the last several years we ve reinvested close to 30 million in new construction and renovations of our properties to bring them up to world class standards said sam romeo chairman of greenwich communities romeo said greenwich communities units are affordable in perpetuity he said developers build single family units which go back onto the open market in 30 40 years so they re not really serving the community as the law intended romeo explained developers see an opportunity and they re jumping in to maximize their money and every square inch of land that s here on the gold coast romeo added executive director of greenwich families anthony johnson pointed out other initiatives the town is working on to address affordable housing like the town s affordable housing trust fund johnson said he believes greenwich communities will be a part of the solution in the town s quest to offer affordable housing with the support financially and politically i think we can achieve a great deal of what the legislation had intended to occur i m pretty sure we can get there he said fazio said greenwich s delegation has worked with other lawmakers around the state who are in support of reform to 8 30g

favorable market conditions for railcar manufacturing could help freightcar america return to profitability the chicago headquartered railcar manufacturer said tuesday it expects to be profitable on an adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda basis for 2022 the potential milestone comes after freightcar america nasdaq rail closed its manufacturing locations in alabama and virginia in 2019 and 2020 and moved all its manufacturing operations to mexico to ensure the company s survival the heavy lifting part of resizing and retooling our manufacturing footprint is now complete said chief commercial officer matt tonn on a call with investors in a release on tuesday president and ceo jim meyer said 2022 will be the first year for which our operations and results will not be obscured by restructuring activities as such we believe that our performance this year will provide more clarity on the full potential of freightcar america the company expects to deliver between 2 350 and 2 650 railcars in 2022 a 44 increase over 2021 at the midpoint it also booked 1 032 orders in the fourth quarter of 2021 and it has a backlog of 2 323 railcars and a strong inquiry pipeline that continues to increase tonn said those inquiries are for a broad range of car types he said demand for new railcars is on the rebound emerging from the worst railcar demand cycle since the recession of 2009 tonn said high railcar scrapping rates aging fleets and railroads seeking to expand capacity are all pointing in the right direction for a strengthening railcar demand cycle freightcar america plans to break ground on three more production lines at its facility in castaños mexico with one line ready to produce railcars by the end of this year and another line to be ready for railcar production by early next year the third line will be on standby for production the construction of the additional production lines will result in doubling annual capacity to between 4 000 and 5 000 railcars by early 2023 freightcar america also plans to have doubled the size of its wheel and axle shop by the end of the first quarter while its fabrication shop will be online sometime midyear but even that expanded capacity will be half of the capacity it had when both of its u s facilities were running according to meyer its former u s operations had an annual capacity of around 10 000 railcars meyer said we always intended to scale that facility commensurate with how we view ourselves in the marketplace meyer said the company uses current sales activities to govern planned capacity increases he said executives said freightcar america s relationships with the larger railcar lessors continue to improve and talks are underway for the possibility of longer term multiyear builds the additional production capacity will make those conversations with the larger lessors easier meyer said one of the things that we bring to the table that i think is a competitive advantage is that we are not a leasing company we are a pure play builder and for many of our leasing companies they find that to be a refreshing advantage tonn said freightcar america expects to release its fourth quarter 2021 and full year 2021 results on march 22 but the company provided some preliminary results the fourth quarter of 2021 was the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth margin the third consecutive quarter of positive manufacturing operating income and the first quarter of positive adjusted ebitda at the castaños facility freightcar also said it reaffirms its ability to achieve positive adjusted ebitda under normal business conditions at volume levels of 2 000 units per year moving manufacturing operations to mexico helped the company achieve annual fixed cost savings of approximately 20 million and labor cost savings of more than 60 on average compared to the prior u s based footprint subscribe to freightwaves e newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox click here for more freightwaves articles by joanna marsh
growth investors turned a cold shoulder to the space stock what happened after tumbling more than 16 in december shares of virgin galactic spce 5 56 continued their downward plunge in the first month of 2022 according to data provided by s p global market intelligence virgin galactic s stock lost 31 2 in january a far worse performance than the s p 500 s 5 decline while market volatility shook the resolve of growth investors last month bearish opinions emanating from wall street analysts provided another catalyst for this specific stock s descent as did the company s announcement of a new debt offering so what the broad market s rocky mood high inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates undoubtedly played significant roles in virgin galactic s decline last month as investors exited positions in growth stocks in search of more defensive options with tickets for its brief spaceflights carrying price tags of 450 000 apiece virgin galactic is catering to an exclusive clientele evidently investors looking at the macroeconomic conditions concluded that the company s growth may be in jeopardy as some of its potential customers may be more reluctant in these circumstances to pony up quite that much for a ride to the final frontier in addition news that virgin galactic was turning to the debt markets to raise capital sent investors running for the exits on jan 14 the company announced that it was offering 425 million in senior convertible notes due 2027 the news was unsurprising since the company is still in its pre revenue phase and it needs cash to keep the lights on however the prospect of further share dilution down the line seemed to be too much for some investors to handle pessimism from wall street analysts provided further fodder for the bears austin moeller of canaccord genuity cut his price target on the space stock to 36 from 44 while maintaining a buy rating some days later ronald epstein an analyst at bank of america espoused an even more pessimistic position reducing his price target to 10 from 20 and keeping an underperform rating on the stock now what in the wake of the stock s sell off some investors may be taking a closer look at virgin galactic and its less expensive price tag buying shares may seem reasonable since the stock price decline didn t reflect the company encountering any formidable obstacles growth investors considering opening a position will want to pay close attention to the company s expectation that it will begin commercial service in the fourth quarter of 2022

when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think

sanctions threats are not even worth responding to the foreign ministry has said washington s rhetoric about the possibility of imposing colossal sanctions on russia is so outrageous that moscow sees little point in even responding one of the country s top diplomats has said in an interview with ria novosti on tuesday deputy foreign minister alexander pankin was asked about the possibility of washington imposing unprecedentedly harsh measures on the russian energy and financial sectors including additional sanctions on the nord stream 2 pipeline linking the gas fields of siberia to consumers in germany it s long been clear to everyone that american legislators have lost touch with reality and are living in a kingdom of their own phobias regarding our country churning out obscurantist plans to deter russia on all fronts with any justification or without one pankin replied i don t see the point in reacting to the capitol s routine initiatives about this we can only repeat once more our regret about what has happened and confirm that there will inevitably be negative consequences from the harsh restrictions laid on us by the western initiators of such measures the diplomat added asked whether russia is prepared for the possibility of being cut off from the swift banking system which some american and european leaders have threatened if moscow decides to invade ukraine pankin said our hope is that as opposed to washington s completely unjustified movement towards the sanction field reason will still prevail in brussels and these measures will not happen which would damage the stability of the international finance system itself as well as global economic recovery and the possibility of fulfilling the sustainable development goals on time last month the us congress and the biden administration announced that they were considering imposing unprecedented economic sanctions on russia if it attacks ukraine including measures that could cause a stock market crash and financial pain for millions of families moscow has insisted that it has no plans to invade its neighbor and has called for security agreements that would limit the activity of nato the us led military bloc in eastern europe rt com

joining today s earnings call the first thing i d like to do is thank our people at s p global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2021 we ve asked a lot of our people this year as they do their day jobs while also preparing for the expected merger with ihs markit and all the while dealing with the uncertainty of the pandemic so on behalf of the board and our management team thank you now let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2021 s p global delivered 12 organic revenue growth and 17 adjusted diluted earnings per share growth all four businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit margin this is quite an achievement following the remarkable results of 2020 we generated 3 5 billion of free cash flow excluding certain items and returned 743 million in dividends in addition to the very strong financial results we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well clearly the most important initiative of the year has been on preparation for the merger and the multiple rounds of synergy validation upon closing of the merger we are well prepared to rapidly begin operating as one company and to begin to realize both the cost and revenue synergies we have already outlined to you in fact on a run rate basis we have already achieved pre realized synergies of 25 million by the end of 2021 also after the merger is completed we will host a post merger investor call to provide an update on the merged company strategy business segment details synergies investment programs share repurchase plans and guidance the other key initiatives achieved in 2021 include the rapid progress achieved on our 2020 multiyear productivity program numerous new product launches and expanded product capabilities resulting from our strategic investment initiatives the creation of sustainable1 to manage and drive significant expansion in coordination with esg product offerings across the company the launch of s p platts dimensions pro a fully integrated user experience connecting pricing market commentary news and analytics with special emphasis on energy transition and continued progress in china with one example being the issuance of 57 domestic ratings in china up over 150 from 2020 this included the first dual rated bond i ll provide more detail on many of these items in today s call these are the strategic initiatives that we shared with you on our fourth quarter earnings call last year we made great strides in each of these items and we ll remark in more detail on many of them today to recap the financial results for the full year organic revenue increased 12 to 8 3 billion our adjusted operating profit increased 15 our adjusted operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 55 2 and we delivered a 17 increase in adjusted diluted eps it s important to note that adjusted eps of 13 70 far exceeded our original 2021 guidance of 12 25 to 12 45 and that the adjusted operating profit margin of 55 2 far exceeded our original guidance of 53 8 to 54 3 much of this was due to unexpected outperformance in ratings following what was a very strong 2020 ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment all four divisions delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement the largest revenue gain was the 16 in indices after several years of elevated investment spending market intelligence delivered the largest adjusted operating profit margin increase with a gain of 190 basis points it s important to remember that our 2021 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance over the past four years we ve posted a compound annual growth rate of 8 for revenue and we have averaged 217 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion and this has resulted in a nearly doubling of our adjusted diluted eps over that time frame the company also continued to advance its own industry leading practices in sustainability we issued our 10th annual sustainability impact report and third annual tcfd report we expanded parental leave to 26 weeks and introduced a flexible time off policy with no prescribed maximum in all eligible jurisdictions we established a 1 5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility tied to our published science based target goals one of the first sustainability linked banking facilities in the u s our s p global foundation increased its grants by 30 to 15 million to organizations that support covid 19 relief diversity economic inclusion and environmental sustainability and our efforts have been recognized by several leading third parties while we continue to improve our own internal sustainability programs we re investing in our esg business in 2021 we launched sustainable1 to elevate and coordinate external esg efforts across the company this resulted in esg revenue of 98 million a 51 increase over 2020 all our key esg products contributed to this growth we completed 59 esg evaluations up 48 43 green evaluations up 79 103 sam benchmark engagements up 36 and we launched social and sustainability framework alignment opinions and completed 42 of them we ended 2021 with esg etf aum reaching 32 2 billion an increase of 59 versus year end 2020 at the core of our esg efforts are the corporate sustainability assessments these are a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world for the methodology year that ends in march we have already increased csa survey participation by 58 to 2 190 companies we also enhanced esg offerings available on capital iq pro expanded s p global esg scores coverage to 11 500 companies and expanded coverage of climate risk analytics to more than 3 million physical assets such as mines power stations and buildings in addition to excellent commercial progress and expanded capabilities we also launched numerous new esg products and initiatives in 2021 while i don t have time to delve into each one of them let me just comment on a few second party opinions assess a transaction against a sustainable finance framework for alignment with consistent and comparable market principles and standards climate changes created the need to evaluate the impact of different climate related scenarios on counterparties investments and portfolios to support these efforts market intelligence and oliver wyman created climate credit analytics a climate scenario analysis and credit analytics model suite and in december we acquired the climate service the company sells the climanomics platform a tool that quantifies physical climate risk for corporates investors and governments kensho continues to be a driving force for productivity improvement for the company and increasingly for our customers the key capabilities they have created are listed on this slide codex is an ai powered document viewer that enables efficient navigation and extraction of relevant information from large quantities of documents there have been over 300 000 client uses to date codex is available on capital iq pro kensho agave has transformed platts process for creating price assessments the agave tool developed by engineers at kensho and platts has transformed the process for creating price assessments platts has implemented agave in 40 of 57 markets targeted and on average daily price assessments are completed 70 minutes faster internally kensho link facilitated quicker data ingestion by providing automated mappings for 60 million company entities externally kensho link was used by our customers to efficiently map 16 million of their own entities to s p global unique identifiers many of our customers have taken note of kensho s capabilities and we ve begun monetizing kensho link kensho scribe rpa data extraction and machine learning development while the innovation we create internally is what drives much of our success key industry trends also help one of those is the shift into passive investing this chart illustrates the 1 9 trillion of cumulative aum u s equity flows in the past 10 years we are a prime beneficiary of this trend if we look at etf aum associated with our indices there has been a 173 increase over the past five years to 2 8 trillion we believe that this trend will continue the increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company it s hard to believe that 2021 issuance growth of 15 exceeded 2020 issuance growth of 13 as is often the case to pockets of strength and pockets of weakness in 2020 global investment grade and high yield were the strongest while in 2021 leveraged loans and structured products were the fastest growing categories the market clearly favored leveraged loans over high yield in 2021 the bars on these charts depict leverage loan volume which soared in 2021 the lines depict the percentage of loans that we rated which reached new heights of 95 in the u s and 93 in europe i d now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2022 the latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month the total amount of global debt maturing in this study is 11 trillion over the next five years this is down 3 from the 11 3 trillion highlighted in last year s study the chart on the right depicts the global high yield debt and leverage loans maturing over the next five years it totals 2 9 trillion down 3 from 3 trillion in last year s study it appears that 2021 issuance benefited from a bit of extra pull forward let s put this small decline in upcoming maturities into perspective this chart shows total global corporate debt outstanding for the past six years this increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 6 the vast majority of this debt will get refinanced and the pool of debt that needs to be refinanced just keeps getting larger after exceptional issuance growth in 2020 and 2021 our ratings research group anticipates that issuance will decrease 2 in 2022 the forecast calls for gains in structured u s municipal and financial services issuance of 3 2 and 1 respectively and a decrease in non financials of 7 please note that this is an issuance forecast not a revenue forecast and it does not include leveraged loans now let s start with the latest view from our economists they are forecasting global gdp growth of 4 2 in 2022 the global economy is in the midst of a robust but uneven rebound from the pandemic demand growth is outrunning supply growth and inflation has risen quickly almost everywhere gdp growth in the u s and europe reached multi decade highs in 2021 and have continued in 2022 inflation has proven to be more persistent than thought and now presents a key policy challenge in the u s and europe our economists now expect at least three fed rate hikes this year starting in march each year we carefully assess the external factors facing the company this slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2022 probably the most important positive factors are the expectation for continued healthy economic growth borrowing costs that remain historically low continued aum flows from active to passive elevated commodity levels that help the financial stability of commodity producers and ample liquidity the most significant negative factors are geopolitical uncertainty sticky inflation central bank rate increases and a repricing of equities and of course the pandemic and supply chain disruptions remain general risks facing the global economy before i finish i want to say that i m incredibly proud of the team we ve built at s p global and i look forward to welcoming the talented ihs markit employees to s p global we re hopeful we ll be speaking with you soon to update you on the merger once the merger is complete we will immediately begin building a new company with an even brighter future and now i d like to turn the call over to ewout steenbergen who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook ewout ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you doug and welcome to all of you on the call let me start with our fourth quarter financial results revenue increased 12 adjusted corporate unallocated expense increased 38 primarily due to increased incentive compensation higher professional fees and the timing of contributions to the s p global foundation adjusted total expenses increased 9 and i ll come back to this on the next slide adjusted operating profit margin increased 120 basis points interest expense decreased 22 primarily due to a reduction in fin 48 interest expense accruals and adjusted diluted eps increased 16 total adjusted expenses for the full year increased 7 for the fourth quarter they increased 9 the fourth quarter increase was primarily due to elevated variable expenses including incentives commissions and royalties as a result of strong 2021 financial performance severance charges related to management changes in the indices business during the quarter increased investments in growth initiatives increased professional fees and the resumption of t e spending during the fourth quarter the non gaap adjustments totaled to a net pre tax loss of 131 million they included 21 million for merger transaction costs primarily legal fees 42 million for merger integration costs primarily consulting fees retention bonuses branding and technology integration costs 51 million for merger costs to achieve which will drive synergy benefits they include lease impairments and restructuring charges 4 million for acquisition and divestiture related expenses 8 million in gains from real estate sales and 21 million in deal related amortization this quarter all four segments delivered increased revenue with indices leading the way with an 18 increase all four segments also delivered adjusted operating profit growth with ratings leading the way with an 18 increase quarterly margins were mixed but more importantly all four segments reported a gain in adjusted operating profit margin for the year each year on our fourth quarter earnings call we share the changes in our headcount in 2021 headcount decreased 1 primarily for two reasons the first is operational efficiencies much of the operational efficiencies were from automation in fact our people created 225 bots in 2021 with market intelligence leading the way with 167 bots cognitive automation and rpa generated over 600 000 hours of savings in 2021 the second is pre realized merger synergies because of the pending merger it didn t make sense to backfill many positions when people left the company in 2021 we estimate that there were about 150 s p global positions left unfilled representing pre realized synergies of approximately 25 million by year end 2021 this year with the formation of sustainable1 we added this as a new category many of the people in sustainable1 were previously reported in other categories platts was the area with the largest headcount increase at 11 due to investments in several growth projects market intelligence had the largest decrease at 6 largely due to automation efficiencies and realignment to sustainable1 last year we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest 100 million on growth initiatives in 2021 we ended up investing 80 million the primary reasons for the difference were the competing priorities due to the merger and the competitive labor market we will share our 2022 investment spending plans after the merger is completed on our third quarter 2020 earnings call we introduced a new 120 million productivity program to be completed over a two to three year period i m pleased to report that only after 18 months we have already largely completed the program there are a few small procurement projects that are awaiting the close of the merger to take advantage of the increased scale of the combined company all our productivity efforts will now be focused on achieving the merger synergies now turning to the balance sheet our balance sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity we have cash and cash equivalents of 6 5 billion and debt of 4 1 billion our adjusted gross debt to adjusted ebitda improved since the end of last year to 1 8 times free cash flow excluding certain items was 3 5 billion in 2021 an increase of 217 million or 7 over the prior year period because the share repurchase program was suspended due to the pending merger with ihs markit we only returned 21 of free cash flow to shareholders in 2021 after the merger is completed we expect to significantly ramp up share repurchases now let s turn to the division results starting with s p dow jones indices the segment delivered 18 revenue growth primarily due to gains in aum linked to our indices and increased exchange rated derivative activity our asset linked revenue also included the benefit of a customer underreporting true up in the fourth quarter we reported a 28 increase in adjusted expenses primarily due to severance increased incentive compensation commissions and royalties a 13 increase in adjusted segment operating profit and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 65 7 a decrease of 280 basis points on a trailing four quarter basis the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 69 9 s p dow jones indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter asset linked fees increased 18 with very strong gains in etfs and mutual funds exchange traded derivative revenue increased 30 data and custom subscriptions increased 10 activity at the cboe increased in the fourth quarter with s p 500 index options activity increasing 47 and fixed futures and options activity increasing 18 cme equity complex volume increased 15 with particular strength in e mini s p 500 options ratings reported revenue increased 12 adjusted expenses increased 5 primarily due to increased incentive compensation wages and outside services this resulted in an 18 increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 300 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing four quarter basis adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 180 basis points to 64 2 non transaction revenue increased 7 primarily due to fees associated with crisil new entity credit ratings and surveillance partly offset by lower rating evaluation service as an aside we added over 1 000 new entity credit ratings in 2021 transaction revenue increased primarily due to strength in investment grade corporate bonds bank loans and structured products this slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets the largest contributor to the increase in ratings revenue was the 14 increase in corporates in addition financial services revenue increased 5 structured finance increased 32 governments decreased 11 and the crisil and other category increased 14 on the right side of this slide you can see the changes in revenue within structured products the largest change was in clos which increased 43 turning to platts revenue increased 12 or 26 million including a 4 million commercial settlement approximately 14 of this growth was from new products core subscriptions increased 10 and global trading services increased 13 the gains in gts revenue were mainly from higher petroleum and iron ore volumes adjusted expenses increased 16 primarily due to increased commissions growth investments cost of sales and incentives adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 50 1 the trailing four quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 55 1 platts delivered excellent revenue growth in every category with notable increases in natural gas power and renewables and petrochemicals market intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8 or 42 million with 34 of the growth coming from new products usage of our key market platforms increased 4 year over year while year ending active users increased 13 to 299 000 users adjusted expenses increased to 5 due to increased cloud hosting initiatives royalties incentives and commissions adjusted segment operating profit increased 15 and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 32 7 on a trailing four quarter basis adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 34 3 looking across the market intelligence components desktop revenue grew 6 during 2021 market intelligence rebranded its premier platform offering as capital iq pro the capital iq pro platform combines the best of capital iq and snl desktops with broad public fundamentals and deep industry data in addition the platform offers greater visibility into private companies and private markets as well as regulatory supply chain climate data and analytics and esg scores data management solutions revenue grew 11 and credit risk solutions revenue grew 8 due to the pending merger the company will not provide guidance for 2022 at this time but will provide 2022 guidance for the combined company after the merger is completed we continue to expect the merger to close this quarter in addition to the slides that we have reviewed on this call there are additional slides in an appendix that can be downloaded from the investor presentations section of the investor relations website in conclusion 2021 was a noteworthy year for s p global we delivered strong financial results realized significant growth made considerable progress on merger preparation and synergy validation and launched multiple innovative new products across the company including our sustainable1 product offerings and with that let me turn the call back over to chip for your questions chip merritt senior vice president investor relations thank you operator we will now take our first question questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from george tong with goldman sachs your line is open george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning with respect to the merger with ihs markit can you elaborate on what steps remain for the companies to complete before the transaction can close doug peterson president and chief executive officer hi george this is doug thanks for the question well first of all as you know from our last call and what you ve seen that we ve released we have approval from all of the regulators that we require approval from to close the merger and but those are conditioned on certain divestitures so with the u k cma we are have already presented them with approved buyers for the base chemicals business which is news corp we re waiting for their approval of that potential buyer and then the second would be from the ec we have they ve looked at all of the divestitures and the additional one from them is cusip which we ve announced that we signed a contract with factset and we re waiting for them to approve them as an acceptable divestiture partner other than that we re ready to go george tong goldman sachs analyst got it very helpful you ve realized pre realized merger synergies over the course of 2021 and early 2022 given your work around synergy realization how are your views on revenue and cost synergies from the transaction changed ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning george this is ewout obviously we have continued to work on further validating our synergies both on the cost side and on the revenue side we have in the meantime had five rounds of synergy submissions by our work streams so they do a lot of work on substantiating synergies building bottom up plans and further really developing concrete initiatives around these synergies so the confidence level is going up for each of those submission rounds i cannot give you specific numbers today we ll get back to you during the merger call but a lot of work is continuing so we re ready to realize the synergies immediately after completing the transaction george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks george operator thank you our next question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley your line is open toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thanks so much wanted to ask on ratings you mentioned the down 2 issuance for this year that your ratings group is forecasting just given the potential for rising rates you mentioned you re expecting three rate hikes i guess how are you thinking about upside versus downside to that neck down 2 number doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah toni thank you for that first of all let me just share a little bit of the color of the market as you know last year was a i had a lot of mixed movement in the ratings as an example the corporates in the u s were down 30 financial institutions were up 17 and then as an example globally structured credit which is clos was up 265 so we saw a lot of mix in the movements and our analysts and the team at the s p global ratings research team have been looking across all of those types of factors what was the part issuance one thing that they ve looked at is what was the growth in issuance over the last couple of years in all the different sectors what s the m a landscape what are we seeing for the pipeline of lbos of private sector transactions private credit transactions and what they see right now is in the what we call the corporates or the industrials that they re expecting they ll be down by about 7 next year with a range of negative 15 to negative 5 financial services relatively flat up about 1 with a range from down 5 to up 5 structured finance at about 3 growth for the year with could go down as much as 5 could go as much up as 8 and then public finance at about 2 either flat to up 5 so that gives you a total of down about 2 with a range that could go down eight and it could go up to 3 as i said this is based on the factors of looking at the pipeline looking at outstanding issuance maturities that are coming up m a pipeline what we ve learned from the banking sector on what they see with the private transactions etc toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst that s great very helpful and wanted to ask on esg so you ve mentioned in the past that most of the esg revenue right now is in platts but there are significant opportunities in the other segments and you ve mentioned a number of those earlier in the call but just how should we think about the ramp of esg in the different segments like would you expect like market intelligence to be able to ramp first or index and should we see this being sort of a gradual opportunity over time or as things gain traction massive step up somewhere just how should we think about going forward ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning toni if you look at the revenues for esg we re very pleased with the growth during 2021 we realized 51 growth in revenues across the company and so overall we continue to be committed to that 40 cagr that we have laid out before your question with respect to each of the segments you re right that platts is still the highest the largest in terms of esg revenue contribution market intelligence is very closely following now the platts business and what we are seeing that besides platts particularly ratings market intelligence and the index business are having the highest growth of each esg revenues at this point in time so it is clearly an enterprisewide initiative that s why we have created the sustainable1 group that is looking across the company and driving commercial initiatives for the company as a whole and we continue to be very excited about the outlook for the esg revenues and particularly also seeing that growth in the other segments outside of platts toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst terrific thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks toni operator thank you our next question comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse your line is open kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst great thanks so much and congratulations obviously there s a lot going on and just really really nice outcome doug or ewout could you talk about obviously there s the focus on rates but there s market volatility as well maybe talk about how the volatility impacts the indices business the market intelligence and then platts as well because i think there s puts and takes across the model but maybe the increased volatility again how that impacts indices intelligence and then maybe just a spike in oil within the context of platts if you could ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer absolutely kevin and good morning actually the way how we look at volatility that is in many cases also a positive for our businesses because if there s more volatility going on in the markets more activity happening there is more demand for our products for our research for our insight and for our analytics so actually volatility in markets usually shows more the higher value add of our products and then on top of that we see two of our businesses that are directly benefiting from more volatility from a trading perspective we have global trading services revenue in platts that is going up when there s more market volatility in the commodities markets and then we have the exchange traded derivative activity in the index business which is the case that there is more hedging going on in more volatile equity markets and that is one of the revenue drivers of our index business so clearly volatility is helping the company both from a value add but then also about directly to revenue streams in both the index and the platts business kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst it s great i ll get back in thank you so much doug peterson president and chief executive officer thank you kevin operator thank you our next question comes from alex kramm with ubs your line is open alex kramm ubs analyst hey good morning everyone wanted to come back to the ratings agency discussion for a second doug you mentioned obviously that the forecast from your team doesn t include loan markets but if you look at the loan business for you in 2021 obviously that business doubled so curious where you shake out in terms of loan market expectations in terms of issuance and obviously that filters into structured finance as well in case it s a soft environment which we ve seen so far in january thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah thank you well when it comes to the loan market we still see conditions which are quite attractive for loan issuers first of all even though there s discussions about rates going up we ve seen estimates from three four five six even seven hikes recently as the last couple of days our own economists have increased their expectation for rate hikes in the u s up to a range of more like five or six now but even if you look at rates rates are still quite low and there s a lot of demand for floating rate instruments given the rate cycle and there could be increases there we also see a very strong m a pipeline as you know m a is one of the biggest drivers of loan issuance as people complete m a they many times are financing it with a bridge loan or potentially going into the loan market so when we look at the entire market we think that even though rates are going to be going up they re still low on historical levels spreads are very tight there s a lot of demand for floating rate paper there s a large pipeline of transactions coming through both from a combination of m a as well as private equity transactions so we re seeing right now still a very strong market for loans into the near future alex kramm ubs analyst all right fair enough and then maybe this could be for ewout or you inflation obviously is a topic that s been coming up a lot curious i know you re not giving any guidance at this point but how you think on the one hand that could impact your cost pressure that we ve seen with other companies and then maybe remind us how much cpi you have built into some of your contracts in market intelligence maybe platts so i guess the question is where could inflation actually help organic growth in 2022 which some people may not be thinking about thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks alex i m going to start and then i m going to hand it over to ewout well first of all when we look at inflation we see that last year as an example in the u s it was a 7 annualized rate in december that annualized rate of 7 has obviously led to a very animated discussion about interest rates in the u s so as we built our plan and we re looking forward we ve been looking at this in the u s and the u k around the world so first impact is we believe that interest rates will be going up you ve seen them go up in the u k they re talking about it in the ec the ecb has now been rumored to be looking at interest rate increases and then in the u s there s expectations this year so we ve built those factors in when it comes to labor markets that s one of the areas i m watching myself quite closely both from a systemic point of view and then for our company itself we ve seen some wage pressure in areas like technology roles there are some esg roles that we ve seen some pressure wage pressure because those we re obviously going to be paying market rates but let me hand it over to ewout to give you some more thoughts about how we re applying it for our budget for this year ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning alex if you think about the impact of inflation on the company we think overall this is going to be manageable for us because of a couple of reasons obviously there will be expense increases with respect to people costs and procurement and as doug said we are making some targeted adjustments for certain job groups within the company but then the offsets are the following we are continuing to run productivity programs and you have seen that we have made quite good progress with the program we announced in 2020 of course we re getting the significant synergy programs and then we have an opportunity based on the high value add of our products and services to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time when we are at that point of renewal obviously that depends on facts and circumstances for each of our businesses but clearly we will be looking at balancing growth margins customer relations and then ultimately shareholder value by managing the impact of inflation but as i said at the beginning we think that is overall manageable from a financial results perspective alex kramm ubs analyst very helpful thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks alex operator thank you our next question comes from ashish sabadra with rbc capital markets your line is open ashish sabadra rbc capital markets analyst thanks for taking my question just going back to the when the info acquisition was announced the company had guided to a mid single digit eps growth for 22 i understand you will provide the guidance on the after the acquisition closes but a lot has changed since then so i was just wondering if you could just provide us some puts and takes since the original guidance was given and whether the buyback was included in that original guidance any incremental color will be helpful thanks ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer ashish fully understand this is a very unusual situation that we cannot provide you guidance at this point in time having said that you should expect us from a philosophical perspective how we manage the company to continue exactly for what you have seen us doing in the past and what we have told you before so expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and also to continue to expand our margins and we will be more specific during the merger call and give you more quantification around that ashish sabadra rbc capital markets analyst that s very helpful color thank you for that and then just on the multiyear productivity it s great to see the progress there and ability to pull forward or ability to execute at a better than expected pace and then now the focus on cost synergies going forward just a question there would be is there opportunity for as we in addition to the cost synergies could there be more opportunities for productivity global productivity improvement on stand alone businesses as well thanks ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer we will continue to look at all the opportunities you may expect us to see us continue to be very disciplined from a cost management perspective there are areas where we are further looking at across the whole company from productivity to real estate to automation many many different areas again we will give you a full update on what that means for the combined company from a synergy perspective but overall i m very pleased with the progress we are making to get ready to start to realize those synergies and the concrete plans that we have put behind that and as i said before five rounds we now had in terms of synergies submissions by the work streams so an incredible amount of work has gone into this to further validate and to bring up the confidence level in terms of what we will be able to accomplish ashish sabadra rbc capital markets analyst that s great and congrats on such a strong quarter thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks ashish operator thank you our next question comes from manav patnaik with barclays your line is open manav patnaik barclays analyst thank you i m just looking at the kensho slide here and i just wanted kind of a high level overview on what the pipeline at kensho looks like just with s p at the moment and i imagine ihs markit only opens up the doors there ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks manav and you know this is always one of my favorite topics to talk about so we continue to be so excited about the initiatives of kensho and how kensho is helping to transform s p global and what it can do also for the combined company after we complete the transaction you ve seen some of the highlights of the accomplishment of kensho during 2021 and we are expecting to see that continuing in 2022 we have such a complete toolkit of ai for unstructured data which is about linking data extraction speech to text the codex platform that is now on cap iq pro and has already 300 000 users to date and you cannot imagine the amount of demand that kensho will have going forward we will have some prioritization decisions to make where we think we can create the highest value and where to use those resources also by the way the attention for kensho from external customers is going up at this point in time there s more and more external activity happening and also the relations with kensho with some of the large technology firms is further expanding so we re actually really excited that the external recognition of kensho remains very high so high value creation for kensho and it s going to be really positive to see what is going to be next for kensho in a way to help to catalyze innovation for the company manav patnaik barclays analyst got it thank you for that and then just a quick update on china obviously the number of ratings is growing really nicely as you disclosed just wondering like is the revenue material yet and what that kind of pace looks like doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah thanks manav well we re so excited about china we have a fantastic team there with really good leadership we ve been out educating the market as you know there s been some opportunities for us to provide some seminars on credit we ve seen a very large increase in traffic coming to us especially given the current credit environment in china as you mentioned we got up to 57 ratings in 2021 one of the things that s important to us is that they span the different levels of investment grade ratings they re broad from aaa to bbb we rated financial institutions corporate structured and the regulatory environment is also one where there are some very good initiatives going on to look at changing the floor of ratings that are going to be available for financial institutions and insurance companies but our revenue is still light it s not material to the company it s something that we re putting a major focus on in 2022 so we can drive our commercial organization faster and harder to take advantage of the really strong start that we re off to manav patnaik barclays analyst all right thank you very much doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks manav operator thank you our next question comes from hamzah mazari with jefferies your line is open hamzah mazari jefferies analyst hey good morning thank you my question is just on market intelligence could you just remind us are all those contracts now on enterprisewide arrangements and maybe do you see the mix changing with data management solutions kind of being a much bigger part and any mix changes you see within this business post merger i know it s one of your highest growth businesses and margins seem to have come back post some of your earlier investments ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer hamzah good morning definitely what we expect to see is that the data management solutions is going to grow faster and becoming a more and more prominent part of the market intelligence business over time so maybe going back to a couple of the comments you made with respect to enterprisewide contracts that process is done so we have now all our contracts on that basis what you re seeing is very steady and healthy growth in desktop we really like the commercial activity in 2021 we ve seen some very healthy sales levels and that sets us up well for 2022 from a desktop growth perspective 6 reported growth and that is more or less that mid single digit steady growth is to be expected going forward then data management solutions in a normal quarter you should see that grow at high single digits to low teens we re a bit higher this quarter about 11 and a particularly nice growth in marketplace and in the trucost area as well so those are doing particularly very well and then lastly you were referring to margins we have been investing as you know over the last few years a lot in new growth initiatives in market intelligence and we re very happy to see that paying off from an overall revenue growth perspective and we said that you should see margins coming back in 2021 to that mid 30 levels and we re very happy to see that that actually also has taken place so market intelligence is very well positioned i think for the next few years hamzah mazari jefferies analyst got it very helpful and just my follow up question i ll turn it over is just around just the ratings business i know you highlighted your global issuance forecast for 2022 and i know your revenue differs obviously with that figure because of pricing and non transactional business and mix etc but maybe could you talk about what you re seeing in europe around issuance maybe in asia i know you touched on china in some of your prepared remarks but any thoughts as to outside of north america how those markets look like as you look at 2022 thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah just to give you some thoughts about the markets well first of all the numbers we gave you were a global issuance forecast so it s taken into account all the different markets we re in but europe was very similar to the united states last year in full year and also in the final numbers in the quarter europe was down in corporates but it was up in financial institutions as well as very strong in clos and structured credit in addition the cmbs market in europe was strong we saw it s not a big market but there was a lot of interest in cmbs in the european market we see the continued conditions in europe that are strong for capital markets there is an interest i ve mentioned this before in other calls of in the european policy sector to stop having all of the dependence for corporate financing coming from banks and moving more to capital markets as that continues we see that as a long term valuable trend for us that trend in asia is also something that we re seeing more of as well just a little bit about 2020 2021 in asia across all of asia both the corporates and financial institutions were up corporates were up about 10 and financial institutions were up about 14 through the year whereas the overall structured in asia was only up about 30 most of that being in traditional abs and rmbs where the major volume is but we do see again in asia that move toward capital markets away from banking markets as a trend there s also a lot more m a activity taking place and part of asia obviously is china where we re on the ground floor there as that becomes a much more sophisticated market hamzah mazari jefferies analyst thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks hamzah operator our next question comes from craig huber with huber research partners your line is open craig huber huber research partners analyst great thank you just wanted to touch on the cost a little bit for the you gave some good detail earlier on this but in the fourth quarter can you just touch on internal investment spending how that may have differed dollar wise if you could versus a year ago or sequentially and also incentive compensation as well is that materially different how has it accrued over the course of the year and i have a follow up thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yes good morning craig and thanks for asking that question so i would first would like to point out that the expenses are unusually high during this quarter the vast majority is not recurring and you should see continued expense discipline from us going forward so having said that you were specifically asking about certain categories so what you re seeing here from an expense growth perspective that the majority of the growth was coming from variable expenses performance related expenses which i consider good expenses because they re directly correlated with healthy sales and revenue activity so these are commissions royalties and incentive compensation incentive compensation you asked a specific question around that we re accruing at this moment significantly above 100 for our short term incentive compensation and that s a bit higher compared to 2020 and also the performance factors of our long term incentive compensation are running a bit higher than in 2020 so that drove some of the additional expenses with respect to growth investments although you saw that they were overall a bit lower compared to the year before that doesn t mean that it doesn t have an impact on the overall expense levels because some of those growth initiatives go to a baseline and it means that some of the new growth initiatives are still incremental to what we already have in place so overall growth in net investments drove approximately 15 million of the expense growth during the fourth quarter so we think these are clear reasons why the expense growth is happening the underlying recurring expense growth is actually very limited and very minimal craig huber huber research partners analyst and my follow up i guess you guys touched on a little bit earlier about upon bank loans the outlook for that can you just go a little bit deeper i mean that s obviously a huge wildcard this year obviously it s not included in your global debt issuance forecast so maybe touch on a little deeper what do you think the likely outcomes are for bank loans versus last year s strength of about 100 maybe touch on clos as well as they think about this new year thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks craig yeah right now i can talk to you a little bit about the conditions but we re not giving any guidance right now for 2022 but as i mentioned the conditions for the market as of the current market are still quite favorable for bank loans in particular the m a market we see is strong there s a large backlog of transactions which have already been announced that haven t been closed yet you have a large private equity pipeline of transactions which are going on even though interest rates are starting to go up and we ve seen the 10 year treasury hasn t hit 2 but it s getting closer but spreads are tight and interest rates are still very low on a historical basis there s a lot of demand as well from insurance companies from banks and other institutional investors for floating rate paper so we do think that the conditions are still very strong for the loan market but as of now we re not giving any specific guidance for 2022 craig huber huber research partners analyst thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks craig operator thank you our next question comes from andrew nicholas with william blair your line is open trevor romeo william blair and company analyst hi good morning this is actually trevor romeo in for andrew appreciate you taking the questions just a couple of quick ones for me first just wanted to go a bit deeper on platts with 12 growth in the quarter i think 18 growth in the u s i know some of that might be one time from the commercial settlement is there anything you d call out there in terms of drivers of that strength and how much is the strong commodity market driving growth kind of across the various areas of platts right now ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning trevor definitely very pleased to see such a high revenue growth in platts i think it has been a long time ago we see platts growing in the double digit space so this is really excellent results you re right there was that 4 million commercial settlement in those numbers if you would take that out you re at approximately 10 growth for revenues for platts in the fourth quarter so still quite strong so what is happening behind there in terms of revenue growth we see strong commercial momentum in both the core business which is the price reporting business and the insights business and that is mostly because we see customers being healthy with the current commodity prices the current commodity market environment is actually very good for our customers and then also global trading services is doing well we re growing clearly here based on the overall price volatility in the markets and then the third reason behind this strong revenue growth of platts is the new initiatives we have invested in new initiatives like lng energy transition and agriculture and they also start to pay off at this moment so very pleased with the results of platts overall trevor romeo william blair and company analyst great great thank you and then just a quick follow up just wanted to ask about your recent acquisition of the climate service i m sure that s probably a fairly small acquisition but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about how that kind of physical climate risk more broadly fits into your esg strategy thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah thank you for that the climate service is a really interesting business and it s an excellent fit for us with the suite of climate products in particular that we ve been putting together both homegrown as well as the trucost acquisition we made four and a half years ago it brings a platform called climanomics which is you re able to build across different data sets it allows companies to look at their physical risk in many different categories cyclones hurricanes fire floods etc and it can be modeled to different approaches as an example the task force for climate related financial disclosure modeling so this is something that we find that it s a great fit for our organization but more importantly it also brings a really talented group of people people who are entrepreneurial they ve got passion they ve got energy and they re going to be a great addition to s p global as well because they re going to bring all of that energy as we build out even further our sustainable1 business platform trevor romeo william blair and company analyst great appreciate the color thanks again doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah thanks trevor operator thank you our next question comes from owen lau with oppenheimer your line is open owen lau oppenheimer and company analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions i want to get your thought about the potential development of esg this year and there has been a lot of conversation about the inconsistency of esg data and ratings and there are obviously some benefits of esg data as well but could you please talk about some of the potential events or development this year that can potentially get us closer to a more standardized esg disclosure or esg data and ratings thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah thanks owen this is really an important area for us both as s p global as well as an industry and by that i mean the entire financial industry as we look to this important factor that starts to get included in people s decision making what we see is that the esg market itself for data and analytics as scores it started to evolve as more and more insurance companies institutional investors asset managers take those factors into account as they make decisions and as of now as you know the factors which are being used by different organizations are not the same you have organizations that care more about climate you have some that care more about diversity inclusion or supply chain and so there s different language out there whether it s an impact fund it s an esg fund it s an esg approach and we re working very closely with different organizations such as the ifrs and the issp they re setting up the international sustainability standards for disclosure the iosco which is the international organization of securities commissioners is looking at new rules around the globe for disclosure as well both disclosure from the point of view of issuers but also disclosure that could be asked for by different types of investors as they sell their funds or sell their investments we do think that there is a really good effort going on across the private sector as well as ngos along with these regulatory agencies to start addressing what would be the potential regulatory requests as well as the market themselves coming to standards of how we re going to be disclosing this s p global for our products all of our products we provide very simple clear consistent disclosure on everything that we are providing in the esg products our disclosure is built in a way that it s consistent it s transparent it s comparable you can see what the actual criteria is that s used to determine an index or a score or the weighting of the score and we think that that s going to be a key differentiating factor for us as we build up our esg business owen lau oppenheimer and company analyst got it that s very helpful and then one follow up question s about the buyback and again and i know you don t provide any specific guidance on buyback but how should we think about kind of the magnitude and also the timing of the asr i mean the stocks have traded down quite a bit since the beginning of this year would you be opportunistic to do one large asr or you would do multiple asr for the rest of this year thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah owen let me explain to you philosophically what we are having in mind obviously we need to do a catch up because we have not been able to do buybacks over the last two years the same applies for ihs markit we have the opportunity to do buybacks based on the proceeds of some of those divestitures we re also of course looking at the overall refinancing that we can do of the ihs markit debt and potentially some opportunity for upsizing and then very quickly we would like to go in a normal course return of capital we still are committed to the capital targets that provided the call when we announced the merger so at least 85 of return of free cash flow so we definitely are ready to resume buybacks after the transaction is completed and we would like to do that as quickly as possible in order to get in a normal rhythm again for the combined company owen lau oppenheimer and company analyst got it thank you very much doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks owen operator thank you our next question comes from jeff silber with bmo capital markets your line is open jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks i know it s late i ll just ask one in your comments you talked a bit about labor cost i was wondering if you can drill down a little bit more first of all is it more difficult to find and retain people i know a lot of companies are talking about that and then what does that translate into the labor costs you ve been incurring and what you expect for this year thanks doug peterson president and chief executive officer thanks jeff i m going to start and then hand it over to ewout as i mentioned earlier it s critical for us that we are competitive and we re paying market rates in all of the different markets we re in we re seeing a little bit of inflation or increase in job expenses wage expenses as i mentioned in some specific areas like high demand technology areas data scientists one market in particular we re seeing increase in some pressures in india and i ll give you an example of something you might not have thought of but we re actually seeing a lot of our recruiters getting recruited away people are trying to hire people who can hire people so we re seeing certain areas where we do see some increase in turnover and we re seeing clearly the areas that we re watching quite carefully but our philosophy is to pay market rates to ensure that this is a great place to work and ewout can talk a little bit more of how that translates ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in addition to what doug said i think we are not having any problem with hiring we re still a very attractive company people like to work for us and to stay competitively from a pay perspective we have made adjustments for certain job groups think about the ratings analysts technology and esg and we re also increasing the merit levels in certain jurisdictions so that is just to make sure we stay competitive but overall as i said to an earlier question we believe that the impact is manageable because we have opportunities also to look at productivity synergy efficiencies automation as well as the opportunity to look at some contractual terms and fees over time jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst ok it s really helpful thanks so much ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff operator thank you our final question comes from jeff meuler with baird your line is open jeff meuler robert w baird and company analyst yeah thank you heard you loud and clear no guidance at this time but i thought ewout said that you expect to grow revenue in all of your businesses in 22 if i could just confirm if that s what was said obviously asking specifically for ratings if that s the case and then a related technical question just given your team your ratings team maintaining the down two issuance forecast but also explicitly saying risks way to the downside did they lower the low end of the range in that down eight seven at the low end already reflects their current views of that downside risk or did they maintain the whole range and their kind of probability weighting different parts of the range or think there could be a future adjustment thank you ewout steenbergen executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning jeff first to your question about revenue growth indeed i said before that we expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and that we ll get back to you with more specifics during the merger call with respect to your question about some of the ranges with respect to the issuance forecast by our research group i think you re right that compared to a quarter ago some of the ranges have widened but overall the issuance forecast is still at that minus 2 level and ranges have become wider because as we showed you in one of those slides in the prepared remarks clearly there is more uncertainty in the macro environment so the level of headwinds and potential tailwinds that we re seeing is a bit larger so ranges are wider but overall the midpoint is still the same jeff meuler robert w baird and company analyst makes sense and thanks for the reinforcement thank you doug peterson president and chief executive officer yeah thanks jeff and let me just reinforce what ewout said about the businesses and just clarify that this is s p global businesses that we re talking about we have no discussion whatsoever about the ihs markit businesses but let me wrap up the call and i want to thank everyone again for joining the call for your questions for your support i want to thank again as i always do our very dedicated people this has now been two years for the pandemic we re going into our third year we ve asked our people to do a lot last year in the last two years and we want to ensure that they re fully prepared for the expected merger with ihs markit because we re going to be working really hard and running fast as soon as that closes and throughout 2021 we continue to perform as you saw today with the strong financial results and the progress on our strategic initiatives especially those that are going to be driving growth in the future and kensho data sciences data analytics esg what we ve talked about with investment in our global businesses going back to one of the first questions we received about the merger we re very excited about the merger and the progress that we ve been making planning for the merger we re going to host the call as soon as it s completed we ll do a post merger investor call we can provide an update on the company s strategy the business segments the synergies the investment program share repurchases things that you asked about today or wanted to ask about today and that would include guidance one last point i d

the house of representatives voted 272 162 implying something in the way of bipartisanship on tuesday to advance a continuing resolution to extend current federal agency funding rates through march 11 the current continuing resolution keeping the federal government open expires on feb 18 senate majority leader chuck schumer had indicated before the house vote that the senate would take up the funding bill quickly after house passage in time before the feb 18 deadline read hr 6617 s full bill text here and a summary here virginia house members on the record on hr 6617 donald mceachin d va 04 it is imperative that the united states government remains open functional and working for the american people i voted in support of the continuing resolution to ensure that is the case this temporary extension will provide time to complete bipartisan bicameral negotiations on fiscal year 2022 appropriations legislation while this extension was necessary we cannot continue to fund our government for small incremental periods of time it is past time house and senate republicans come to the negotiation table in good faith so that we can finalize our long term funding package for fiscal year 2022 elaine luria d va 02 my vote for the continuing resolution tonight was a vote to avoid a government shutdown which would devastate coastal virginia s economy and threaten our national security we are nearly halfway through fiscal year 2022 and have yet to pass a spending bill that funds our national defense gives a pay raise to our service members and secures the long term future of hampton roads this is unacceptable a year long continuing resolution would cost the department of defense billions and prevent the navy from quickly and adequately responding to threats and aggression around the world from adversaries like china the navy would lose 14 billion in purchasing power over the next year severely impacting our ability to acquire ships and weapons though the continuing resolution is far from perfect i worked with my colleagues and fought hard to ensure that funding for the columbia class submarine was included in the final package passed today the columbia class is the pentagon s most important priority and it s crucial to maintaining our nuclear triad the cornerstone of our national security however important priorities like iron dome and the entire department of defense budget were not addressed continuing to subvert the normal appropriations process threatens our ability to defend our nation undermines the considerable economic progress we have made since the start of the pandemic and disrupts major industries and employers in coastal virginia congress must act swiftly to pass a strong budget that prioritizes defense spending to counter the threats we face around the world and provide our government with the basic resources it needs to function rob wittman r va 01 doing something repeatedly that results in the same failures and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity for far too long congress has used continuing resolutions as a complete abandonment of budgeting responsibly as washington s budgeting by crisis mentality has steadily gotten worse rather than buckling down and getting spending bills done on time congress has yet again kicked the can down the road through a short term solution to a long term problem this is no way to govern today s passage of a continuing resolution is further proof that we live in an age of procrastination and irresponsible budgeting in washington it s time for members to stop preaching accountability without any substantive action or follow through this new normal of members of congress using a continuing resolution rather than doing the job they were elected to do is unacceptable i remain committed to passing a permanent solution that will provide a path to fiscal certainty for our armed services our federal employees and agencies and the american economy
when the coronavirus pandemic began the health department in teton county wyo went all in on contact tracing everyone at the health department stopped their regular jobs to join the effort and each person who tested positive in the county home to jackson and grand teton and yellowstone national parks got a call but when the omicron surge hit this winter the numbers were just staggering says health director jodie pond at one point in early january the county had the highest case rate in the country when the health department got too overwhelmed to call everyone she says the community noticed right away our phone lines were just ringing off the hook the week before christmas because people were like i haven t heard from you they went on local news to tell residents what was going on we had to make sure they understood that they wouldn t be getting a call from us pond says with one full time and four part time staffers the health department had to prioritize who would get a call they decided to focus on people over age 60 people who might not have access to medical care and those who tested positive in group settings like daycares it was hard because we didn t want to let our community down she says but as a small health department in a rural county with at the peak more than 275 cases in one day she says we just had to make the pivot perfect world meet messy reality with omicron the sheer number of cases was completely unmanageable for contact tracing programs in many places in fulton county ga chief epidemiologist fazle khan says they have 130 people on their contact tracing team as many as they ve ever had it still hasn t been enough we ended up in fulton county alone in this omicron surge with more than 44 000 cases that have not been investigated khan says in maryland during the omicron surge we really were only able to reach out to 11 or 12 of the cases says marcia pearlowitz chief of the maryland department of health s contact tracing unit before omicron they had reached 76 of residents on average she says even during previous surges in a perfect world when an infectious disease started spreading there would be plenty of testing and plenty of public health staff to reach out to people who test positive and their contacts and share guidance about isolating and quarantining doing this quickly over and over would keep the virus in check this ideal was especially beguiling at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic places such as hong kong and singapore initially contained their outbreaks by deploying thousands of public health workers to track down every positive case and all of their contacts in the u s the director of the centers for disease control and prevention at the time called for an army of 100 000 contact tracers to contain the virus at one point the u s got close surveys by npr of state health departments found there were 70 000 public health staff working on contact tracing covid 19 cases in december 2020 up more than six fold from when the pandemic began but the efforts were still far from what was needed public health experts including cdc officials agree the country never had enough staff doing contact tracing to contain the rapid spread of the sars cov2 virus and now many of those programs have scaled back omicron s flood of cases was the final blow to the dream that contact tracing could keep up with the spread of covid in the u s many state and local contact tracing programs are taking stock and trying to chart a new strategy for the rest of the pandemic and that s raised a question if health departments can t realistically keep on top of every case or even most what good are their efforts part of the answer seems to lie in targeting tracing toward those most vulnerable many public health experts insist that contact tracing for covid 19 remains valuable even if it must now prioritize who to reach and how to reach them it s still important and can still save lives in the midst of a surge says crystal watson senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security contact tracing s new phase in late january several important public health organizations endorsed the move away from universal contact tracing in a statement the groups including the association of state and territorial health officials and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists call for a revised public health approach we urge a refocus of our public health efforts and resources with an emphasis on targeting investigations in higher risk settings serving vulnerable populations and other critical measures to better protect the public s health the statement reads the statement explains dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of astho came after many jurisdictions were already beginning to make this kind of shift there was just a feeling that somebody needed to lay out an explanation of that for the public and for policymakers he says the concern would be that the public would view it as another place where we ve not been capable of doing what needs to be done and so that s why at least be the first step towards trying to change social expectations hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy nashp which tracks state contact tracing programs says it is time to acknowledge that we re in a different phase of the pandemic when the pandemic started there were few tools to contain outbreaks she says we really had to rely on contact tracing very heavily i think now we re in a very different place to be clear she adds i don t think this is a failure for health departments to move away from trying to contact trace as many people as possible and after two years of doing this work there s a lot of good lessons learned scaling back and adapting while some states have reduced or stopped contact tracing according to tewarson others are pivoting to a variety of lower resource approaches one particular model seems to be taking off among red and blue states alike she says while contact tracing is still conducted for high risk populations for the rest there s a whole bunch of states that have said okay public you should reach out to your own contacts or enter information into the portal online right now about 20 states are using this model she says including alaska colorado michigan nebraska and vermont even if born of necessity the move to ask the public to participate more may be a smart pragmatic shift many people don t answer public health workers calls even those who answer often don t provide phone numbers for their contacts so when people reach out to their own contacts it spares public health workers the hard work of tracking people down and the contact is more likely to take the call there have also been innovations since the scrappy early days of covid 19 contact tracing in maryland people are encouraged to report their positive at home test result in the state s self report portal and when they do that or get a positive lab test result they receive a link to an online survey that gives them personalized guidance about how long they need to isolate and mask and a work or school excuse letter the information they provide in the survey then helps the department flag people who are at higher risk and might need to receive a follow up call we really have put the tools in place that will allow us to ensure that we re still attempting to reach out to everyone but doing it in an automated way maryland health department s pearlowitz says a few other places like washington d c and local health departments in california new york and north carolina have similar self reporting platforms even when contact tracing programs can no longer reach everyone they still serve a critical role in their communities says watson of johns hopkins it may be really important for the nursing home where there are many people who are severely at risk for bad outcomes from getting covid and need to be more protected she says it s still important for workplaces that don t want large outbreaks and absenteeism i think it s important for individuals you may reach somebody through contact tracing who really hasn t thought to notify their contacts contact tracing can also connect people to antiviral medications during the vital few days after diagnosis when they can be used most effectively it can connect people who need help with local resources like rent or utility relief programs if they have to miss work due to illness it can also give public health officials and policymakers insight into where outbreaks are happening for instance washington d c tracks the number of outbreaks in restaurants and gyms and schools and more using data from the district s contact tracers funding issues in teton county wy as elsewhere around the country the omicron surge seems to be retreating as quickly as it arrived but even when her department has a chance to catch its breath after the surge says jodie pond they ll continue to focus on contact tracing only those who may be at higher risk from covid 19 i think we stay the course on this pivot she says even the scaled back version of contact tracing that many places have moved to is limited by budget concerns and could be reduced even further without additional funding when contact tracing was one of the only ways to stop the spread of the virus that s where a lot of resources went now much of the funding has been spent and health departments have other priorities like running vaccination campaigns notes khan of fulton county ga of course there s also the everyday work of public health as well like animal control and hiv prevention and helping people quit smoking and more pond in teton county says her small local health department has received some federal grants and did receive funding through the cares act one of the early covid 19 relief bills but she says she hasn t felt the impact of the 7 4 billion appropriated in the american rescue plan last year for building the public health workforce that funding is designed to meet a lot of needs from school nurses to data infrastructure updates to the laboratory workforce as for contact tracing it s a funding issue pond says noting that public health in the u s is chronically underfunded if congress and the biden administration want to continue to fund us for contact tracing we will need additional appropriations she says the work goes on despite the pivots and the challenges all over the country public health workers are still making calls every day giving advice and sometimes comfort and clarity to people who may feel sick and stressed and scared a few weeks ago one of the people who got a call from a public health worker in maryland was crystal watson the scholar at johns hopkins who researches public health and was an early voice advocating for contact tracing in the first months of the pandemic i was glad to have that experience having talked about it so much she laughs it was fast too i think it was within 48 hours of my positive result she also uploaded her result into an app designed to automatically notify people she d been close to and her husband got notified so for us for our household it worked she says she thinks it s understandable that people would want to declare the end of covid 19 contact tracing but it s too soon i think people are very eager to move to the place where we don t have this ramped up public health response that s different than what we see for seasonal respiratory viruses she says and contact tracing is a part of that but i don t think we re there yet and we do have to be vigilant about what s coming next npr s allison aubrey contributed to this report copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
