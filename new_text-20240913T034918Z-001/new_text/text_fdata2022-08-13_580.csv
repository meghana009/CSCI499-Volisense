the house passed democrats healthcare and climate spending package on friday sending the landmark piece of legislation to joe biden s desk and delivering a much needed political victory for the party ahead of the midterm elections this november the bill passed the house in a party line vote of 220 to 207 and democratic members broke into raucous applause as the proposal crossed the finish line today is really a glorious day for us we send to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people the house speaker nancy pelosi said before the final vote if you are sitting at your kitchen table and wonder how you re going to pay the bills your healthcare bills your prescription drug bills this bill is for you joe biden is expected to quickly sign the legislation which he has celebrated as a significant step toward combatting the climate crisis and reducing americans healthcare costs the final house vote capped off a lively debate among members in the chamber as republicans attacked the bill as a reckless spending spree that would fail to address americans financial needs a number of republicans sharply criticized the bill s provision to increase funding for the internal revenue service which far right congresswoman lauren boebert compared to armed robbery on the taxpayers that comment prompted a rebuke from john yarmuth the democratic chairman of the house budget committee i would implore my republican colleagues to cut out the scare tactics quit making things up and debate the substance of this bill yarmuth said the house s passage of the bill came five days after the senate approved the package in a vote of 51 to 50 following a marathon session that lasted overnight and stretched into sunday afternoon the bill formally known as the inflation reduction act is the culmination of more than a year of negotiations among democratic lawmakers the proposal was negotiated behind closed doors by the senate majority leader chuck schumer and centrist democratic senator joe manchin who single handedly quashed the bill s predecessor the build back better act last year house progressives complained that the new bill is much narrower in scope than the build back better act but they ultimately supported the spending package largely because of its climate provisions the legislation includes 369bn in funds aimed at expanding renewable energy sources and lowering planet heating emissions experts have estimated the bill could reduce america s emissions by about 40 by 2030 compared with 2005 levels this landmark legislation marks the largest ever federal investment in climate action pramila jayapal the chair of the congressional progressive caucus said on friday she added we think we crafted the best bill in the world with build back better so as soon as we get a couple more democrats we ve made the case for the rest of the bill the bill also fell short of expectations for some of the centrist members of the house democratic caucus lawmakers from high tax states like new jersey and california had pushed for changes to the limit on federal deductions for state and local taxes salt but they failed to get that policy added to the spending package instead the bill includes a number of tax changes to cover the cost of the rest of the proposal those policies including a new corporate minimum tax and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks are expected to bring in more than 700bn in revenue for the government despite their reservations centrist democrats supported the bill while emphasizing that they would continue their efforts to reform the salt deduction i will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing salt mikie sherrill a democrat of new jersey said on sunday because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district but in fact significantly lowers their costs i will be voting for it the bill previously attracted criticism from the progressive senator bernie sanders who said the spending package did little to help working americans who are struggling under the weight of record high inflation sanders attempted to expand the healthcare and financial assistance provisions in the bill during the senate s 16 hour vote a rama session last weekend but those efforts were unsuccessful sanders has taken particular issue with the bill s provisions aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs which he has said are too limited the bill will allow medicare to start negotiating the price of certain expensive drugs and will cap medicare recipients out of pocket prescription drug costs at 2 000 a year but key provisions meant to help americans who receive health insurance coverage through the private market were stripped out of the legislation it s a very modest step forward sanders told msnbc on sunday bottom line is i m going to support the bill because given the crisis of climate change the environmental community says this is a step forward it doesn t go anywhere near as far as it should it is a step forward democratic leaders have downplayed criticism of the bill instead championing the legislation as america s most significant effort yet to address the climate crisis as i say to members you cannot judge a bill for what it does not do you respect it for what it does do and what this bill does do is quite remarkable pelosi told msnbc on tuesday do we want more of course will we continue to work for more of course democrats hope the passage of the bill could help the party s prospects in the midterm elections which have appeared grim so far republicans are heavily favored to regain control of the house of representatives although democrats have inched ahead in polling since the supreme court s reversal of roe v wade which ended the federal right to abortion access party leaders have voiced optimism that the passage of the inflation reduction act will show the country how democrats are delivering for their constituents and convince voters to support them in november yes i do it s going to immediately help biden said on monday when asked whether he believed the bill will bolster democrats midterm prospects it changes people s lives

the measure meets the moment ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives republicans solidly opposed the legislation calling it a cornucopia of wasteful liberal daydreams that would raise taxes and families living costs they did the same sunday but senate democrats banded together and used vice president kamala harris tiebreaking vote to power the measure through that 50 50 chamber democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford said house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif i can almost see glee in their eyes biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion proposal also envisioned free prekindergarten paid family and medical leave expanded medicare benefits and eased immigration restrictions that crashed after centrist sen joe manchin d w va said it was too costly using the leverage every democrat has in the evenly divided senate still the final legislation s pillar is to use about 375 billion over 10 years to encourage industry and consumers to shift from carbon emitting to cleaner forms of energy that includes 4 billion to cope with the west s catastrophic drought spending tax credits and loans would bolster technology like solar panels consumer efforts to improve home energy efficiency emission reducing equipment for coal and gas powered power plants and air pollution controls for farms ports and low income communities another 64 billion would help 13 million people pay premiums over the next three years for privately bought health insurance medicare would gain the power to negotiate its costs for pharmaceuticals initially in 2026 for only 10 drugs medicare beneficiaries out of pocket prescription costs would be limited to 2 000 starting in 2025 and beginning next year would pay no more than 35 monthly for insulin the costly diabetes drug the bill would raise around 740 billion in revenue over the decade over a third from government savings from lower drug prices more would flow from higher taxes on some 1 billion corporations levies on companies that repurchase their own stock and stronger irs tax collections about 300 billion would remain to defray budget deficits a sliver of the period s projected 16 trillion total against the backdrop of gop attacks on the fbi for its court empowered search of former president donald trump s florida estate for sensitive documents republicans repeatedly savaged the bill s boost to the irs budget that is aimed at collecting an estimated 120 billion in unpaid taxes over the coming decade and republicans have misleadingly claimed that the irs will hire 87 000 agents to target average families rep andrew clyde r ga said democrats would also weaponize the irs with agents many of whom will be trained in the use of deadly force to go after any american citizen sen chuck grassley r iowa asked thursday on fox and friends if there would be an irs strike force that goes in with ak 15s already loaded ready to shoot some small business person few irs personnel are armed and democrats say the bill s 80 billion 10 year budget increase would be to replace waves of retirees not just agents and modernize equipment they have said typical families and small businesses would not be targeted with treasury secretary janet yellen directing the irs this week to not increase the share of small business or households below the 400 000 threshold that would be audited republicans say the legislation s new business taxes will increase prices worsening the nation s bout with its worst inflation since 1981 though democrats have labeled the measure the inflation reduction act nonpartisan analysts say it will have a barely perceptible impact on prices the gop also says the bill would raise taxes on lower and middle income families an analysis by congress nonpartisan joint committee on taxation which didn t include the bill s tax breaks for health care and energy estimated that the corporate tax boosts would marginally affect those taxpayers but indirectly partly due to lower stock prices and wages the bill caps three months in which congress has approved legislation on veterans benefits the semiconductor industry gun checks for young buyers and ukraine s invasion by russia and adding sweden and finland to nato all passed with bipartisan support suggesting republicans also want to display their productive side it s unclear whether voters will reward democrats for the legislation after months of painfully high inflation dominating voters attention and biden s dangerously low popularity with the public and a steady history of midterm elections that batter the party holding the white house the bill had its roots in early 2021 after congress approved a 1 9 trillion measure over gop opposition to combat the pandemic induced economic downturn emboldened the new president and his party reached further they called their 3 5 trillion plan build back better besides social and environment initiatives it proposed rolling back trump era tax breaks for the rich and corporations and 555 billion for climate efforts well above the resources in friday s legislation with manchin opposing those amounts it was sliced to a roughly 2 trillion measure that democrats moved through the house in november he unexpectedly sank that bill too earning scorn from exasperated fellow democrats from capitol hill and the white house last gasp talks between manchin and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y seemed fruitless until the two unexpectedly announced agreement last month on the new package manchin won billions for carbon capture technology for the fossil fuel industries he champions plus procedures for more oil drilling on federal lands and promises for faster

lactose avoiding consumers milklab s plant based products are a common sight in cafes across the nation but few coffee drinkers would know that milklab s manufacturer is at the centre of one of the most spectacular corporate implosions in recent australian history the future of cult favourite milklab is in the hands of a noumi shareholder vote on wednesday credit janie barrett smh milklab s maker an asx listed company once known as freedom foods is still struggling to recover from revelations two years ago of significant accounting irregularities worth over half a billion dollars the irregularities preceded by the sudden resignations of two top executives forced the company into a nine month trading halt two class action lawsuits and an investigation by the corporate regulator asic have followed freedom foods has changed its management team secured support from a new cornerstone shareholder the billionaire perich family one of western sydney s biggest landowners and rebranded itself as noumi pronounced new me despite this the company behind a wide range of dairy and plant based milk products and health supplements has failed to win back the trust of investors advertisement noumi was a market darling as recently as a few years ago class action law firm phi finney mcdonald associate muhammad arayne says the financial irregularity revelations made in mid to late 2020 genuinely shocked the market and caused the company to lose a substantial amount of trust from investors the share price collapse was catastrophic noumi shares currently hovering around 28 cents are about 90 per cent below a september 2018 peak price of 5 30 with a market value of 78 million noumi is worth less than 5 per cent of a company once valued at nearly 2 billion loading throughout this turmoil milklab has been one bright spot for the company enjoying stratospheric growth and strong customer loyalty among baristas but now even noumi s most prized brand and the company s future prospects are hanging on a knife s edge and this week the company disclosed that a separate legal battle has been launched by french tea and coffee company sunday collab over rights to distribute milklab in europe claims noumi says are without merit noumi had already been accused of fraud by its former supplier californian almond grower blue diamond which sued noumi for breaching a licensing agreement between the two parties relating to milklab advertisement the pair of companies have reached a settlement of us35 million 49 million more than the embattled noumi can afford so to pay it all off noumi wants to sell its stake in a separate company but this needs shareholder approval the future of milklab rests in the hands of these shareholders who will vote on whether to approve the stake s sale at an extraordinary general meeting on wednesday spilt milk the first sign something was wrong at freedom foods came on tuesday june 23 2020 when then chief financial officer campbell nicholas suddenly resigned milklab has seen success amid the booming popularity in non dairy milk drinks credit tribune the following morning ceo rory macleod went on leave trading on the asx was suspended pending a further announcement but not before shares dropped to a five year low an unusually high volume of 21 5 million shares traded hands there have been no allegations of insider trading then on thursday of that week the company released a statement to the asx revealing that its estimated value of useless assets 25 million had blown out to 60 million a review of inventory levels showed there was more out of date stock some from cancelled orders than originally thought sixty one staff positions were made redundant advertisement almost simultaneously the company held a conference call with the cfo and ceo gone the unenviable task of hosting it fell to then chairman perry gunner the most pressing question from investors and stakeholders was where did things go wrong the outdated stock and cancelled orders went as far back as 2017 why wasn t it picked up earlier the company had been shifting stock from five external warehouses into its own facility the chairman explained that they knew there was some amount of stock that needed to be reworked for instance turned into dry powder but didn t realise just how much there was over the years vast amounts of milk had been going off in warehouses and either no one had noticed or no one had reported it loading but getting rid of it was expensive simply put there was so much milk that had gone off that it was cheaper to write it off than to rework it the difficulty is the cost of getting that milk out of the packages and into a vat to allow it to be processed does not justify the protein or the value of the milk powder that you would obtain from doing it he said according to transcripts of the investor call that s why the likely provision has been increased from 25 million to 60 million advertisement gunner was pressed by investors on why the company hadn t identified issues of such a scale with its inventory during a regular stocktake and whether the company suspected fraud his answers did little to defuse the investor unease the revelations seemed as startling to him as they were for everyone else this has only come to the attention of the board today effectively said gunner we ve still got a lot of further investigation to undertake hitting rock bottom the trading halt in late june 2020 that was only supposed to last for a fortnight was extended until october 30 and then again by the time trading eventually resumed in march 2021 the company was nearly unrecognisable the wealthy perich family and freedom foods key backer owning 52 5 per cent of company shares stepped in to play a central role in the company s reformation advertisement
house democrats delivered the final votes needed to send president joe biden a slimmed down version of his tax climate and drug price agenda overcoming a year of infighting and giving themselves a cornerstone achievement to campaign on for the november congressional election the legislation passed the house friday on a party line 220 207 vote the bill passed the senate on a 51 to 50 vote on sunday with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie and speaker nancy pelosi could not afford more than a few defections with the slim democratic majority in the house given the high stakes biden personally called lawmakers to ensure support throughout the week a white house official said democrats united around the bill even though the spending is far less than the 10 trillion measure progressives like new york s alexandria ocasio cortez initially pushed it also doesn t raise the 10 000 limit on the deduction for state and local tax or salt which moderates from high tax states demanded in the end the bill spends about 437 billion on climate health subsidies and drought relief while raising about 740 billion in revenue over ten years the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated an earlier version of the bill cuts deficits over ten years by 102 billion a figure that rises to 300 billion when revenue from expanded tax audits is factored in whether the bill helps democrats retain their house majority remains to be seen the party hopes its core voters are mobilized by the largest climate change bill in u s history while seniors cheer the coming of lower drug costs i ve been prepared to win the midterms all along it depends on getting out the vote this probably could be helpful i don t know house speaker nancy pelosi said this week but i do know it will be helpful to america s working families and that s our purpose house speaker nancy pelosi d california stefani reynolds bloomberg independent studies project the bill would have a limited impact on inflation despite the name democrats gave it a new penn wharton study of the bill found that it would reduce inflation by 0 1 percentage points after five years and have no impact after 2028 in the near term effects would have upward pressure on inflation but be too small to be measured by the government for middle class obamacare enrollees and seniors with expensive prescription drugs the effect will be most immediate republicans argue that imposing new taxes on business could worsen a looming recession likely to be provoked by the federal reserve raising interest rates to fight inflation gop lawmakers who blame historic inflation on last year s stimulus bill argue the bill s tax credits for pricey electric vehicles are a giveaway to the upper middle class while the drug provision stifles innovation in the pharmaceutical industry democrats are desperate for any win even one that slows the economy and crushes businesses republican representative kevin brady of texas said he said the gop will work to repeal the tax increases and drug price changes if the party wins the house next year and try to shift the additional irs funding in the bill toward customer service rather than ramped up auditing democrats said they will seek to pass elements of biden s social agenda that did not make it into the final version of the bill next year if they keep the house and expand their senate majority they said they will once again try to expand medicare and medicaid boost child tax credits and childcare subsidies and provide paid family leave on friday ways and means chairman richard neal said democrats will also look to raise the corporate tax rate and top individual tax rate paid by the wealthy next year key effects on business in the bill that passed the house include

the package includes 369 billion in energy and climate funding the largest investment to combat climate change in american history washington cn returning from august recess for one day house democrats passed a massive climate health care and tax bill friday that aims to deliver on long touted campaign promises to reduce drug prices and combat climate change at the federal level while raising taxes on wealthy corporations the inflation reduction act the brainchild of a last minute deal between senate majority leader chuck schumer and conservative democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia revived policy goals and legislation many thought were destined for the cutting room floor after months of previous negotiations failed to gain manchin s support for a democrat backed bill lawmakers returned to washington from august recess a time when members take a break from the congressional schedule and typically work from their home states to get the bill across the finish line it passed the house by a vote of 220 207 with all democratic members backing the legislation now the sweeping reconciliation bill is headed to president joe biden s desk marking a major win for democrats just months shy of the november midterms the package aims to lower prescription drug and healthcare prices by empowering medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices for a limited number of drugs beginning in 2026 and monthly insulin prices for people who use medicare will be capped at 35 a month it also includes a policy long fought for by democrats that would extend affordable care act subsidies for people purchasing their own insurance until 2025 preventing insurance premiums from rising these measures are a big blow to pharma which has had a stranglehold for decades speaker of the house nancy pelosi said on the house floor friday climate advocates have celebrated the package which includes the largest ever federal investment to fight climate change an estimated 369 billion will go to green energy and climate provisions over the next decade an investment democrats say will put the u s on track to reduce the country s carbon emissions by 40 by 2030 compared to 2005 levels that climate investment includes subsidies for people buying electric vehicles and green energy resources for their homes such as solar panels or heat pumps these policies will be paid for by revenue generated through the package which hikes up the minimum corporate tax rate for some wealthy companies taxes stock buy backs and beefs up the irs to target tax evaders it makes a difference at the kitchen table and at the board room table corporations and the wealthy will now have to pay their fair share pelosi said during a press conference early friday democrats say those tax policies and the new irs funding will pay for the bill while also cutting the federal deficit by 300 billion over the next decade though the nonpartisan congressional budget office put that number closer to 100 billion republicans have criticized the irs funding arguing it will lead to audits of middle class families representative kevin brady a republican from texas called the bill a hoax on the american people if the green new deal and corporate welfare had a baby it would look like this brady said on the house floor friday the irs has said the bill will improve customer service and fund audits on wealthy americans additionally treasury secretary janet yellen directed the service not to use the new financial support to increase audits of people making less than 400 000 i believe today we are demonstrating what democrats mean when we say that we are putting people over politics our republican colleagues continue to put their politics over the people s health and wellbeing majority whip james clyburn a democrat from south carolina said house minority leader kevin mccarthy slammed the legislation as the largest tone deaf bill i ve ever seen in this chamber in 232 years democrats more than other ones already in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy said on the chamber floor friday in order to get manchin on board with the legislation democrats cut out provisions from what was once the 2 trillion build back better act particularly policies aimed at reducing child poverty and expanding the social safety net the child tax credit which gave monthly checks to families amid the pandemic and calls for universal pre school as well as paid family leave did not make it into the final bill manchin a democrat in a state that relies heavily on the coal and oil industries got some of his personal policies in the compromise including a provision that will expand oil and gas leasing democrats also agreed to support a bill down the line on permitting reforms that will likely expedite how quickly oil and gas companies can expand their projects while the legislation is strategically branded as a malady to the nation s inflation woes some experts predict a minor change to inflation in the long term and the penn wharton budget model predicts the impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero
washington sweeping legislation to boost climate spending raise taxes on corporations lower the cost of prescription drugs and speed the auto industry s pivot to electrification passed the u s house friday on a 220 207 party line vote it s a far cry from the package president joe biden first proposed more than a year and a half ago a more than 2 trillion slate of proposals that would revamp the nation s tax social services climate and energy and infrastructure systems but experts say the bill dubbed the inflation reduction act is still the most significant piece of climate legislation passed in u s history the package is expected to put 369 billion into supercharging the clean energy economy and create around 737 billion in revenue reducing overall deficits by around 300 billion it includes significant aid for the u s auto industry though some proposals have been criticized as useless in the short term despite the name preliminary estimates say it is unlikely to have a significant impact on inflation the bill s passage also leaves democrats in washington with multiple legislative victories to tout as they go into a competitive midterm election cycle a surprising turnaround from just weeks ago when it appeared negotiations had come to a grinding halt none of michigan s delegation broke ranks with their respective parties friday with the state s seven republican members voting against the bill and its seven democratic members voting for it the inflation reduction act is a transformational piece of legislation that is going to address some of the urgent challenges facing our nation rep debbie dingell d ann arbor said friday michigan democrats praised the legislation as a much needed shot in the arm to their climate and health goals while republicans raised concerns about continued spending and increased tax enforcement by the internal revenue service does anyone actually believe that this bill is going to reduce inflation retiring rep fred upton r st joseph asked on the house floor friday i didn t think so biden is expected to quickly sign the bill into law climate boost the bulk of the spending will go to clean energy programs aimed at reducing emissions and slowing climate change independent research firm rhodium group estimates it will reduce emissions 31 44 over 2005 levels by 2030 compared with 24 35 under the status quo consumers will soon be eligible for billions in tax credits and rebate programs to make their homes more energy efficient such as installing rooftop solar heat pumps and electric water heaters companies will be able to use tens of billions in tax credits to build clean energy components such as wind turbines critical mineral processing plants and electric vehicle batteries automakers will qualify for billions more for building new plants and retooling old ones to build evs and their components rep bill huizenga r holland said the additional dollars will go into an economic system that has already been choking on the weight of congress other spending this session he called the climate provisions green new deal light a reference to a 2019 climate framework introduced by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d new york that s not the right direction he said what i m frustrated with is that you re not seeing market forces at play here you re having government subsidies or regulations that are requiring what i view as very harmful changes many of the programs incentivize aid for disadvantaged communities or areas that have disproportionately been impacted by the effects of climate change the bill also includes major changes to tax credits for electric vehicles it creates a new 4 000 credit for people to buy used evs and for the first time offers both a new and used credit as an up front discount rather than requiring buyers to wait until they file their taxes to get money back a 200 000 vehicle per manufacturer cap that has prevented general motors co tesla inc and toyota motors corp from continuing to benefit from the existing 7 500 credit also will be lifted however the legislation also includes new strings aimed at boxing china out of america s burgeoning electric auto industry including requirements that vehicles have an increasing amount of battery minerals sourced from the u s or allied countries and that vehicles are assembled in the u s provisions required by conservative sen joe manchin d west virginia in order to include the credit a leading group representing the auto industry has lobbied to change that and warned that no existing evs would qualify for the credit once it goes fully into effect michigan sen debbie stabenow d lansing has expressed dismay that the credits will be difficult for automakers to take advantage of dingell a former general motors executive agreed it s going to be three to five years before car companies will be able to meet the requirements but joe manchin doesn t want the u s to become more dependent on china and neither do i she said later adding it s going to incentivize the companies to move more quickly to develop that mineral and battery production source here taxes and health care the legislation gives the federal government the ability to negotiate some drug prices and caps out of pocket drug prices for medicare recipients to 2 000 per year it also bars companies from raising medicare drug prices faster than inflation and extends health care subsidies for low and middle income people under the affordable care act rep elissa slotkin d lansing said when she arrived in washington friday morning her team had received more than 1 000 calls in support of the drug pricing provisions she s disappointed some drug provisions were lost including a 35 insulin cap for private insurers but i will always take some progress over no progress she said and that s what this bill is by a long shot democrats bill includes a 1 tax on stock buybacks companies purchasing shares of their own stock a method often used to boost share prices and implements a minimum corporate tax rate of 15 on companies with at least 1 billion in income the tax proposals are what remain from an earlier version that would have closed a loophole that allows private equity and hedge fund managers to pay lower tax rates taken out of the bill at the behest of democratic sen kyrsten sinema of arizona it s also significantly less than biden s original proposal to increase the corporate tax rate to 28 raise the highest income taxes to nearly 40 and implement a 43 capital gains tax on taxpayers with income over 1 million rep richard neal d massachusetts told bloomberg friday morning that if democrats retain the majority in congress after the midterm elections this fall the house will look to raise corporate and individual income taxes akin to a ways and means committee proposal from 2021 this statement on top of an appropriation in the bill of around 80 billion over the next 10 years to increase irs enforcement activities incensed republicans who voted against the legislation the ink is not yet dry on today s massive tax hike and democrats are already calling for more wrote michigan rep tim walberg r tipton on twitter stop the madness rep lisa mcclain r bruce township said this bill does anything but reduce inflation and called it nothing but a socialist messaging

party hopes will bolster their prospects for keeping their hold on congress in november s elections the house used a party line 220 207 vote to pass the legislation which is but a shadow of the larger more ambitious plan to supercharge environment and social programs that biden and his party envisioned early last year even so democrats happily declared victory on top tier goals like providing

inflation data finally flipped and investors also are looking to flip the script on the losses in equities from earlier in the year with wall street picking up steam this week manhattan cn as inflation seems to have turned a corner wall street hopes to improve on its summer gains and recoup losses from the spring u s indices posted meager gains early in the week but on wednesday investors pulled further ahead on news that headline inflation fell in july from 9 1 to 8 5 according to data released by the federal government by the week s end the dow jones industrial average gained 958 points while the s p 500 and nasdaq put up 134 points and 390 points respectively while the consumer price index was unchanged in july not something investors generally would cheer the data were better than analyst expectations and indicate to some experts that inflation may have peaked or at least taken a breather it also indicates the federal reserve may not remain as hawkish when it again meets to discuss interest rates later in the fall diving more deeply into the numbers put out by the u s bureau of labor statistics some sectors still saw price increases in july and the flatlining inflation was driven primarily by the 4 6 drop in energy prices that includes an 11 fall in fuel oil services that don t include energy services increased by 0 4 in july while food prices picked up by 1 3 however shipping costs are down year over year while supply bottlenecks are loosening up and core prices gained only 0 2 month over month the fifth straight month that those prices have slowed one month doesn t make a trend but at least headline is coming down and core stopped going up said chris zaccarelli chief investment officer at the independent advisor alliance if we see future months data showing a decrease in inflation then it will help markets see the end of the tunnel in terms of rate hikes the fall in energy prices in particular has caught analysts eyes with some saying if energy prices continue to decline that will mark the end of rising inflation altogether a few analysts such as paul ashworth chief north american economist at capital economics are even predicting prices will begin to come down ashworth calls food prices the next deflationary shoe to drop noting the recent collapse in agricultural crop prices as well as the fall in dairy egg and chicken futures prices he also pointed to the unwinding of the avian flu outbreak from the spring his is not yet the meaningful decline in inflation the fed is looking for ashworth wrote in an investor s note but it s a start and we expect to see broader signs of easing price pressures soon inflation expectations also are falling at least according to the federal reserve bank of new york the institution noted on monday in its survey of consumer expectations that three year inflation expectations fell sharply in july from 3 6 to 3 2 one year expectations also dropped from 6 8 to 6 2 from june to july the new york fed found expectations among consumers related to the most headline grabbing items related to inflation namely gasoline and food also fell notably over that period expectations of year ahead price changes fell by 4 2 for gas to 1 5 while the expectations for food price gains dropped by 2 5 headline inflation is sure to fall dramatically over the next year but the tight labor market and the expected rise in rent will keep inflation a talking point and economic pressure for the foreseeable future experts say inflationary expectations are also starting to temper earlier in the week the national federation of independent business reported that small business optimism finally increased in july barely from 89 5 to 89 9 after it had hit the lowest point in nearly ten years also concerning is that more than one third of owners said inflation was the single most important problem facing their business the highest level since the fourth quarter of 1979 the uptick in small business sentiment was disappointingly small considering that gas prices fell in july and the stock market partially recovered from the first half of 2022 s selloff said bill adams chief economist at comerica bank the extremely weak small business outlook is another reason to think a recession is somewhat more likely than not over the next year and a half the bureau of labor statistics also reported earlier in the week that producer prices are decelerating falling 0 5 last month after increases of about 1 the following two months this is the first drop in headline producer prices since april 2020 and the 1 8 decline in final demand goods is the largest decline since that same month once again energy prices led the charge posting a 9 decline in july according to the producer price index while food prices continued to increase last month to the tune of 1

washington the u s house on friday cleared democrats long sought climate health care and tax package sending it to president joe biden for his signature the roughly 750 billion measure is much smaller than the 2 trillion reconciliation package the house originally sent to the senate in november the final product left out dozens of provisions including expanded child care tax credits and paid family leave that many left leaning democrats believe are desperately needed but democrats including progressives still championed the slimmed down version of the bill before voting 220 207 along party lines to approve the package debate on the bill friday was part of a brief one day session for house members who now will continue their august recess members aren t expected to return to washington d c until sept 13 democrats repeatedly called the legislation historic and said it showed their party putting people above politics the package would cap out of pocket expenses for medicare prescription drugs at 2 000 annually beginning in 2025 and allow the federal government to negotiate some of the more expensive prescription drugs starting in 2026 this is landmark legislation that is going to help reduce costs for american families while finally aggressively tackling the climate crisis energy and commerce committee chairman frank pallone jr a new jersey democrat said during floor debate we simply cannot wait any longer to confront the climate crisis he said extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more extreme and these extreme weather events cost families their loved ones their homes and their livelihoods maine democrat rep jared golden the sole member of his party to vote against the larger package in november announced friday just ahead of the vote that he would support this version it is fiscally responsible and is targeted on four key priorities reducing the national debt and putting our country back on a fiscally responsible path lowering the cost of prescription drugs and making health care more affordable investing in an all of the above energy strategy to significantly increase oil gas and renewable energy production to lower energy costs for americans and cracking down on the tax avoidance of billion dollar multinational corporations golden said in the statement gop slams irs funding republicans remained steadfastly opposed to the measure dubbed the inflation reduction act saying it would raise the costs of energy and boost the number of internal revenue service employees the package would provide about 80 billion in funding for the internal revenue service to boost tax enforcement a change that democrats argued during debate friday would not affect americans making less than 400 000 annually michigan republican rep fred upton weighed in against the bill saying that while he s no stranger to working on bipartisan legislation he simply couldn t support the package democrats brought to the floor friday our economy is in a fragile state as we emerge from this pandemic upton said we ve seen decades high inflation that is crushing main street and squeezing the middle class house gop whip steve scalise a louisiana republican rebuked democrats for advancing the bill speaking out against the energy climate health care and tax provisions he also chastised democrats for including the 80 billion to bolster staff and technology at the internal revenue service let s talk about these 87 000 irs agents you think of just about any nfl stadium in america filled completely with new irs agents that s right more than doubling the size of the irs scalise said house budget chairman john yarmuth a kentucky democrat called republicans statements about the irs hiring 87 000 new agents nonsense and noted that the current irs commissioner has said the agency won t increase audits on people making less than 400 000 annually it seems to me that republicans just don t want people to pay taxes even if they re owed yarmuth said noting that hundreds of billions of dollars in owed taxes go unpaid every year this is an attempt to try to recover some of that money that is owed and is not being paid by taxpayers who are in many cases cheating yarmuth added swifter house action house debate on the measure was nowhere near as long or tedious as it was in the u s senate where members spent saturday night into sunday debating 37 amendments before voting 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie to approve the package on aug 7 the bill primarily negotiated by senate majority leader chuck schumer and west virginia sen joe manchin iii would dedicate 370 billion to clean energy programs including electric vehicle tax credits and tax incentives for energy companies to produce renewable energy it would provide 1 5 billion to the environmental protection agency to help companies reduce methane a greenhouse gas and would impose a fee on companies for certain methane emissions as part of the deal with manchin the legislation requires the u s government to lease 2 million acres of federal land and 60 million acres of federal waters for oil and gas development in order to lease other federal lands and waters for solar or wind production the bill would also boost funding for a federal trust fund that helps coal miners diagnosed with black lung pay for their health care if the company they worked for doesn t do so virginia democratic rep bobby scott lauded the provision during floor debate saying that extending the tax will protect the long term sustainability of the black lung disability trust fund while ensuring that the coal industry does not shift the cost of benefits from coal companies to miners families or the taxpayer in other health provisions the package would require pharmaceutical companies to pay rebates if they raise the cost of some prescription drugs within medicare faster than inflation it would extend subsidies for three years for individuals who purchase health insurance as part of the affordable care act or obamacare to stave off a price hike that was expected to begin at the end of the year those enhanced subsidies were first approved as part of democrats covid 19 bill last year and were set to expire insulin cap in medicare the measure would cap the cost of insulin for medicare recipients at 35 but wouldn t apply a similar cap on co pays for people with private health insurance after republicans in the u s senate successfully blocked that provision house democratic whip jim clyburn of south carolina said he was especially pleased with the bill s insulin provisions having experienced my late wife s 30 year battle with diabetes i m especially pleased that this bill would cap insulin costs at 35 a month for those on medicare clyburn said this is a giant step forward but we will continue to work to overcome the republican opposition that blocked extending the same life saving measures to those on private insurance the bill would be fully paid for by instituting a 15 minimum tax on corporations with incomes more than 1 billion and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks as well as by allowing medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices democrats advanced the measure through the 50 50 senate and the narrowly divided u s house by using the budget reconciliation process a complicated path that requires the bill to comply with several rules democrats used the same legislative process to approve their 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief package last year republicans used budget reconciliation to pass their 2017 tax bill and the gop tried to use it to repeal and replace obamacare the same year but didn t have the votes in the senate to pass their proposal congress has used the process to enact 22 laws since 1980

bloomberg peloton interactive inc will embark on a sweeping overhaul that includes cutting nearly 800 jobs raising prices for its bike and tread machines and outsourcing functions such as equipment deliveries and customer service to outside companies the changes which the company disclosed friday in a memo to employees also include gradually closing many of its retail showrooms a process that will get underway next year it s the widest ranging shake up yet under chief executive officer barry mccarthy a tech veteran who took the helm in february peloton is hoping to turn around a business that thrived during the early days of the pandemic but suffered a punishing slowdown in the past year revenue is declining losses are mounting and the company s stock price was down nearly 90 over the past 12 months the latest moves are an attempt to reinvigorate sales boost efficiency and restore some of peloton s former cachet we have to make our revenues stop shrinking and start growing again mccarthy said in the memo provided to bloomberg adding that the changes are essential to making peloton cash flow positive again cash is oxygen oxygen is life advertisement article continues below this ad read the peloton ceo s full memo here investors applauded the moves sending the shares up 14 to 13 53 in new york trading it was the biggest one day gain in more than three weeks in its third known set of layoffs this year the company will fire 784 employees across its distribution and customer service teams peloton will stop using in house employees and vans to deliver equipment and shutter 16 warehouses across north america instead it will rely on providers of third party logistics or 3pl to set up bikes and treadmills at customer homes peloton already uses third party shipping companies jb hunt transport services inc and xpo logistics inc for some deliveries and will offload its remaining in house distribution to those firms the company acknowledged that such a change might not be loved by all buyers as some have complained that the third party delivery services aren t on par with peloton s own efforts this has been a challenge mccarthy told staff we won t fix it overnight but we have no choice but to make it work so we re leaning into it and proactively managing our 3pl relationships we are confident in the plan we ve put in place and we re encouraged by the progress we re making advertisement article continues below this ad peloton is also cutting about half of its customer support team which is mainly located in tempe arizona and plano texas the company will use third party firms to handle support requests as needed to augment the staff it is keeping these expanded partnerships mean we can ensure we have the ability to scale up and down as volume fluctuates while still continuing to provide the level of service our members have come to expect mccarthy wrote the winding down of in house deliveries distribution and warehouses will eliminate 532 jobs while another 252 will be culled from support teams peloton said last month it would cut about 570 employees in taiwan as part of a move away from in house equipment manufacturing in february it fired nearly 3 000 employees across the company still mccarthy said the company will continue to hire in key areas including its software engineering group i share this so you won t think we re driving with our foot on the gas and the brake at the same time he said the company is raising the price of its flagship bike by 500 to 2 495 and its tread treadmill by 800 to 3 495 the increases are a reversal as the bike was priced at 2 495 prior to cuts in april the new tread price is higher than it was four months ago advertisement article continues below this ad mccarthy acknowledged the about face saying that the april price cuts were necessary to more quickly move units and generate cash flow i probably wouldn t have messed with the prices at all if i had been confronted with different inventory states back when we lowered the pricing he said in an interview at the time peloton was in the early days of an 800 million restructuring plan and was still in the process of securing a 750 million bank loan the price cuts cheapened at least the perception of the brand he said so this is a return to historical positioning peloton is betting that the price increases will help juice sales during its fiscal third quarter the new york based company missed analyst estimates with revenue declining 24 and losses coming in far wider than expected advertisement article continues below this ad peloton also said it intends to undergo a significant and aggressive reduction of its retail footprint in north america beginning in 2023 the company currently operates 86 stores across the us and canada mccarthy said in the interview that the number of locations shuttered will be determined by negotiations with landlords he said that the savings from store closures will be reallocated toward marketing and selling its products in other ways we need to be where our customers are when they make purchasing decisions mccarthy said in the interview increasingly they do that online he said and that s reflected in the foot traffic the announcements come six months after mccarthy was appointed ceo in a broader management reshuffling the former spotify technology sa and netflix inc executive vowed to cut costs improve peloton s products and move increasingly to a subscription based model the pandemic had been a boon to peloton s business with lockdowns sending consumers scrambling to buy its bikes and sign up for online fitness classes but the company overestimated demand produced too much equipment and mistakenly believed the surge in demand would continue after economies reopened after peloton began struggling the board replaced co founder john foley with mccarthy though foley remains chairman advertisement article continues below this ad before the latest moves peloton already moved away from in house device manufacturing shifting the production of its bikes to partners in asia the company also implemented a leasing program that could lower the cost of equipment ownership and hiked the price of its content subscription service by 5 to 44 per month peloton is making other changes including a return to in person work office employees will have to come in at least three days a week starting sept 6 mccarthy said friday that s in line with the approach used by other tech firms such as apple inc but marks a twist for a company that benefited from the work from home lifestyle so far wall street has been skeptical of peloton s comeback the shares continued to slide after mccarthy took the job and remain down about two thirds in 2022 management is betting that improving peloton s fixed costs and raising prices will boost investor sentiment i continue to be optimistic about the future of peloton mccarthy said in the memo that doesn t mean there won t be challenges ahead there will be and there will be unforeseen setbacks that s the nature of turnarounds but i m confident we can overcome the challenges because we ve come so far in just the last four months which feeds my optimism about our ability to engineer our long term success advertisement article continues below this ad

limited upside with plenty of risks the set moved mostly sideways in july opening at 1 568 33 points and closing at 1 576 41 representing just a 0 5 month on month rise that said there was a period during the month when the index took quite a swing reaching a low of 1 517 51 in mid july before rebounding to its peak of 1 576 68 before closing at 1 576 41 recession was the key concern during the month alongside high inflation high energy prices and the rising interest rate environment both in europe and the united states economic activity during july was subdued due to the large number of holidays during the month further depressing the mood for investment average daily turnover was just 58 3 billion baht down 13 month on month and marking the lowest monthly average for the year foreign and retail investors were net buyers in july at 4 7 billion baht and 5 5 billion baht respectively local funds meanwhile were net sellers of 9 8 billion though the us federal reserve increased its interest rate by 75 basis points in line with market expectation investors now anticipate that further increases will be less aggressive this should cool the global investment climate for now the main concern in thailand is still the cost of living but we note that july seems to have marked a peak in a number of indicators the baht weakened throughout the month reaching almost 37 per dollar however towards the end of the month and into early august it regained strength to 35 10 and is now trading around 35 50 inflation in thailand was 7 7 year on year in june and that depressed the trading environment consumer price inflation edged down marginally to 7 6 in july and the investment mood brightened a bit in early august as a result indeed our economist now believes we have seen the peak for domestic inflation inflation peaking oil price movements have also been encouraging west texas intermediate wti crude has fallen from its peak of us 110 to below 100 per barrel as of early july and to below 90 as of early august many commodities appear to have also passed their peak in june and july and have fallen more than 20 since then this indicates that the overall inflation peak has passed and we could expect a material decline in official readings starting in august however the electricity generating authority of thailand is set to announce an increase to its fuel tariff ft rate of 0 68 per unit raising the total tariff to a record 4 72 per unit kilowatt hour however prime minister prayut chan o cha has already said authorities will find a way to subsidise the higher ft cost at least for the next few months to ease people s living costs in addition cooking gas prices have increased by another 45 baht for the july september period bringing the price of a 15kg tank to 408 baht up 28 from 318 baht in early 2022 these hikes imply that food prices will rise in the third quarter so far this month trading sentiment on the set has improved substantially pushing the index up from 1 576 41 to 1 620 98 points over the first 10 days average daily turnover has also improved by 8 to 63 billion baht foreign investors already have a net buy position of more than 15 billion baht for the month compared to only 4 7 billion for all of july we see this as an opportunity to reduce portfolios rather than accumulate stocks particularly as we are nearing the end of the second quarter results season results overall should be good as the bulk of the impact from high costs and high inflation should manifest in the second half of the year another risk to the market is that there is a high chance of listed company earnings forecasts being revised downward this is because most analysts upgraded their forecasts early this year before inflation really started to heat up and affect costs consequently we see a current trading range for the set between 1 580 and 1 620 points our recommendations revolve around stocks with potential to post strong results our picks include banpu ck com7 and egco in the energy sector banpu is primed for a superb year with earnings projected at 28 billion baht representing 128 year on year growth this is thanks in large part to the huge rise in coal prices the company recently bought a gas rig from xto energy of the us and will reduce its coal revenue to only 50 of its total from 66 currently as it seeks greater exposure to the clean energy businesses second quarter profit came in almost 10 times higher than a year earlier top contractor for the contractor ck we expect second quarter earnings to jump 119 year on year and 268 quarter on quarter catalysed by a bigger dividend from ttw and an increasing contribution from bem while the current backlog of ck is 61 billion baht we expect the company to win new projects in the near term raising its backlog to more than 100 billion baht these include a project in luang prabang laos valued at 8 9 billion baht for which bidding will open later this year ck is our top pick for contractors in the information and communication technology space the share price of the it retailer and distributor com7 has fallen more than 15 year on year despite the prospect of attractive earnings growth of 19 this year second quarter profit should also be decent rising 15 year on year com7 has increased its branch count to 1 062 boding well for sales growth of 21 year on year to 14 billion baht the company has also invested in sabuy and set up a joint venture with the hospital operator bdms to expand its business base note however that these ventures will need one or two years before contributing to earnings com7 is currently trading at a price earnings ratio of only 23 times making it a good value stock given the current economic volatility and risk of earnings downgrades we recommend defensive stocks egco fits the bill here the power generator s earnings in the second quarter should increase by 46 year on year in our estimate egco has many new projects it plans to deliver this year including the nam theun power plant in laos in which it holds a 25 stake and the tpn oil pipeline project 45 stake with a steady profit trend and good dividend of 4 5 per year egco is a solid defensive stock to add to your portfolio

to reach 4 280 the benchmarks ended the week on a high note clinching the fourth straight winning week for the nasdaq composite and s p 500 investors have reacted positively to cpi and ppi data released this week that suggested inflation may have already peaked we are not arguing that the market will make new highs this year we are more in the trading range camp but we would not be surprised to see a run toward the highs as inflation eases and the fed slows the pace of rate hikes michael darda chief economist and market strategist at mkm partners said in a note according to cnbc 12 05pm us stocks higher at midday the major us indices were in the green at midday as the markets play gold against the american greenback and worry less about rising inflation rates at midday the dow jones industrial average was up 0 6 to 33 541 the s p 500 was up by 0 8 at 4 242 and the nasdaq composite was up by 0 6 at 12 921 michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets said receding inflation is tempering expectations that the federal reserve will be as aggressive as originally supposed when it comes to raising rates the latest university of michigan inflation survey was a bit of a mixed bag with confidence improving in august while one year inflation expectations declined to 5 however five to 10 year expectations edged higher to 3 from 2 9 the university of michigan consumer sentiment index rebounded to 55 1 from 51 5 in july and now sits above june s all time low of 50 hewson also noted the us dollar has seen a bit of a rebound today at the end of what has been a negative week for the greenback declining inflation expectations and weaker than expected inflation has seen markets reduce the prospects of a more aggressive federal reserve when it comes to raising rates this week s inflation numbers have shifted the dial on a 75bps rate hike in september to a less aggressive posture of 50bps hewson said another week of gains for gold prices according to hewson has put the commodity close to 1 800 an ounce which hints the us dollar bull run might have come to an end it s also interesting to note that gold prices have risen alongside equity markets which suggests there is little to no correlation between investor appetite for risk and gold prices hewson said meanwhile chris beauchamp chief market analyst at online trading platform ig said the bounce in risk assets has made it through another day the week is rounding out with further upside for equities as the general positive feeling in the wake of this week s inflation data continues beauchamp said but the drift higher seems set to carry on especially since the market is apparently content to ignore any warnings about further us interest rate hikes having been calmed by the downtick in us cpi and ppi this week beauchamp said at midday the major movers included on semiconductor up by 5 6 on news of positive year over year cash flow growth plus pinduoduo up by 4 8 and walt disney up by 2

which followed the below forecast us cpi data for july craig erlam senior market analyst uk emea oanda commented it s been another very good week for equity markets extending the run to four weeks in many cases as investors become more optimistic about the economic outlook this week has been all about the inflation data and frankly it could be the dominant force in the markets now right up until the jackson hole symposium the fact that inflation not only decelerated in the us but at a faster pace than the consensus forecasts was a double win and risk assets are feeling the benefit of course it doesn t take much of a dive into the data to see that fuel prices are having a considerable impact favourably for once this isn t something that s going to sway the fed at all even if it will ease the burden on the economy a little the fed will need to see broader signs of inflationary pressures softening to ease off the brake into year end erlam added it is worth highlighting also the apparent disconnect between the equity and bond markets equity markets give the impression that all is not as bad as it seemed the dow is less than 10 from its all time highs while the bond market has

house speaker nancy pelosi d calif attends the aug 9 signing of the chips and science act washington post photo by demetrius freeman washington house democrats on friday approved a sprawling bill to lower prescription drug costs address global warming raise taxes on some billion dollar corporations and reduce the federal deficit sending to president joe biden the long delayed last component of his economic agenda in time for this year s elections the 220 to 207 vote marked the culmination of roughly a year and a half of debate that at times pitted the party s lawmakers against each other revealing democrats fierce ideological divides in the end though the often fractious caucus banded together to overcome unanimous republican opposition adopting a measure to improve americans finances originally premised on biden s 2020 campaign pledge to build back better the bill known as the inflation reduction act of 2022 secures the largest ever investment to tackle climate change with roughly 370 billion dedicated to curbing harmful emissions and promoting green technology the bill also moves to cap and lower seniors drug costs while sparing about 13 million low and middle income americans from increases in their insurance premiums that otherwise would occur next year advertisement article continues below this ad to pay for the spending democrats rely on revisions to tax laws including a new minimum tax on some billion dollar corporations that now pay nothing to the u s government that change along with another new tax on stock buybacks and fresh funding for the internal revenue service to pursue tax cheats is expected to cover the costs of the bill democrats say it also can reduce the federal deficit by about 300 billion but they have yet to furnish a final fiscal analysis the winding tumultuous path to passage began soon after biden entered the white house as the pandemic savaged the u s economy last spring the president put forward a series of policy blueprints that aimed to re envision the role of government in americans lives biden s plans left virtually no portion of the country untouched seeking to rethink tax laws rehabilitate the nation s aging infrastructure and spend massive sums on health care education and climate democrats eventually adopted a 1 9 trillion american rescue plan to respond to the coronavirus last march then secured bipartisan support to invest 1 2 trillion in the nation s roads bridges pipes ports and internet connections last fall but the president s party warred with itself in the months to follow over the final piece of biden s agenda which targeted federal safety net benefits and longer term challenges such as global warming it took a string of uncomfortable public clashes seemingly intractable fights between party liberals and moderates including sen joe manchin w va before democratic leaders reached a delicate truce the deal chiefly brokered between manchin and senate majority leader chuck schumer n y last month forced party lawmakers to accept what many saw as agonizing compromises as they had no choice but to jettison plans to expand medicare offer free universal prekindergarten and authorize a raft of new aid for low income families advertisement article continues below this ad but democrats on friday still hailed the accomplishment however unlikely it once might have seemed by stressing it delivers on many of their past promises it s not anything that anybody three months ago would have said is a possibility house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said in an interview later emphasizing on the chamber floor that the bill expands the promise of health and financial security for generations to come democrats erupted in raucous applause as soon as they reached the votes required for passage shortly after that biden tweeted that he would sign it into law next week saying today the american people won special interests lost house republicans meanwhile mounted a stiff united opposition they attacked the measure as a tax increase on families even though it does not raise individuals rates and in speeches they insisted it would allow the government to hire tens of thousands of new irs agents to snoop around in your bank account your venmo your small business and then the government will shake you down for every last cent as house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif said advertisement article continues below this ad mccarthy s comments at one point describing the guns in the possession of the tax agency misstated the full purpose of the proposed irs funds still he described the fuller spending measure as the largest tone deaf bill he had ever seen today the people s house should be working to answer our country s call to address the rising price of gas groceries and just about anything else mccarthy said for democrats the vote friday clinched an achievement they long have seen as essential toward preserving their majorities in november anything less risked angering voters who were sold in 2020 on the promise that democrats would pursue dramatic economic change the victory particularly emboldened the party s liberals many of whom promised friday to continue fighting for the provisions abandoned in the name of compromise we insisted the democratic majority deliver said rep pramila jayapal d wash the leader of the congressional progressive caucus a major force in crafting the original 2 trillion proposal last year advertisement article continues below this ad we have won the argument for the president s full economic agenda that we passed in the build back better bill she said at a news conference now we just need a couple more democratic senators to make the rest of that agenda a reality democrats now face a test in selling the accomplishment at a moment of mixed economic signals and vast political uncertainty inflation is trending down yet prices are still high while the threat of a recession looms large despite recent strong growth in the labor market biden s popularity is low in some polls even after democrats notched a wide array of legislative victories in recent weeks including laws to restrict gun purchases expand veterans health care and manufacture much needed computer chips adding to the challenge a new analysis released friday by the penn wharton budget model offered a mixed review of the bill the report found it would reduce the deficit by about 264 billion over the next decade less than some democrats hoped with an effect on inflation that is statistically indistinguishable from zero americans are suffering are we here debating how to alleviate that suffering no said rep jason smith mo the top republican on the house budget committee adding the bill would not put out the fire of inflation advertisement article continues below this ad republicans have suggested in recent days that a gop majority in the next congress could try to roll back the legislation much as it tried repeatedly to do to the affordable care act adopted under president barack obama in 2009 rep steve scalise r la the house minority whip pledged this week his party would soon be rolling out an agenda that will reverse the bill but democrats seemed to welcome such a threat in a briefing with reporters on thursday a senior white house official said the outcome would help the party hone its new message to voters democrats are helping ordinary americans while republicans are extremists beholden to special interests and former president donald trump pelosi meanwhile told the washington post that the upcoming elections would offer democrats a big contrast with the gop she later added this is the path we re on the republicans want to take us off this path the inflation reduction act for the first time allows the u s government to negotiate the price of some medicines on behalf of seniors on medicare a novel system set to take effect in 2026 the bill also caps these seniors annual out of pocket prescription expenses at 2 000 a year beginning in 2025 and limits insulin co pays to 35 starting in 2023 for medicare patients advertisement article continues below this ad taking aim at drug manufacturers the proposal further imposes penalties on those that raise the price of medicare beneficiaries medicines faster than the rate of inflation while the inflation rebate does not apply to prescriptions written for americans on private insurance a casualty of the way democrats moved the bill in the senate lawmakers see the measure as a major victory after years of staunch pharmaceutical industry opposition for as long as i have been running for office people have been coming to me with concerns for the price of prescription drugs the fact i can say we have heard you we have taken a step forward is important said rep abigail spanberger d va a moderate running in a competitive race this november on climate change the bill includes 161 billion in new tax credits to incentivize clean electricity and about 80 billion to encourage consumers to purchase new or used electric vehicles and improve the energy efficiency of their homes it also approves 1 5 billion to cut down on methane a potent greenhouse gas a number of republicans took to the floor friday to lambaste democrats programs to respond to global warming rep lauren boebert colo at one point said lawmakers were sacrificing american families at the altar of climate change advertisement article continues below this ad in total though democrats stressed their climate related spending would reduce emissions by 40 below 2005 levels by the end of the decade and they pointed to a raft of extreme weather events as they made the case for aggressive action all of the experts are saying we re very close to the point of no return if we don t do something soon we might not be able to save the planet said rep bobby scott d va chairman of the education and labor committee to win manchin s vote however democrats also agreed to mandate new oil and gas leasing in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of alaska while backing a future bill to streamline permitting for pipelines and other infrastructure the concessions troubled some lawmakers including rep john yarmuth d ky who expressed alarm that democrats had catered too much to manchin and another moderate holdout sen kyrsten sinema d ariz what bugs me to this day is that ultimately kyrsten sinema and joe manchin are going to get credit for doing something where they put their own interest in front of everybody else s yarmuth the leader of the house budget committee said in an interview advertisement article continues below this ad only eight months earlier though it seemed unfathomable that democrats might pass any bill at all stymied by divisions that saw manchin walk away from talks in december the battle began in the spring after biden introduced the proposal known as the american families plan soon democrats on capitol hill began translating the president s vision into a bill that could be passed under the process known as reconciliation which in the senate allowed the party to overcome a gop filibuster congressional budget leaders yarmuth along with sen bernie sanders i vt eventually clinched an outline that allowed democrats to spend up to 3 5 trillion on their agenda in the months to follow every major house committee produced reams of pages of legislative text toward the massive spending bill which democrats likened to the great society reforms enacted under lyndon b johnson an analogy biden himself favored their resulting proposal aimed to expand medicare benefits invest billions of dollars in child care and free prekindergarten authorize new paid family and medical leave and raise taxes on wealthy americans and corporations but their ambitions quickly collided with the political reality liberals led by jayapal favored sizable new federal investments while the party had rare control of congress and white house but they clashed with moderates including manchin and sinema who took a more cautious fiscal view without all 50 senate democrats the party had no way to shepherd their bill through the chamber leaving the debate at a standstill advertisement article continues below this ad the tensions came to a head in late september as failed negotiations stalled the entirety of biden s legislative agenda including his infrastructure bill that prompted a rare intervention from biden who made a personal appeal to his party on capitol hill to find common ground house democrats eventually settled on a 2 trillion package which they adopted over gop opposition in november but manchin scuttled it a month later out of concern it might worsen inflation infuriating liberals who felt the party had been held hostage by a sole outlier even biden who once preached compromise expressed outrage at the collapse sparking days of public sniping between the white house and manchin talks resumed this spring between the moderate west virginian and schumer a set of intensely private discussions that often seemed on the verge of another disappointment even as democrats shaved billions of dollars and shelved some of their most prized plans to aid low income americans manchin remained troubled by its cost and at one point last month walked away from climate and tax policies he had once supported but schumer and manchin ultimately forged a deal by the end of the month opening the door for the senate to adopt it this month reflecting on the compromises democrats made on the eve of the house vote pelosi said in an interview that she had urged her members to respect the bill for what it does rather than make judgments about it for what it does not advertisement article continues below this ad but live to negotiate further she added
americans for tax reform opposes democrats reckless tax and spend the senate amendment to h r 5376 and urges all members of congress to vote no this legislation is a clear violation of president biden s promise to not raise taxes on anyone earning less than 400 000 as voters worry about runaway inflation and an economy in recession democrats are instead focused on raising taxes by roughly 750 billion to fund progressive priorities analysts ranging from the penn wharton budget model to sen bernie sanders i vt agree that this legislation does nothing to help inflation this bill will kill nearly 30 000 jobs reduce gdp and lower wages for workers this partisan bill supersizes the irs with 87 000 new irs agents to perform 1 2 million new audits on taxpayers and small businesses rather than provide relief for small businesses in a recession democrats put mainstreet in their crosshairs with new business tax increases even going as far as targeting passthrough businesses declaring losses the bill creates a new excise tax on stock buybacks that harms the retirement savings of any individual with a 401 k ira or union pension plan americans enduring high prices and expensive energy bills will be hit harder by the bill s tax hikes on natural gas crude oil and coal the bill deals a serious blow to medical innovation and will reduce the supply of life saving new medicines by creating government price controls and punitive tax increases on prescription drugs the bill extends boosted obamacare subsidies previously sold to the public as temporary covid 19 relief at the expense of taxpayers while relying on budget gimmicks to claim savings that exist only on paper democrats spent the country into inflation and are now taxing the u s economy into a recession americans for tax reform urges all members of congress to reject this bill and vote no

inflation reduction act will also combat climate change and invest in american energy to end our dependence on foreign energy sources like russia and china rep luria said the inflation reduction act delivers for coastal virginians in the short term while making long term investments to reduce the deficit and build a better future for generations of americans congresswoman abigail spanberger d va 07 today s vote is about siding with the virginia seniors who are struggling to afford their medications rather than siding with multinational pharmaceutical companies today s vote is about recognizing the hardships faced by virginia s working families as healthcare costs rise rather than refusing to take any steps to combat high costs and today s vote is about america leading the way in responsibly addressing climate change rather than ignoring the very real national security threat posed by climate change said spanberger this legislation will help lower prescription drug costs reduce healthcare premiums tackle federal deficits and strengthen domestic energy production including through clean energy jobs these are key priorities as our economy continues to recover and rebuild when we deliver results that lower costs for the american people and help them pay the bills we are investing in our financial security the economic independence of our nation and a stronger future for the next generation morgan griffith r va 09 under the misleading and inaccurate title of the inflation reduction act democrats put together a wrongheaded wish list that will raise taxes unleash the irs implement the green new deal and impose cure killing price controls in medicine this bill will not help americans struggling with high prices by raising taxes subsidizing unreliable energy sources and penalizing affordable fossil fuels it will make the cost of living crisis worse and thanks to the 80 billion this bill sends to the irs to hire 87 000 new agents more middle income earners can expect a time consuming and expensive audit these are the priorities of the current majorities in the house and senate and the biden administration americans will take note as they survey the consequences of this outrageous bill

our website at neomaterials com let me now turn the call over to constantine constantine karayannopoulos thank you ali and good morning everyone for the second quarter 2022 we are pleased to report yet again excellent quarterly performance throughout the company in the phase of continuing volatility globally customer demand remain healthy underpinned by pent up demand for end consumer product pricing for neo s critical materials remains in favorable levels due to this higher demand and for the first six months of the year we delivered our best financial results in the company s history our second quarter sales were a record 168 million with net income of 14 7 million or 0 36 per diluted share and adjusted ebitda of 26 5 million i m very proud of our team s ability to deliver on our plan by reliably and consistently providing innovative products to our customers we remain thankful to our customers and suppliers and all of our partners for their continuing support on the heels of our strongest first half the perception of uncertainty ahead of us continues particularly in news headlines and some recent earnings reports the challenges that have been with us for the past two years largely remain namely supply chain shortages including semiconductor chips shipping challenges covid lockdowns in china and manufacturing disruptions war in ukraine continues along with the associated sanctions the new challenges are weighing down consumer confidence such as central bank interest rate hikes around the world to battle back against inflationary pressures parsing out the impact of any one of these factors individually can be very very challenging for us we managed through these periods of uncertainty through direct conversations with our customers and by ensuring extraordinarily high levels of customer service and care based on continuous feedback from customers we adjust production plans and inventory positions almost daily we have gone through a few very tough years as a result of this pandemic around the world politics geopolitics and supply chain disruptions and many of us have repeatedly said that what we saw over this time has been quite unprecedented so i hope you bear with me when i again say that the current confluence factors in today s business environment is still very much unprecedented these challenges are not equal in terms of severity or duration while several economies are experiencing negative economic sentiment or outlook consumers are also clamoring for more cars electronics home appliances and increased travel to spend time with loved ones after global lockdowns of course consumers have to wait a lot longer for their major purchases to be delivered as anyone who has recently tried to buy a new car or a computer knows both discretionary and large durable goods remain in high demand but manufacturers cannot fulfill purchase orders in a timely manner economic case studies haven t really dealt with this scenario before so we are seeing variability in commercial activity among our customer base as an example within the automotive industry the first six months it played out hot and cold depending on the individual oem for example ford recently reported a surge in sales while general motors says 100 000 vehicles are awaiting chips in north america the average car dealer inventory available for sale is about two weeks that is a slight improvement from the start of this year but remains at all time low since this type of data was first reported 30 years ago also hot and cold depending on the geography europe automotive sales are down nearly 20 with the war in ukraine while china has just recently seen an explosive surge in june chinese vehicle demand has dealt with the same effects as north america combined with further intermittent lockdowns for covid this year that continue to cause market ripple effects notwithstanding persistently strong ev demand near term demand for new internal combustion engine cars in china dropped significantly at the start of the second quarter and lockdown related disruptions to various automotive component supply chains reach havoc in global automotive volumes yet we have already started to observe a strong rebound of sales of light duty vehicles in china exiting the quarter after we will see if the current new vehicle acquisition tax incentive sustains this improved demand through the end of the year the manufacturing sectors particularly automotive in korea and japan have languished longer than in other economies indications from automotive oems show that unit volumes are down 10 to 15 this year and will likely continue to decline through the back half of the year both honda and toyota have recently signaled semiconductor chip challenges that will further reduce anticipated production in the coming quarters reflective of a softer market in japan in the balance of these supply chain disruptions rare earth pricing remains substantially higher compared to last year our product average selling prices were about 50 higher compared to the previous year as to the prior year as longer term trends discussed last quarter remain intact for magnetic rare earth such as neodymium praseodymium pricing has eased through the second quarter and recent prices are down about 10 to 15 compared to the start of the year this is largely reflected to the diminished demand within in china during the second quarter as the intermittent shutdowns related to covid created some artificial drag across the industry covid impacts are continuing here as just this week china was forced to scramble to stem new omicron outbreaks in the hubs of tibet in the province of tibet and hainan we are seeing reports of magnet production being down 20 30 with some of the smaller producers facing serious questions on their survival motor manufacturers that fell victim to the ups and downs created by the semiconductor chip shortage are still sitting on inventories that led to some decreased magnet buying during the quarter with prices for rare earth precursor materials slipping in step taking a broad view we will continue to see some demand for all of our internally produced neodymium praseodymium molecule at current pricing levels innovation from our end customers continues so what does this mean for neo our employees our shareholders and all of our stakeholders our manufacturing operations around the world remain efficient but fakeness of the second half of this year s means that a sales pipeline has inherently a bit more risk today compared to the first half of this year while we acknowledge there is increased uncertainty we repel back the layers we are still finding general positivity from many of our customers what this looks like is that orders are not being canceled but customers may request to delay partial shipments as they catch up to downstream supply chain disruptions although raw material costs reagent costs and other general input costs have been increasing over the last few quarters we have been able to maintain our margins despite these cost pressures and with operating leverage across our p l we have been able to expand our adjusted ebitda and overall profitability by more than 200 basis points versus the previous five year average most of that has come with the automotive industry remaining down 10 it s important to note that our operating model is intact and our strategic growth initiatives remain on track with substantial exposure to the automotive aerospace electronics and consumer good sectors we adamantly believe long term demand for advanced product remains robust as the automotive industry reverts back to producing more than 90 million units per year and electric and hybrid vehicles maintain their growth rates we believe that neo will continue to be the preferred supplier of innovative materials that will outcompete and will be designed into our customers technologies over the next decade and beyond one effect of the current macro challenges is that normal seasonality can be thrown to the wind some of you will recall previous conversations on earning call after a quarter where we stress the seasonality that seems to be gone by the wayside as we speak while european summer holidays are still in effect production lines are operating if and when semiconductor chips arrive at the assembly door consumer electronics productions expected to moderate through the back half of the year rather than wrapping up to meet normal q4 holiday demand recent industry estimates have revised personal computer demand to be down about 10 this year as schools and offices reopened globally and the at home surge for electronics in 2020 and 2021 eases demand for hard disk drives and associated motors for servers that acquire a bonded permanent magnet solution will likely be needed as well yet our magnequench volumes continue to grow for those consumer home appliances improve deficiency technologies for automotive applications and thermal management devices for electronics including 5g stations servers laptops and gaming devices let me give you one highlight thermal management in both electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles is a big thing and a good casing point there are a number of sophisticated motors beyond drive trains that use rare permanent magnets within both electric and hybrid drive trains if various battery system components do not operate on optimal temperatures battery performance and vehicle range can be adversely impacted systems need to be actively cooled or heated depending on the required function all of this is done by synchronizing the refrigerant circuit with the coolant circuit to transport heat to and from different components neo s magnequench product development team has been working closely with major tier 1 automotive suppliers in europe china and japan on the supply of magnets for two very complex sophisticated small motors for these systems one is a coolant proportional valve which performs temperature regulation in the coolant circuit while interconnecting the battery and electric axle the other is a coolant valve which controls the refrigerant flow to switch from heating to cooling loads together with another controlled mechanism enable the design of an intelligent thermal unit for electric and hybrid drive train our magnequench rare earth magnets are vital to these systems operational precision size and weight all of which help to optimize battery performance and extend vehicle range and we have the critical know how and credibility with customers to help them develop these next generation technologies we see sizable growth opportunities for our materials in vehicle micro motors which should nicely complement our plans to expand more significantly into vehicle traction motors similarly we are developing next generation mixed oxides with new functionalities for hybrid and internal combustion motors while the transition towards the 2050 net neutral glide path is in front of us improvements are also required for traditional gas diesel and hybrid platforms we continue to believe that there will be a place to decade and beyond for those new products our portfolio for aerospace and electronic rare metals continues to outperform our internal expectations despite aerospace also observing supply chain disruptions for key components by diversifying our new product applications we adapt into a strong value add portfolio that contributes meaningfully to our bottom line and now that aerospace production and next generation electronic chip technologies continue to improve our rare metals team is working ideally to meet those needs with both primary and recycled metals for super alloys and other critical applications operationally we continue to make strides in improving our manufacturing sites and enhancing our customer relationships we are pleased to report that our magnequench facility located in tianjin china was recognized with an advanced safety production award this past month we are selected as one of 10 companies to receive this honor out of more than 1 200 eligible enterprises in the area our teams have been building the culture of accountability and safety for years in everything we do and we are proud of the systems we have implemented these systems focus on worker safety identifying dual prevention methods ensuring continuing maintenance and improvement and effectively managing and communicating risks and preventive measures with both our employees and local government authorities it s a tremendous honor for the teams who have received this recognition it also sets the tone as we further implement and integrate esg tracking systems as we continue to outperform our chemicals and metals industry peers on health environment safety and sustainability metrics our magnequench and rare metals teams have quickly moved forward to set up esg working past teams to help investigate and implement our strategic initiatives following our published sustainability report in the same manner that our teams have organically built strong safety systems we are methodically working through a long term planning for sustainability systems which are the frequent subject with customer and other stakeholder inquiries these days in europe we also continue to make headway with our sintered magnet expansion plan our magnequench teams are progressing rapidly on engineering permitting and construction planning for a greenfield neo magnet manufacturing plant in estonia to serve european automotive oem and tier 1 customers who clearly want us to make these products there as they ramp up electric vehicle production estonian government leaders also continue to express the support for assembling the financial packages necessary for us to make a final commitment to proceed we very much appreciate their continuing support the key reason that we expect neo will continue to outcompete is our proven commitment to esg principles with traceable and diverse supply chains that operate across every major region asia pacific europe and the america advancing our esg agenda is not only a matter of corporate citizenship it is an integral part of our long term strategy to increase the profitability of our business while some skepticism perhaps even cynicism is evident as examples of esg we like to differ with our peers in fact we are finding that the world s leading oems and tier 1 component suppliers not only require adherence to more rigorous and responsible principles but they are backing it up with higher price commitments to secure responsibly sourced materials and components when lowest cost is no longer the primary determinant then the real glide path towards decarbonization can be accelerated were we not bound by confidentiality obligations i d love to share with you specific conversations with large global customers clearly expressing their view which is a marching order for us and should also be for the rest of the industry that they will reward and i quote â competitiveness beyond total cost ownership â it is for this reason that our european expansion strategy included identifying a site that would be largely independent of russian gas supplier disruptions increasingly powered by renewable energy expanding optionality of upstream resource feedstock from more jurisdictions and pursuing end to end circular vertical integration for magnetic materials we are confident that neo sintered magnets will be produced in europe with some of the industry s lowest carbon footprint and adhering to the highest esg standards in our industry this will result in neoâ s magnets being the most long term competitive option for european ev manufacturers and other permanent magnet motor producers as it will help our oem customers to continuously improve their lifecycle assessment which is an increasing priority for them we believe that this set of value differentiators will drive long term growth and profitability for neo we also aim to further diversify our sources of raw materials and we have significant experience in assessing strategic mineral resources around the world i d like to share that we are in the late stage efforts for potential transaction that would provide neo with rights to very attractive magnetic materials rich mineral resource this type of diversification would further and ideally complement our current european rare earth magnet growth strategy this is in addition to our current supply agreement for rare earth concentrate that is being shipped from the united states by energy fuels out of utah we have been especially pleased with the cooperation by energy fuels to improve the quality of their feedstock heavy mineral sand base concentrate that skews favorably towards the magnetic elements we are also very supportive of their efforts to secure raw material resources globally as evident by the latest deal in brazil the global rare industry is being remained and we are happy to be working with the right partners in both directions of our supply chain it is also important to note that we have not experienced any supply disruptions from our rare earth material suppliers related to the conflict in ukraine the ongoing sanctions programs around the world continue to evolve and we are diligently monitoring the situation our raw material sourcing from outside of europe continues on its course for both rare metals as well as chemicals and oxides from an operations planning perspective we anticipate that a potential natural gas shortage to the chemicals industry may tighten the supply of certain processing reagents and other materials that we utilize but we do not expect to have any direct or lasting impact on our ability to operate a rare metals facilities there is also minimal usage of russian natural gas in our european operations either directly on site or indirectly as a primary source of energy generation as electricity generation is now primarily derived through local biomass while we continue to monitor the situation we pulled back on sales and ancillary products to certain firms that might indirectly ties to sanction russian enterprises we believe and overly cautious approach is prudent given the highly opaque and fluid ownership structures of many private enterprises in russia i m proud of our team s ability to navigate the current supply chain headwind and i m confident in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional products to our customers in any region we have seen challenging price and supply demand environments before and we know what it takes to deliver innovation and new technologies our current operating profile remains strong and we remain acutely focused on further diversifying our upstream while material supply and delivering environmentally sustainable materials for our customers iâ ll now turn the call over to rahim for financial details on the quarter rahim suleman thanks constantine and good morning everyone through the first six months of the year we are pleased to report that our product sales and operations perform largely within our expectations and at significantly higher levels in past performance the second quarter continued to show very strong sales performance driven by sustained elevated pricing environment customer demand for our products mostly remained healthy during q2 noting that constantine elaborated on the overall macro events that have led to heightened uncertainty across several industrial sectors in particular our geographic sales profile during the quarter was underweight toward japanese customers as the supply chain interruptions of semiconductor chip shortages more acutely impacted some automotive component manufacturers there this is particularly true as the driver for our lower magnequench volumes but we remain confident in our relationships with our customers and the programs that we have secured that the lower volumes are related to macro effects rather than company specific issues for a review of the quarter we reported a record sales figure of 168 2 million driven primarily by increased pricing which is about 50 higher compared to the prior year this improved pricing profile for our value added products helped offset volume declines the causes for which were discussed earlier as a reminder the first half of 2021 had unusually high volumes as the advanced material space refilled downstream supply chains following the 2020 covid year we reported net income of 14 7 million or 0 36 per diluted share an improvement of 13 over the prior year and we reported adjusted ebitda of 26 5 million and 19 improvement over the prior year on a sequential basis our profitability remains near all time highs but declined relative to the prior quarter related to the lead lag effect as our cost of sales began to catch up to a slowing pricing environment general rare earth pricing remains at recent historically high levels which continues to provide enhanced topline and additional dollar value margin in our income statement pricing for the magnetic materials such as neodymium praseodymium terbium and dysprosium moderated a little in the quarter while remaining significantly higher than recent previous years while other key rare earths were largely stable although our pass through pricing mechanisms and focus on our value added margins are largely agnostic to these price movements over the longer term the second quarter had a mix of some positive and some negative impacts related to lead lag these dynamics make it paramount for us to be more selective in our raw material sourcing and is a testament to our ongoing focus on strategically expanding our base of raw material suppliers there remains adequate raw material feedstock in the market today and our local teams remain perfectly positioned to pursue the most economically beneficial sources available we are diligently managing our inventory volume levels and seeking whenever possible to convert higher priced inventory units into cash the fundamental economic model remains intact and our free cash flow position improved in the quarter this is entirely normal following a relatively volatile pricing environment in a rising pricing environment we will see the benefit appear first on the topline as shown by the recent quarters record performance and then cash generation flows through as pricing stabilizes our cash flow from operating activities improved sequentially from the first quarter by nearly 14 million and our additional investment in overall working capital slowed substantially if current pricing environments remain stable we would expect to not to continue to build working capital as we have in the last year but rather we would convert more earnings into cash our balance sheet remains healthy with 66 2 million of cash and cash equivalence and our net cash position improved sequentially during the quarter we also invested 2 6 million into plant property equipment and distributed 3 2 million in dividends to shareholders as we pursue our strategic growth initiatives including the expansion of our magnequench portfolio into sintered magnets outside of china and the relocation and expansion of one of our primary mixed oxide production facilities we anticipate that we will fund these initiatives primarily through a combination of our existing balance sheet strength cash generated from operations and debt financing both existing and anticipated we remain committed to pursuing our long term strategic growth initiatives and are well positioned to take advantage of long term trends for new precision motor innovation next generation catalyst technologies and further improvements in aerospace and the electronics industries i ll now turn the call back to constantine for closing remarks constantine are you with us constantine karayannopoulos sorry rahim i was on mute thank you there is a lot of positive momentum occurring throughout the company and we look forward to continuing to update all of you on our strategic growth initiatives while i usually prefer not to comment on neoâ s relative valuation in this forum it is obviously a key piece of information that myself our board of directors and our shareholders are keenly aware suffice to say that we do not believe that neoâ s underlying value proposition and growth potential are adequately reflected in our market value today we are proud of our accomplishments over our past 12 months and we keenly focused on locking additional growth through our sintered magnet expansion plans within europe and whatever comes next after that yet the trading range of neoâ s common shares over the past quarter in my opinion is more reflective of mature conservative value oriented companies rather than a growing advanced materials specialty materials leader that is supplying some of the largest high profile companies in the world for those of you who know me and our management group as well as our company s history and culture you very well know that we are not stock promoters so shamelessly plagiarize our friend and partner mark chalmers ceo of energy fuels we re doers we re not talkers we have a longstanding record of executing to plan in order to build sustainable value yet at least in trading levels we are entering territory where we as management and the board were fiduciaries are required to evaluate strategic alternatives we believe adamantly in the underlying value of our business and if partnering with others that also recognize that value or otherwise pursuing new path will help to accelerate our growth then we will strongly consider it listen i thought long enough i appreciate your understanding and neither i nor the company will be taking additional questions on this specific topic but we ll be happy to open the lines for other questions at this time operator question and answer session operator thank you we will take our first question from yuri lynk with canaccord genuity please go ahead yuri lynk good morning constantine you talked about being in the late stages of a transaction to secure some rare earth feedstock can you provide any more detail on that are we talking about an investment in a mine or is it a byproduct type of deal and any comments on the geography constantine karayannopoulos yes thanks yuri i ve hinted at this in a previous call in the last couple of months we ve gotten into the details and we re getting pretty close as i said in my comments it s a deposit it s not a mine it s a primary deposit in a friendly jurisdiction high esg jurisdiction and also one that would allow us to have fairly limited carbon footprints with regards to supplying that material to either our plant in europe and estonia or through north america beyond that given that there is some â a few more conditions to come together there s a couple more shoes that need to drop before i can openly speak about it but we re very pleased with what we managed to do and this is again part of our vertical integration strategies both downstream and upstream but we re certainly very pleased with the state of affairs and how much progress we made here but i can t really comment much more on that yuri lynk okay and what type of capital commitment are we talking and source of funds constantine karayannopoulos sure it s shockingly low i mean we re certainly not betting the farm and we re funding that of cash flow it s not going to put a dent in our working capital or anything like that so i do expect that we should be able to comment in the near future about it right now i really can t provide any more information yuri lynk understood one for rahim just with rare earth prices leveling off declining slightly in the last few months should we be expecting q3 margins to kind of approximate your historical run rate rahim suleman yes i think there s probably a mix in there so i think that generally as prices have now been at least reasonably stable for six months that s a true statement that things will return to normalized margin levels without the lead lag but as we ve mentioned before higher pricing levels and we certainly are at higher pricing levels do allow more dollar value margins so weâ ve been independent of lead lag certainly i think that the benchmark is higher than historicals yuri lynk okay i ll turn it over there constantine karayannopoulos yuri before you go let me jump in and also want to stress that the deal that i m referring to â the upstream deal that i m referring to just because it s not going to put a dent in our cash balance is not going to be a diluter we re not going to use stock to do it either so it will be a non dilutive fairly with a very strong security of access to the material but again we should be able to talk more about it the next little while so we ll have a lot more to say at that point operator we ll take our next question from frederic bastien with raymond james please go ahead frederic bastien good morning constantine karayannopoulos good morning frederic frederic bastien i know you have provided some goal posts in the past but i d like to go over your expansion plans in estonia again and what sort of capital requirements you re looking at perhaps let s start with the easiest one your ambitions to increase rare earth processing capacity which obviously is natural expansion of what you re already doing at summit what are your ultimate capacity goals and whether it s doubling or tripling capacity and what kind of investments are you contemplating to get you there constantine karayannopoulos thanks frederic yes it s a multifaceted question our expansion in estonia and whatever upstream deals we put in place will continue to be driven by our magnet expansion at this stage phase i of what we re planning to build for magnet capacity can be adequately serviced through our existing capacity phase ii will require either buying more ndpr and dy tb in the market or putting together an expansion something in the order of doubling perhaps a bit more of our existing capacity a rare earth separation capacity in estonia and even more so expanding into heavy rare earth production that we expect will be in the tens of millions of dollars in order to achieve that and for us of course it s a lot easier to expand an existing facility than to build a grassroots or greenfield rather facility somewhere where the infrastructure doesn t exist so perhaps the cost â the capital cost of an expansion in rare earth production around estonia will be significantly lower than any other greenfield projects that you maybe familiar with however the progression of that development will be phase i magnet production first followed by phase ii magnet production and a simultaneous expansion in capacity or additional arrangements to provide that security of supply through external suppliers does that make sense frederic bastien yes it s important to not put the cart before the horse now now turning to the magnet plant do you have an estimate of what it will cost and how long it would take to build from the moment you break ground perhaps starting with that first phase and then moving onto eventually a second phase constantine karayannopoulos yes phase i we re looking to do something in the order of 1 500 tons a year of alloys which would translate into something in the order of 400 tons a year magnets that number keeps creeping up given the feedback from customers both tier 1 and oems in europe so i wouldn t be surprised if by the time we break ground the final design is even higher than that but round numbers that s sort of the ballpark that we re looking at phase i we expect it will cost in the ballpark of 50 perhaps with inflation and material price pressures raw material price pressure rather 50 million to 60 million to put it all in place and phase i plus phase ii which would see this go to something around the 5 000 ton a year magnet capacity should be in the 200 million ballpark again now we would have access to a number of funding mechanism both grants and low interest loans in addition to our own balance sheet and other more market loans reflecting ongoing rates but we maintain pretty confident that we can finance this capacity extension in this new plant production â new plant construction adequately in terms of timing i think what we re talking about is a construction period of the better part of the year we have the major components identified we have been having conversations with the key component suppliers and i do expect that if we were able to break ground by the end of this year we should be in a position to start production or ramping up by the end of next year so it would be a 2024 ramp up event that would allow us to hit the ground running at full capacity by 2025 which is really the objective that we re trying to meet as expressed in terms of demand by one of the largest oems in europe that really need us to be in place and operating by 2025 frederic bastien okay that s super clear thanks so much and then maybe my last one how much of government assistance are you looking for with respect to partly funding that expansion constantine karayannopoulos in phase i because that s â we are engaged with folks on these discussions for phase i we re looking at least what we anticipate and what is been expressed in terms of all the discussions we re having is something in the order of about a 20 capital grant so out of the 50 or so will we expect to get something in the order of 10 million or just north of 10 anything more than that would be a pleasant surprise will be welcome of course but we think that this is very doable and itâ s well within the parameters of the granting mechanisms in europe as part of the various funds that have been designed to promote green technology and supply chain resilience now for phase ii i would expect â yes phase ii would be a bigger project and they would qualify for grants under different programs that we expect could be even larger than the 20 ballpark that i mentioned but that s another ball of wax i don t want to get too far ahead there on this frederic bastien yes that s great thanks and it s pretty exciting good luck with everything constantine karayannopoulos yes thanks frederic we re definitely excited ourselves operator we ll take our next question for mark neville with scotiabank please go ahead mark neville hey good morning constantine hi good morning rahim constantine karayannopoulos good morning mark mark neville hey good morning do you mind just repeating sorry what you said about the strategic alternatives constantine karayannopoulos sorry the strategic what mark neville yes do you just mind repeating sort of what you said about the strategic alternatives i just did catch what you said sorry constantine karayannopoulos well i d be happy to read my script mark neville sure yes that s fine constantine karayannopoulos yes perhaps there was some frustration that was coming through in my comments that given the performance of the company we look at the share price and there s disconnect there and we can t really bridge that all i was saying is that as we re being approached by folks who want to do things with neo we will be a bit more receptive than we would ve been say year ago simply because if we see opportunities to do something a bit unconventional to increase value for our shareholders we will look at alternatives that perhaps we were not willing to look a year ago simple as that whether those are private equity private taxation m a whether it s the whole range there are a number of conversations taking place but of course i can t say much more than that but all i m saying is that we are much more receptive to approaches and those approaches are materializing mark neville okay fair maybe just on the following the yuri questions on the upstream it sound clear you re not looking to get into mining correct like it s you said it s a â yes sorry constantine karayannopoulos yes we re not looking at an existing mine but we are looking at a deposit that could become a mine again it will become a lot more clear when we are able to talk about it but honestly when you have mining companies looking to become magnet companies and enjoying multiples that are in the stratosphere i think it only makes sense from a business point of view beyond markets and shareholder expectations i think it makes all sense in the world from an operating perspective to be looking to secure our upstream this is what our customers need if we could â we are buyers in the market which means we cannot control either our cost of raw materials or we cannot control â we cannot fix our prices or make our pricing a bit more predictable and this is something that supply chains desperately need the oems the tier 1s are screaming for price predictability and unless we own the dirt in the ground we cannot give them that that s all we re saying and this is really an effort not only to diversify away from resources that have to come a long way from a long way away but also to create a cost structure that is a bit more predictable and we have a bit more control over it that as simple as that mark mark neville okay the grants that you re waiting on or you re talking about phase i is that with the estonia government or is that with the eu constantine karayannopoulos well it s eu funds that have been awarded to estonia to distribute as they see fit but also every grant needs to be blessed finally by the eu on esg and other grounds so it s a bit of both the estonia government needs to pick the project that they will fund but then ultimately those projects need to be also approved by brussels so it s a bit of a circular approach mark neville yes okay and do you â or could you share with us sort of where you re at on the process or where the application is if it sits with estonia or eu constantine karayannopoulos yes originally as i said in previous calls that process â the file submission is opening up for all of europe at the beginning of september estonia through their efforts and our efforts opened the process a little sooner we had filed that we ve gone back and forth to the various officials in the government we are getting feedback we think we re in an excellent position to qualify for that support but again as i said the decisions by the estonian government have not been made other than we ve only received encouraging signs and positive feedback on the quality of our file but no decisions yet and once the estonia government makes that decision or that recommendation that decision needs to be approved by brussels so we re still in the early parts of the process but we re way ahead from where we were three months ago mark neville could you start construction work before the grant or would that disqualify you from the grant constantine karayannopoulos no no we can start today if we wanted to just that given how politics works and how priorities tend to shift in europe i would rather have iron cloud assurances that the support will be there i mean if the support is not going to be there i think we ll need to make our decisions and frankly the project is attractive enough that we would eventually go ahead on our own without grant support itâ s just that in order for the economics to make sense and as i said i think on the previous call this is part of managing the financial risk of the project because the market risk and the technology risk weâ re pretty comfortable with the financial risk needs two unknowns to come together one is the pricing and the whatever premium to less attractive alternatives exist for european customers and the second is capex support which is this i think when it all comes together it makes for a very attractive project if one of those two parameters is not there the project is not as attractive but still doable so we would prefer to make sure that all of those conditions are in place before we start but if things get too delayed we might â as you said we might decide to go alone without grants that would not be our preference mark neville and the pricing arrangements you would negotiate with the oes or the clients the customer sorry how exactly would that work again you made the comments a few minutes ago but not controlling your feedstock and the price so i m just curious how would you â how the long term pricing arrangements work constantine karayannopoulos well not too differently from what our pricing arrangements are now where we do have a formula with pretty well every one of our magnet customers â our magnequench customers that the price gets adjusted either monthly or quarterly or semiannually or annually given what happens to the prices of our raw material inputs i would expect to see that formula continue until because â and that s the reason the main reason for that is none of the major raw material produces none of the mining companies not lynas or mp materials are willing to provide long term predictable pricing it s all spot and of course that cuts both ways mind you but i believe that if a company like us eventually controls its raw material cost then we would be much more willing to at least a portion of that output sell it at much more predictable longer term pricing contracts mark neville got it and sorry just last sort of digging up all the time but one last question constantine you mentioned i think mixed oxide capacity relocating some of that i think that s new maybe not but can just maybe talk with that constantine karayannopoulos yes this is a project in china that we ve referred to in the past and talked about in the disclosures we are upgrading and moving our mixed oxide capacity within the same area to a new industrial park and that s something that we ve been working on it for about a year or so we are in the process of doing that mark neville no sorry i thought you were referring to something else so that s clear constantine karayannopoulos yes cancel the project we talked a little bit in the past about it mark neville all right yes thanks again for all the time really appreciate it good luck guys constantine karayannopoulos okay yes thanks mark operator we ll take our next question from david ocampo with cormark securities please go ahead david ocampo thanks for taking my questions just a couple of quick headers constantine just to follow up on the pricing dynamic that you re talking about there are your customers willing to pay a premium for diversifying their supply chains and sourcing material from europe as opposed to china constantine karayannopoulos the short answer is yes however that premium comes with a lot of strings attached it comes with high esg performance it comes with low carbon footprints it comes with a circular operation it comes with supply chain resiliency and so on and so forth so it s not â they re not going to pay us the premium just because they like us or just because we re neighbors in estonia we need to put all those things together in a way that make sense and allows them as i refer to like comments to continue to reduce their life cycle carbon footprints life cycle effect and so on so it s not a simple case and please don t take my comments wrong this is not clearly it s not an effort to lessen dependence from one particular jurisdiction â on one particular jurisdiction although at any time you have a supply chain concentration in one jurisdiction that comes with inherent risks as we are finding out continuously with lockdowns and so on and so forth so i think it s not healthy for the industry to be reliant on one particular jurisdiction for the vast majority of its purchases so i think supply chains are coming together perhaps in slightly different ways in order to make those supply chains much shorter much more local and much more resilient and we are trying to take advantage of that but at the same time that performance needs to come together with an extremely high esg set of practices that allow all these oems to deliver on promises and expectations that they have been making and withstanding over the last few years david i don t know if that answers your question butâ david ocampo no that was good and i ll leave it there since we re coming up on the hour thanks so much guys constantine karayannopoulos okay all right thanks you operator we ll take our next question from ian gillies with stifel please go ahead ian gillies good morning everyone with respect to funding of phase i in estonia you mentioned a 10 million grant potentially coming in is there additional government financing outside of this through a loan as well because if we go back in the course of time i think at one point this was thought to be funded kind of 50 through government funding and 50 through cash on hand or some other source of funds constantine karayannopoulos yes listen in addition to the grants there both eu and the australian government made it very clear we have been in discussions with funding agencies in europe whether it s the european bank ebrd and so on who ve made it very clear that the project we qualify for low interest loans to what extent that will be the case we will go soon enough but yes the idea is to provide a financing package that includes grant low interest loans perhaps some market loans and their own cash ian gillies okay that s helpful and just i wanted to get one last clarification on the comments around potential strategic alternatives are you able to say whether you re actively engaged or would you just qualify what s going on right now is interesting conversations ali mahdavi yes itâ s ali we ve made it clear that there is no questions on this obviously it s not the forum to discuss anything material like this but it was just more indicative of our view on valuation so we ll leave it at that ian gillies okay thank you that s helpful operator we have no further questions in the queue i would like to turn the conference back to the presenters for any additional or closing remarks ali mahdavi thank you operator on behalf of the neo team again we d like to thank you for dialing in today getting the update on the quarterly results if you have any questions as usual please feel free to reach out to any one of us i m available and we look forward to further updates which will be coming out and as constantine said stay tuned we ve got a lot of good things that we re working on that concludes today call have a great weekend and iâ ll pass it back to the operator to close the call operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this does conclude todayâ s conference we appreciate your participation you may now disconnect

the bill has breathed life into the democratic party s ambitions to retain control of congress in upcoming elections the us congress has passed the democratic party s climate and healthcare bill in what is likely to be considered the most substantial legislative success of his first term democrats hope that the 430bn bill will help them maintain control of congress in november s midterm elections the bill passed 220 207 on friday and includes 375bn meant to encourage a shift away from fossil fuels as well as 64bn to help people cover health insurance premiums the bill is substantially less ambitious than the party originally hoped for but is considered a sizable achievement given the party s narrow majority in congress the bill now heads to us president joe biden for signature today is a day of celebration a day we take another giant step in our momentous agenda said house speaker nancy pelosi a democrat she said the measure meets the moment ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives democrats hope a series of recent legislative wins paired with voter frustration with the supreme court s decision to invalidate abortion rights and an increasingly right wing republican party will bolster biden s low popularity and demonstrate that the democratic party can deliver wins for their agenda republicans opposed the bill in the house and the senate where the bill passed on sunday with vice president kamala harris casting the tiebreaking vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford said republican house minority leader kevin mccarthy i can almost see glee in their eyes today the american people won special interests lost with the passage of the inflation reduction act in the house families will see lower prescription drug prices lower health care costs and lower energy costs i look forward to signing it into law next week president biden potus august 12 2022 the bill is a sign of how much democrats were forced to whittle down their agenda due to opposition from more conservative members of their own party biden s initial proposal would have spent 3 5 trillion over 10 years and included free preschool paid family and medical leave and expanded medicare benefits however with the us senate split down the middle senator joe manchin from west virginia used his substantial leverage to cut the bill saying that it was too expensive manchin has received substantial political contributions from the fossil fuel industry and was criticised for obstructing biden s agenda negotiations between manchin and senate majority leader chuck schumer had seemed to have stalled until the two unexpectedly announced a bargain last month on the new package the current bill is still considered substantially more ambitious than any previous legislation when it comes to cutting emissions and combatting climate change the bill includes more than 370bn over 10 years to encourage industry and consumers to break away from carbon emitting to cleaner forms of energy as well as 4bn to help the western us cope with severe drought the bill uses spending tax credits and loans to give a shot in the arm to technology such as solar panels home energy efficiency and air pollution controls for farms ports and low income communities among others healthcare was another key focus of the legislation with 64bn to assist 13 million people cover expenses for private health insurance premiums over the next three years medicare a government health insurance programme for people aged 65 and older would gain the ability to negotiate prices for certain pharmaceutical drugs and some prescription costs for drugs such as insulin would be capped the law is expected to raise about 740bn in revenue over the next 10 years by increasing taxes on some 1bn corporations levies on stock buybacks and more robust tax enforcement on the wealthy lower drug prices stemming from the ability of medicare to negotiate would also contribute hundreds of billions of dollars in savings the bills s supporters say republicans have latched onto the spending to bolster the internal revenue service irs and have pushed a false claim that 87 000 new irs agents would target average families there is not a plan to add that number of agents the money in the bill is earmarked to hire agents to replace the estimated 50 000 eligible to retire in the next five years as well as to upgrade technology and operations the false claims by republicans appear to be a fear tactic ahead of congressional midterm elections in november us treasury secretary janet yellen has also instructed the irs to focus enforcement efforts on families and businesses that make more than 400 000 a year though democrats have named the bill the inflation reduction act ira analysts doubt it will have a perceptible impact on prices democrats are hoping this bill alongside other recent successes will help the them in the midterm elections when the party in power is traditionally outperformed by the opposition several other legislative successes have democrats feeling more optimistic they may be able to beat the odds those wins include the passage of a bill that would boost us semiconductor manufacturing another that expands health care and disability benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and a meagre gun control bill

a wall street sign is pictured in new york city a number of chinese state owned enterprises announced on friday that they will seek delistings from the new york stock exchange a move experts said is a sensible business choice made on their own to reduce their exposure to regulatory uncertainties china s major oil producers sinopec and petrochina had both informed the nyse that they will apply for voluntary delistings of their american depositary shares listed on the exchange in accordance with laws and regulations the energy behemoths said in separate announcements on friday citing the small trading volumes of their us listings but heavy relevant compliancy costs the companies said they plan to submit delisting filings to the us securities and exchange commission around aug 29 and are expected to stop being listed on the nyse by september three other state owned enterprises china life insurance co ltd aluminum corp of china ltd and sinopec shanghai petrochemical co ltd also said on friday they will voluntarily apply to delist from the new york bourse effective early next month the china securities regulatory commission the country s top stock market regulator said on friday that it respects the decisions made by the us listed chinese issuers based on their own conditions the commission will maintain communication with relevant overseas regulatory agencies to jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the chinese enterprises and their investors an unnamed official from the csrc was quoted as saying in an online statement listing and delisting are normal activities in the capital market according to announcements from relevant enterprises they have strictly abided by the us capital market rules and regulatory requirements since their listing in the us and the delisting decisions were made out of considerations for their own business development the official said as these enterprises are listed in multiple stock markets and their shares traded in the us only account for a small proportion of the total their delisting plans from the us stock markets will not affect the continued use of domestic and foreign capital markets for financing and development the official added the delisting decisions came amid an ongoing audit dispute between china and the us that has exposed some us listed chinese issuers to the risk of forced delistings dong dengxin director of wuhan university of science and technology s finance and securities institute said the delisting decisions of those enterprises are sensible as chinese enterprises face a discriminatory regulatory environment in the us the holding foreign companies accountable act which was passed in 2020 in the us has meant that chinese enterprises were forced to deal with unreasonably strict and institutionally discriminatory information disclosure requirements he said
a divided congress gave final approval friday to democrats flagship climate and health care bill handing president joe biden a back from the dead triumph on coveted priorities that the party hopes will bolster their prospects for keeping their house and senate majorities in november s elections the house used a party line 220 207 vote to pass the legislation prompting hugs among democrats on the house floor and cheers by white house staff watching on television today the american people won special interests lost tweeted the vacationing biden who was shown beaming in a white house photo as he watched the vote on tv from kiawah island south carolina he said he would sign the legislation next week the measure is but a shadow of the larger more ambitious plan to supercharge environment and social programs that biden and his party unveiled early last year even so democrats happily declared victory on top tier goals like providing congress largest ever investment in curbing carbon emissions reining in pharmaceutical costs and taxing large companies hoping to show they can wring accomplishments from a routinely gridlocked washington that often disillusions voters today is a day of celebration a day we take another giant step in our momentous agenda said house speaker nancy pelosi d calif who minutes later announced the final vote as she presided over the chamber she said the measure meets the moment ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives republicans solidly opposed the legislation calling it a cornucopia of wasteful liberal daydreams that would raise taxes and families living costs they did the same sunday but senate democrats banded together and used vice president kamala harris tiebreaking vote to power the measure through that 50 50 chamber democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford said house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif i can almost see glee in their eyes biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion proposal also envisioned free prekindergarten paid family and medical leave expanded medicare benefits and eased immigration restrictions that crashed after centrist sen joe manchin d w va said it was too costly using the leverage every democrat has in the evenly divided senate still the final legislation remained substantive its pillar is about 375 billion over 10 years to encourage industry and consumers to shift from carbon emitting to cleaner forms of energy that includes 4 billion to cope with the west s catastrophic drought spending tax credits and loans would bolster technology like solar panels consumer efforts to improve home energy efficiency emission reducing equipment for coal and gas powered power plants and air pollution controls for farms ports and low income communities another 64 billion would help 13 million people pay premiums over the next three years for privately bought health insurance medicare would gain the power to negotiate its costs for pharmaceuticals initially in 2026 for only 10 drugs medicare beneficiaries out of pocket prescription costs would be limited to 2 000 starting in 2025 and beginning next year would pay no more than 35 monthly for insulin the costly diabetes drug the bill would raise around 740 billion in revenue over the decade over a third from government savings from lower drug prices more would flow from higher taxes on some 1 billion corporations levies on companies that repurchase their own stock and stronger irs tax collections about 300 billion would remain to defray budget deficits a sliver of the period s projected 16 trillion total against the backdrop of gop attacks on the fbi for its court empowered search of former president donald trump s florida estate for sensitive documents republicans repeatedly savaged the bill s boost to the irs budget that s aimed at collecting an estimated 120 billion in unpaid taxes over the coming decade and republicans have misleadingly claimed that the irs will hire 87 000 agents to target average families rep andrew clyde r ga said democrats would also weaponize the irs with agents many of whom will be trained in the use of deadly force to go after any american citizen sen chuck grassley r iowa asked thursday on fox and friends if there would be an irs strike force that goes in with ak 15s already loaded ready to shoot some small business person few irs personnel are armed and democrats say the bill s 80 billion 10 year budget increase would be to replace waves of retirees not just agents and modernize equipment they have said typical families and small businesses would not be targeted with treasury secretary janet yellen directing the irs this week to not increase the share of small business or households below the 400 000 threshold that would be audited republicans say the legislation s new business taxes will increase prices worsening the nation s bout with its worst inflation since 1981 though democrats have labeled the measure the inflation reduction act nonpartisan analysts say it will have a barely perceptible impact on prices the gop also says the bill would raise taxes on lower and middle income families an analysis by congress nonpartisan joint committee on taxation which didn t include the bill s tax breaks for health care and energy estimated that the corporate tax boosts would marginally affect those taxpayers but indirectly partly due to lower stock prices and wages house democrats ensured voters will fire them this fall said spokeswoman torunn sinclair of the house gop campaign committee in an email she listed dozens of democrats in competitive reelections who will face republican attacks for raising taxes and

the house floor and cheers by white house staff watching on television today the american people won special interests lost tweeted the vacationing biden who was shown beaming in a white house photo as he watched the vote on tv from kiawah island south carolina he said he would sign the legislation next week the measure is but a shadow of the larger more ambitious plan to supercharge environment and social programs that biden and his party unveiled early last year even so democrats happily declared victory on top tier goals like providing congress largest ever investment in curbing carbon emissions reining in pharmaceutical costs and taxing large companies hoping to show they can wring accomplishments from a routinely gridlocked washington that often disillusions voters today is a day of celebration a day we take another giant step in our momentous agenda said house speaker nancy pelosi d calif who minutes later announced the final vote as she presided over the chamber she said the measure meets the moment ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives house speaker nancy pelosi speaks during a news conference at the us capitol in washington d c us on wednesday aug 10 2022 ting shen bloomberg via getty images previous senate passes inflation reduction act house to vote next republicans solidly opposed the legislation calling it a cornucopia of wasteful liberal daydreams that would raise taxes and families living costs they did the same sunday but senate democrats banded together and used vice president kamala harris tiebreaking vote to power the measure through that 50 50 chamber democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford said house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif i can almost see glee in their eyes biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion proposal also envisioned free prekindergarten paid family and medical leave expanded medicare benefits and eased immigration restrictions that crashed after centrist sen joe manchin d w va said it was too costly using the leverage every democrat has in the evenly divided senate still the final legislation remained substantive its pillar is about 375 billion over 10 years to encourage industry and consumers to shift from carbon emitting to cleaner forms of energy that includes 4 billion to cope with the west s catastrophic drought spending tax credits and loans would bolster technology like solar panels consumer efforts to improve home energy efficiency emission reducing equipment for

to the irs budget that s aimed at collecting an estimated 120 billion in unpaid taxes over the coming decade and republicans have misleadingly claimed that the irs will hire 87 000 agents to target average families rep andrew clyde r ga said democrats would also weaponize the irs with agents many of whom will be trained in the use of deadly force to go after any american citizen sen chuck grassley r iowa asked thursday on fox and friends if there would be an irs strike force that goes in with ak 15s already loaded ready to shoot some small business person few irs personnel are armed and democrats say the bill s 80 billion 10 year budget increase would be to replace waves of retirees not just agents and modernize equipment they have said typical families and small businesses would not be targeted with treasury secretary janet yellen directing the irs this week to not increase the share of small business or households below the 400 000 threshold that would be audited republicans say the legislation s new business taxes will increase prices worsening the nation s bout with its worst inflation since 1981 though democrats have labeled the measure the inflation reduction act nonpartisan analysts say it will have a barely perceptible impact on prices the gop also says the bill would raise taxes on lower and middle income families an analysis by congress nonpartisan joint committee on taxation which didn t include the bill s tax breaks for health care and energy estimated that the corporate tax boosts would marginally affect those taxpayers but indirectly partly due to

change bill now they have to sell it the vote was 220 207 with all democrats voting in favor and all republicans opposing with the midterm elections quickly approaching congressional democrats have had a series of legislative victories in recent weeks expanding nato securing health care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits investing nearly 53 billion into the u s semiconductor industry and passing bipartisan gun safety legislation that momentum has culminated into passage of the inflation reduction act an offshoot of the many versions of president joe biden s failed build back better act the ira which the senate advanced sunday with vice president kamala harris breaking a tie now heads to biden s desk for his signature with biden poised to sign the bill in the coming days house democrats say their focus should now shift to touting its benefits to americans they readily admit they failed to adequately communicate to the american people how previous massive legislation that passed this congress would improve their lives including last year s 1 trillion infrastructure package rep ro khanna d calif said democrats need an all hands on deck approach that gets beyond the media and the beltway and directly into communities we need administration officials we need members of congress we need state legislatures we need 1 000 surrogates flooding every community in this country khanna said in an interview we need to do things like that have people out in their communities not just their districts but in communities across this country talking about why this is going to matter rep jimmy gomez d calif touted three tax credit provisions in the inflation reduction act one for used electric vehicles including hybrids and two for home efficiency for new and existing homeowners a lot of times people don t recognize the significance of these achievements gomez said they don t know what was in it and they don t know how they benefit forty one percent of americans are familiar with the inflation reduction act according to a reuters ipsos poll released this week more than a quarter of respondents however said they ve never heard of the legislation while nearly a third acknowledged having heard of it but not knowing more about it the bill will allow medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices cap out of pocket drug expenses for medicare beneficiaries at 2 000 per year and cap drugmakers price increases on climate it will reduce emissions by about 40 by 2030 proponents say the measure will also impose new taxes on wealthy corporations and their stock buyback programs and provide funding to beef up the internal revenue service s taxpayer services and enforcement it includes 4 billion to address the water crisis along the colorado river speaker nancy pelosi d calif framed the legislation as a kitchen table issue at a news conference hours ahead of the vote if you are sitting at your kitchen table and wonder how you re going to pay the bills your health care bills your prescription drug bills this bill s for you pelosi said rep josh harder d calif one of the most vulnerable democrats in california seeking reelection stressed the importance of getting savings to americans as quickly as possible families in the central valley are paying an arm and a leg at the grocery store and the gas pump right now so our no 1 priority has to be implementing this bill so they see real savings on their prescription drugs their health care costs and their energy bills harder told the los angeles times house gop leadership mocked the bill as the inflation recession and irs army act in a message sent to all house republicans offices in a lengthy floor speech house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif panned the legislation as a misguided tone deaf bill that will raise taxes and hand out tax credits like candy with no accountability progressives cheered the legislation while acknowledging they would have preferred it had gone further to fight climate change and bolster the nation s social safety net we are at the progressive caucus heartbroken to see investments in care in housing immigration workforce and more left on the cutting room floor said congressional progressive caucus chair pramila jayapal d wash who called it particularly outrageous that republicans stripped a provision that would have capped the price of insulin at 35 a month for everyone with private insurance rep jared huffman d calif commended the bill for addressing some of his constituents most pressing issues this is by far the biggest step the u s has ever taken to combat climate change but i know that this is by no means a mission accomplished moment huffman said we must get off the fossil fuel roller coaster that has been driving inflation and killing our planet once and for all in an appearance friday morning on msnbc s morning joe senate majority leader charles e schumer suggested senate democrats in battleground states were already reaping the benefits of the inflation reduction act s passage in the upper chamber the way i look at it schumer said if we held the election today there is a damn good chance we d pick up a few seats

of the date on which it is made the company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof except as may be required by law notice regarding non gaap financial measures in addition to our reported results and net earnings per diluted share which are financial measures presented in accordance with gaap this press release contains and may refer to certain non gaap financial measures including funds from operations ffo core funds from operations core ffo adjusted funds from operations affo core adjusted funds from operations core affo and net operating income noi we believe the use of core ffo and core affo are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of reits ffo and related measures including noi should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows or as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures you should not consider our core ffo or core affo as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap our reconciliation of non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below note 1 subsequent to the issuance of the company s 2021 form 10 k and q1 2022 form 10 q management of the company identified an immaterial error in application of accounting standards codification asc 480 10 distinguishing liabilities from equity specifically the company incorrectly classified the partnership interest of gip fund 1 llc as redeemable non controlling interest rather than non controlling interest within equity the company has accordingly corrected certain numbers in the prior year presentation above our reported results are presented in accordance with gaap we also disclose funds from operations ffo adjusted funds from operations affo core funds from operations core ffo and core adjusted funds of operations core affo all of which are non gaap financial measures we believe these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of reits ffo and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements accordingly they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures we compute ffo in accordance with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit nareit defines ffo as gaap net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items as defined by gaap net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets impairment write downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and real estate related depreciation and amortization including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries we then adjust ffo for non cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs above and below market lease intangible amortization straight line rent adjustment where the company is both the lessor and lessee and non cash stock compensation to calculate core affo ffo is used by management investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions we believe that affo is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non cash revenues or expenses ffo and affo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies we believe that core ffo and core affo are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations we use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals as ffo excludes depreciation and amortization gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and extraordinary items it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs general and administrative expenses and interest costs providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss however ffo should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations additionally ffo does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non controlling

but they re being answered by our operators now joseph visconti alright thank you good afternoon everybody thank you for taking the time to participate in twin vee powercats q2 2022 financial results i will start off by providing several q2 updates on our company s progress and discuss our plans moving forward carrie gunnerson our cfo will then give a financial update on the company and we ll conclude with some q a as you know twin vee powercats designs manufactures and sells a line of catamaran sport boats from our factory here in fort pierce florida our model lineup for gas powered boats range from 24 feet in length to our newest model our 40 foot quad engine 400 gfx from q1 2022 our dealer network has increased over 24 locations and we currently employ around 160 employees the past couple of weeks have been exciting and filled with a lot of promising momentum for our company today our electric division forza x1 will be brought public by our investment bank thinkequity as of today forza x1 will become its own independently trading nasdaq listed publicly trading company under the symbol of frza twin vee will hold a 70 stake in forza x1 and twin vee will continue to file a consolidated financial statement going forward based on our 70 ownership in forza now let s discuss twin vee s gas powered boat operations we are pleased to report 158 increase in net revenue for the three months ended june 30 2022 compared to the same quarter and in 2021 and our adjusted net profit q2 2022 was 607 000 again this is for our twin vee gas powered division this quarter was our gas powered divisions first profitable quarter since twin vee s ipo in july of 2021 this achievement is due in part to our company adding additional models to our lineup expanding our dealer network and our continued efforts to streamline the manufacturing process including our push towards a lean manufacturing facility lean manufacturing was first devised by toyota and is now the gold standard in manufacturing around the world our unit throughput has increased to an average of 4 75 boats per week up from approximately 3 25 boats per week in the fourth quarter of 2021 we are knocking on the door of one voted day which is exciting for us we re paying close attention to market conditions dealer inventory levels and economic indicators that might affect our business or the buying decisions of our customers our goal is to sustain our current production momentum streamline inventory levels and remain focused on hiring highly qualified production and administrative staff to further strengthen our business we feel confident that even with some slowdowns occurring in certain segments of the market we have the ability to open new dealers and expand market share and continue our growth momentum catamarans are really gaining traction and popularity and as we spoken before twin vee is the second largest multi haul manufacturer in the country by unit count as we move forward into the second half of 2022 we anticipate our operating income will improve for our core gas powered boat division it s important to note that if twin vee move forward focusing on building its gas powered boat division forza x1 our electric boat division will incur losses as forza moves from r d to prototyping its new fx1 one models then to testing and marketing these electric boats and then to ramping up production in our new forza x1 factory in marion north carolina over the next 12 to 18 months the forza x1 ipo post ipo which could happen any minute will now fund the forza operations and the new factory and the ramping up forza s production based on the forza ipo twin vee will no longer be required to fund for his operations after today the removal of the cash infusions that twin vee was funding for forza should strengthen twin vee s cash flow and strengthen twin vee s balance sheet we are seeing some softening in the marine sport boat market we also are seeing some fields inventory levels grow but the good news is the current dealer inventory levels are still not back to pre covid traditional levels it s important to know that our sales team has reached out to every one of our twin vee dealers about their annual forecast these forecasts are the number of boats that each dealer orders over the course of the year by model and desired delivery dates and not a single twin vee dealer has changed modified or reduced their forecasted boat orders with us as a result our current dealer forecast twin vee still has over a year of forecasted sales production on our books let s move to forza x1 now moving to our electric vehicle manufacturing subsidiary forza x1 we ve spoken about this many times that forza s mission is to produce an affordable fully integrated all electric recreational boat to inspire the adoption of sustainable recreational boating by producing stylish electric sport boats we ve made some major strides at forza x1 as we work towards commencing sales to our customers of our fx1 boats in q2 of 2023 in addition to the ipo let me start with our most recent news during a press conference in north carolina about two weeks ago governor roy cooper the governor of north carolina was announced that forza x1 would obtain incentives from north carolina department of commerce and the mcdowell county local government to establish its 100 000 square foot dedicated fully electric boat manufacturing operation in mcdowell county north carolina forza x1 s ceo president jim leffew led these efforts with state and local entities jim did a phenomenal job thank you jim in terms of the electric boat themselves forza x1â s first model will be the 24 foot fx1 dual console i m happy to report that the tooling of the fx1 dual console has been finished and the hull and deck molds are expected to be completed in the coming weeks and within the next 30 days we will be assembling our first fx1 model this is great progress on forza s electric outboard motor as well the motor currently consists of over 250 parts this motor will be made in house at forzaâ s new factory we are starting to build small batch numbers of this motor and boat up to 20 units turning to the batteries that will power our boats in january we announced that forza x1 entered into a five year supply agreement with a michigan based company named american battery solutions abs for production grade 52 kilowatt high powered lithium ion liquid cooled batteries forza has recently received the first battery shipment from abs which will be used to continue testing in our prototype boats and subsequent battery shipments are expected to arrive here in the next couple of months for the use of our brand new fx1 dual console and center console boats overall forza x1 continues to make substantial progress towards its mission and there s a lot of work to do and we re looking forward to the coming weeks and months and letting you all know about those updates i hope you enjoyed my presentation let me turn it over to our cfo carrie gunnerson and then i ll give you a little bit more review and we ll go to q a thank you carrie gunnerson thank you joseph i m going to begin with the income statement our revenue for the quarter was up 158 or approximately 5 222 000 up to 8 520 000 our gross profits for the quarter were up 162 or approximately 2 131 000 to 3 447 000 as joseph stated we continue to monitor the costs of our raw materials and purchase components and adjusting our sales prices and our discounts structures accordingly our dealer demand has remained strong and we are monitoring our dealer inventory levels very closely additionally we are working diligently to increase our dealer networks our operating expenses for the quarter increased by approximately 2 486 000 to 3 919 000 our net loss for the quarter was approximately 539 000 compared to net income of 51 000 in 2021 however in 2021 we did not have either of our subsidiaries forzaâ s portion of our net loss was approximately 590 000 and net income from our business gas powered boats was approximately 73 000 further when we look at our adjusted net income for the quarter which excludes noncash charges our adjusted net income for our core business the gas powered boats was approximately our net loss is a reflection of the investment that the company has continued to make in our electric boat division as well as our efforts to increase the number of models we offer for our gas power division and its production we continue to aggressively recruit highly experienced staff and are not only increasing our productivity but also our efficiencies turning to the balance sheet we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately 9 860 000 as of june 30 2020 our inventory levels have increased by approximately 2 570 000 to 4 370 000 these inventory levels support our aggressive increases in production and the challenges that we ve faced in the current supply chain our accounts payable have also increased by approximately 1 061 000 to 2 262 000 again the increase is to support our new production levels with that i ll turn the call back over to joseph joseph visconti thank you carrie so as you can see we re growing i think it s important to note that with our increased growing we still have over 9 million cash in the bank and soon with forza going public we will no longer have that cash burn on twin vee s books and so that s going to strengthen our balance sheet so i believe in twin vee second quarter was extremely strong we debuted a bunch of new boats our 26 our 34 our brand new 40 if you go online at twinvee com you can see some amazing imagery of our brand new 40 it s very exciting and we re receiving orders from our dealers and we are starting to even work on additional new models so in addition we have increased our unit throughput to an average 4 75 boats per week as we discussed and this again helped twin vee s gas powered division record its first profitable quarter since twin vee s ipo in july 2021 we re really excited about the opportunities ahead of us before i open it up to some q a i would like to thank all of our employees for the continued teamwork dedication the passion they have of building our boats i want to thank our shareholders for their support and everyone on the call today for their interest in twin vee powercats with that i d like to turn it back to the operator for q a and we can take our first question question and answer session operator and mr visconti it appears there are no questions at this time i d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks i apologize sir we just had a couple questions join our queue we ll go first to guy newman private investor unidentified analyst can you please explain to the shareholders the correlation between twin vee powercats and forza forza is now trading in open joseph visconti twin vee is a 70 shareholder in forza x1 forza will operate as an independent company and that s it so it s it was always a wholly owned subsidiary and i didn t see the stock quote yet but as it begins trading twin vee i mean i m sorry forza has its own board of directors its own officers and will operate as an independent company operator and our next question comes from joe solano private investor unidentified analyst i m a shareholder in both companies twin vee tvpc and i m trying to find out your situation with stock conversion here and what do you guys plan on doing with that joseph visconti yes so we did a press release it s a little confusing but there will be a merger between tvpc and veee the merger will not there will be no money changing hands there ll be no stock being issued essentially we have to roll tvpc into veee the net effect will be veee will end up with an nol and those shares will then all the veee shares will be distributed on a pro rata basis back to all the tvpc shareholders there s a document that s going to be filed an s 3 registration over the next couple of weeks and i apologize about the delay but it s an extremely â thereâ s all types of tax issues there was a fairness opinion that required shareholder votes but the net effect is that all tvpc shareholders there ll be an x date and tvpc shareholders will receive veee registered shares probably over the next 60 to 90 days if you still own the stock at that point but thank you for asking the question and again there ll be documents filed which you can go online and start to read and i apologize it took so long but we re getting there operator it seems we have a follow up question from joe solano unidentified analyst so is it going to be one to one conversion or how are you guys handling joseph visconti so it s not one to one conversion i can t get into the numbers there s disclosure issues mr zolano but if you we did a press release if you go back and look at the press release you can kind of figure it out like the shares that are outstanding in veee and then the shares that are issued and outstanding in tvpc and you take those two numbers and divide it that will be the distribution and both those numbers are fully disclosed my personal shares are in tvpc so i m on the same page with you and again i apologize it took so long but we re getting there thereâ s a lot of legal and accounting and tax work to get this completed operator and it appears there are no further questions mr visconti i will turn the conference back to you joseph visconti i want to thank you everybody and for supporting us and again have a great day we ll talk to you soon thank you operator and this does conclude today s conference thank you all for your participation you may now disconnect

beijing continue to jostle over letting american inspectors audit chinese companies the fight could lead to hundreds of china based companies being booted from u s stock exchanges just in case chinese businesses are preparing to be kicked off of wall street the state owned firms are seeing that the writing is on the wall for them liqian ren director of modern alpha at investment firm wisdomtree asset management told fortune and indicates that a bigger shift might be underway for other public china based companies as well business decisions the u s and china are at loggerheads over a decades long dispute over allowing american inspectors to audit u s listed chinese firms the u s s audit watchdog wants full access to chinese companies auditors and audit papers but china has refused citing national security concerns the u s could delist over 260 chinese companies worth a combined 1 3 trillion by 2024 if washington and beijing can t reach an agreement china s securities regulator said in a friday statement that listings and delistings are common in capital markets it added that the five state firms followed u s rules while listed on american stock exchanges and that their delisting decisions were only made out of business considerations other u s listed chinese firms could follow in the footsteps of the five state owned enterprises soes the two remaining chinese soes listed on u s stock exchanges two state linked airlines will definitely be considering delisting from new york ren says china s state run firms all hold information that beijing deems sensitive or crucial to national security that it doesn t want american inspectors to access meaning that it wouldn t come as a surprise if the remaining state firms choose to delist soon brendan brendan ahern chief investment officer at kraneshares a china focused investment fund told fortune story continues yet this hedge isn t limited to state firms other chinese firms want to retain their u s listings but they ll ultimately review the situation and make a strategic choice ren says for most big firms they ll feel that a u s listing is risky and opens them to being caught in the crossfire between chinese and american regulators especially in the face of deteriorating sino u s ties she says and non state linked companies have been moving to reduce those risks on july 29 the u s securities and exchange commission sec added chinese tech behemoth alibaba which raised 25 billion in 2014 in the u s s biggest ever ipo to its delisting watchlist alibaba announced that it is changing its hong kong listing from a secondary to primary status which allows it an exit route in case of delisting and one that lets it tap mainland china investors stifled progress in recent months the sec has continued to add chinese companies to its now long list of firms that face expulsion from american stock exchanges sec chair gary gensler has reiterated that the u s will accept nothing less than full compliance from china advertisement advertisement beijing reportedly wants to strike a deal with washington that would separate u s listed chinese firms based on the type of data they hold china is seeking a compromise to let most non state owned firms open their books to american inspectors but restrict reviews of state firms and tech companies that hold sensitive information adam montanaro investment director of global emerging markets equities at investment firm abrdn told fortune earlier this year while china does have incentives to improve their relations with the u s have been seriously damaged in the last few years the trust is very low especially with the recent taiwan flareup ren says at the same time u s regulators have been very clear that they want full access and compliance there s not going to be a two tier system of access that beijing desires she says ahern however argues that the five state firms delistings are a positive sign that washington and beijing might be closer to reaching a delisting consensus once chinese soes are all delisted from wall street the remaining non state companies have long stated that they have nothing to hide from u s inspectors ahern says still the sec s delisting watchlist has only grown larger and the challenges for u s listed chinese firms more difficult the sec has now flagged 159 firms including alibaba s e commerce rival jd

the u s house of representatives friday sent president joe biden a long debated climate tax and healthcare bill the legislation passed with a vote of 220 to 207 along party lines biden s signature will mark the final chapter for an 18 month long saga marked by intense negotiations among democrats who used a parliamentary procedure called reconciliation to pass the bill but still needed complete party support in both chambers republicans warned the measure would inflame inflation and the deficit biden is expected to sign the bill which would mark a victory and the fourth major piece of legislation for the president and democrats heading into pivotal midterm elections i believe that every american has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have access to affordable quality health care the inflation reduction act is a historic investment in that belief biden said friday in a statement the inflation reduction act is about loosening the stranglehold that special interests have had on congress said house speaker nancy pelosi bloomberg news house speaker nancy pelosi said the legislation like the american rescue plan and the bipartisan infrastructure act is about loosening the stranglehold that special interests have had on congress and giving much more leverage to the people originally called the build back better bill and carrying a price tag of 3 5 trillion the final version is dubbed the inflation reduction act and provides roughly 430 million of new money for programs and 300 million that will go to pay down the deficit it s expected to raise 737 billion over the next 10 years supporters say the bill will cut greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 40 by 2030 lower drug prices and reduce the federal deficit it includes 64 billion to extend affordable care act subsidies a move that is considered credit positive for hospital s the senate passed the bill on august 7 the legislation s biggest revenue generator is a 15 minimum tax on the so called book income of corporations earning 1 billion or more in annual profits the impact of the new tax on the municipal bond market remains unclear with some market participants warning it will hurt demand for tax exempt securities and other minimizing the fallout issuers groups like the national league of cities have praised the legislation for investments into climate related challenges that affect states and cities the legislation provides and extends tax credits for clean energy projects like wind and solar nuclear energy energy storage and carbon capture technology a 27 billion investment would go to creation of a green bank for clean energy technology

paul laurence dunbar was perhaps the pre eminent black poet of the era after reconstruction in a new biography the princeton university english professor gene andrew jarrett takes dunbar s rather glum shortish life and pulls off a book that pulls you along like an open bag of potato chips for the first 100 or so pages i could barely put it down but there s one thing that jars like a wrong note every time it comes up dunbar regularly and casually referred to black people of a lower social class than his with the n word an example i dressed at the hall dressing room in all clean linen but had to send a out for a standing collar because mine were all lay downs sadly this wasn t atypical for more fortunate black people of the era dunbar s erudite and accomplished wife alice dunbar nelson also used the word freely in their letters the mother of the late 19th and early 20th century black composer and conductor will marion cook used the word in dismay at her classically trained son s pursuing popular music with sometimes salty lyrics that kind of open classism particularly when directed by middle and upper class black people of the victorian era toward working class black people can be startling for contemporary readers today for a well heeled black person to denigrate a less well off black person in this way would be deemed malicious at worst or elitist respectability politics at best knowing this about dunbar might sour someone s opinion of him as an individual but his use of the n word and the sentiment behind it are unlikely to reduce his stature as a literary figure and almost no one would consider this as grounds for a retroactive reckoning reconsideration or yes cancellation of the kind to which the legacies of various historical figures are now subject if for no other reason then probably because his is a case of intra black offense being given

financial measures presented in accordance with gaap this press release contains and may refer to certain non gaap financial measures including funds from operations ffo core funds from operations core ffo adjusted funds from operations affo core adjusted funds from operations core affo and net operating income noi we believe the use of core ffo and core affo are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of reits ffo and related measures including noi should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows or as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures you should not consider our core ffo or core affo as an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap our reconciliation of non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure and statements of why management believes these measures are useful to investors are included below note 1 subsequent to the issuance of the companys 2021 form 10 k and q1 2022 form 10 q management of the company identified an immaterial error in application of accounting standards codification asc 480 10 distinguishing liabilities from equity specifically the company incorrectly classified the partnership interest of gip fund 1 llc as redeemable non controlling interest rather than non controlling interest within equity the company has accordingly corrected certain numbers in the prior year presentation above our reported results are presented in accordance with gaap we also disclose funds from operations ffo adjusted funds from operations affo core funds from operations core ffo and core adjusted funds of operations core affo all of which are non gaap financial measures we believe these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of reits ffo and related measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements accordingly they should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures we compute ffo in accordance with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit nareit defines ffo as gaap net income or loss adjusted to exclude extraordinary items as defined by gaap net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets impairment write downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and real estate related depreciation and amortization including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries we then adjust ffo for non cash revenues and expenses such as amortization of deferred financing costs above and below market lease intangible amortization straight line rent adjustment where the company is both the lessor and lessee and non cash stock compensation to calculate core affo ffo is used by management investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions we believe that affo is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non cash revenues or expenses ffo and affo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies we believe that core ffo and core affo are useful measures for management and investors because they further remove the effect of non cash expenses and certain other expenses that are not directly related to real estate operations we use each as measures of our performance when we formulate corporate goals as ffo excludes depreciation and amortization gains and losses from property dispositions that are available for distribution to stockholders and extraordinary items it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs general and administrative expenses and interest costs providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss however ffo should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties which could be significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations additionally ffo does not reflect distributions paid to redeemable non controlling interests contact details investor relations 1 813 448 1234 ir gipreit com company website news source news direct news source news direct 13 08 2022

a divided congress gave final approval friday to democrats flagship climate and health care bill handing president joe biden a back from the dead triumph on coveted priorities that the party hopes will bolster their prospects for keeping their house and senate majorities in november s elections the house used a party line 220 207 vote to pass the legislation prompting hugs among democrats on the house floor and cheers by white house staff watching on television today the american people won special interests lost tweeted the vacationing biden who was shown beaming in a white house photo as he watched the vote on tv from kiawah island south carolina he said he would sign the legislation next week the measure is but a shadow of the larger more ambitious plan to supercharge environment and social programs that biden and his party unveiled early last year even so democrats happily declared victory on top tier goals like providing congress largest ever investment in curbing carbon emissions reining in pharmaceutical costs and taxing large companies hoping to show they can wring accomplishments from a routinely gridlocked washington that often disillusions voters today is a day of celebration a day we take another giant step in our momentous agenda said house speaker nancy pelosi d calif who minutes later announced the final vote as she presided over the chamber she said the measure meets the moment ensuring that our families thrive and that our planet survives get new england news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for necn newsletters republicans solidly opposed the legislation calling it a cornucopia of wasteful liberal daydreams that would raise taxes and families living costs they did the same sunday but senate democrats banded together and used vice president kamala harris tiebreaking vote t o power the measure through that 50 50 chamber democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford said house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif i can almost see glee in their eyes biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion proposal also envisioned free prekindergarten paid family and medical leave expanded medicare benefits and eased immigration restrictions that crashed after centrist sen joe manchin d w va said it was too costly using the leverage every democrat has in the evenly divided senate still the final legislation remained substantive its pillar is about 375 billion over 10 years to encourage industry and consumers to shift from carbon emitting to cleaner forms of energy that includes 4 billion to cope with the west s catastrophic drought spending tax credits and loans would bolster technology like solar panels consumer efforts to improve home energy efficiency emission reducing equipment for coal and gas powered power plants and air pollution controls for farms ports and low income communities another 64 billion would help 13 million people pay premiums over the next three years for privately bought health insurance medicare would gain the power to negotiate its costs for pharmaceuticals initially in 2026 for only 10 drugs medicare beneficiaries out of pocket prescription costs would be limited to 2 000 starting in 2025 and beginning next year would pay no more than 35 monthly for insulin the costly diabetes drug the bill would raise around 740 billion in revenue over the decade over a third from government savings from lower drug prices more would flow from higher taxes on some 1 billion corporations levies on companies that repurchase their own stock and stronger irs tax collections about 300 billion would remain to defray budget deficits a sliver of the period s projected 16 trillion total against the backdrop of gop attacks on the fbi for its court empowered search of former president donald trump s florida estate for sensitive documents republicans repeatedly savaged the bill s boost to the irs budget that s aimed at collecting an estimated 120 billion in unpaid taxes over the coming decade and republicans have misleadingly claimed that the irs will hire 87 000 agents to target average families rep andrew clyde r ga said democrats would also weaponize the irs with agents many of whom will be trained in the use of deadly force to go after any american citizen sen chuck grassley r iowa asked thursday on fox and friends if there would be an irs strike force that goes in with ak 15s already loaded ready to shoot some small business person few irs personnel are armed and democrats say the bill s 80 billion 10 year budget increase would be to replace waves of retirees not just agents and modernize equipment they have said typical families and small businesses would not be targeted with treasury secretary janet yellen directing the irs this week to not increase the share of small business or households below the 400 000 threshold that would be audited republicans say the legislation s new business taxes will increase prices worsening the nation s bout with its worst inflation since 1981 though democrats have labeled the measure the inflation reduction act nonpartisan analysts say it will have a barely perceptible impact on prices the gop also says the bill would raise taxes on lower and middle income families an analysis by congress nonpartisan joint committee on taxation which didn t include the bill s tax breaks for health care and energy estimated that the corporate tax boosts would marginally affect those taxpayers but indirectly partly due to lower stock prices and wages house democrats ensured voters will fire them this fall said spokeswoman torunn sinclair of the house gop campaign committee in an email she listed dozens of democrats in competitive reelections who will face republican attacks for raising taxes and empowering the irs to target their constituents democratic leaning interest groups had their own warnings we ll ensure that every republican who voted against this bill is held accountable for prioritizing polluters and corporate special interests over the health and well being of their constituents said tiernan sittenfeld a top official of the league of conservation voters the bill caps three months in which congress has approved legislation on veterans benefits the semiconductor industry gun checks for young buyers and ukraine s invasion by russia and adding sweden and finland to nato all passed with bipartisan support suggesting republicans also want to display their productive side it s unclear whether voters will reward democrats for the legislation after months of painfully high inflation dominating voters attention biden s dangerously low popularity ratings and a steady history of midterm elections that batter the party holding the white house biden called his 3 5 trillion plan build back better besides social and environment initiatives it proposed rolling back trump era tax breaks for the rich and corporations and 555 billion for climate efforts well above the money in friday s legislation with manchin opposing those amounts it was sliced to a roughly 2 trillion measure that democrats moved through the house in november he unexpectedly sank that bill too earning scorn from exasperated fellow democrats from capitol hill and the white house last gasp talks between manchin and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y seemed fruitless until the two unexpectedly announced agreement last month on the new package manchin won concessions for the fossil fuel industries he champions including procedures for more oil drilling on federal lands so did centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who ended up eliminating planned higher taxes on hedge fund managers and helping win the drought funds ___ associated press reporter seung min kim in kiawah island and congressional correspondent lisa mascaro contributed to this report
