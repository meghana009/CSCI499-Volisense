nairobi kenya ethiopia s government rejected accusations friday that it s trying to suffocate the people of tigray by denying them urgently needed food and other aid as transport and communications links remained severed to the region that faces one of the world s worst famines in a decade foreign minister demeke mekonnen spoke to reporters a day after a bridge that s crucial for accessing much of the region of 6 million people was destroyed and the united nations indicated that special forces from the neighboring amhara region were to blame amhara authorities have occupied western tigray and forced out hundreds of thousands of ethnic tigrayans the insinuation that we are trying to suffocate the tigrayan people by denying humanitarian access and using hunger as a weapon of war is beyond the pale there is absolutely no reason for us to do so these are our people demeke said ethiopia s government blamed tigray forces for the bridge s destruction but an aid worker who traveled to the site said area residents described to him how they saw amhara special forces placing objects on the bridge and driving away after the blast they still seemed in shock at what had happened roger sandberg vice president of field operations with medical teams international told the associated press sandberg said area residents also told him that there was no other way to cross while tigray forces conveyed to him that they wouldn t obstruct ngo access to the region the u n security council was meeting to discuss tigray on friday unilateral cease fire in a stunning turn earlier this week ethiopia declared a unilateral cease fire on humanitarian grounds while retreating from tigray forces but the government faces growing international pressure as it continues to cut off the region from the rest of the world aid workers say fuel and other supplies are running low in a strikingly outspoken statement the world food program said friday that a second key bridge leading into tigray was destroyed on thursday while no wfp flights bringing in u n or other aid workers have been allowed by ethiopia since june 22 even before the bridges were destroyed at least 3 800 metric tons of food had been blocked from reaching parts of western tigray wfp emergency coordinator tommy thompson told reporters in geneva he warned that more people will die if access doesn t materialize but added that an air bridge might be set up in coming days the u n agency said trucks were loaded and ready to replenish its nearly exhausted food stocks inside tigray where 5 2 million people need emergency food aid we ll be out of food in the northwest by this weekend thompson said up to 900 000 people in tigray are facing famine the united states has said a new u n humanitarian update issued late thursday said that the blackout of electricity telecommunications and internet throughout tigray region will only exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation ethiopia s foreign minister said the government has a road map for dialogue to resolve the tigray crisis that s expected to include rank and file members of the who show readiness to choose a peaceful path but tigray forces recently designated by ethiopia as a terrorist group now control most of the region and have demanded that ethiopia resume basic services before any talks a cease fire doesn t mean cutting a region off power or destroying critical infrastructure european union foreign policy chief josep borrell tweeted friday a credible cease fire means doing everything possible so that aid reaches the millions of children women and men who urgently need it the security situation in tigray was generally calm after the retreat of ethiopian forces and those of neighboring eritrea who have been accused by witnesses of some of the worst atrocities in the war officials with eritrea an enemy of tigray leaders after a 1998 2000 war along their border have not responded to requests for comment amhara authorities have warned tigray forces against trying to retake the region s western areas but the tigray forces spokesman told the ap this week they would liberate the region from enemies and thousands of fighters were seen heading west ethiopia s government has said the cease fire will last only until the crucial farming season in tigray is over meaning september but the wfp said farmers have already missed the peak planting month of june because of seed and fertilizer shortages

from the coronavirus delta variant rather the data which was published june 18 shows the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the variant an instagram post falsely claimed the health agency s data showed vaccinated people were twice as likely to die from the delta variant than unvaccinated people another falsely claimed vaccinated people were six times more likely to die from a circulating variant like delta than are unvaccinated people one post used a table from the report to share the false claim but the post misrepresented the table s data while the table does address delta variant deaths it shows that among 60 624 confirmed cases of the variant between feb 1 and june 14 recorded deaths included 37 vaccinated people and 34 unvaccinated furthermore the table does not state the age group of those who died and whether they suffered from any additional illnesses experts say that means conclusions cannot be drawn about the role of vaccines in those deaths unless you account for these differences in age and population you really can t make the argument that vaccination confers a higher risk of death said dr nasia safdar an infectious disease physician at the university of wisconsin s school of medicine and public health the report notes that follow up is needed when examining the data on delta variant deaths because it is too early to provide a formal assessment of the case fatality of delta stratified by age compared to other variants the public health agency issued another report on june 25 that showed that no deaths had been recorded of patients under 50 who were infected with the delta variant and had received both doses of vaccine the data from the agency shows that two doses of the vaccines made by pfizer or astrazeneca are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant associated press writer beatrice dupuy in new york contributed this report viruses can evolve to be more

what s best for the pathogen said day but the problem is that it s not always possible and in many instances is never possible to be more transmissible and also less lethal day said there are documented cases of animal viruses that evolved over time to become more lethal including myxoma virus in rabbits and marek s disease in chicken some viruses provoke severe symptoms in their hosts

the making that followed an intensive investigation by the manhattan district attorney s office which subpoena the presidents former presidents tax records um and had investigated many aspects of his business before bringing this case trump himself was not charged in the indictment unsealed today but the manhattan district attorney s office has stressed for weeks that the investigations are still ongoing even as these charges have been made public it s a significant case on many fronts because a former president is being placed in the perilous position of having to defend criminal charges against his own company there s also been rampant speculation that the chief financial officer alan white hesselberg could face pressure to flip and provide information to prosecutors that could be detrimental to the president that s something that s been watched very closely and will continue to be watched mhm weisberg who is known as an intensely private man and lived in a modest home in long island claimed to continue to claim residency there despite living in a company paid manhattan apartment according to the prosecution and by doing so he concealed that he was in new york city resident and avoided paying more than 900 000 in federal state and city income taxes and collected about 133 in refunds to which he wasn t entitled prosecutors set y spielberg himself could face jail time if convicted of these serious charges but the trump organization itself would likely be forced to pay fines or fees and perhaps even change the way that it operates if convicted work more advertisement explainer how could the indictment hurt trump s company share copy link copy the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get

challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and others using its name although some companies have collapsed after criminal indictments others have survived or even thrived others that received what s called deferred criminal charges have done well afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in all three companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use

in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort would prove while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year that condo prices in many buildings that have licensed the use of his name have fallen sharply with brokers saying some potential buyers refuse to even look at apartments in buildings with trump s

in his june 27 op ed a prescription for mediocrity george f will posited a false dichotomy between meritocracy and mediocrity he criticized michael sandel s radical notion of equity but then went too far in the opposite direction mr will dismissed the concept of systemic racism as more frequently bandied than defined but surely he would acknowledge that slavery the jim crow era real estate practices that segregated neighborhoods and numerous other forms of racial discrimination were clearly systematic and that their legacies continue to deny equal opportunity for black people mr will disparaged government interventions in the economy as a source of mediocrity but progressive income tax rates entitlement programs and widespread regulation have hardly prevented an era of robust technological innovation and increasing polarization of wealth among the top 1 percent mr will said we need to avoid government meddling to ensure the country s ability to compete against foreign rivals but china has become our major rival partly because of government direction of its economy advertisement reasonable policy measures can promote greater social justice without destroying a broadly merit based society there is room for both objectives lawrence bruser chevy chase george f will began his argument on the value of a meritocracy vs an equitable society based on a false premise that the opposite of an equitable society is a meritocracy but the opposite of a meritocracy is a society of inequity many in our society are denied opportunity and fairness and equity because of racism or poor schools or prejudice at work or in housing progressives believe government assistance is necessary to help create a society that is in fact equitable by contrast many of society s privileged enjoy the blessings of american society because they are born white or come from wealthy families or from affluent neighborhoods or are educated in mostly white good schools moneyed success in the united states increasingly comes from stock incomes and tax benefits not from hard work or diligence industriousness self reliance or deferral of gratification as mr will averred advertisement many of the wealthy in the united states meritocratic class do not come to their wealth by merit indeed the myth that the united states is a meritocratic society denigrates those in our society who work hard often at unfairly low wages who yearn for a fair and equitable society not a constricting status quo where the privileged such as mr will claim the fruits of society share this article share ironically a society that provides the means for its citizens to live in an equitable and fair society creates the talent that mr will said faces a future of commercial and military competitions of increasing sophistication not a society of mediocrity richard l mccloud fredericksburg george f will argued that the market is a better allocator of preferences than the government that may have been true when adam smith wrote his seminal 1776 book the wealth of nations but today s economic marketplace has undergone substantial changes advertisement as john mauldin president of mauldin economics wrote in forbes two years ago without realizing it we ve become a nation of monopolies a large and growing part of our economy is owned by a handful of companies that face little competition it is no coincidence that organized powerful economic interests are far more successful in hiring expensive lobbyists to obtain the kinds of laws and regulations that deliver wealth and opportunity for themselves at the expense of the vast majority of our citizens of course if everyone african americans hispanics et al started out in the same place on roughly equal footing there would be no argument unfortunately mr will neglected the scourge of slavery and racism because white americans have had and continue to have greater access to educational economic and political resources than their black counterparts relying solely on the market reinforces the existing economic system advertisement ed rothschild mclean george f will decried affirmative action and other remedies for past bigoted practices one could agree with mr will if black people hadn t suffered through 250 years of slavery plus another 150 years during which blacks have been discriminated against in hiring and promotions arrested and detained in disproportionate numbers prevented from voting prevented from receiving mortgages or redlined forced to live in poor parts of town had separate and unequal schools because of school funding coming from property taxes and so on and so on and so on it seems some are so afraid of competition that we need to create and continue systems that pretend it s about meritocrity only whites need apply

stock photo getty images we have things flying around military bases and places where we re conducting military exercises and we don t know what it is and it isn t ours so that s a legitimate question to ask and i d say frankly if it s something outside this planet it would actually be better than the fact that we ve seen some technology leap on behalf of the russians the chinese or some other adversary the bottom line is if there are things flying over military bases and you don t know what they are they re not yours and they exhibit potential technologies you don t have at your disposal that to me is a national security risk and one we should be looking into dozens of men and women we have entrusted with the defense of our country are telling us about encounters with unidentified aircraft with capabilities we do not fully understand we cannot allow the stigma of ufos to keep us from seriously investigating these encounters i think it s a bit presumptuous and arrogant for us to believe that there s no other form of life anywhere in the entire universe i think some of the phenomena we re going to be seeing continues to be unexplained and might in fact be some type of phenomenon that is the result of something that we don t yet understand and that could involve some type of activity that some might say constitutes a different form of life things that we are observing that are difficult to explain there s actually quite a few of those sometimes we wonder whether or not our adversaries have technologies that are a little bit further down the road than we thought or than we realized but there are instances where we don t have good explanations for some of the things that we have seen when we talk about sightings it s not just a pilot or just a satellite or some intelligence collection usually we have multiple sensors that are picking up these things i don t know why we haven t been more transparent about it in the past and i m part of that crime i guess and my former capacities i didn t i didn t insist on more transparency with respect to this issue but what is true and i m actually being serious here is that there s footage and records of objects in the sky that we don t know exactly what they are we can t explain how they moved their trajectory they did not have an easily explainable pattern about the author gary heseltine is the vice president of the international coalition for extraterrestrial research icer he is a former british police detective who retired after 24 years to create ufo truth magazine a bi monthly online ezine the policy of denial and debunking evidence of encounters with alien spacecraft that s been in place since the 1950s is crumbling even ex us presidents and cia directors admit there s something out there we can t explain it s often said that when mankind acknowledges that life in the universe has been confirmed and an intelligent civilization reaches out to us so almost everyone is in agreement as to the ramifications of such contact today on world ufo day as we approach the summer of 2021 the world is potentially on the brink of learning something that most people will be astonished and perhaps shocked by for more than 70 years highly trained credible people have found themselves involved in multiple witness reports and having an interaction with some kind of intelligence that is literally out of this world why the explanation is simple and stark governments across the planet supported by the mainstream media have poured scorn on and trivialised the subject of unidentified flying objects or flying saucers since the early 1950s as the late stanton friedman a nuclear physicist and huge ufo proponent used to say it can t be so it isn t that phrase is particularly apt if we ask the question as to why the scientific and academic worlds have largely ignored the mass of corroborated testimony from military pilots commercial pilots astronauts cosmonauts radar operators air traffic controllers sonar operators military personnel and police officers etc in recent years a new acronym has been created to replace the term ufo unidentified aerial phenomena uap in the hope that science academia and the media would be more open to investigating the subject however such is the manufactured stigma attached to this topic that it is still deemed too taboo for most given the way the subject has been trivialized and dismissed for so many years it isn t surprising that most scientists and academics do not take the ufo uap phenomena seriously after all for most of their lives they have been told that there is no evidence to support the premise that some of these reports are credible and cannot be explained and may be of extraterrestrial non human origin however almost all of them do not realise that they and hundreds of millions of ordinary citizens in january 1953 a group of scientists met for two days to figure out a way to strip the aura of flying saucers that the public had for the subject they decided the best way to do this was toflying saucers were to be dismissed trivialised and scorned by the deliberate use of the media in all its forms i e television film newspapers books and magazines which took its name from that of its chairman harold percival robertson it was a policy that effectively created the terrible stigma and ridicule that has plagued this topic for decades and yet most people are totally unaware of how it began most astronomers won t even consider looking at the mountains of ufo uap evidence while those that do express a willingness to get involved in genuine research have been prevented from doing so because of the perceived risk of ridicule and the effect on their careers this fear has persisted for decades and has been a powerful deterrent for those that dared to take the phenomena seriously yet there have been significant developments on this subject in recent weeks and months that seem to be signalling the end to this long standing policy of deceit and denial last week a report to congress regarding us navy encounters with uaps off the east and west coasts of america that have taken place in recent years it citedgiven the huge technological resources the us has it is a staggering statistic how could military personnel using the most sophisticated equipment in the world fail to identify the mysterious objects that they witnessed we ve also seen people at the highest levels of government and the military change their tune and speak out about the phenomenon in complete contrast to what leaders have said on the matter before recently spoke at george mason university and stated recently said on fox news that there were another told cnn earlier this year in an unexpected development evenhas talked in specifics for the very first time publicly about uaps on the james corden chat show that aired in may he said from such high level individuals indicates that at last the very real possibility that we have been witnessing ufos in action around our earth for decades will be taken seriously by the world s top scientists andthis is likely to have profound implications for humanity it is not as if there isn t a lot to investigate the amount of unexplained contacts with potential visitors to our planet is large and growing in the second part of my article to be published tomorrow i will detail some of the most astonishing unexplained encounters

double the footprint of its flagship research and office facility signing a lease on an additional 100 000 square feet of space at the gateway utah biotech startup recursion pharmaceuticals is upending the realm of clinical stage drug research melding robot driven automation with digital artificial intelligence on a mission to revolutionize how new medications are developed to battle some of the rarest and most challenging of human medical conditions and the company has been on an absolute tear in the last year raising over 500 million via a public stock offering in april expanding its footprint with a new research facility in toronto and growing its staff by over 60 it also has four medications currently in clinical trials recursion was founded in 2013 and outgrew two facilities at university of utah s research park before taking over a 100 000 plus square foot space in downtown s gateway center the former home of dick s sporting goods this week the company announced it will double the footprint of its flagship research and office facility signing a lease on an additional 100 000 square feet of space at the gateway recursion president and chief operating officer tina larson said the new real estate will help accommodate the company s plans to continue growing its capacity and current staff of 270 recursion is a pioneer in the emerging field of technology enabled drug discovery larson said in a statement to deliver on our mission we have grown our world class team of scientists engineers clinicians and company builders by more than 60 in the last year expanding our laboratory footprint will allow us to grow our proprietary biological dataset even faster and add several novel capabilities in biology and chemistry research a cellular experiment image from recursion pharmaceuticals the company just announced plans to double its 100 000 square foot headquarters in downtown salt lake city recursion pharmaceuticals the company said it currently has over 100 unfilled positions and is likely to add at least that many new employees in the coming year in addition to salt lake city recursion has operations in milpitas california and plans in place for additional facilities in toronto and montreal recursion s innovative approach began as the core of doctoral research performed by company co founder and ceo chris gibson at the university of utah the method relies on automating the once human intensive process of peering through a microscope to assess if a chemical compound s impact on a diseased cell is having a positive effect or advancing it toward being a healthy cell in a 2018 deseret news profile of the company larson explained that recursion has developed a technique to take a sample cell representing a genetic disorder and test it against the effects of hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds in a process that automates the visual evaluations and data gathering to allow for a lot of testing in a very short period of time we look at a disease we re interested in against every chemical we can access larson said we have so much robotics we can run hundreds of thousands of experiments very quickly in a way that you can t do with traditional biology the advanced automation identifies hits or impacts from particular chemical compounds on diseased cells that show promising results once identified the recursion team can hone in and pursue furthering the results through modifications to the compound lux capital based in new york city and menlo park california was an early recursion investor participating in a 60 million round of funding for the company in 2017 zavain dar a principal with lux said a former stanford graduate school classmate of his put the company on lux s radar in 2016 and when he looked into it he was wildly impressed with recursion s approach their process is exceptionally intelligent dar said in 2018 it removes human hubris and bias from the equation a factor that s plagued preclinical drug discovery research for decades now dar noted the company s innovation is entirely new and taking advantage of automation wet lab and machine learning advances that have put recursion years ahead of its competition and gone well above and beyond what anyone thought was possible dar also believes the approach recursion is developing could lead to compressing the time it takes to identify and bring a new drug to market from a decade plus into the range of three to five years and lux capital has not been alone in its bullish stance on recursion s potential before entering the public markets this spring recursion had attracted over 460 million in venture investments according to tech data aggregator crunchbase at the end of regular trading on friday recursion stock rxrx was trading at 36 50

nairobi kenya ethiopia s government rejected accusations friday that it s trying to suffocate the people of tigray by denying them urgently needed food and other aid as transport and communications links remained severed to the region that faces one of the world s worst famines in a decade foreign minister demeke mekonnen spoke to reporters a day after a bridge that s crucial for accessing much of the region of 6 million people was destroyed and the united nations indicated that special forces from the neighboring amhara region were to blame amhara authorities have occupied western tigray and forced out hundreds of thousands of ethnic tigrayans the insinuation that we are trying to suffocate the tigrayan people by denying humanitarian access and using hunger as a weapon of war is beyond the pale there is absolutely no reason for us to do so these are our people demeke said ethiopia s government blamed tigray forces for the bridge s destruction but an aid worker who traveled to the site said area residents described to him how they saw amhara special forces placing objects on the bridge and driving away after the blast they still seemed in shock at what had happened roger sandberg vice president of field operations with medical teams international told the associated press sandberg said area residents also told him that there was no other way to cross while tigray forces conveyed to him that they wouldn t obstruct ngo access to the region the u n security council was meeting to discuss tigray on friday unilateral cease fire in a stunning turn earlier this week ethiopia declared a unilateral cease fire on humanitarian grounds while retreating from tigray forces but the government faces growing international pressure as it continues to cut off the region from the rest of the world aid workers say fuel and other supplies are running low in a strikingly outspoken statement the world food program said friday that a second key bridge leading into tigray was destroyed on thursday while no wfp flights bringing in u n or other aid workers have been allowed by ethiopia since june 22 even before the bridges were destroyed at least 3 800 metric tons of food had been blocked from reaching parts of western tigray wfp emergency coordinator tommy thompson told reporters in geneva he warned that more people will die if access doesn t materialize but added that an air bridge might be set up in coming days the u n agency said trucks were loaded and ready to replenish its nearly exhausted food stocks inside tigray where 5 2 million people need emergency food aid we ll be out of food in the northwest by this weekend thompson said up to 900 000 people in tigray are facing famine the united states has said a new u n humanitarian update issued late thursday said that the blackout of electricity telecommunications and internet throughout tigray region will only exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation ethiopia s foreign minister said the government has a road map for dialogue to resolve the tigray crisis that s expected to include rank and file members of the who show readiness to choose a peaceful path but tigray forces recently designated by ethiopia as a terrorist group now control most of the region and have demanded that ethiopia resume basic services before any talks a cease fire doesn t mean cutting a region off power or destroying critical infrastructure european union foreign policy chief josep borrell tweeted friday a credible cease fire means doing everything possible so that aid reaches the millions of children women and men who urgently need it the security situation in tigray was generally calm after the retreat of ethiopian forces and those of neighboring eritrea who have been accused by witnesses of some of the worst atrocities in the war officials with eritrea an enemy of tigray leaders after a 1998 2000 war along their border have not responded to requests for comment amhara authorities have warned tigray forces against trying to retake the region s western areas but the tigray forces spokesman told the ap this week they would liberate the region from enemies and thousands of fighters were seen heading west ethiopia s government has said the cease fire will last only until the crucial farming season in tigray is over meaning september but the wfp said farmers have already missed the peak planting month of june because of seed and fertilizer shortages
the trump organization and its chief financial officer alan weisberg pleaded not guilty today to tax fraud charges and grand larceny in manhattan state court these charges were more than two years in the making that followed an intensive investigation by the manhattan district attorney s office which subpoena the presidents former presidents tax records um and had investigated many aspects of his business before bringing this case trump himself was not charged in the indictment unsealed today but the manhattan district attorney s office has stressed for weeks that the investigations are still ongoing even as these charges have been made public it s a significant case on many fronts because a former president is being placed in the perilous position of having to defend criminal charges against his own company there s also been rampant speculation that the chief financial officer alan white hesselberg could face pressure to flip and provide information to prosecutors that could be detrimental to the president that s something that s been watched very closely and will continue to be watched mhm weisberg who is known as an intensely private man and lived in a modest home in long island claimed to continue to claim residency there despite living in a company paid manhattan apartment according to the prosecution and by doing so he concealed that he was in new york city resident and avoided paying more than 900 000 in federal state and city income taxes and collected about 133 in refunds to which he wasn t entitled prosecutors set y spielberg himself could face jail time if convicted of these serious charges but the trump organization itself would likely be forced to pay fines or fees and perhaps even change the way that it operates if convicted work more advertisement

challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and others using its name although some companies have collapsed after criminal indictments others have survived or even thrived others that received what s called deferred criminal charges have done well afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in all three companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use trump s fame to strike licensing deals around the world in the years surrounding his runaway tv success the apprentice trump struck deals to put his names on suits ties steaks and residential towers in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort would prove while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year that condo prices in many buildings that have licensed the use of his name have fallen sharply with brokers saying some potential buyers refuse to even look at apartments in buildings with trump s name over the door

the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit today reversed a 2019 rule by the environmental protection agency that e15 gasoline a 15 ethanol blend could be sold year round with few restrictions oil refiners challenged the rule in the case american fuel petrochemical manufacturers et al vs epa epa had long held that e10 a 10 ethanol blend was safe from concerns about high levels of vaporization that could affect the functioning of gasoline powered vehicles but for many years e15 could not be sold in the summertime on the grounds that the vaporization level was too high in 2019 epa issued its final rule extending the reid vapor pressure volatility waiver to e15 and found that e15 is substantially similar to e10 the court said that congress did not intend the law epa used to make the ruling apply to e15 the ruling followed a supreme court ruling last month that made it easier for refiners to apply for exemptions from the renewable fuel standard that governs the use of ethanol in the nation s fuel supply growth energy the renewable fuels association and the national corn growers association said today they disagreed with the decision and added we are working to ensure the continuity of e15 sales through the 2021 summer season and beyond this decision could impact summertime sales across all non rfg areas where nearly two thirds of retail sites offering e15 currently do business if e15 in those markets were to end summertime e15 sales would fall by 90 we are pursuing all available options and will work with the administration and our congressional champions to ensure that we have a solution in place before the 2022 driving season rfa president and ceo geoff cooper added today s decision from the d c circuit court is a heavy blow to the ethanol industry retailers across the country and consumers looking for cleaner greener fuel options if as a result of this decision epa were to return to the summertime ban on e15 it would reverse the tremendous progress we ve made on reducing ghg emissions from transportation growing markets for america s farmers and lowering fuel costs for consumers in the wake of today s decision rfa and its partners are exploring all of our options to protect and expand the market for lower cost lower carbon e15 it is sadly ironic that the refiners crying about high rin credit prices and tight rin stocks are the same refiners that are trying to halt e15 expansion and artificially constrain the supply of rins this is just another case of refiners cutting off their nose to spite their face but in the end we are confident that global outcry and demand for low carbon fuels will win out over the refiners deep pockets and their incessant campaign to protect dirty petroleum s market share iowa renewable fuels association executive director monte shaw said in a separate news release we are very disappointed by today s decision to strike down epa s rule that makes it easier to sell e15 year round in all markets it is still our view that the law allowing an rvp waiver for blends containing 10 ethanol can and should be applied to e15 which does contain 10 ethanol and a little more there is no scientific or environmentally sound reason to erect arbitrary barriers to the sale of e15 in the summer months which has lower combined evaporative and tailpipe emission than either e0 or e10 today s decision really turned this section of the clean air act on its head every legal regulatory and legislative option will be pursued to reverse this decision we are confident that as this issue continues to work its way through the legal and regulatory process e15 sales during this summer s driving season will not be impacted the key will be to find a solution by june of 2022 to ensure the rug is not pulled out from under fuel retailers across the country who have added e15 to their stations banking on the certainty epa provided to offer the fuel all year ethanol producers will not abandon these retailers as we continue to find a path for e15 to be sold all year long it is painfully ironic that last week we lost an important rfs lawsuit when the supreme court found that agencies could broadly construe the word extension while today the d c circuit court rules against us because an agency did not employ the most narrow and limiting definition of the word contains perhaps last week s supreme court loss sowed the seeds of this decisions future reversal growth energy rfa and ncga participated in oral arguments for the case on april 13 2021
the company planning to build the byhalia connection pipeline on friday announced that it is abandoning the project bringing a sudden end to one of the biggest environmental controversies in recent memphis history the project which would have put a crude oil pipeline through mostly black south memphis neighborhoods sparked a complex legal and public relations battle that was fought in multiple venues from the memphis city council to the court of national public opinion local opponents and celebrities such as al gore danny glover and jane fonda voiced opposition the former vice president visited memphis and called the project a reckless racist rip off opponents also raised concerns about oil spills and threats to the area s drinking water which is drawn from wells deep underground from the memphis sand aquifer the companies plains all american pipeline and valero energy corp had formed a joint venture byhalia connection llc to build the pipeline the pipeline was to have started at the valero refinery in south memphis on west mallory avenue traveled south across the mississippi state line and swung to the east before terminating in marshall county mississippi it was to connect two existing crude oil pipelines company representatives had argued for months that the pipeline could operate safely but the opposition was organized and in may the company had told city council representatives that it was putting the project on pause opinion why memphis black and brown communities have most to lose from byhalia pipeline environmental activists elated by news sarah houston is an executive with the environmental group protect our aquifer she said her first reaction to friday s news was that it was incredible we don t know if they ll come back or not but right now it feels like a fourth of july birthday present ward archer founder of protect our aquifer said he got an alert from a stock trading website that plains all american sent the sec a notice mentioning that they were abandoning the byhalia connection pipeline after confirming with a few colleagues he said he let out a sigh of relief the stars aligned for this fight he said sometimes the good guys win and this is one of those times kathy robinson co founder of memphis community against the pipeline said she was shocked that the fight did not last as long as expected i anticipated this to last as long as the keystone xl pipeline if i m honest robinson said a fight over construction of the 1 200 mile keystone xl pipeline had lasted for years and ended in june but i m happy when i reflect on my family history and future there will be one less industry in southwest memphis today there will not be a new entity poisoning us more not today justin pearson another environmental activist and a key leader in the pipeline fight spoke about the decision on facebook live we ve shown them that we aren t the path of least resistance we are the path of resilience the statement released by the company didn t mention the opposition byhalia connection llc announced today that it is no longer pursuing the byhalia connection construction project primarily due to lower us oil production resulting from the covid 19 pandemic spokesman brad leone said in a statement posted on a company web site national attention pete buttigieg said u s dot won t intervene in byhalia pipeline construction in case you missed it what s underway to try to stop the byhalia connection pipeline in memphis here s a guide u s crude oil production dropped from an estimated 12 25 million barrels per day in 2019 to 11 31 million barrels per day in 2020 according to the u s energy information administration oil production has dropped to an estimated 11 08 million barrels per day so far in 2021 but was projected to increase to 11 79 million barrels in 2022 the company statement continued we value the relationships we ve built through the development of this project and appreciate those that supported the project and would have shared in its ongoing benefits including our customers communities energy consumers landowners area contractors and suppliers pipelines continue to play a critical role in safely transporting energy products from where energy is produced to where it is refined and turned into consumer goods that benefit our lives as part of any shift to lower carbon energy hydrocarbons will continue to be a critical part of meeting increasing global need for affordable reliable energy legal fight will likely end it s a huge relief for our clients said amanda garcia an attorney with the southern environmental law center the center represented several of the grassroots organizations including memphis community against the pipeline garcia said she did not expect the company to abandon the plans but also acknowledged that community organizations and some elected officials have pushed back against the pipeline plans on multiple fronts even while garcia is relieved to see the plans for the byhalia connection scrapped she cautions that memphis still needs protections for the city s drinking water source further she said there is still a question mark over the usage of the collierville connection pipeline a crude oil pipeline that already connects the diamond pipeline and the capline pipeline for both of these reasons garcia is encouraging memphians and grassroots organizations to remain vigilant and keep pushing for stronger protections of the memphis sand aquifer we don t know what else is coming but i hope the message and the lesson that memphis takes from this experience is that they need better protection for their drinking water source garcia said the coming ordinance through city council remains important we need protection at the local level and memphians can do a lot to protect their drinking water source pipeline ordinance memphis city councilman jeff warren called the move to abandon the project a welcome one plains all american has my personal thanks warren said i am very pleased they made this decision it s going to benefit the future of our groundwater warren is a primary driver behind the city council effort to introduce a regulatory mechanism to control underground infrastructure that could potentially harm the overall health of the aquifer warren said he plans to push forward with what people are calling the pipeline ordinance we do need to proceed with our groundwater protection ordinance warren said the health of the aquifer depends on it investigative reporter daniel connolly welcomes tips and comments

fort lauderdale fla hurricane elsa which had strengthened friday afternoon as it continued speeding through the caribbean saw its forecast track shift slightly westward in the 5 p m edt advisory placing most of coastal south florida including surfside where rescue efforts after the condo collapse are ongoing outside the national hurricane center s projected potential path however the majority of palm beach broward and miami dade counties remained in the potential path for early next week according to the national hurricane center elsa the season s first hurricane increased its wind speed to 85 miles per hour earlier friday afternoon an increase of 10 mph from friday morning but not enough to exceed category 1 strength 74 95 mph elsa is cruising west through the caribbean at the seldom seen speed of 30 mph the storm became the season s first hurricane friday morning and nearly the entire state of florida was in its forecast cone of uncertainty any local impacts from elsa would come after the july fourth holiday according to robert garcia a meteorologist with the national hurricane center that means the scheduled fireworks shows in broward and palm beach counties should be unaffected by elsa unless the forecast changes even though much is still uncertain broward mayor steve geller on friday urged residents to stock up on hurricane supplies now while they are readily available rather than waiting later in the hurricane season have enough water and nonperishable food at home as well as batteries if you can prepared now for the hurricane season geller said he also encouraged residents to make sure they have all they need to board up and put on hurricane shutters ahead of a major storm we ve all been there before and we know people have a tendency to wait he said local officials from the airport water control and electric companies are also keeping a close eye on elsa fort lauderdale hollywood international airport is monitoring the situation according to spokesperson arlene satchell right now we re not under any hurricane watches or warnings she said we ll continue to monitor the path of the storm and we ll make adjustments it if becomes a threat to the region satchell suggested travelers check with their airlines for possible delays or cancellations randy smith spokesman for the south florida water management district said they re lowering canals in broward and miami dade counties and sending the water to the ocean through gates and pump stations we ll put them in a low range and that s because we anticipate significant rainfall from elsa he said smith also said people should check neighborhood drainage areas and make sure nothing is blocking the path otherwise the water could back up and flood don t wait until it starts raining he said smith said if a big clearance job is required people should call their local public works department florida power light is also monitoring elsa it said customers can go to fpl com storm for information on things such as outages we re ready spokesman peter robbins said we have trained for storms year round we ve got our people and equipment on standby and we ll keep watching and see how it develops robbins said at this point it s too late to trim trees because trash pickup could be disrupted by elsa s approach hurricane elsa could also disrupt travel plans on the busy july fourth weekend florida expects to have 2 6 million drivers on the roads according to aaa the auto club group last year in the midst of the covid 19 threat florida has just fewer than 2 million drivers on the road for july according to aaa elsa was being watched carefully by officials in surfside as well any bad significant wind could potentially bring down the remaining part of that building t j lyon chair of florida s statewide emergency response plan told weather com any bad weather is going to have a significant impact on the incident scene elsa is located 505 miles southeast of santo domingo dominican republic according to the national hurricane center hurricane force winds extend 25 miles from elsa s center and tropical storm force winds extend 140 miles all of south florida remains in the cone of hurricane elsa and the system could hit the region early next week it s too early to determine whether hurricane elsa could hit south florida as a hurricane this forecast is most complicated by land interaction meteorologist jonathan belles of the weather channel said in an email we don t know exactly how this system will interact with hispaniola jamaica or cuba this weekend the more interaction elsa has with those countries the weaker the storm will be as it gets closer to florida a secondary factor that we ll be watching with this system is its forward speed it is being shoved westward at a much faster clip than most systems can sustain themselves at but this forward speed should slow down somewhat wind shear is a concern with this storm too but to a lesser degree than the other two factors elsa is a record breaker becoming the earliest forming fifth storm in recorded history the previous record was held by tropical storm eduardo which formed on july 5 2020 elsa s hurricane development is 39 days ahead of when meteorologists typically observe the first hurricane formation of the season which on average usually happens on aug 10 according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s database forecasters mentioned elsa s possible development into a hurricane thursday but there was no hint it would develop so quickly i would say at this point with a tropical storm being forecast it isn t unreasonable for south floridians to be ready for the potential of a category 1 hurricane knocking on our door early next week garcia said it is something that can t be ruled out and folks should be aware that s something we may have to prepare for here during the holiday weekend whichever way the system goes elsa seems sure to bring rain to already saturated south florida and it could bring lots the current forecast path takes elsa over portions of the windward islands where the western caribbean sea meets the north atlantic ocean and southern leeward islands where the caribbean sea meets the western atlantic ocean today its forecast to move across the eastern caribbean sea friday evening and friday night and near the southern coast of the dominican republic and haiti on saturday by sunday elsa is forecast to be near jamaica and portions of eastern cuba however the hurricane center has been quick to add the forecast is uncertain beyond three days elsa is expected to produce between 3 to 6 inches of rain and perhaps as much as 10 inches in parts of the windward and leeward islands including barbados a hurricane warning is in effect for the south coast of the dominican republic from punta palenque to the border with haiti and the southern portion of haiti from port au prince to the southern border with the dominican republic a tropical storm warning is in effect for st vincent and grenadines st lucia martinique dominica the coast of haiti north of port au prince the south coast of the dominican republic east of punta palenque to cabo engano and jamaica a hurricane watch is in effect for jamaica a tropical storm watch is in effect for grenada saba and sint eustatius the north coast of the dominican republic from cabo engano to bahia de manzanillo and cayman brac and little cayman one forecast model has elsa turning north after reaching haiti and the dominican republic but other models have elsa continuing into the southeastern gulf of mexico the discrepancy in the models makes confidence in this track lower than usual according to the hurricane center the determining factor of where elsa goes and when it turns north from its current westward direction is the bermuda high a high pressure system that is the storm s steering mechanism it s essentially what deflects storms from florida or allows them near this influence will last into the weekend before we start to reach the western edge of the bermuda high and begin to turn northward belles said if the bermuda high is strong storms often go westward into central america he said but if that bermuda high is weaker storms can re curve northward over the greater antilles and out into the atlantic it appears that elsa will split this envelope of climatology down the middle last year s first hurricane hanna developed into a hurricane and made landfall in texas on july 25

the trump organization and its chief financial officer alan weisberg pleaded not guilty today to tax fraud charges and grand larceny in manhattan state court these charges were more than two years in the making that followed an intensive investigation by the manhattan district attorney s office which subpoena the presidents former presidents tax records um and had investigated many aspects of his business before bringing this case trump himself was not charged in the indictment unsealed today but the manhattan district attorney s office has stressed for weeks that the investigations are still ongoing even as these charges have been made public it s a significant case on many fronts because a former president is being placed in the perilous position of having to defend criminal charges against his own company there s also been rampant speculation that the chief financial officer alan white hesselberg could face pressure to flip and provide information to prosecutors that could be detrimental to the president that s something that s been watched very closely and will continue to be watched mhm weisberg who is known as an intensely private man and lived in a modest home in long island claimed to continue to claim residency there despite living in a company paid manhattan apartment according to the prosecution and by doing so he concealed that he was in new york city resident and avoided paying more than 900 000 in federal state and city income taxes and collected about 133 in refunds to which he wasn t entitled prosecutors set y spielberg himself could face jail time if convicted of these serious charges but the trump organization itself would likely be forced to pay fines or fees and perhaps even change the way that it operates if convicted work more advertisement explainer how could the indictment hurt trump s company share copy link copy the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get bank loans and bring in new money to his sprawling and indebted business the former president himself was not charged by prosecutors but investigations are ongoing here s a look at the company and the challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he would use the presidency to help his business at the time he set up trust to hold its assets and handed over day to day control of it his two adult sons and weisselberg but trump remained the sole owner or principal owner of those hundreds of businesses and could pull profits from them at any time recently he s returned to his old offices at trump tower on fifth avenue but it s not clear how much he has assumed his former role overseeing operations will the charges hurt the company s ability to do business if the trump organization is convicted it would have to pay a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes or 250 000 whichever is larger the company may also have to change the way it operates but even absent a conviction the indictment could pose problems companies that are being indicted whether they are private or public big or small face serious collateral consequences said daniel horwitz a white collar defense lawyer at mclaughlin and stern and former prosecutor at the manhattan district attorney s office companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them horwitz said their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages what happened to other companies that have been criminally indicted the giant accounting firm arthur andersen started losing auditing business after criminal charges were filed in relation to its enron work and it eventually had to lay off tens of thousands of workers in 2005 the supreme court overturned its obstruction of justice conviction but it was too late and the firm collapsed other companies hit hard by criminal charges include the now defunct 1980s junk bond giant drexel burnham lambert the once massive hedge fund sac capital and oil company bp which had to pay billions stemming from criminal charges for its role in a drilling rig explosion in the gulf of mexico what is the likely hit to trump s company the trump organization could find it more difficult to strike deals to put the trump name on buildings or products attract tournaments to its golf courses and borrow money it may be able to withstand the blows it is a sprawling company but its operations are simple and behind the scenes it runs golf clubs and hotels collects checks from companies occupying offices it owns and charges licensing fees to buildings and

afterward including drug giant bristol myers squibb which was accused of accounting fraud and jpmorgan chase co which was caught up in connection with bernard madoff s massive fraud stocks in all three companies are at or near all time highs what are the former president s future business plans he hasn t said but there some obvious moves experts on branding say that the company could still use trump s fame to strike licensing deals around the world in the years surrounding his runaway tv success the apprentice trump struck deals to put his names on suits ties steaks and residential towers in las vegas chicago and new york the trump brand has been damaged by his divisive rhetoric and stances it s unclear how successful a new licensing effort would prove while he was in office hotels and residential towers in several cities stripped his name off their buildings his company had to scrap plans for new hotel chains because of a lack of interest by potential partners most damaging of all were accusations trump incited the bloody siege of the capitol in january real estate brokers lenders and other businesses cut ties shortly afterward the associated press reported earlier this year

torrent make pontiac segment suv the sport utility vehicle suv market might be at its most rampant right now but it has a long history with a lineage dating back to the military jeep that means there s a rich tapestry to explore as the suv rose to prominence and that history is full of missteps bold ideas that should have worked out and good ideas launched at the wrong time add to that a market that was less global than it is now and you have a lot of vehicles that fell through the cracks you might not have heard of these are some of the more interesting examples 1 monteverdi safari montverdi was a swiss brand that existed from 1967 to 1984 and produced a series of vehicles including the wonderful safari model traditionally monteverdi built supercars but the safari wowed when it went on sale in 1976 the coachbuilt suv was based on the international harvester scout which makes the safari one of the earliest luxury suvs standard equipment included a chrysler 5 2 liter v8 but could also accommodate the same company s 7 2 liter v8 the bodywork was by the italian coachbuilder fissore and the safari sold until 1982 outlasting the international harvester scout by two years we assume monteverdi stocked up and we know not many were sold compared with the range rover models in europe close 2 isuzu amigo the isuzu vehicross isn t on this list because it has become well known there s actually a bunch of forgotten isuzu suvs but its the amigo that we adore it arrived in the us in 1989 as a short wheelbase semi convertible suv coming with a choice of a 2 3 liter or 2 6 liter four cylinder for its first outing then from 1998 until it disappeared for good in 2000 it could be bought with a 2 2 liter four or a 3 2 liter v6 it was based on isuzu s pickup truck of the time and is related to the later launched four door rodeo the rodeo was better known as it was also badged as a honda and sold through honda dealerships however the sole source for the amigo was isuzu dealers close 3 pontiac torrent gxp if you haven t heard of the pontiac torrent that s because was overshadowed by the horrific mistake pontiac made by creating the aztek the torrent was the aztek s replacement but nobody was interested even in a gxp performance model the torrent was essentially a chevrolet equinox with stiffer suspension and the gxp version came with a 3 6 liter v8 with a performance tune to make 264 horsepower it was also longer and lower sitting on tuned suspension and had hydraulic power assisted steering rather than the standard electric power assisted system overall it was a big step up from the standard torrent and gm was pushing it as a lower cost yet more powerful rival to the bmw x3 nobody was buying that or the torrent gxp as it sold for just one year as a 2008 model close 4 ussv rhino gx u s specialty vehicles ussv advertises the rhino g x as one of the largest suvs available and that claim is backed up by the rhino g x being based on the f 450 ford super duty the monstrous on or off roader can be bought with either a 6 7 liter v8 turbodiesel or a 6 8 liter v10 gas engine under the hood and looks like it could be dropped into a war zone and easily emerge unscathed however inside the g x model is a hand built cabin featuring amenities like a 40 inch television and decorated in wood trim if you like the look of the rhino g x it starts at just 330 750 close 5 jerrari rewinding the clock more than 40 years we have the wonderfully bizarre jerrari wagoneer it was william fisk harrah of harrah s hotel and casinos fame who commissioned a pair of jeep wagoneers with 4 4 liter ferrari v12 engines replacing the amc factory v8s the idea came about because harrah asked enzo ferrari to make a four wheel drive vehicle but ferrari refused for the first jerrari a 1969 jeep grand wagoneer was given the engine and transmission from a ferrari 365 gt then the front end of the classic supercar was grafted on the second vehicle was a 1977 jeep wagoneer that was kept mostly stock with its looks but a few extras from the donor car were used such as the quad tip exhaust and the ferrari steering wheel close 6 isuzu trooper rs the isuzu trooper sold incredibly well due to being a solid workhorse of an suv and a perfectly adequate family vehicle and because it appeared on other automakers dealers lots with their badges on however the isuzu trooper rs was overlooked because at the time it went on sale as three door suvs were dropping hard in popularity as well as two less doors than the standard second generation trooper the rs model was shorter with its 91 7 inch wheelbase compared to the full size model s 108 7 inches the rarest is the first generation trooper rs which appeared in the u s in 1989 sold poorly then disappeared as quickly as it appeared the first gen shown below is active in arizona and its owner kyle knoll keeps it alive using the wealth of parts available from salvage parts from full size troopers close 7 lada niva most russians and many readers outside the u s will be familiar with the lada name and the niva as it has been sold in over 100 countries worldwide but it still bears mentioning that the russian built suv was the first mass production off road vehicle to use a unibody architecture with a coil sprung independent front suspension that makes it something of a true crossover and a predecessor to the vehicles that are now commonly built on a car s architecture it s also the longest running 4x4 on the market still available in its original form that doesn t make it good though it makes it cheap it first launched in 1977 and the original is now called the lada niva legend as a second generation has been launched it was originally designed as an agricultural vehicle and has the comfort build quality and safety standards you would expect from a 30 year old vehicle created during the soviet union s era of stagnation however there are reasons it has lasted so long the niva is cheap simple and surprisingly versatile amazingly it has even won the dakar rally close 8 chevrolet menlo chevrolet already has an electric crossover albeit one so compact you could call it a hatchback it s a chinese market electric vehicle and has a unique trim level structure that includes starshare galaxy nebula and starlux it s also due to government subsidies china s lowest price electric compact utility vehicle cuv it has a range of around 250 miles using the new european driving cycle nedc while developing a reasonable 148 hp and 258 lb ft of torque given that it s a good looking vehicle with decent specs it s a surprise chevy hasn t brought a version to the u s yet close 9 conquest knight xv the canadian company conquest tells us on its website that the knight xv is an armored vehicle and not a vehicle that has been uparmored unlike most vehicles that are uparmored in the aftermarket the knight xv is manufactured as an armored vehicle from the ground up using top grade armoring materials that s because the luxury suv is essentially a hand built armored law enforcement vehicle called the terradyne gurkha that runs on a 6 8 liter bio fuel powered v10 engine conquest takes the armored suv and goes nuts on the inside with lashings of leather adds led lighting a television a playstation and other high end features staying true to conquest pr parlance we re going to say the company upluxuried the terradyne gurkha

we aren t as different as some think by gbenga olawepo hashim in the contest for power and resources in history people always try to outdo each other by creating divisions around race ethnicity or faith people do this to enlist group support for otherwise private agenda or whip support for personal disappointment or loss as it presently is sometimes when faith and ethnicity are the same demagogue explores doctrinaire differences as it was in europe in the 17th century where european kings fought a 30 years war dividing themselves into catholics or protestants between 1618 and 1648 europe never emerged significantly as a powerhouse until it overcame that era of darkness only then was it able to march into renaissance enlightenment industrial revolution and democracy ethnically and religiously homogeneous somalia whose war lords divided it along clans has yet to escape from the ruins and darkness of her own division rwanda to the contrary is matching forward having buried the ghost of hatred making development a focus when i was a young student both at a levels and the university it was our aspiration to seek the unity of all of africa into one country in the manner america as espoused by kwame nkrumah the first prime minister of ghana and sekou toure the first president of guinea and other great nationalists some of our mentors in nigeria such as alao aka bashorun worked as pan africanist in drafting the constitutions of many newly independent african countries in a clime when nigeria s justice akinola aguda served as chief justice of botswana we saw all africans as same and we perceived any attack on any group of africans as an attack on the rest of us it was in that spirit that on january 6 1988 rotimi ewebiyi olaitan oyerinde chris ayaze sylvester odion and my humble self all students of the university of lagos were arrested and detained after the massive protest we staged alongside nigerian workers and students following prime minister thatcher of britain s visit we were protesting in nigeria against her pro apartheid policy in south africa where we are coming from is of course very far from where we are now where people are demonstrating to break nigeria in the days of yore it was unimaginable for us that there will come a time that advocacy will become fervent that we break nigeria into separate countries nigeria which we considered then as one of the small 52 states of africa just the size of california everything from farming practices pastoralist vs farmers differences in dressing climate and land are being thrown in the discus to magnify our differences the methods are even regrettably pedestrian in what seem to be an argument that it is needless to save the unity of the country tragically those who have held high offices in nigeria at one point are stoking the current embers of disunity the truth very stubborn truth is that we are the same people more than the magnifying glasses of separatists want us to see nigeria may have diverse languages but the cultures of most nigerian ethnic groups are the same pointing to the same roots in distant history and here is why the cosmogony religious rights history and cultures of most nigerians pre colonial and pre arabic influence are largely the same despite diversity in language the african american scholar chancellor williams has already done justice to this question in his seminar work the destruction of african civilization great issue of a race williams explained that two major factors account for why africa though account for less than 3 of global trade is home to the highest numbers of languages and dialects in the world but same culture these factors are first the migration that occurred in prehistoric times because of the dry up desertification of the areas of the sahara which was home to a previously thriving culture and life the second was forced migration owing to various wars of conquest according to professor williams when people flee they go in small bands in different directions carrying the memory of their cultures and cosmogony but often lose their original languages as they travel far in nigeria it is possible to decipher a definite relationship in the pre colonial and pre arabically influenced cultures of western and northern nigeria these are presumed to be cultures whose ruling classes migrated from meriotic sudan ethiopia and egypt the same practices in the hausa bori cult of worship exists in the sango yoruba cult of worship similarly the same practices are found in the amadioha worship circle amongst the igbos who though are associated with the bantustan stock the details of these assumptions should have by now been a subject of a detail study in archaeology history linguistics using modern technology of historical reconstruction cheikh anta diop who i consider the most outstanding african scholar historian physicist archaeologist and chemist has done some pioneer work on this subject and planned a perspective for historical reconstruction of africa cultures which establishes that africans are essentially the same people not different people and can live together and must ever break from been sliced into tiny groups for easy conquest this was his preoccupation with his books cultural unity of africa africa pre colonial the african origin of civilization myth or reality civilization or barbarism and last the economic and cultural basis for a federated african state i recommend these important works for advocates of separatism who constantly repeat the false doctrine that we are different people we cannot live together let everyone go their ways africans everywhere are of the same ancestry all human beings are of the same ancestry and so says the bible in act of apostle 17 26 and hath made of one blood all nations of men for dwelling on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation let us resolve our economic and political challenges in nigeria in the political turf let us keep ethnic division and religious bigotry out of it ethno religious confrontation are conflicts no one can ever win as all are always losers in that field nigeria is a beautiful country the most formidable promise of the african people it started well at independence and her people had learnt to live together peacefully well until the setback of the civil war triggered by the 1966 military coup the fantastic testament of our peaceful co existence and integration includes such occasions as when the mainly christian voters of gboko elected a kanuri muslim man abubakar imam to represent them in the northern state assembly it includes when chief obafemi awolowo campaigned for ernest ikoli an ijaw man in the lagos elections against a fellow ijebu man akinsanya in the early 1960 s right to the seventies 70 s easterners like kalu anya served in borno judiciary as well as justice olagunju a yoruba man from offa who trained many jurists in the sokoto division today s setbacks are not conclusive evidence of our inability to live together but challenges we must overcome as even the most advanced countries of the world such as united states of america united kingdom spain and france still grapple with issues of identity nigerians up till today are still more tolerant of each other than the separatist s propaganda want us to believe even as we write the only seat allocated to kebbi state at the supreme court is occupied by a jurist originally from delta state who practiced in the old sokoto state and married from argungu justice amina adamu augie kebbi people do not regard her as a foreigner but a loyal daughter of kebbi it is time to talk a little more about the prime point in our journey to national integration rather than our low points nigerians can live together peacefully and in prosperity once we regain our minds to do some of the right things including decentralizing more powers to the states and local government electing focused leaders with clear vision for economic and social development with character and antecedents that show they can deliver on promises and embarking immediately on a policy of national reconciliation and inclusiveness these are what nigeria needs not division
a roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week none of these are legit even though they were shared widely on social media the associated press checked them out here are the facts posts mislead on delta variant data claim data from the u k s public health agency confirms that those who have been vaccinated against covid 19 are anywhere from two times to six times more likely to die from the delta variant than the unvaccinated the facts public health england s report did not show evidence that those who are vaccinated are more susceptible to dying from the coronavirus delta variant rather the data which was published june 18 shows the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the variant an instagram post falsely claimed the health agency s data showed vaccinated people were twice as likely to die from the delta variant than unvaccinated people another falsely claimed vaccinated people were six times more likely to die from a circulating variant like delta than are unvaccinated people one post used a table from the report to share the false claim but the post misrepresented the table s data while the table does address delta variant deaths it shows that among 60 624 confirmed cases of the variant between feb 1 and june 14 recorded deaths included 37 vaccinated people and 34 unvaccinated furthermore the table does not state the age group of those who died and whether they suffered from any additional illnesses experts say that means conclusions cannot be drawn about the role of vaccines in those deaths unless you account for these differences in age and population you really can t make the argument that vaccination confers a higher risk of death said dr nasia safdar an infectious disease physician at the university of wisconsin s school of medicine and public health the report notes that follow up is needed when examining the data on delta variant deaths because it is too early to provide a formal assessment of the case fatality of delta stratified by age compared to other variants the public health agency issued another report on june 25 that showed that no deaths had been recorded of patients under 50 who were infected with the delta variant and had received both doses of vaccine the data from the agency shows that two doses of the vaccines made by pfizer or astrazeneca are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant associated press writer beatrice dupuy in new york contributed this report viruses can evolve to be more deadly claim no virus has ever mutated to become more lethal as viruses mutate they become less lethal the facts as the spread of coronavirus variants raise new public health questions social media users are sharing misinformation about how viruses mutate a post on facebook reads in the history of virology there has never ever been a viral mutation that resulted in a virus that was more lethal as viruses mutate they become more contagious transmissible and less lethal but in fact there have been cases of viruses that mutated to become more deadly that claim as a whole is just nonsense said troy day a professor of mathematics and biology at queen s university in canada who has studied the ways infectious diseases including coronavirus can evolve some examples of viruses that became more deadly over time include those that developed drug resistant variants and animal viruses such as bird flu which were harmless to humans initially but then mutated to become capable of killing people according to dr amesh adalja a senior scholar at johns hopkins university s center for health security flu viruses have developed resistance to certain antivirals that make them more difficult to treat and therefore make them more deadly adalja said also noting the same has happened with hiv and certain hepatitis c strains while early scientific theories suggested that as viruses evolved they would become more contagious and less lethal to keep spreading over time the scientific community has acknowledged that s not always the case becoming more transmissible and less lethal are absolutely what s best for the pathogen said day but the problem is that it s not always possible and in many instances is never possible to be more transmissible and also less lethal day said there are documented cases of animal viruses that evolved over time to become more lethal including myxoma virus in rabbits and marek s disease in chicken some viruses provoke severe symptoms in their hosts that make it easier to transmit the virus to others but those same symptoms can wind up killing the hosts the virus speaking anthropomorphically just wants to spread and have its genes replicated said adalja if the best way for it is to spread by causing severe symptoms it will continue to do that associated press writer terrence fraser in new york contributed this report fake memo targets cold remedies amid spread of covid 19 variant claim information in a confidential memo from a professor at imperial college london shows that pharmaceutical companies are being told to stop manufacturing

victoria wanted to hear but he warned that while it was a terrific outcome it was nowhere near over victorians have done an awesome effort in getting tested getting vaccinated following the rules we are not out of the woods yet today having zero cases is a great reflection of the work of all victorians there is a total of 75 active cases in the community and 17 604 tests were processed on thursday mr merlino urged those in craigieburn to get tested as he said testing numbers were lower than expected in some areas we would like to see an uplift because of community transmission it was lower than we would have liked in some parts of melbourne i am asking victorians that if you live in the craigieburn area and did not get tested yesterday please go out and get tested today he said acting premier james merlino says victorians are not out of the woods yet picture david crosling chief health officer brett sutton also urged victorians to keep testing efforts up the week ahead probably won t be all zero cases we have thousands of primary close contacts some of which will become positive it is not a concern as they all quarantined for the entire period it has only been 48 hours since we had cases of uncertain acquisition the genomic sequence from the four mystery cases in the same reservoir household has indicated they re carrying the kappa strain of virus prof sutton said that finding was consistent with the existing city of whittlesea outbreak the dhhs is still searching for the source of exposure for the two queensland cases in melbourne they have gone through a long interview process with us prof sutton said we thank them for that it is a tiring process lots of detail around where they have been we have been looking quite a bit earlier than june for that acquisition where they may have picked it up whether or not they were infectious through that he said mr merlino said a number of exposure sites would come up as a result of the couple who had travelled to queensland but could not say if the pair would be fined a large line forms at the food bank pop up in la trobe street after the easing of restrictions picture nca newswire david crosling

place prof sutton said the state would not ease restrictions sooner than planned given the kappa variant link with the reservoir household he said he wasn t suprised by friday s zero cases obviously primary close contacts isolating at home has helped to control this he said although tracing work has helped to control this and all the great testing that has been done has allowed us to find cases and then control them so we are going to get days of zero i expect they will be more and i also expect there will be days when we have new cases each day it isn t over yet we are on the right track as the city s restrictions eased on monday prof sutton said he had never backed lockdowns as the first measure to tackle an outbreak they will never be the first measure they will be a measure that we implement when we have to do and only when we have to do there are so many sad stories and struggles that people are reporting on my heart goes out to them i cannot fathom what it has meant across victoria throughout lockdown and through all of the circuit breakers and lockdowns across australia we are doing this with the minimum restrictions that keep us safe the alternative with this running away is too awful to imagine in some respects however he said mystery cases would trigger tighter restrictions but couldn t say whether the emergence of more mystery cases would lead to another lockdown of course mystery cases where there are concerns about high risk settings would be of concern there will be mystery cases where people have had very little interaction or there is a significant suggestion where they may have picked it up geographically or otherwise there is no one size fits all each on its own merits chief health officer brett sutton says mystery cases will trigger more restrictions picture andrew henshaw shopper return to bourke street mall picture david crosling covid jab a path out of lockdowns more than 17 000 victorians were vaccinated on thursday mr merlino said the commonwealth had assured it had enough pfizer vaccination in stock for a second dose he said vaccination was a pathway out of future blanket lockdowns the sooner we get our

coronavirus had not been transmitted outside in any recent outbreak it comes as authorities scramble to work out how a family of four mysteriously caught the virus a woman in her 70s and three men in

cautious easing of melbourne s restrictions allowing schools to reopen restaurants to have 100 patrons only 50 indoors and travel up to 25km could go ahead we are moving ahead but we are on high alert acting premier james merlino said questions have been raised as to the effectiveness of wearing masks outdoors after both professor cheng and covid 19 commander jeroen weimar confirmed no cases in the current cluster or recent outbreaks had been acquired while outside we have no evidence that we ve seen yet in this particular outbreak or the most recent ones we ve dealt with of outdoor transmission mr weimar admitted on thursday professor cheng said there was pretty good evidence around masks reducing transmission and that cases where the virus was passed outdoors in the second wave might have gone unnoticed when asked about reports that transmission was 20 times less likely to happen outdoors prof cheng said that doesn t mean zero there is still a risk infectious diseases expert prof peter collignon said little to no transmission occurred outdoors unless in crowded situations where people gathered for prolonged periods unless you ve got uncontrollable spread like in the uk or europe i can t really see it ll provide much benefit to wear masks outdoors prof collignon said there can t be much community transmission in melbourne right now if any mr merlino said the continued wearing of masks was a small price to pay we don t have the luxury of picking and choosing public health advice that we like or don t like he said melbourne exited lockdown at midnight on thursday picture ian

victorian contact tracers have little information on the case given they are now in the hands of queensland authorities prof cheng flagged the new cases could stall the planned easing of restrictions in greater melbourne from thursday june 17 we may need to hold on the current settings for a little longer prof cheng said more exposure sites added a mcdonald s drive through multiple coles supermarkets and a woolworths are among the latest additions to victoria s long list of covid 19 exposure sites the state s health department made eight additions to the alerts list of venues visited by a confirmed case of covid 19 on thursday as melbourne s tough lockdown was lifted all of the new venues were listed as tier 2 exposure sites meaning people who visited during the times listed need

a roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week none of these are legit even though they were shared widely on social media the associated press checked them out here are the facts posts mislead on delta variant data claim data from the u k s public health agency confirms that those who have been vaccinated against covid 19 are anywhere from two times to six times more likely to die from the delta variant than the unvaccinated the facts public health england s report did not show evidence that those who are vaccinated are more susceptible to dying from the coronavirus delta variant rather the data which was published june 18 shows the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the variant an instagram post falsely claimed the health agency s data showed vaccinated people were twice as likely to die from the delta variant than unvaccinated people another falsely claimed vaccinated people were six times more likely to die from a circulating variant like delta than are unvaccinated people one post used a table from the report to share the false claim but the post misrepresented the table s data while the table does address delta variant deaths it shows that among 60 624 confirmed cases of the variant between feb 1 and june 14 recorded deaths included 37 vaccinated people and 34 unvaccinated furthermore the table does not state the age group of those who died and whether they suffered from any additional illnesses experts say that means conclusions cannot be drawn about the role of vaccines in those deaths unless you account for these differences in age and population you really can t make the argument that vaccination confers a higher risk of death said dr nasia safdar an infectious disease physician at the university of wisconsin s school of medicine and public health the report notes that follow up is needed when examining the data on delta variant deaths because it is too early to provide a formal assessment of the case fatality of delta stratified by age compared to other variants the public health agency issued another report on june 25 that showed that no deaths had been recorded of patients under 50 who were infected with the delta variant and had received both doses of vaccine the data from the agency shows that two doses of the vaccines made by pfizer or astrazeneca are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant associated press writer beatrice dupuy in new york contributed this report viruses can evolve to be more deadly claim no virus has ever mutated to become more lethal as viruses mutate they become less lethal the facts as the spread of coronavirus variants raise new public health questions social media users are sharing misinformation about how viruses mutate a post on facebook reads in the history of virology there has never ever been a viral mutation that resulted in a virus that was more lethal as viruses mutate they become more contagious transmissible and less lethal but in fact there have been cases of viruses that mutated to become more deadly that claim as a whole is just nonsense said troy day a professor of mathematics and biology at queen s university in canada who has studied the ways infectious diseases including coronavirus can evolve some examples of viruses that became more deadly over time include those that developed drug resistant variants and animal viruses such as bird flu which were harmless to humans initially but then mutated to become capable of killing people according to dr amesh adalja a senior scholar at johns hopkins university s center for health security flu viruses have developed resistance to certain antivirals that make them more difficult to treat and therefore make them more deadly adalja said also noting the same has happened with hiv and certain hepatitis c strains while early scientific theories suggested that as viruses evolved they would become more contagious and less lethal to keep spreading over time the scientific community has acknowledged that s not always the case becoming more transmissible and less lethal are absolutely what s best for the pathogen said day but the problem is that it s not always possible and in many instances is never possible to be more transmissible and also less lethal day said there are documented cases of animal viruses that evolved over time to become more lethal including myxoma virus in rabbits and marek s disease in chicken some viruses provoke severe symptoms in their hosts that make it easier to transmit the virus to others but those same symptoms can wind up killing the hosts the virus speaking anthropomorphically just wants to spread and have its genes replicated said adalja if the best way for it is to spread by causing severe symptoms it will continue to do that associated press writer terrence fraser in new york contributed this report fake memo targets cold

a roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week none of these are legit even though they were shared widely on social media the associated press checked them out here are the facts posts mislead on delta variant data claim data from the u k s public health agency confirms that those who have been vaccinated against covid 19 are anywhere from two times to six times more likely to die from the delta variant than the unvaccinated the facts public health england s report did not show evidence that those who are vaccinated are more susceptible to dying from the coronavirus delta variant rather the data which was published june 18 shows the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the variant an instagram post falsely claimed the health agency s data showed vaccinated people were twice as likely to die from the delta variant than unvaccinated people another falsely claimed vaccinated people were six times more likely to die from a circulating variant like delta than are unvaccinated people one post used a table from the report to share the false claim but the post misrepresented the table s data while the table does address delta variant deaths it shows that among 60 624 confirmed cases of the variant between feb 1 and june 14 recorded deaths included 37 vaccinated people and 34 unvaccinated furthermore the table does not state the age group of those who died and whether they suffered from any additional illnesses experts say that means conclusions cannot be drawn about the role of vaccines in those deaths unless you account for these differences in age and population you really can t make the argument that vaccination confers a higher risk of death said dr nasia safdar an infectious disease physician at the university of wisconsin s school of medicine and public health the report notes that follow up is needed when examining the data on delta variant deaths because it is too early to provide a formal assessment of the case fatality of delta stratified by age compared to other variants the public health agency issued another report on june 25 that showed that no deaths had been recorded of patients under 50 who were infected with the delta variant and had received both doses of vaccine the data from the agency shows that two doses of the vaccines made by pfizer or astrazeneca are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant associated press writer beatrice dupuy in new york contributed this report viruses can evolve to be more deadly claim no virus has ever mutated to become more lethal as viruses mutate they become less lethal the facts as the spread of coronavirus variants raise new public health questions social media users are sharing misinformation about how viruses mutate a post on facebook reads in the history of virology there has never ever been a viral mutation that resulted in a virus that was more lethal as viruses mutate they become more contagious transmissible and less lethal but in fact there have been cases of viruses that mutated to become more deadly that claim as a whole is just nonsense said troy day a professor of mathematics and biology at queen s university in canada who has studied the ways infectious diseases including coronavirus can evolve some examples of viruses that became more deadly over time include those that developed drug resistant variants and animal viruses such as bird flu which were harmless to humans initially but then mutated to become capable of killing people according to dr amesh adalja a senior scholar at johns hopkins university s center for health security flu viruses have developed resistance to certain antivirals that make them more difficult to treat and therefore make them more deadly adalja said also noting the same has happened with hiv and certain hepatitis c strains while early scientific theories suggested that as viruses evolved they would become more contagious and less lethal to keep spreading over time the scientific community has acknowledged that s not always the case becoming more transmissible and less lethal are absolutely what s best for the pathogen said day but the problem is that it s not always possible and in many instances is never possible to be more transmissible and also less lethal day said there are documented cases of animal viruses that evolved over time to become more lethal including myxoma virus in rabbits and marek s disease in chicken some viruses provoke severe symptoms in their hosts that make it easier to transmit the virus to others but those same symptoms can wind up killing the hosts the virus speaking anthropomorphically just wants to spread and have its genes replicated said adalja if the best way for it is to spread by causing severe symptoms it will continue to do that associated press writer terrence fraser in new york contributed this report fake memo targets cold

the u s economy is awakening from a coma that was the analogy used by more than one economist who spoke with the pbs newshour about the uptick in consumer prices that americans have experienced over the past few months one year after the coronavirus pandemic brought the economy to a grinding halt read more half of u s fears another covid wave even as optimism grows the prices of goods and services in the u s rose by 5 percent in may from the previous year marking the highest inflation rate recorded since 2008 the latest bureau of labor statistics report released on june 10 immediately sent some investors and lawmakers into a tailspin over concerns that high inflation figures could negatively affect the stock market or lead to a price spiral not unlike what happened in the 1970s when double digit inflation led to long lines at gas stations and boycotts over the high cost of food recent polling by the pbs newshour npr and marist suggest all of the talk surrounding inflation had an impact on how everyday americans were feeling about it too in a recent survey 26 percent of respondents said inflation was their number one concern regarding the u s economy more than any other area including wages and unemployment but economists who spoke with the pbs newshour cautioned that the crisis spurred by the pandemic was unique and the inflation rates recorded in april and may were intimately tied to the events of the last year which saw unprecedented slowdowns in consumer spending global supply chain issues that are still persisting and deep job losses that have yet to rebound they also said they expected inflation to cool as most of these issues sort themselves out provided the u s does not experience another virus surge in modern history we haven t been in this situation where parts of the economy were essentially put into a coma for a while and now they re waking up said gabriel ehrlich an economist and forecaster at the university of michigan here s a look at some of the factors driving prices up in the u s right now and what they can and can t tell us about the current state of the american economy historic fall historic rise in the first months after covid 19 began spreading throughout the u s the country experienced deflation with the consumer price index a measure commonly used to measure changes in price level for u s goods dropping by 0 4 percent in march 2020 and then by 0 8 percent in april a monthly decline not seen since the great recession in 2008 but the pandemic turned a swift corner in the u s this spring the initial covid 19 vaccine rollout was fairly successful with more than 3 million americans a day on average being vaccinated by mid april 2021 this growing vaccination rate coupled with falling cases spurred many businesses that had shuttered or scaled back during the height of the pandemic to reopen and prompted people who had been largely homebound for the past year to go out and begin spending money again and as more consumers started purchasing goods and services that had gone largely untouched this time last year the cost of items such as airline tickets rental cars and hotels rose significantly amid this sudden uptick in consumer demand and lingering supply chain issues tied to the pandemic consumer prices rose 5 percent from the previous year in may robert rich director of the center for inflation research at the federal reserve bank of cleveland said some of these price hikes were not unexpected given the historically low price drops that occurred across many sectors of the economy this time last year when the pandemic hit we saw prices for some goods and services go down significantly he said the minute they move out of that 12 month window you re going to start to see this surge in inflation and while the recent inflation has been cause for worry among some in washington economist claudia sahm a former section chief at the federal reserve said it came as no surprise to economists after the historic deflation that occurred last year drawing on the coma analogy sahm said we can t predict whether the economy will suddenly snap out of it or awaken more slowly but she believes inflation is likely to slow down in the coming months rising consumer prices point to some positive signs that the economy is recovering in addition to airline fares and hotels the cost of apparel rose by more than 5 6 percent over the past year driven in part by raw material shortages but also pent up demand for clothes from shoppers coming out of quarantine the cost of food away from home also rose as more americans spent more money on restaurants thanks not only to a third round of stimulus payments but also the lifting of dining restrictions and a recovering labor market the federal reserve responded to inflation the week of june 14 by pushing up its timeline on when it will next raise interest rates to 2023 the fed typically raises interest rates during periods of inflation to slow growth and keep the economy from overheating fed chair jerome powell told congress on june 22 that these current price increases tied to the pandemic were larger and more persistent than expected but that he did expect inflation to wane over time but regardless of whether americans start to see lower prices on items like gas and rental cars in the coming months some 9 5 million still remain unemployed an indicator that the u s economy is far from a full recovery especially as the country is still in the throes of the pandemic inflation can have far reaching and potentially damaging impacts and a persistent or dramatic rise in inflation would be of concern said mark hamrick a senior economic analyst with bankrate adding that he did expect the federal reserve to take action if this happened but he said that it was still too early to tell whether supply and labor shortages would lead to long term inflation noting that like so many questions surrounding the u s economy over the past 16 months this is just an issue that s going to have to play itself out some price hikes driven by supply chain issues one of the most eye popping trends driving up inflation in may was a shortage of used cars and trucks which caused prices of these products to rise nearly 30 percent over the past year we re seeing a lot of inflation in the vehicle sector said laura rosner warburton a founding partner and senior economist with macropolicy perspectives she identified a few factors that put extra pressure on the used car market high demand for new cars due to public transportation fears during the pandemic coupled with a shortage of the microchips needed to manufacture them that began last year drove more people to the used car market additionally faced with an initial drop in business at the beginning of the pandemic many rental car companies sold their fleets only to see demand spike the following spring those same rental companies are now bidding on used cars too there s just excess demand right now and very limited supply and it s really driven up used car prices to an unprecedented degree that s what s behind a lot of that momentum in the consumer price index said rosner warburton gabriel ehrlich said that supply chain bottlenecks similar to the microchip shortage affecting the vehicle sector are also touching other parts of the economy the price of lumber for example was up nearly 90 percent in april from the previous year which in turn drove up prices for home furnishings as well as new homes the rising cost of raw metals also contributed to an increase in prices for home appliances such as microwaves in may but economists generally expect these supply chain issues to sort themselves out in the coming months claudia sahm cautioned against reading too much into the crazy price hikes in a sector like used cars telling me that used car prices rose more than ever before really doesn t tell me anything she said noting that while supply chain issues are likely to work themselves out in the end a resurgence of the coronavirus which public health experts are warning may happen could put the u s back where it started last spring covid has been in charge of this economic crisis from the start and it will be in charge of it until the end other price surges tied to reopening among the industries hardest hit by the pandemic was travel and the reopening of the economy prompted a major rebound in demand for items like airline tickets and hotels both of which were largely on hold during the height of the pandemic after plummeting 28 8 percent from the previous year in may 2020 airline fares rose this spring with year over year prices jumping by 9 6 percent in april 2021 and by 24 1 percent the next month sahm said this is a reflection of necessary price hikes by the airline industry which could not have functioned more than a year or two at the levels they were in 2020 yes they re overshooting and they will come down she said the price of hotels and motels also went up by 10 percent in may compared to the previous year another trend that is also almost certainly tied to the reopening people have been cooped up in their homes they missed holidays they hadn t seen family no vacations said sahm of some of the spending driving inflation in last month s consumer price index report so it s not surprising rosner warburton also noted that the cost of eating out at restaurants rose over the past year in part because of worker shortages in the food service industry the reality is that those public facing jobs are riskier than they were before she said and so those employees and workers they are demanding raises rosner warburton added though that she expected this trend to be a one time shift rather than an ongoing sequence of wage increases inflation likely to fall but jobs recovery could take longer it s normal for americans to worry about inflation after all it can have a direct impact on their budgets and pocketbooks but sahm urged caution against so called inflation hawks who have suggested the current trends could lead to a wage price spiral akin to what happened in the late 1970s when both rising wages and prices caused inflation to rise above 10 percent powell was pressed on this question by house republicans on june 22 but said it was very very unlikely the country would get anywhere near this point robert rich of the federal reserve in cleveland echoed powell s point noting that there s still a lot of slack in the labor market meaning that a high number of americans remain unemployed compared to the number of jobs available and unions are nowhere near as numerous or as powerful in driving wage negotiations as they were 50 years ago for now sahm said she sees promising signs that inflation is cooling while it reached a historic high in may consumer prices grew at a slower rate compared to the previous month s change and she said recently prices on some of the items and commodities that had been driving up inflation like lumber microchips and used cars have been decreasing read more u s jobless claims fall to 364 000 a new pandemic low but bigger questions about the overall health of the u s economy remain as lawmakers questioned powell on inflation toward the end of june they also debated whether extended unemployment benefits are keeping americans from going back to work and discussed what duty the u s has to donate covid 19 vaccines to other countries in order to help the rest of the global economy get back on track while the u s has experienced a swift economic recovery from the coronavirus thus far growth is much more uneven in other parts of the world where vaccination rates remain low and transmission of the delta coronavirus variant continues to push economies back into lockdown some economists have warned of large and persisting trade deficits if the u s economy recovers much more quickly than other countries both ehrlich and sahm said they ve been paying closer attention to jobs reports for a true measure of where americans are feeling an economic pinch the most recent employment report showed promising signs of recovery with the u s adding 850 000 workers in june but that s still below the one million monthly job gains that fed chair powell said he wanted to see consistently unemployment rose to 5 9 percent in june and there are still 6 8 million fewer jobs compared to february 2020 industries with low wage workers such as leisure and hospitality have been slower to recover despite showing gains in the most recent jobs report the reality is we re in a really big jobs hole and it is lower income workers who are least likely to be re employed ehrlich said for many people way up into the middle class if they miss a paycheck or three months of paychecks they are in serious financial difficulty so when unemployment goes up this is bad sahm added we should not say mission accomplished until the unemployment rate is back down
a roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week none of these are legit even though they were shared widely on social media the associated press checked them out here are the facts posts mislead on delta variant data claim data from the u k s public health agency confirms that those who have been vaccinated against covid 19 are anywhere from two times to six times more likely to die from the delta variant than the unvaccinated the facts public health england s report did not show evidence that those who are vaccinated are more susceptible to dying from the coronavirus delta variant rather the data which was published june 18 shows the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the variant an instagram post falsely claimed the health agency s data showed vaccinated people were twice as likely to die from the delta variant than unvaccinated people another falsely claimed vaccinated people were six times more likely to die from a circulating variant like delta than are unvaccinated people one post used a table from the report to share the false claim but the post misrepresented the table s data while the table does address delta variant deaths it shows that among 60 624 confirmed cases of the variant between feb 1 and june 14 recorded deaths included 37 vaccinated people and 34 unvaccinated furthermore the table does not state the age group of those who died and whether they suffered from any additional illnesses experts say that means conclusions cannot be drawn about the role of vaccines in those deaths unless you account for these differences in age and population you really can t make the argument that vaccination confers a higher risk of death said dr nasia safdar an infectious disease physician at the university of wisconsin s school of medicine and public health the report notes that follow up is needed when examining the data on delta variant deaths because it is too early to provide a formal assessment of the case fatality of delta stratified by age compared to other variants the public health agency issued another report on june 25 that showed that no deaths had been recorded of patients under 50 who were infected with the delta variant and had received both doses of vaccine the data from the agency shows that two doses of the vaccines made by pfizer or astrazeneca are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant associated press writer beatrice dupuy in new york contributed this report viruses can evolve to be more deadly claim no virus has ever mutated to become more lethal as viruses mutate they become less lethal the facts as the spread of coronavirus variants raise new public health questions social media users are sharing misinformation about how viruses mutate a post on facebook reads in the history of virology there has never ever been a viral mutation that resulted in a virus that was more lethal as viruses mutate they become more contagious transmissible and less lethal but in fact there have been cases of viruses that mutated to become more deadly that claim as a whole is just nonsense said troy day a professor of mathematics and biology at queen s university in canada who has studied the ways infectious diseases including coronavirus can evolve some examples of viruses that became more deadly over time include those that developed drug resistant variants and animal viruses such as bird flu which were harmless to humans initially but then mutated to become capable of killing people according to dr amesh adalja a senior scholar at johns hopkins university s center for health security flu viruses have developed resistance to certain antivirals that make them more difficult to treat and therefore make them more deadly adalja said also noting the same has happened with hiv and certain hepatitis c strains while early scientific theories suggested that as viruses evolved they would become more contagious and less lethal to keep spreading over time the scientific community has acknowledged that s not always the case becoming more transmissible and less lethal are absolutely what s best for the pathogen said day but the problem is that it s not always possible and in many instances is never possible to be more transmissible and also less lethal day said there are documented cases of animal viruses that evolved over time to become more lethal including myxoma virus in rabbits and marek s disease in chicken some viruses provoke severe symptoms in their hosts that make it easier to transmit the virus to others but those same symptoms can wind up killing the hosts the virus speaking anthropomorphically just wants to spread and have its genes replicated said adalja if the best way for it is to spread by causing severe symptoms it will continue to do that associated press writer terrence fraser in new york contributed this report fake memo targets cold

research melding robot driven automation with digital artificial intelligence on a mission to revolutionize how new medications are developed to battle some of the rarest and most challenging of human medical conditions and the company has been on an absolute tear in the last year raising over 500 million via a public stock offering in april expanding its footprint with a new research facility in toronto and growing its staff by over 60 it also has four medications currently in clinical trials recursion was founded in 2013 and outgrew two facilities at university of utah s research park before taking over a 100 000 plus square foot space in downtown s gateway center the former home of dick s sporting goods this week the company announced it will double the footprint of its flagship research and office facility signing a lease on an additional 100 000 square feet of space at the gateway recursion president and chief operating officer tina larson said the new real estate will help accommodate the company s plans to continue growing its capacity and current staff of 270 recursion is a pioneer in the emerging field of technology enabled drug discovery larson said in a statement to deliver on our mission we have grown our world class team of scientists engineers clinicians and company builders by more than 60 in the last year expanding our laboratory footprint will allow us to grow our proprietary biological dataset even faster and add several novel capabilities in biology and chemistry research a cellular experiment image from recursion pharmaceuticals the company just

add at least that many new employees in the coming year in addition to salt lake city recursion has operations in milpitas california and plans in place for additional facilities in toronto and montreal recursion s innovative approach began as the core of doctoral research performed by company co founder and ceo chris gibson at the university of utah the method relies on automating the once human intensive process of peering through a microscope to assess if a chemical compound s impact on a diseased cell is having a positive effect or advancing it toward being a healthy cell in a 2018 deseret news profile of the company larson explained that recursion has developed a technique to take a sample cell representing a genetic disorder and test it against the effects of hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds in a process that automates the visual evaluations and data gathering to allow for a lot of testing in a very short period of time we look at a disease we re interested in against every chemical we can access larson said we have so much robotics we can run hundreds of thousands of experiments very quickly in a way that you can t do with traditional biology the advanced automation identifies hits or impacts from particular chemical compounds on diseased cells that show promising results once identified the recursion team can hone in and pursue furthering the results through modifications to the compound lux capital based in new york city and menlo park california was an early recursion investor participating in a 60 million round of funding for the company in 2017 zavain dar a principal with lux said a former stanford graduate school classmate of his put the company on lux s radar in 2016 and when he looked into it he was wildly impressed with recursion s approach their process is exceptionally intelligent dar said in 2018 it removes human hubris and bias from the equation a factor that s plagued preclinical drug discovery research for decades now dar noted the company s innovation is entirely new and taking advantage of automation wet lab and machine learning advances that have put recursion years ahead of its competition and gone well above and beyond what anyone thought was possible dar also believes the approach recursion is developing could lead to compressing the time it takes to identify and bring a new drug to market from a decade plus into the range of three to five years and lux capital has not been alone in its bullish stance on recursion s potential before entering the public markets this spring recursion had attracted over 460 million in venture investments according to tech data aggregator crunchbase at the end of regular trading on friday recursion stock rxrx was trading at 36 50 per share on the nasdaq

the trump organization and its chief financial officer alan weisberg pleaded not guilty today to tax fraud charges and grand larceny in manhattan state court these charges were more than two years in the making that followed an intensive investigation by the manhattan district attorney s office which subpoena the presidents former presidents tax records um and had investigated many aspects of his business before bringing this case trump himself was not charged in the indictment unsealed today but the manhattan district attorney s office has stressed for weeks that the investigations are still ongoing even as these charges have been made public it s a significant case on many fronts because a former president is being placed in the perilous position of having to defend criminal charges against his own company there s also been rampant speculation that the chief financial officer alan white hesselberg could face pressure to flip and provide information to prosecutors that could be detrimental to the president that s something that s been watched very closely and will continue to be watched mhm weisberg who is known as an intensely private man and lived in a modest home in long island claimed to continue to claim residency there despite living in a company paid manhattan apartment according to the prosecution and by doing so he concealed that he was in new york city resident and avoided paying more than 900 000 in federal state and city income taxes and collected about 133 in refunds to which he wasn t entitled prosecutors set y spielberg himself could face jail time if convicted of these serious charges but the trump organization itself would likely be forced to pay fines or fees and perhaps even change the way that it operates if convicted work more advertisement explainer how could the indictment hurt trump s company share copy link copy the criminal tax fraud charges unsealed against donald trump s company thursday are a blow to a business already reeling from canceled deals following the insurrection at the u s capitol and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on hotels and clubs the indictment may make it harder for trump to strike new deals get bank loans and bring in new money to his sprawling and indebted business the former president himself was not charged by prosecutors but investigations are ongoing here s a look at the company and the challenge it now faces what is the trump organization the company is a business entity encompassing hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings hotels residential towers golf clubs branding rights licensing deals and other assets around the world those various businesses share staff with the trump organization including trump s two adult sons donald jr and eric both executive vice presidents and allen weisselberg the indicted chief financial officer what are the allegations a grand jury indictment charged the trump organization with conspiring to help top executives cheat on their taxes by not reporting compensation like free use of apartments and cars payments of school tuition or reimbursement for personal expenses the company pleaded not guilty as has weisselberg one of trump s most loyal and longest serving employees the company says neither it nor weisselberg did anything wrong and claimed the charges are politically motivated weisselberg is also accused of cheating on his taxes by disguising that his full time residence was in new york city where he was subject to the city s income tax what is trump s current role in the company trump resigned from positions he held with hundreds of trump organization entities in over 20 countries before he took the presidential oath of office four years ago it was his attempt to allay fears he

i m usually loathe to label any pop culture work important because i think it reeks of pretentious lazy writing but if i were the type to call something important white would certainly fit the bill because how else would you describe the sequel to black a book that came out at the launch of the trump era that posed the question what if the only superpowered beings on earth are black the long awaited sequel to black finally reached some customers hands this week as white hits comics shops though in limited form more on that down below the creator owned book is the newest chapter of a saga that quickly morphed from a kickstarter success story to a straight up phenom one with sold out print runs tons of media coverage and a movie deal with warner bros to create a cinematic black universe the story that kwanza osajyefo and his co creators including co writer tim smith 3 and artists jamal igle and khary randolph put together for white follows the natural progression from the events of black namely how far would the white establishment go to protect its place in society in a world with black supers when osajyefo hopped on a zoom call with syfy wire recently he explained how the current story arc came together with the main antagonist theodore mann occupying a prominent new position and as it does with a lot of nerds it all came down to star wars credit khary randolph black mask studios in my wildest dreams before black ever actually landed on paper i had always imagined it being like sort of a trilogy with a definite arc to it osajyefo says and something very star wars and with white we re in the empire strikes back section of the story right now as such osajyefo wanted white to challenge the initial concept of black and see where it takes us okay well what if only black people had super powers and then how would the world react to that so white is essentially how the world reacts to that once it becomes public knowledge and so you have the character of theodore mann he becomes elected as president of the united states which believe it or not was the intent way before the former guy came into office osajyefo is of course referring to former president donald trump who took over the white house in 2017 but while mann s fictional election may have proceeded trump s actual one osajyefo admits to using trump s time in office as a source of material for the new project i actually took particular interest in children because that s a next generation of people like him osajyefo says i thought what creates a person like the former guy what creates his children the writer says he saw the conflict between theodore mann s son thaddeus and the leader of the resistance movement x as crucial to the evolution of the larger storyline x was once known as kareem jenkins who in black was the young man who is killed by police only to return with superpowers in white we really set the tension up between x and mann s son thaddeus who s essentially trying to pick up the family business in some respect he s very much a product of entitlement he sees the world through a very limited and curated lens osajyefo says when you take someone like that who thinks the world is his oyster and belongs to him and then you create a segment of people who have actual physical power it kind of puts him on his heels a bit and he s very determined to show dominance throughout the story and it becomes this interesting conflict of these two young people who are basically trying to survive in different ways one is more survival of ego and the other one is like literal survival it s not hard to see parallels between the push by theodore mann s presidency in white trying to clamp down on superpowered black people and alleged voter restriction efforts currently happening in states all around the u s when asked about the relevance and timeliness of this story osajyefo argues that neither the first book or its sequel are timely that the story is simply following the arc of history for blacks in america we re not looking forward in order to tell the story we re looking at past history because the current voter restriction acts are no different than those that existed after the civil war where all of these laws were put into place in order to suppress black people he says that s not new so there s this looking back at that stuff and saying okay if america hasn t learned anything how would they react to a supernatural version of what we re experiencing right now and the answer is it s pretty self evident it s really about looking at a country that has yet to come to terms in a real way with its past behavior and so it continues to simply repeat it osajyefo admits that working on white took a similar emotional toll on him and his fellow co creators as did black i definitely took a big long break after writing it osajyefo says but i think it was a little less taxing than when we were doing black following that arc of the hero s journey but also the path of black struggles in america in black definitely took a little bit more out of us i think with white we were operating more in a present mindset so we were speaking more to things that are that are going on with also a hope for the future and leading into the third act of this osajyefo is not one to hold back from speaking his mind when asked if he has seen a discernible improvement in how the comics industry approaches representation in the wake of the black lives matter movement he replied in predictably blunt fashion i m gonna say not particularly no i think that we had some reflection from a lot of corporations and stuff like that you know following like george floyd s murder where there s a lot of charity there s a lot of surface changes but systemic that hasn t really changed that much and i don t know that the people who could make those changes actually have the lens to truly recognize or the motivation to really change it and that s not a dig at anybody osajyefo says i ve seen more change in terms of indie comics and independent publishers where you re seeing more of those changes happen in terms of equity and representation and you know inclusion of women and people of color and lgbtq he continues but i think when it comes to the major publishers there s still very much a lot of hey we ll tap you when we have a story that we want to get some pr for and that s fine i can t be mad at that there s still the system in place that favors people who favor the system itself that favors straight white men and it s one of those things where it s like you wish you could have more honest conversations about that with people without them feeling that you re attacking them as a longtime comics fan he s especially fond of the x men osajyefo seems to think he won t be getting a call from the house of ideas for a project anytime soon i ve not been ever offered an opportunity to do any work with them but i don t know that with my style and approach that that would ever be in their comfort zone anyway he admits and that s fine it doesn t mean that i can t enjoy them or that they can never call me it s just more like hey you know who i am and you know what i m going to do if i but i m fine to watch and read you know jonathan hickman really evolve the x men into something because i m a huge fan being a proud comics geek osajyefo knew he wanted to make the release of white something special and as someone who came of age as a fan in the 90s the golden age of collectible comics he made sure fans got a comic that was cool and collectible the kickstarter supporters who gave more than 40 000 to the white campaign received a special printing of all six issues of white printed with a special card stock cover and no ads through the book s publisher black mask studios a limited run of white about 2 500 copies were printed of its main cover and sent to comics shops this week what we wanted to do for people who are collectors and big fans of the book is just do a limited run so if you get it you have something that you can legitimately call a collector s item osajyefo says however because demand for the book was off the charts it sold out at the distributor s level more than 40 000 orders were reportedly put in which means a second printing of white is coming later this month so anyone interested in seeing the next chapter of the black saga play out will have that chance as for the in the works theatrical adaptation of black osajyefo could only offer a vague but optimistic update there is some very great movement and i am super excited about it but i can t talk about it he says but i will say that i m pretty happy with it i ve always had the approach of don t try to replicate the comic in the film that s not gonna work so just make a movie pick the elements that have meaning and make a movie because i think that s what has been marvel s secret sauce they didn t really go into like iron man and say we re going to literally tell this exact story from the comics no they just took these elements like who is tony stark and what s his struggle what s he going through then modernize it and make it fun and i think that s definitely what s going on with black the views and opinions expressed in this article are the author s and do not necessarily reflect those of syfy wire syfy or

how big is too big want this newsletter delivered to your inbox in god we trust in big tech we antitrust the largest expansion of the federal government s antitrust powers in generations american choice and innovation online act platform competition and opportunity act ending platform monopolies act augmenting compatibility and competition by enabling service switching act state antitrust enforcement venue act merger filing fee modernization act the situation in india what s important to note is that india doesn t actually have a law that can break up monopolistic companies preventing a dominant company from abusing its power ettech deals digest a quick look at the top deals of this week other big stories by our reporters the us government which is attempting the largest expansion of its antitrust powers in generations faced two setbacks in the battle to rein in big tech firms last week back home india s competition regulator has been investigating alleged anti competitive behaviour by amazon flipkart facebook and google for some time join us as we get into the weeds and suss out the differences in how the two countries view and treat market dominating companies the us government s efforts to rein in big tech firms facebook apple google amazon and to a lesser extent microsoft were all over the news last week on monday a us district court dismissed a complaint that the federal trade commission the country s antitrust regulator had filed against facebook late last year the ftc s complaint had sought to undo facebook s acquisitions of instagram and whatsapp alleging that the company had violated federal antitrust laws by buying up potential competitors in his decision the judge wrote that the ftc had not proven its primary claim that facebook wields monopoly power the ruling dealt a huge blow to the us government s antitrust case against facebook on tuesday things got even worse for the government democratic house majority leader steny hoyer said a package of six bills aimed at reining in big tech which had passed the committee level the previous week weren t ready for a vote in the full house his comments were an indication that the legislation might not have enough support to be signed into law the six bills which represent passed the house judiciary committee with rare bipartisan support but also faced opposition from members of both parties even once they re ready for the house floor the bills face an uphill challenge owing to opposition from centrist democrats who say some of them are too broad and could harm innovation tech companies and industry groups warned that four of the bills which targeted apple google amazon and facebook could end up destroying products that are popular with consumers here are the six landmark bills and what they aim to achieve this bill is meant to bar major tech firms from giving their own products preference over competitors on their platforms it also seeks to bar big platforms from using non public data to support their own platform it takes aim at amazon which has been found to be using data from third party sellers to create competing products and then placing them near the top of search results it would also force google to tweak its search algorithm so that its own products don t get preference over those of competitors this one would bar any platform with 50 million or more monthly active users in the us from holding more than 25 of a competitor s stock or profits with the aim of deterring them from buying out competitors facebook is clearly the primary target of this legislation the company has long been accused of doing whatever it takes to retain its hold on the social media market including copying buying or killing competing apps this bill would make it illegal for a dominant platform to create its own products or services to out compete sellers on its platform if passed the law could force amazon to stop selling private label brands and apple to stop pre installing certain apps such as pages keynote and numbers on iphones it could even threaten apple s entire app store businesses on the grounds that it is the only way for ios users to download apps on their devices and that apply takes a hefty cut of all purchases if all this sounds familiar it s because this legislation mirrors some of india s latest draft e commerce rules which call for similar restrictions on in house brands and seek to prevent large companies from selling on their own platforms through related parties the competition commission of india cci also launched an investigation in january 2020 over allegations that amazon and flipkart promoted certain sellers on their platforms and offered deep discounts that stifled competition on june 12 this year the karnataka high court dismissed amazon s and flipkart s pleas to cancel the cci s probe the access act is less controversial as it doesn t seek to carve up big tech firms rather its goal is to give users of platforms such as facebook and youtube more control over their personal data if passed it would let a whatsapp user for example to not just take their data with them if they choose to leave the platform but also continue to chat with friends and family members that use it it would be up to the platform to figure out a way to do this this one s somewhat of a meta law its goal is to stop big tech firms from shifting antitrust cases to courts they consider friendlier while also increasing the cost of litigation the purpose of this bill is to give the us government more resources 670 million to be precise to enforce antitrust laws it would also increase the fees that big tech firms need to pay for large transactions apart from amazon and flipkart whatsapp and google are also under investigation in india for alleged anti competitive practices on march 24 the cci ordered a probe into whatsapp s practices claiming the facebook owned platform s privacy policy update violated the provisions of the competition act on abuse of dominance it said that requiring users to share certain data with facebook seemed exploitative and could end up stifling competition and on june 22 cci ordered an investigation into allegations that google was restricting the development and use of alternate versions of android by making smart tv manufacturers sign restrictive agreements these agreements among other things require manufacturers to preinstall several google apps and deny access to the play store app to forked versions of android cci alleged that not allowing tv makers to choose which google apps they would like to preinstall was an unfair condition under the competition act in fact the competition act 2002 unlike its western counterparts isn t against monopolies at all rather it is aimed atto influence prices and control the market it also regulates combinations mergers and acquisitions that have the potential to adversely affect competition like the draconian monopolies and restrictive trade practices act 1969 that it replaced the competition act is riddled with loopholes and vague terminology that s open to many interpretations for instance dominant firms could justify anti competitive behaviour by claiming they are contributing to the country s economic development and when all else fails companies can always seek refuge in the morass of india s judicial system incidentally competition law is called antitrust law in the us and canada because these laws were originally written in the late 19th century to rein in large conglomerates formed

in the ancient world many cultures built elaborate temple complexes dedicated to their healer gods imhotep in egypt and asklepios in greece for example these gods were recognized as having the power to cure supplicants from a variety of ailments within sleep and sacred dreams those who desired healing might travel many hundreds of miles to reach such a temple working through periods of fasting and purification taking part in invocation rituals drinking water from holy mineral rich springs and observing a variety of other devotional customs before finally lying down upon a sacred skin called a kline in ancient greek from which we derive clinic to await a curative reverie this process was called incubation to lie upon spirit medicine you might describe a sleep temple as a sort of hospital for the spirit body although real life operations did also take place the sleep temple was primarily an infirmary for that ethereal aspect of our being that slips into unmanifested realms each night when we fall asleep sleep states and dream revelations were viewed as important indicators of health and dreams were seen as an opportunity for mortals to connect with higher divine energies capable of inspiring miraculous healing ruins of the asklepion in epidaurus jana_janina adobe stock does modern science reject the idea of a human being having a soul outright on the surface contemporary pharmaceutical medicine certainly does seem to have very little interest in matters of the spirit which was the tradition at the heart of the healing arts employed by our ancestors current scientific research does however validate the veracity of the placebo effect and the efficacy of therapeutic treatments aimed at the unconscious mind and autonomic nervous system such as hypnosis meditation the feldenkrais method and fasting state of mind clearly has a profound influence upon the physical health of any individual the proof of placebo power alone shows that belief and suggestion must sometimes unconsciously activate the body s natural maintenance system homeostasis these unconscious processes might be more readily available to a patient during a sleep state the placebo effect might actually become embedded during sleep when the climate for healing and regeneration is at an optimum and certain genes are switched on that are always switched off during waking hours dream incubation present within most of these sleep temples were elaborate systems of fasting dedication lustration purification ritual drama sensory deprivation or over stimulation invocation and dream interpretation these institutions prevailed for thousands of years so clearly the sleep temple methods were fruitful for many there are countless testimonies and votive offerings proclaiming successful treatment but how did they work would these old methods of dream incubation work today the practice of temple sleep is well evidenced in ancient egyptian greek and roman archaeology and literature i believe the practice of dream incubation reveals many secrets regarding the journey of human consciousness the evolution of memory and language the mind body connection the placebo effect and the unconscious mind s potent response to imagination story and symbolism what cosmic earthly and human forces have influenced the way we experience the relationship between the inner and outer worlds how might our perception have shifted since the days of sleep temples patients sleeping in the temple of aesculapius at epidaurus ernest board wellcome collection cc by 4 0 the evolution of sleep consciousness julian jaynes an american psychologist is best known for his controversial book the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind 1976 in this book he puts forward the theory that a cerebral shift from right to left brain dominance is the underlying determinative in the self awareness ego identity we experience as modern consciousness today the gradual erosion of the divide between the brain s left and right hemispheres due to the increasingly intellectual demands of new cultural activities such as language writing and city dwelling led to the consciousness of human beings becoming distinct from the rest of the animal kingdom self aware and uniquely imaginative another theory that i believe deserves closer study is that of the effect of geomagnetism on human consciousness and circadian rhythmicity the ancients of all advanced cultures spoke often of magnetic forces and geomancy earth magic these were critical factors in site selection modern geographical surveys of sleep temple sites often reveal interesting geological anomalies iron rich springs and caves we might conjecture that a person visiting such a sacrosanct location one full of chi or negative ions perhaps might very well get physically charged up by the invisible healthful energies ever present in the atmosphere the strength of the earth s magnetic field does fluctuate and it varies from one geographic location to another it was weak at its inception 3 5 billion years ago and according to archaeomagnetic data reached one of several peaks in intensity between 2500 bc and 500 bc it has shown an especially accelerated decline more recently did ancient peoples possess magnetoreception that is the ability to physically detect magnetic forces perhaps even see them as it is speculated migrating birds do biochemistry does show we potentially retain some of the necessary equipment for it we have cryptochromes light sensing ancient proteins in the human eye that are implicated in an evolutionarily old magnetic sense as well as the regulation of our daily rhythms it is known that the circadian clock which governs melatonin production and controls periods of rest and wakefulness is disrupted by magnetic anomalies and geomagnetic storms is it possible that humanity experienced a collective peak in consciousness as a result of cosmic magnetic activity in our distant past reconstruction of the interior altar and statue of temple of aesculapius at epidaurus cc by 4 0 asklepions much of the best evidence regarding the day to day goings on in sleep temples comes from ancient greece here asklepios was the presiding deity this handsome healer god always represented with a snake entwined staff was worshipped at many great sanctuaries known as asklepions throughout the ancient world including important centers at epidaurus kos athens and pergamon in modern day turkey asklepios was a key figure of greek mythology he was the son of the multi faceted and complicated god apollo and his mortal lover koronis legend tells us that apollo murdered koronis for infidelity she was pregnant with the child asklepios at the time it is sometimes hermes sometimes apollo himself that is credited with cutting the living child from koronis s womb atop the funeral pyre and saving the life of the greatest healer god of the greek pantheon asklepios was raised and trained in the healing arts by the centaur chiron but it was a supernatural encounter with a wise snake that was said to have charged asklepios with a supernaturally advanced healing ability sufficiently gifted to even bring a man back from the dead although this transgression cost asklepios his life zeus struck him dead with a thunderbolt although later according to roman era mythography at apollo s behest zeus set asklepios in the heavens and he became the constellation ophiuchus the serpent bearer sanctuary at epidaurus at epidaurus one of the most celebrated asklepions in the ancient greek world there was a large very rare chryselephantine made from ivory and gold sculpture of asklepios unfortunately just the base remains today architectural drawings show that the sculpture sat over a well which kept the ivory moist and prevented cracking chryselephantine creations were hugely expensive artistic endeavors and required frequent attention to preclude drying out a pious maintenance ritual of some significance in itself the colossal chryselephantine statue of zeus at olympia thought to have been plundered in the 5th century for its precious materials indicates the status enjoyed by asklepios statue of asclepius exhibited in the museum of epidaurus theatre michael f mehnert cc by sa 3 0 the snake entwined staff the rod of asklepios is still used as the symbol of medicine to this day and was pivotal to the cult of asklepios the healing sanctuaries were filled with living snakes moving freely throughout the sites a particular non venomous pan european rat snake was employed for temple duties snakes were considered sacred creatures demonstrating an ability to produce poison and antidote our word pharmacy derives from the ancient greek and combines remedy and poison another symbol of modern medicine which has the same ancient roots is the bowl of hygeia hygeia from which we have the word hygiene was asklepios s daughter and her symbol depicts a cup or chalice with a snake twined around its stem and poised above it this is the sign for pharmacies in many countries the rod of asclepius a symbol representing medicine and healthcare roman adobe stock snakes were seen by ancient people to return to youthfulness shed skin and regenerate they can re grow severed tails snakes have been worshipped since time immemorial and it is easy to see why they were considered to have special powers story and music another important consideration in understanding ancient consciousness and the potential power of the psyche over the physical body is the value of music ritual drama and enactment in the journey towards deep healing as the mystery schools of antiquity had their mythological pageants performances and initiation rituals so too did the sleep temples employ music and drama to make contact with the inner beings of their visitors at epidaurus there was an impressive amphitheater famed for its acoustics a later edition to the sanctuary was a large building called the thymele an impressive circular edifice with a subterranean labyrinthine structure that modern archaeoacoustic researchers now believe served to amplify musical performances the lyre seven stringed symbol of apollo who was also worshipped at epidaurus was an especially quiet instrument the superb craftsmanship of this building meant that even the most delicate lyre music could travel all over the sanctuary perhaps even enter dreams the medicine of music could permeate the very air the ancient greeks had a specific type of healing song the paean the paeans were performed by choruses in a circular formation the singers calling up the gods to hear the words of their hymns and attend to the needs of the afflicted scribes at epidaurus kept detailed records of the dreams and healing experiences of their patients these were called iamata the highest healing one could receive was a visit from asklepios himself these occurrences were diligently documented and displayed throughout the sanctuary almost as propaganda and advertising asklepios might come to you in a dream and perform some sort of psychic surgery often resulting in a totally spontaneous cure else a dream might suggest an available remedy or require interpretation from a temple priest the activities of the patient during waking hours were carefully designed so as to connect with the unconscious mind the soul the psyche when the time eventually came for the sacred sleep and it was the turn of the unconscious to dominate real healing could occur by this means through dreams one could truly come to know thyself and experience the divine eternity we all have within us when you enter the abode of the god which smells of incense you must be pure and thought is pure when you think with piety this was the inscription that greeted pilgrims who passed through the propylaia the main gate into the sanctuary of the god asklepios at ancient epidaurus if you spent a great deal of time adoring statues hero worshipping listening to angelic choruses and hypnotic lyre music wafting on the charged breezes if you found yourself silently inhabiting a carefully designed holy environment within which symbols and myth were deliberately enmeshed into every minutiae if you observed endless snakes had your wounds licked by temple dogs if you possessed a clear and absolute intention and desire to be visited by a god to whom you were utterly devoted and confident in this would doubtlessly manifest in dreams and dreams would come true women consulting aesculapius wellcome

bourbon wouldn t be bourbon without corn literally american law requires that any whiskey perched alongside the bottles of maker s mark and buffalo trace at the liquor store come from a mash that is at least fifty one percent corn with a remainder of barley wheat or rye so infusing the flavor of fresh corn into brown liquor made a sort of intuitive sense for chris spear the frederick maryland based chef and culinary instructor who writes the blog perfect little bites at first i thought i d just throw some corn into some bourbon and see if i could get the flavor i wanted he says after some trial and error he added a second step to the process dosing the whiskey with a little melted butter which leaves behind a tinge of flavor and a rich silky texture the corn infused whiskey is tasty on the rocks or with a cube of corn stock if you re simply looking to celebrate the season but if you re interested in a mixed drink that s as unique as its base spirit spear devised a mexican street corn inspired cocktail seasoned with lime juice and chili powder to showcase the infusion if you just mix a manhattan with the whiskey there s so much going on that you won t really taste the corn he says

a roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week none of these are legit even though they were shared widely on social media the associated press checked them out here are the facts posts mislead on delta variant data claim data from the u k s public health agency confirms that those who have been vaccinated against covid 19 are anywhere from two times to six times more likely to die from the delta variant than the unvaccinated the facts public health england s report did not show evidence that those who are vaccinated are more susceptible to dying from the coronavirus delta variant rather the data which was published june 18 shows the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the variant an instagram post falsely claimed the health agency s data showed vaccinated people were twice as likely to die from the delta variant than unvaccinated people another falsely claimed vaccinated people were six times more likely to die from a circulating variant like delta than are unvaccinated people one post used a table from the report to share the false claim but the post misrepresented the table s data while the table does address delta variant deaths it shows that among 60 624 confirmed cases of the variant between feb 1 and june 14 recorded deaths included 37 vaccinated people and 34 unvaccinated furthermore the table does not state the age group of those who died and whether they suffered from any additional illnesses experts say that means conclusions cannot be drawn about the role of vaccines in those deaths unless you account for these differences in age and population you really can t make the argument that vaccination confers a higher risk of death said dr nasia safdar an infectious disease physician at the university of wisconsin s school of medicine and public health the report notes that follow up is needed when examining the data on delta variant deaths because it is too early to provide a formal assessment of the case fatality of delta stratified by age compared to other variants the public health agency issued another report on june 25 that showed that no deaths had been recorded of patients under 50 who were infected with the delta variant and had received both doses of vaccine the data from the agency shows that two doses of the vaccines made by pfizer or astrazeneca are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant associated press writer beatrice dupuy in new york contributed this report viruses can evolve to be more deadly claim no virus has ever mutated to become more lethal as viruses mutate they become less lethal the facts as the spread of coronavirus variants raise new public health questions social media users are sharing misinformation about how viruses mutate a post on facebook reads in the history of virology there has never ever been a viral mutation that resulted in a virus that was more lethal as viruses mutate they become more contagious transmissible and less lethal but in fact there have been cases of viruses that mutated to become more deadly that claim as a whole is just nonsense said troy day a professor of mathematics and biology at queen s university in canada who has studied the ways infectious diseases including coronavirus can evolve some examples of viruses that became more deadly over time include those that developed drug resistant variants and animal viruses such as bird flu which were harmless to humans initially but then mutated to become capable of killing people according to dr amesh adalja a senior scholar at johns hopkins university s center for health security flu viruses have developed resistance to certain antivirals that make them more difficult to treat and therefore make them more deadly adalja said also noting the same has happened with hiv and certain hepatitis c strains while early scientific theories suggested that as viruses evolved they would become more contagious and less lethal to keep spreading over time the scientific community has acknowledged that s not always the case becoming more transmissible and less lethal are absolutely what s best for the pathogen said day but the problem is that it s not always possible and in many instances is never possible to be more transmissible and also less lethal day said there are documented cases of animal viruses that evolved over time to become more lethal including myxoma virus in rabbits and marek s disease in chicken some viruses provoke severe symptoms in their hosts that make it easier to transmit the virus to others but those same symptoms can wind up killing the hosts the virus speaking anthropomorphically just wants to spread and have its genes replicated said adalja if the best way for it is to spread by causing severe symptoms it will continue to do that associated press writer terrence fraser in new york contributed this report fake memo targets cold remedies amid spread of covid 19 variant claim information in a confidential memo from a professor at imperial college london shows that pharmaceutical companies are being told to stop manufacturing medicine for colds flu and hay fever and as of july pharmacists will not be allowed to sell them the facts the memo which has a subject line next steps permanent lockdown of the uk private confidential was fabricated according to officials at imperial college london pharmaceutical companies were not asked to stop making such medications nor will sales be halted the memo falsely claims

officials across the u k including in wales and northern ireland ferguson a former adviser to the u k government on its covid 19 response has spoken out about a possible third wave of covid 19

auto companies reported substantial sales increases for the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same time last year in spite of an ongoing worldwide microchip shortage which has idled much of the world s auto production some corporations have reported sales numbers that reveal a closing of the gap between post and pre pandemic production however wards intelligence an analytics firm which tracks auto sales shows us light vehicle sales were down last month with 1 3 million cars sold compared to 1 6 million in may of this year ford rouge plant in dearborn michigan the basis of the rebound in the auto industry has been levels of exploitation of autoworkers which are practically unprecedented at major auto plants throughout the country with the full support and collaboration of the united auto workers union forced overtime has become routine as companies scramble to make up for profits lost in the early stages of the pandemic meanwhile an unknown but no doubt massive number of workers have gotten sick and died of covid 19 inside the plants the human toll of this breakneck pace on autoworkers was expressed in a series of tragic deaths in detroit last week two autoworkers died of drug overdoses at stellantis warren truck assembly plant and warren stamping plant and a third worker died outside of the company s jefferson north assembly plant when she was struck by a train in the middle of the night leaving work the uaw announced this week that mask requirements would end later this month for vaccinated workers in us plants as part of its continuing collaboration with the auto companies to tear up what remains of coronavirus related restrictions justified by false claims by the biden administration that the pandemic which is still surging throughout the world is over toyota reported a sales increase of nearly 73 percent this past quarter compared to 2020 evs including hybrids made up nearly a quarter of total sales the company said toyota replaced general motors as the top selling automaker in the us for the second quarter of 2021 unlike the us based corporations toyota had a supply of the microchips on hand when the shortage first began to affect the auto industry but as the situation has dragged out it has also had to cut back production at its plants due to the lack of components cox automotive earlier predicted that ford s sales would be up by 20 5 percent compared to last year but still down 19 5 percent from the second quarter of 2019 however ford missed most predicted targets for the second quarter of 2021 increasing sales by only 9 6 percent its june 2021 sales fell by 26 9 percent compared to may 2021 with sales of its best selling f series pickups declining by nearly 30 percent ford s sales and production continue to be impacted by the chip shortage the company reported earlier this year that it expected to lose half of its projected second quarter production as a result of the lack of parts recently the company announced a slew of production cuts that will impact workers across its factories in the us canada and mexico over the next month of these ford chicago assembly plant will be impacted the most with all production shut down for four weeks beginning july 5 workers will have to apply for dwindling unemployment benefits through the state yet again many who have already been temporarily laid off this year due to the ongoing chip shortages stellantis formed out of a merger in january of psa group and fiat chrysler automobiles reported a 32 percent increase in second quarter sales compared to what the two parent corporations reported last year the increase was driven in large part by a 47 percent increase in dodge ram sales the most popular ram pickup truck the ram 1500 is built at its sterling heights assembly plant shap in michigan where autoworkers have been on forced overtime for the entire year stellantis executives have clearly made the decision to keep the plant running at full blast no matter the cost this breakneck pace continued throughout massive outbreaks of coronavirus inside the plant at one point in the spring more than 10 percent of the plant s nearly 8 000 workers were out on quarantine the uaw meanwhile has run damage control for the company by covering up the true extent of the spread shap is also one of the few major assembly plants never to have shut down or cut production due to the microchip shortage stellantis even shifted chips and manpower from idled plants such as warren truck which is now reopened to shap general motors gm reported sales increases over 40 percent for this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2020 down only 5 8 percent compared to 2019 sales of the chevrolet bolt ev built in orion township mi went up 31 percent and sales of its buick suv built in delta township mi went up 31 percent its chevrolet silverado truck built at its plant in silao mexico also picked up large numbers of sales similar to shap workers at gm s silao plant have faced grueling conditions including forced 12 hour shifts and covid 19 has infected and killed an unknown numbers of workers at the plant other major automotive corporations reported high sales increases compared to the previous quarter german auto giant volkswagen reported sales increased of 72 percent in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 and sold 5 756 evs last quarter up from 474 in the first quarter its stock price rose 1 3 percent after sales results were released thursday honda recorded an overall sales increase of about 64 percent compared to the same quarter last year the company also reported a record number of ev hybrid sales all electric carmaker tesla which reopened its plant in fremont california in defiance of stay at home orders in the state of california last year recorded record numbers of deliveries in the second quarter of 2021 according to refinitiv the company delivered 201 250 vehicles in total during the past quarter above its expected target of 200 258 vehicles tesla stock prices rose as high as 3 3 percent on friday morning and it has reportedly increased its vehicle prices in response to the chip shortage although it sells far fewer cars in comparison to its competitors the massive wealth of the company and its billionaire ceo elon musk rests in large part on speculative profits and is increasingly dependent on volatile cryptocurrency investments like its 1 5 billion bitcoin investment revealed in february the company s productive capacity is vulnerable to the supply of microchips and there is nervousness on wall street that its streak of prosperity could end if it relies heavily on cryptocurrency to shore up its financial profits while the auto companies no doubt had much to celebrate this week there can be no doubt that in corporate boardrooms and in uaw offices throughout the country there is intense anxiety that rebounding profits could be jeopardized by an eruption of struggles by autoworkers last year workers rejected a uaw corporate deal to keep plants running during the initial surge in the pandemic by carrying out wildcat strikes temporarily foiling this corporatist conspiracy and forcing a two month shutdown given the pressure cooker atmosphere inside the plants there is every reason for them to fear a renewed upsurge this is a central reason why the uaw has imposed an information blackout of the strike by volvo trucks workers in virginia upon the rest of its membership indeed the first reference to the strike on the uaw s website was published on thursday when the union announced a tentative agreement which it hopes will end the strike the uaw fears most of all that other autoworkers might follow the lead of the volvo workers rank and file committee which was founded to oppose the uaw s isolation and betrayal of their struggle by rebelling and forming committees of their own
