consumers going on holiday particularly to north america will notice an impact on exchange rates 5 000 will get you roughly 1 050 fewer dollars than you would have had at the end of may last year consumers going on holiday particularly to north america will notice an impact on exchange rates 5 000 will get you roughly 1 050 fewer dollars than you would have had at the end of may last year we ve become well used to price hikes with rampant inflation but last month was marked by tax hikes with the increase in national insurance contributions hitting the pockets of many employees as well as employers the attention now though is very firmly on interest rate hikes with the federal reserve having just delivered its first 0 5 per cent rate increase in 22 years with more to come as the fed seeks to tame inflation which is at 40 year high in the uk the bank of england s monetary policy committee mpc raised the bank rate to 1 per cent this month its fourth consecutive hike a first in the 25 years since it was granted independence as inflation is set for a 40 year high too three members of the committee wanted to see rates rise to 1 25 per cent and governor andrew bailey made clear that these hikes won t prevent inflation from rising further but judged they were needed to prevent it becoming entrenched the european central bank ecb also looks set to jump on the rate hiking bandwagon having indicated that it will start to raise some of its key interest rates in july and we re seeing movement all around the world indeed australia recently increased its key rate for the first since 2010 many will cry what the heck are they doing as interest rate hikes bring even more pain to consumers who are already suffering from steep price rises and rising taxes but as the bank of england governor indicated central banks need to do something and the context is that the price of money is still incredibly low by historical standards more mortgages are now also on fixed rate deals than during the last financial crisis so people are less exposed to the rises than they may have been in the past there is also an argument to be made that more pain now means less pain down the line in the form of a prolonged period of higher rates of inflation indeed central banks want to take the heat out of certain aspects of the economy but there is a balance to be struck as people fear that rate rises could engineer a recession many are referring back to what happened in the us in the 1980s then paul volcker who was chair of the us federal reserve and at 6 foot 7 inches arguably the tallest central banker in history cranked up the fed funds rate to 20 per cent in june 1981 he saw this as the only way to stem rampant inflation it worked but it led to a significant recession and us unemployment rose above 10 per cent as a result the current chair of the fed jerome powell is trying to do the opposite deal with inflation whilst engineering a soft landing history isn t on his side though in the last 50 years almost every time the fed started a series of rate increases it led to a recession however whilst history isn t on his side some of the current economic indicators perhaps are the labour market is in rude health and indeed some might say it s red hot with record levels of vacancies and unemployment very low these characteristics are also applicable to the uk and many other economies financial markets have been pencilling in several more rate hikes in the uk topping out at 2 5 per cent if that is to occur the boe reckons the uk economy will flirt with recession and a dip in output but in many respects the threat of recession should be a secondary perhaps even tertiary concern given the scale of the cost of living crisis personally i only expect one more interest rate rise possibly two and rishi sunak will undoubtedly have to unveil a significant package of measures to ease the evolving cost of living crisis whether or not we see a recession remains to be seen but the impact of the hike in interest rates and the expectation of more to follow have already had implications for financial markets in terms of equities and currencies in relation to equities the old investor adage is to sell in may and stay away until st leger s day in september but this year we may see investors coming back in may after the marked sell off in recent months global equity markets largely escaped when the pandemic took hold bar some initial falls equity markets have since soared as central banks around the world pumped trillions into the system at one point in 2020 the fed was effectively printing one million dollars per second last year was dubbed the everything rally from stock markets to crypto currencies and from property to second hand cars but stock markets and crypto currencies are all down year to date and wall street s s p 500 index has had its worst start to a year since 1939 20 per cenr below its record high in january meanwhile the tech heavy nasdaq is already in a bear market down 30 per cent from its peak last november rising interest rates are basically calling time on this remarkable era of cheap money when the cost of money was almost at zero speculation was rife and investor appetite struggled to be satisfied aggressively raising interest rates coupled with fears of a global recession has popped that bubble all of this has implications for everybody around the world through for instance pension funds consumers going on holiday particularly to north america will also notice that there has also been an impact on exchange rates given that the fed is expected to raise interest rates by more than the ecb and the boe the dollar has soared conversely sterling has slumped last may the sterling to dollar exchange rate hit a high of 1 42 whereas it has recently hit 1 21 so 5 000 for a holiday in the us you will get roughly 1 050 fewer dollars than you would have had at the end of may last year interest rates are back at where they were 13 years ago but the currency isn t the summer of 2009 saw sterling just shy of 1 70 but today 5 000 would yield 2 450 fewer dollars again consumers are impacted by interest rate rises in the form of the price of petrol oil is priced in dollars but is purchased with sterling so as the value of the pound goes down all things being equal the price of oil goes up from a currency perspective as a result on march 8 it hit a record high of almost 98 per barrel the appreciation in the dollar and rising interest rates are also bad news for many lower income countries around the world indeed there s talk of an emerging debt crisis not only are countries in africa and the middle east impacted by soaring food and energy costs the cost of the debt that they loaded up on over the past decade when the price of borrowing was so low has surged due to significant parts of this being priced in dollars and linked to us interest rates all of this means that there is an expectation that poverty rates globally will surge northern ireland poverty rates will surge to given the cost of living crisis indeed last week niser stated that 43 000 households in northern ireland will see their food and energy bills rise above their disposable incomes clearly things are going to get worse and politicians need to get to grips with it sooner rather than later in this environment it will become increasingly untenable for northern ireland s politicians to remain out of power and not head for the hill richard ramsey is northern ireland chief economist at ulster bank next week brendan mulgrew

denver there s a funny thing about dreams they can be so close and yet so far away for about a year nache emanuel s dream has been to own a home she s applied for loans gotten her credit up gotten a certificate for taking a home buying class from the colorado housing and finance authority and more emanuel wants to live in the community she grew up in and where she currently works as a childcare provider yet she can t seem to grasp that dream every time emanuel puts a bid on a home she s outbid by people with more buying power than her it may have been like 5 000 10 000 over the amount sometimes there was even a couple of homes that were over 25 000 or 30 000 over the amount of what i had qualified for emanuel said i m not sure about just having 50 000 laying around or anything like that in a thick worn looking orange folder emanual has documented her entire journey since she started looking for a home last year in it there s a copy of that chfa certificate she received notes about the homes she s lost out on her loan paperwork and even notes about her feelings each time she falls in love with a house and each time she loses out on owning it i want to say i ve tried on at least 20 homes at least 20 homes and i have not got one yes not yet emanual said the struggle to buy a home is by no means unique across the state thousands of families are trying to do the same thing and thousands are losing out on that opportunity in an effort to help this year colorado lawmakers passed a package of bills aimed at spending 400 million on affordable housing the money which came to the state through the american rescue plan act would offer loans and grants to build more housing and would support modular housing companies another bill is aimed at helping middle income families by creating the middle income housing authority in the state it s to make sure that the folks that are just earning an average wage here your nurses your teachers or firefighters that they can afford to live in the communities where they work said sen jeff bridges d arapahoe the newly passed bill s co sponsor the goal of the program is to create incentives for private investors to create and maintain housing for families making between 80 and 120 percent of the area s median income it would use municipal bonds that are tax free to create a market incentive for developers nonprofits housing authorities local governments and more to create housing for those families the cost of housing has gone up so much that the average colorado family can t afford the average colorado house bridges said the middle income housing authority would have the power to issue bonds for affordable rental housing projects enter into public private partnerships for affordable rental housing projects provide assistance to tenants to transition to home ownership and more meanwhile the federal government announced monday its own housing supply action plan to help close the housing supply gap in five years among other things the biden administration s plan calls for rewarding areas that have reformed their zoning and land use policies develop financing mechanisms to build and preserve more housing support more modular housing construction making loans more widely available for affordable multifamily housing development and preservation ensuring that government owned homes go to people who will actually live in them work with the private sector on addressing supply chain issues the move is just the latest step by president joe biden to begin to rein in inflation in the country something he said was one of his top priorities in a speech last week the need for more affordable homes is something kinsey hasstedt knows a lot about she is the state and local policy director for enterprise community partners and last year she was part of a state organized working group tasked with taking a closer look at the lack of affordable housing in colorado to come up with solutions we have seen a huge drop off in the production of new affordable homes and we haven t been able to preserve current affordability in places that it exists hasstedt said one of the biggest issues she s noticed is a lack of public investments in affordable housing for years something she says other states have simply been doing better than colorado i think what we see at the bottom of it is a need to produce and preserve meaningfully affordable homes all along the housing continuum including rental and for sale homes and making sure that folks are able to get into and stay into those units hasstedt said her group helped craft some of the bipartisan housing legislation that passed this year she s excited about the biden administration s announcement as well saying that while the change may not be immediate it could be meaningful hasstedt hopes it will help close the surplus gap not only in colorado but across the country as for emanuel despite the hurdles she s trying to stay positive determined to find a home of her very own in a difficult housing market she hopes this journey will inspire her four kids to continue to pursue their dreams no matter the obstacles i want to be able to have that generational wealth the american dream that everybody talks about but right now it just seems like that dream is really out of reach emanuel said i want them to be able to see that hey if my mom can do it i could do it as well

the phones and fax machine at david scheidt s company lit up over the weekend with calls and requests from frantic military moms searching for baby formula military medical supplies provides formula under a contract with tricare the defense department s health program to roughly 200 families whose infants have dietary needs as determined by a doctor that preclude them from using breast milk or require specialty formulas such as those formulated for feeding tubes or digestion issues but a facebook post that went viral on military spouse sites over the weekend said tricare will now pay to have shipped directly to you due to the baby formula shortage the post included a form used by military medical supplies that requires a pediatrician s signature but only touched on that requirement and in the midst of desperately low formula stocks nationwide the message was quickly traded between new military parents screenshot taken may 16 2022 from a facebook group for military spouses read next man killed outside of new boston space force station in shooting involving military contractor the post is only partly true tricare does cover formula for some beneficiaries but only under a doctor s order the shortage has put everyone in a panic unfortunately it seems like everyone now is trying to find an alternative way to get formula scheidt said in a phone interview monday with military com tricare covers nutrition costs for food considered to be medically necessary including standard formula for children or adults who have feeding tubes or otherwise can t consume solid foods high protein formula for infants on ketogenic diets to control seizures and special formulas for those who can t digest certain things but to receive tricare covered formula families must provide clinical notes and have a pediatrician sign off on the order according to scheidt and others familiar with the benefit we were really caught off guard here because we don t advertise or anything of that nature scheidt said baby formula had been in short supply at the start of the coronavirus pandemic when parents stockpiled it during lockdowns ongoing supply chain issues have only exacerbated the problem but in february abbott nutrition maker of similac and other powdered formulas recalled its products after bacterial contamination at its sturgis michigan manufacturing facility sickened three babies and contributed to the death of a fourth now roughly 40 of the stock of baby formula has dried up nationwide at the department of defense current stock levels in domestic commissaries is at 50 while commissaries overseas and in remote areas are a little better off stocked at roughly 70 pentagon spokesman john kirby said monday we re not immune to the same supply chain problems as families across america kirby said during a press briefing when asked by military com about the shortage we re working our way through this very very hard president joe biden spoke with formula manufacturers and retailers last week to discuss the shortages and identify the production and transportation hurdles that are standing in the way of stocked shelves according to a white house official monday the executive branch is in talks with manufacturers reckitt abbott nestle gerber and perrigo as well as retailers such as target amazon walmart and others to determine where supplies may be critically low and how they can bolster them we are also contacting suppliers to infant formula manufacturers to inform them that their materials are critical for boosting u s infant formula production and encouraging them to prioritize their production and delivery the official said scheidt said even his regular customers are seeing the effects of the shortage with shipments delayed by several weeks we are still facing supply issues as well just because of manufactured back orders so it can be anywhere from three to four weeks before they even get formula scheidt said many of the services exchanges also carry baby formula and are taking steps to safeguard the supply according to officials with the retail stores the army and air force exchange service has placed a five canister limit on purchases of similac enfamil and nutramigen according to a spokesman and is taking steps to procure formula by other manufacturers the exchange remains fully focused on maximizing supplier allocations as industry wide production distribution and recall challenges continue in the interim the advises parents to contact their child s healthcare provider for recommendations on changing feeding practices aafes senior public affairs manager chris ward said in an email monday navy exchange service command told military times last week that it has placed special orders for baby formula in an effort to build up inventory in distribution centers and stores we have also been aggressively activating brands and sizes not typically found in our previous baby formula assortment in an attempt to meet the demand nexcom spokeswoman kristine sturkie said for parents scrambling to find their usual formula for their children and who aren t able to breastfeed the fda offers several recommendations and warnings for feeding their babies according to the fda s website parents should contact the baby s pediatrician for recommendations on changing their formula or feeding practices the fda advises against making homemade formula which may not have the nutrition necessary for developing babies and it recommends against diluting infant formula which also can cause nutritional imbalances the agency also cautions against purchasing formula online as it may be counterfeit families using the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children should check with their local or overseas office to see whether they have access to additional supplies as well kirby said the dod is doing everything in its power to ensure that military families have access to formula the defense commissary agency is already ahead of that problem and is doing everything they can to keep the shelves stocked kirby said pentagon reporter travis tritten contributed to this

a survey by the federal reserve bank of dallas provides some insight example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video texas usa lately we have been hearing that old cliché pain at the pump more times than we would probably care to the phrase is sometimes overused but it is also true prices have been painful so when might we get relief for that pain at the pump keep an eye on oil according to the american petroleum institute at least 59 of the cost of gasoline comes from oil oil prices globally have been up by a lot what oil industry insiders are saying producing more oil could help bring down its price and thus possibly lower the price of gasoline will we see a significant increase in oil production for six years the federal reserve bank of dallas has been surveying many oil and gas producers exploration firms and oilfield services firms in the most recent questionnaire respondents said their costs to find and develop oil is at the highest point since the federal reserve bank of dallas started asking them the dallas fed asked how much money the firms need to make per barrel to break even on an existing well or to drill a new well there was a wide range of estimates for different drilling regions but let s look at the averages across all the drilling areas respondents said they need an average of 20 something to 30 something dollars per barrel to cover their operating costs on existing wells and 40 something to 60 something bucks a barrel for new wells to break even oil has been selling for a lot more than that so it s not surprising that energy executives reported more activity in their businesses than in previous surveys but why aren t come of the companies expanding even more to meet surging demand in the survey some companies complain about shortages of equipment and available workers pressure that might prevent the production of a lot more oil many oil producers and their investors have been burned before when prices plummeted even though oil prices are high right now the dallas fed reports that in its survey of energy industry executives the majority 59 believe investor pressure to maintain capital discipline is the primary reason that publicly traded oil producers are restraining growth despite high oil prices indeed not spending a lot of extra money to vastly increase capacity while continuing to take advantage of high oil prices might lead to high profits and happy shareholders but that would still leave the world thirsty for more oil expectations through 2022 the dallas fed asked producers by what percent they expect their crude oil production to change from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022 half of the big companies responded that they either plan to not increase production at all or to just increase production slightly 0 to 5 smaller oil companies plan to increase production more aggressively by the end of 2022 34 of them plan to ramp up production by 10 to 30 and 23 of small producers plan to increase their oil production by more than 30 when they were all asked what they expect the price of oil to be by the end of the year the average guess made by the oil producing executives was 93 26 that would be about 10 less than the 103 07 per barrel at the time they were surveyed that wouldn t be a tremendous decrease but might help to eventually drive down gasoline prices a little texas still the epicenter of u s oil production last year oil producers in texas pulled 1 741 444 000 barrels of oil out of the ground that was 43 of all the oil produced in the entire u s

and so we come to commencement that glorious moment of achievement when a high school or college graduate will be awarded a hard earned diploma and venture into a complex world full of promise and fright uh huh except for over 40 million young americans who are saddled with a collective debt of well over 1 5 trillion and who are being blamed by conservatives like roy exum for having made hasty immature decisions to rack up so much debt in the first place now i have never read or heard mr exum s personal stance on this issue and i don t want to be presumptuous in that regard but i have yet to see any conservative who did not take a hardline stance against student debt forgiveness but consider young people fresh out of high school are among the most financially naïve people in our society yet predatory loan sharks both in our government and the private sector made available to them loans of limitless amounts regardless of their ability to pay them back in a timely fashion but those predatory agencies are not being held accountable in any way they acted and still are acting very much like the crooked banksters who intentionally loaned out money to credit unworthy people during the housing bubble which led directly to the crash of the stock market and the recession of 08 and who got bailed out even though their actions were deliberate and self serving those banskters and wall street shysters not only did they get bailed out they handed out fat bonuses to their ceos and who came to the rescue of the 5 million homeowners who were upside down on their mortgages or who lost their homes altogether nobody obama said he would but he failed to deliver as he only verbally slapped the wrists of those who were doling out bonuses with tax payer money and consider this i am 72 when i went to college a state university i was able to afford it by working a full time job in the summer and a part time job of no more than 15 hours per week during the school year i paid for everything tuition books lodging and meals and came out with zero debt plus pell grants were rather easy to come by even into the early 1990s that is as it should be but college tuition over the years has risen exponentially to such a degree that the students from low income families cannot afford it even by working in addition to going to school and pell grants have become extremely rare and not nearly adequate to cover the overall costs and while college costs have risen the pay rate for low income workers has been stagnant for decades lagging far behind ever increasing inflation and finally consider this that 1 5 trillion dollars of debt is keeping over 40 million young people from contributing anything meaningful to our society and our economy as they are unable to buy a home start a business or do anything but play the role of an indentured servant they are having to devote the vast majority of their time to paying off a debt so large that many of them will be a lifetime paying it off that debt is not just a drain on them it is a drain on our entire economy notice that conservatives don t bat an eyelash when it comes to our government doling out relief money or bailout money or huge annual subsidies to corporate monopolies and billionaires but when it comes to government doing anything whatsoever for the benefit of the people who desperately need some assistance they scream like a stuck pig and yell socialism or communism go figure but such is the nature of an oligarchy in which the rich make the rules for their own benefit and have the audacity to say that anyone who does not aspire to their level of greed is a loser and a slacker rick armstrong so conservatives never help lower and middle income families obtain an advanced degree well rick have you ever heard of the tennessee promise program maybe this will help what is tennessee promise tennessee promise is a scholarship mentoring and community service program that began fall semester 2015 it provides students a last dollar scholarship meaning the tennessee promise will cover tuition and fees not covered by the pell grant the hope scholarship or tsaa funds the promise was passed in 2015 by an overwhelmingly republican legislature and signed by a republican governor i would point out that this is a last dollar scholarship which basically pays for everything there is no reason any student in tennessee cannot obtain at least an associates degree and find a well paying job and many scholarships are available for these grads if they want to obtain a ba or bs the government and their academic supporters have a great scam going you actually mentioned it when you stated college costs have risen exponentially in your letter academia increase costs especially salary and the government guarantees loans to these unsuspecting high school grads who then borrow 100 000 to get a degree in some worthless liberal arts program then they are shocked when they graduate and either can t find a job or get one paying half of what the students who used the promise program to learn how to do something make with no student debt harvard paid elizabeth warren 400 000 over a two year period to teach one class a semester this is a woman who has never had a real job in her life leaching off of academia and government i will have to say i agree with you 100 percent about both parties letting the wall street banks get off after the financial crisis banks are just legalized mafia doug jones ooltewah student loan debt and student loan crisis has been in the news for several years and has been very much a topic of conversation during the biden administration i agree with the financial analysis of mr armstrong and am glad mr jones shot holes in his cheap shot at republicans given the vast amount of publicity and discussion surrounding the student loans i expect that the student loan industry should all but die off going forward with all the newly informed young people that qualify to attend an institution of higher learning surely with all the publicity these high level high achieving students will read and comprehend the loan agreement if they are still considering using a loan for attending a university and perform a basic financial risk reward analysis put simply if your job prospects don t pay enough to repay the loan in addition to everything else you would like spend your future earnings on don t take the loan if you do accept the loan then you are obligated to repay it according to the terms of the agreement the stupid tax is a real thing michael craig some of the institutions peddling student loans are certainly predatory let us not pretend that most high school students are in a position to fully understand the sort of obligation that they are being pushed and or cajoled into when they sign that dotted line this is done by people with a financial interest in sealing the deal but no accountability for the end result they have a conflict of interest add the fact that many of these young people are living close to the edge financially and they have loan officers and sometimes financial advisors telling them it is perfectly acceptable to borrow more money than they need for tuition and books this is common practice in recent years some lenders have settled multi billion dollar lawsuits regarding unfair practices one in particular made loans to people very likely to default because they knew the government would pay if the borrowers didn t they also made loans for students to attend institutions they knew to be inflating graduation rates and job placement rates this is a complex issue i don t profess to have a perfect solution but if we allow education to be dependent upon means we aren t going to like the results likewise if we do not protect students from being the latest crop for wall street to consume we all lose student loans should not have been a replacement for pell grants and other need based financial aid but that has become the situation at the very least there should be robust oversight and fair terms for these loans no person should pay on a loan for years only to find that they owe more than the original loan amount college has become another way for banks and other financial institutions to take advantage we should all have an interest in making education attainable for those who desire it and work toward it if individuals should be held accountable for their financial obligations that should mean all individuals not just those with student loan debt and not just average joes this should extend to banks and other financial institutions automakers oil companies tobacco companies and all others deemed too big to fail corporate welfare comes from taxpayer money and i would venture to say that it costs us a whole lot more than people defaulting on student loans where was the call for accountability when corporate america fleeced the covid relief funds and used the money for feathering their nests to the detriment of average americans where is it now when they continue to artificially inflate prices while people live without necessities spare me the righteous indignation it rings very hollow darlene kilgore take money from hard working responsible taxpayers and give it to people who make poor choices may make sense to liberals but not to me steve campbell

executive officer and director and justin blanchet chief financial officer i would also like to remind everyone that after the remarks from management the call will be followed by a q a session as we will be making forward looking statements during the call please refer to the cautionary notes and the risk disclosure in our md a and slide 2 of the webcast presentation also please bear in mind that all dollar amounts mentioned in the conference call are in the united state dollars unless otherwise noted now i ll turn it over to john to provide you with an overview john lewins thank you david and welcome everyone in the first quarter we delivered strong operational performance and continued to significantly strengthen our financial position with a record cash balance record revenue and also low all in sustaining and cash costs the mining process plant performed well achieving a second consecutive quarter of stage 2 run rate and we certainly seen a compression of our unit costs as a result in the latter part of the quarter we also benefited from a progressive leaving over covid 19 restrictions and that s continued into this quarter lastly we continue to progress with our organic growth delivering an excellent kora resource update and also a maiden resource at judd in addition we reported some very exciting drilling results of kora site and judd site showing that the known system still has an enormous potential on the safety front we recorded one loss time injury during the quarter and on a year to year basis loss kind of injury frequency rate continues to trend downward and we re very proud have the best safety records and the australasia region and we continue to have that strong focus on occupational health and safety and look to continuously improve our safety systems on esg i m pleased to report that earlier this year we approved a significant increase year on year approximately 100 on our community development budget that covers a wide range of initiatives which includes but not limited to investment and transport infrastructure health care education agriculture regional commerce and supporting infrastructure iâ ve just returned from papua new guinea and iâ m really pleased to see how we are progressing with those various programs also while i was in png it was pleasing to see k92 receive recognition in the national newspaper highlighting the positive impact that k92 growth is having on local landowner joint ventures and we re pleased to really have received that recognition but also that the stage 2a and stage 3 expansions we re going to see even more benefits to the community iâ d also like to highlight that k92 has placed a major focus on the greenhouse gas emissions for its esg reporting the 2021 emission inventory ttfb gap analysis is well underway now and a greenhouse gas emission forecast for the stage 3 and stage 3a expansions is also being completed alongside our studies k92 is very green mine the carbon intensity is a fraction of the global average per ounce and from these projects will look to improve their disclosure reduce our carbon footprint and develop a carbon targets going forward for further information on our esg activities i d recommend reviewing our latest esg report which is found on our website and we re certainly very proud of the positive impact that k92 has had we believe in png so moving on to operational performance during the quarter we produced 28 188 ounces of gold equivalent and we processed just under 100 000 tonnes at a high grade of 9 7 grams per tonne gold equivalent compared to q1 2021 mill throughput in production increased 36 and 49 respectively i think a major positive continues to be strong performance of the mill in march record average mill throughput was achieved of 1 219 tonnes per day on average that s about 10 above stage 2 run rate and importantly 45 of the dayâ s quarter or above 1 300 tonnes per day what makes it performance even more impressive is that we ve not yet installed the additional secondary crusher flotation cells for the stage 2a expansion in terms of the key operation quarterly physicals near record mill throughput and total material mined was achieved and development was comparable to the prior quarter i think it s important to highlight the strong performance was achieved during the covid 19 omicron wave which came through png during the quarter and that did result in some short staffing and absenteeism covid has been affected now for two years for the whole industry since really the first quarter in 2021 and i m really proud of our team on site has continued to push ahead and deliver the strong results that we are reporting again today i m also pleased to report that our control measures once again held up during that wave and in the latter part of the quarter as i mentioned we ve been able to start easing our covid 19 restrictions so we no longer require quarantine of any or incoming personnel and obviously it results in a significant cost saving and improvement in the productivity of our personnel and mitigation systems continue to remain vigilant through testing screening procedures additional medical personnel on site and multi temperature checkpoints around the site and camp and obviously a focus on hygiene we currently have no confirmed covid 19 cases on site i think in terms of 2022 it s important to remind investors that our guidance is based on the second half of the year being stronger than the first half driven primarily by higher throughputs rates for the commissioning of various components of stage 2 pension and some of the sequencing i ll now turn the call over to our chief financial officer justin blanchet to discuss the financial results for the first quarter justin blanchet thank you john and hello everyone during the first quarter we had revenue of 52 4 million a 78 increase from prior year we sold 26 471 gold ounces at an average price of 1 769 compared to 21 879 ounces at an average price of 1 735 in the prior year as of march 31 2022 there are 4 848 gold ounces in inventory including both concentrate and dorã a decrease of 2 299 gold ounces when compared to december 31 due to timing of sales cost of sales was 22 5 million compared to 20 9 million in the prior year or 17 7 million compared to 17 1 million when you exclude non cash items the increase can be attributed to an increase in operational activity as we mined 100 124 tonnes as compared to 55 883 tonnes in q1 2021 meaning on a per tonne basis costs are lower than prior year q1 2022 cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was 22 7 million compared to 7 7 million in the prior year as of march 31 2022 we had 79 9 million in cash and cash equivalents while spending 9 million in expansion capital for the quarter and having our strongest working capital balance to date of 92 1 million the company has no debt on the balance sheet as john mentioned during the first quarter the kainantu gold operations produce 24 152 ounces of gold 1 524 827 pounds of copper and 28 142 ounces of silver or 28 188 ounces of gold equivalent we sold 26 471 ounces of gold 1 247 967 pounds of copper and 24 899 ounces of silver or 29 798 ounces gold equivalent we incurred a cash cost of 536 and an all in sustaining costs of 788 per gold ounce which was significantly below our selling price of 1 769 per ounce our q1 2022 cash cost per ounce decreased to 536 from 745 in the prior year the decrease in cash costs was primarily due to the successful ramp up of the 400k expansion allowing the company to achieve better economies of scale and a 21 increase in gold ounces sold it s important to note that after commissioning the stage 2 plant expansion in late third quarter 2021 we have seen a significant compression in our total unit cost per tonne processed we continue to see downward pressure on costs via economies of scale as operations ramp up i will now turn the call back to john to continue with the rest of the presentation john lewins well thanks justin for the exploration growth section of the call we will begin with kainantu s production growth strategy stage 2 expansion 400 000 tonnes per annum achieved third quarter of 2021 and stage 2a expansion which takes us up to 500 000 tonnes ramped up 25 increase is well underway we re also advancing the stage 3 expansion which will increase our throughput to 1 2 million tonnes per annum through a separate standalone plant with a feasibility study on that plant to later this quarter early next quarter that feasibility study will also look at a pea case where we have a quite different project scenario with both the stage 3 and the stage 2a plants operating in parallel stage 2 capital cost as we ve previously said it s low 2 5 million and that s really for the some additional ancillary items around the plant increased underground mining rates are achieved through accelerating some of our stage 3 sustaining capital so at the plant filter press operational the additional tc 1000 is on site flotation tanks are planned to be installed and commissioned second half of this year i d say based on the strong performance we ve seen from the plant today we will actually be looking to gradually increase our mining rates and our processing rates throughout the balance of the year so actually ahead of when we actually commissioned those floatation plants now from stage 2a we obviously expect to get a meaningful boost in terms of our free cash flow generation which further strengthens our ability to self fund our growth last week while i was on site i had the opportunity to tour multiple areas of the operation and i m pleased to be able to share some of those with you on the call today while underground i got to see the immediate positive impact that we re having from the latest equipment that we ve had delivered which includes a new jumbo loader and truck and jumbo arriving late in q1 and the truck and loader arriving in q2 now significant amount of additional equipment is also scheduled to arrive in the near term as we ramped up towards that 2a and that includes another jumbo and other loader truck shotcrete machine and as you track as i think you previously noted in this presentation second half of the year is expected to be the strongest in terms of production as we ramp up that additional equipment and also with the scheduling of the stops that we have now since commencing production we ve also had to have a considerable focus on training and i m pleased that in k92 one of the things that we ve been able to do is set up state of the art training simulators now these simulators have exactly the same controls and display as you would see in practice underground and you can see that from the two photos here with a photo on the left showing our training superintendent operating the simulator on the surface on the photo on the right is actually one of our miners operating at tele remodel order underground our investment in training is also an investment in our communities and through that we generated long term highly skilled workforce which is obviously key for us as well in our expansions going forward so this is very very much a win win type situation thanks to the mining fleet we re also upgrading our maintenance capabilities and infrastructure at the mine portal the large structure with that green blue roof that is our new workshop under construction we expect to be commissioning it in the next quarter and that will obviously increase our capability and our productivity on the maintenance front plant wise one of the other developments as you can see here is that we are producing gold already on site we have approval now to export our gold from the bank of png so that means that the dorã that we produced last quarter and this quarter will not be sold in in q2 and the video here obviously shows one of the points that was able to attend last week with that export license granted we ll be ramping up our gravity circuit and we expect to see an improvement in overall payability and recoveries while on site the mining team achieved another record which this time was the largest single stope blast 7740 times now that blast utilized electronic precision detonators that we ve recently introduced into our blast practices performed extremely well excellent fragmentation and coming out to the site and as you can see they re executing these large blasts will also provide a considerable boost to the mining cycle efficiencies also while underground went into the judd system and we continue to make solid progress there i visited a new third sub level which is a top 85 level and this particular face delivered significant grade and thickness 5 2 meters 13 8 grams per tonne gold 2 3 copper so at 17 grams per tonne gold equivalent as some would probably know the mineralization actually continued into the well so that particular area was actually slightly wider than that not the twin incline furthest incline is now 1112 meters as of end of april performance of development crew has actually been strong over the last three quarters between incline advanced exceeding budget by around 10 the incline as you may recall being a six by six and a half and a five by five and a half have been designed well beyond our requirements for stage 3 looking at a stage 4 stage 5 goes beyond that capability of around 5 million tonnes private if we install conveyors on exploration during the quarter drilling was underway at kora kora south judd judd south also the blue lake porphyry blue lake porphyry drilling program has now been completed just pulling in the last results and compiling all that word into the report which will be out shortly now kora and kora south as you can see alongside sections here there are three key areas like of our focus two of those are short term one is a sort of a medium term so short term drilling core aside from the surface you can see from this long section and absolutely no drilling in that area previously one hole reported so far which was the hole that we reported last quarter and that hole reported one of the most significant exploration results we ve seen since that discovery all in kora north in 2017 second area of focus is drilling kora south from underground now that will obviously tie in with what we re doing from the surface and help improve our overall knowledge and understanding of kora south and obviously look to expand our results to the south as we drilled that we got a drill set up right now at the very end of our 1 200 level and we expect in the second half of the year start again pushing further to the size on the five levels and actually enabling us to continue to drill further to the south by underground as well third area of focus is what we would call kora deeps and the northern strike extension which will be drilled from the twin incline as we get in closer to the kora resource so that s really looking at towards the end of this year if you look at the judd judd south vein system exploration program very much following along similar lines to what we have at kora with i guess the distinction that judd is really about three years behind kora when you think about it kora north discovery in may 2017 judd first high grade results reported q4 2020 so drilling judd side from the surface currently underway as is drilling judd from underground and then within the mining lease the majority of our underground rigs are actually focused on drilling judd in the mining lease and expanding that that resource in the mining lease while i was on site had the opportunity to get on the ground and above the ground obviously as you can see from this chopper video add to our exploration that is underway in kora and judd site starting here with the drill rig which is further to the south that s about 530 metres beyond the mining lease so the rig is one of our contractor rigs and this is the first hole that s been drilled from that drill pad and coming back second rig 270 meters along strike from the mining lease that this rig is owned and operated by k92 this is one of our two surface rigs and as i think some of you are aware over the years we ve invested significantly in drill rigs all of the underground rigs are owned by k92 and two of the three surface rigs and then lastly we re coming up to the third rig working on surface 133 meters from the mining lease also owned and operated by k92 so we have expanded this program from one rig to two rigs and now to three rigs we ve done that in a relatively short period and that has been an excellent outcome from our exploration team on the ground so we re going to be continuing to drill this area all of this year and well into next year so lastly we conclude with our regional advanced mobilemt deep penetrating airborne geophysics results flown late in q4 2021 and these results really have been extremely significant in terms of recognizing the exploration upside of our project the high connectivity on it you can see delineated extends from kora and judd belong kora judd side into what we call the a1 porphyry interpreted a1 porphyry but importantly it extends beyond that to the south with a strike length of something like five meters so that whole area to the south is being integrated into our exploration plans for next year i think the geophysics also identified a prospective porphyry belt and that correlates well with non targets in a1 and also blue lake and as noted earlier phase 2 drill program and blue lake is completed with processing and compiling that data right around geophysics as you can see they have shown a very strong response in a1 even stronger than that weâ ve seen at blue lake and that makes it a high priority target for us in the near term and we plan to commence surface sampling program a1 later this year ahead of the drilling program so then operator i d like to commence the q a session thank you question and answer session operator thank you our first question comes from chris thompson of pi financial please go ahead chris thompson hi good morning guys congratulations on a really really strong quarter just a quick question john can you give us a sense of timing when you guys are going to be delivering the pea and the feasibility study are we looking at later this quarter or maybe early next quarter john lewins yes thanks chris yes in terms of the dts and a pea it s either late this quarter or very early next quarter and we re going to put them both out at the same time so originally the plan was to get the dfs out first and then the pea but bringing them both together just gives us a little bit more work that we need to get finished so it d be very late this quarter early next quarter chris thompson great and i guess the next question just to find on the largest what about the mining lease renewal can you give us a little update on that john lewins mining lease renewal okay so the mining lease as i think you re aware is it actually runs through until late 2024 we actually submitted an application for renewal earlier this year that has gone through the process with the mra and we ve had the wardenâ s hearings last month late last month which is timing wise is actually one of the quickest we ve seen it get organized with that we now have as i think many people will be aware we now have elections in png the roots have been issued which means you ve got a government that s on caretaker mode so we won t we don t believe that we can get a renewal until the elections are finished and the new government is established although i did meet with the md of the mra last week and it ll still go through their process they ll go through the msc which is the mineral advisory council and his advice was seasonal issues without renewal so certainly our expectation is that we should get it later this year chris thompson thanks john thank you operator our next question comes from michael fairbairn of canaccord please go ahead unidentified analyst hi congrats on a really strong quarter and thanks for taking my question just one question for me around your cash costs and aisc very very strong cash costs and aisc this quarter falling well below guidance wondering if full year guidance is starting to look a little bit conservative on those fronts or if we might expect to see a little bit higher costs as we progress through the year john lewins thanks michael i guess a couple of things one in looking at our capital expenditure we certainly expect that the quarters going forward will increase in relation to sustaining capital especially things like development and what have you so certainly our expectation is in terms of aisc our our guidanceâ s is fairly reasonable recognizing it is quite a wide wide number as well in terms of cash costs i think i think we were very pleased with the numbers that we got in q1 as we were with the sustaining but likewise we are increasing the number of people that we re employing and a few other things like that which will obviously have some impact on cash costs so i think we re still fairly comfortable with the numbers that we ve given out to the market unidentified analyst okay perfect that s that s very helpful and that s it for me so congrats again on a very strong quarter john lewins thanks for that operator our next question comes from don demarco of national bank financial please go ahead don demarco thank you operator and good morning john congratulations on a strong start to the year so my first question just has to do with this the gold dorã export license what is your dorã in inventory at the end of q1 should we expect potential lift to q1 q2 sales with this export license now in hand john lewins yes thanks don i think we had a couple of 1000 ounces gold dorã we have not been pushing the gravity circuit to operate full time until such time as we actually had the gold export but i said gold export license per se it s just a modification of the existing gold export license to allow us to do dorã as well so there ll be some impact but it won t be a huge impact on q2 and of course going forward we expect to get around 10 to 20 of our gold coming out in dorã and so we ll have some impact obviously in relation to the abilities and also in relation to recovery as well we think with a slight improvement in recovery from running the gravity circuit as well so had we been running the gravity circuit to full time we would have produced more answers but we didn t actually want to hire stock sitting sitting on site while we re waiting to get our approvals don demarco okay okay it s encouraging now just moving on elections in june so it s getting closer not expecting this to really move the needle but is there any recent developments that might have any read implications on k92 john lewins yes with the election process in png is actually quite drawn out the wits have now been issued and nominations have actually been extended by a week and that was a result of last week there was a quite serious motor accident in which the deputy prime minister was actually fatally injured so that was that was reasonably impactful and as a result they ve extended the nominations by a week it doesn t change the timing of the elections elections in in png are actually very strict in terms of the timeframes and they run five years generally get early elections or anything like that we haven t seen anything in what s happening with the election process that really says it s going to have any impact on k92 or really on the mining industry full stop don demarco okayâ john lewins the turnover that you get in png is quite high get about 54 of sitting members get returned so you actually get a quite high turnover lot of new mps every time you have an election but we don t expect to see much difference in terms of the strength of the relevant parties and as i think you re aware png politics is a little bit different to most places in the world it s a coalition of partners that get into government and yes they may or may not be a change of pm quite frankly and i even if the parties stay the same in terms of the numbers you could still see a change in pm so yeah we can see don demarco okay sounds good and then just finally on stage 3 expansion capex of course we have an estimate from the pea and then there s another estimate that will be pending with the dfs we re in this inflationary environment can you provide any color on inflation or is there any items in this in this spend that that might be subject to inflation or of concern john lewins look as you ve said we are seeing capex inflation across the board especially in things like steel and what have you certainly from our perspective i think one of the things that we are seeing is not so much in the inflation side of things but in the lead time where things like mills crushers float cells are the longest they ve been for at least a decade so there is some lead time issues that we re we re aware of especially for those particular items and of course as you know a lot of that equipment is actually manufactured primarily in china in terms of cost inflation itself the numbers that we re aware of and i ve made the point that we don t have the capex numbers yet for the dfs but in just general discussions with our various suppliers and contractors and consultants you re seeing capex inflation of 10 to 20 and all that there have been several projects that have come out with quite significant increases in capex when you break those numbers down the actual inflation is sitting more around the sort of 20 there are various other things that have driven many of the increases in capex and scope and all the rest of it so i guess the other point would make is from our perspective yes look we have increased the size of the project so it is 20 bigger it is over two years since you put the pea so we do expect to see fairly significant inflation on the numbers but they re coming from a low base yes of course i think if you look to pea we had about 125 million in capex another 115 in sustaining costs so overall capex 240 million that s obviously going to go north of 300 there s no two ways about that but i don t have absolute color on it yet don demarco yes okay okay well that s that s helpful appreciate that and good luck in upcoming quarters that s all for me thank you john lewins thanks don operator our next question comes from alex terentiew of stifel gmp please go ahead alex terentiew good morning guys great to see solid core reviews couple of questions for you on the cost just wanted to circle back to that can you just remind me there just give me some clarity then on the capital spending growth and sustaining for the rest of the year as i can one of the earlier callers asked and noted how costs were quite good and i understand costs are going to go up but can you just remember capex and sustaining and growth capex what your plans are for the rest of the year john lewins okay so we ve i think we ve budgeted capex sustaining costs is around 60 million for the year but more than that and of course that includes our twin incline additional capital equipment that s coming in for underground we ve got a tailings dam lift that we re busy with right now and camp expansion new maintenance workshop at 800 portal so we have a lot of a lot of projects on the goal right now and then of course the the other one would be that we ve got a dfs that s been completed we expect to very quickly after that completion put in orders for long lead items and that isn t in this year s budget simply because the numbers are unknown and obviously requires approval of the board to go ahead with the dfs soâ alex terentiew okay i think you had 46 million in growth capex is that that s not related to the expansion at all that s just development and other projects i guess john lewins yes well when you re running an operation and you re also going to expand it you do get into the situation of saying well is this expansion capital or is it sustaining capital in some cases because the expenditure that you re incurring you would not incur at that given time but you would have to incur at some point so another capex item for late this year is we ve got a race for venture half going in which 600 to 700 meters i think it s a five minute time so it s a pretty substantial development weâ re sitting at four or 500 000 tonnes per annum we wouldn t do that right now we do it a bit later but we re doing it now so yes you ve got to have those discussions with your cfo and all the rest of it as to whether that should be sustaining or expansion and that s one of the reasons that when i talk about the pea i talk about not just the expansion capex but the sustaining capex over that period as well alex terentiew all right next question maybe just on the gold recovery circuit i know this is a bit dated but in the pea you think i believe you guys were targeting kind of 95 recoveries what that s all optimized is that still a reasonable target and then also related to that with the copper do you expect any improvement in the copper recovery and perhaps payability as well john lewins look i think 95 is a reasonable target for the operation going forward we one of the things that we ve seen from the test work that we ve done is is increasing our residence time in the flotation will help us with with recovery of some of this with some of these slow floating material and hence when expanding to this 500 000 tonne per annum we re actually pretty much doubling our refer capacity even though it s only a 25 increase in throughput and that s as a result of some of the tests that we did as part of the dfs with the gravity circuit running we expect to see our copper grades in the con go up and because right now you will obviously optimize your float for recovery of gold not recovery of copper currently 85 90 of our value going forward the float value will increase in terms of copper contribution and you ve already pulled out some of your gold so you re going to be pushing those those copper grades up a bit and that in turn will have some impact on payability so we do expect to get a little bit better payability with higher copper grades overall i think we still expect to see the same sort of coverage but a bit higher grade on the current alex terentiew okay great so that s what i was hoping to hear perfect thank you operator this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to john lewins for any closing remarks john lewins well thank you operator thanks thanks everyone for attending this morning and i can actually say this morning because i m also in in north america currently i think it s the first time i ve had a quarterly call where i m actually in the same timeframe i think it s been a very solid quarter for us we coming off a record quarter in q4 to be able to sustain the production rates in terms of throughput from both the mining and the plant where we re really important in terms of throughput we certainly anticipate we will see similar numbers this quarter in terms of i think our metal production and whatever else we think also this quarter will be similar to the last quarter second half of the year i think we we expect to see higher increasing throughputs increasing mining rates impacted the equipment that we ve got coming in increasing our labor so labor recruitment as well and so we can continue to expect that production for the year we ll be back end loaded and also the sheet on some of the stocks so this has set us up we believe for a good year on the exploration front now with three rigs in kora judd south we re pretty excited by the potential there and obviously we will have will have results coming out on an on going basis throughout the year so there s a lot of things happening with dfs coming up as well a lot of things happening for the company and we re looking really looking forward to the balance of 2022 as being a very exciting year for k92 so again thanks for your attendance this morning look forward to catching up with many of you over the next few weeks or around pdac stay well all the best to you and your families and thank you operator this concludes today s conference call you may disconnect your lines thank you for participating and have a pleasant day

ben shapiro dismissed criticism from liberals regarding the buffalo shooting that left 10 people dead over the weekend specifically regarding the alleged gunman s support for replacement theory and whether that fit within mainstream conservatism the alleged gunman in the buffalo new york mass shooting shared a manifesto that suggested he shared ideological ties to the theory and could have been motivated by it on monday s episode of the ben shapiro show shapiro said now what the left is trying to do is broaden out the term great replacement theory to include any sort of normal concerns about illegal immigration any suggestions that demographic voting patterns make a difference which of course everybody both left and right knows that they do i mean the left has been claiming for literally as long as i ve been alive the changing demographic patterns in the united states were going to shift the politics of the country in a progressive direction he continued so if you wanna talk about the great replacement theory and what this person actually thought you have to actually read the manifesto and you actually have to know what the great replacement theory is the great replacement theory is the theory that essentially there is a there are a bunch of jewish elites and this coterie of jewish elites wish to pervert wishes to pervert the racial stock of a country like the united states a predominantly white country in order to weaken the country from within shapiro explained it is not concerned about illegal immigration it is not concerned about cultural assimilation the great replacement theory is the idea that there can never be cultural assimilation the great replacement theory is the idea that race is destiny he added in fact the racial essentialism of the great replacement theory looks a lot more like wokeism than it does like mainstream conservatism or mainstream liberalism neither of the two major democratic parties is a believer that simply because you are of a particular race this means that you are inherently genetically designed in order to vote a particular way that is relegated to the wokeist left and it s relegated to the white supremacist right basic concerns over illegal immigration and how that trips voting patterns that is not the great replacement theory concerns about whether new immigrants in the united states are going to assimilate to the american wave that s not the great replacement theory shapiro said he concluded so what the left is trying to do is take the classical great replacement theory a neo nazi white supremacist theory and then conflate that with all these other normal concerns and then say if you have those concerns you are part of the movement that led to this mass shooting in buffalo new york listen via the ben shapiro show have a tip we should know tips mediaite com
ford motor co has decided to continue offloading rivian stock with the burgeoning electric vehicle manufacturer at roughly 24 per share after divesting itself of 8 million shares earlier this month blue oval sold another 7 million ahead of the weekend leaving itself holding about 9 7 percent of the company with 86 9 million shares leftover from the sale ford remains a relevant stakeholder however investors are growing worried that the legacy manufacturer will continue dumping rivian as a way of salvaging future losses ford which previously owned some 102 million shares in rivian endured a massive 3 1 billion loss in its first quarter as the value of its investment in the company slumped worse still investors are souring on tech and ev stocks in general analysts are torn as to why popular suppositions include the general state of the market and the rising costs of commodities that battery production is overwhelmingly reliant on and claims that the influx of shady ev startups has gradually soured investors on their future prospects rivian s specific problems are no less complicated unlike some of its less than reputable counterparts the brand has made real headway in terms of production and received meaningful financial support from the likes of ford and amazon it also recently announced plans to establish a new facility in georgia to assemble all electric suvs but it endured a 1 59 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and has cut back its previous assertion that it could produce 40 000 vehicles annually to just 25 000 this puts investors in a bit of a pickle rivian still seems to have some solid momentum behind it and may yet rebound after its lofty ipo settles down however that assumes that investors still think it s a good buy at its present valuation and that ford and amazon will not continue offloading shares

uncertainty in the aftermath of russia s invasion of ukraine has wreaked havoc with the international commodity markets in the normal pattern of the global economy commodity exporting countries like new zealand benefit from a rise in commodity prices and the subsequent strengthening of their currencies but these are not normal times in 2022 commodity prices have risen but the new zealand dollar has failed to strengthen so what is different and what should consumers expect the russian invasion of ukraine has contributed to extreme uncertainty in financial markets including the currency markets the war resulted in significant increases in global commodity prices particularly for energy and agricultural commodities but on may 13 the value of new zealand s currency against the united states dollar dropped to its lowest in two years the new zealand dollar was buying us68 32 cents on january 1 peaked at us69 75c on march 31 and then dropped to us62 39c on may 13 historically unusual again this imbalance between the commodity markets and our currency is not normal the new zealand dollar is classified as a commodity currency along with the australian dollar canadian dollar and norwegian krone primary commodities dairy meat and timber in the case of new zealand constitute a substantial part of these nations exports for countries like new zealand the changes in global commodity prices are one of the main drivers of the country s terms of trade fluctuations and therefore the currency value generally the value of the currency the exchange rate increases when export commodity prices increase the new zealand dollar for example tends to increase in value when global dairy prices increase but recent research has revealed a blip in the normal pattern the authors studied the relationship between the changes in value of 31 currencies including the new zealand dollar and commodity prices over the past ten years the analysis confirmed the traditional positive relationship between the changes in the currency values and commodity prices read more boycotting russian products might feel right but can individual consumers really make a difference however around the start of the ukraine war this relationship reversed and became negative the reversal was particularly evident for commodity currencies this study showed that despite the substantial increases in global commodity prices between january and march 2022 the expected corresponding increases in the value of commodity currencies did not occur the value of the new zealand dollar dropped 0 6 from january 18 to march 1 despite sizeable increases in the global commodity index the s p gsci standard poor s goldman sachs commodity index and the global dairy trade index which increased 17 74 and 13 4 respectively over the same period negativity driven by uncertainty it appears the breakdown in the relationship between the value of the currencies and commodity prices was due to the extreme uncertainties and geopolitical risks during the january to march period this global study also found that the closer a currency was to the conflict the worse it performed so new zealand has been advantaged by its geographic distance from the war the new zealand dollar value held better during the january to march period compared to the value of other currencies currencies of eastern european countries that border ukraine czech republic hungary poland slovak republic lost on average more than 5 from january 18 to march 1 returning to normal perceived uncertainty due to the conflict has reduced as the war has dragged on and the global commodity markets reversed their upward trend during april and may global dairy prices decreased 13 1 potentially due to the expected global economic slowdown and subsequent reduction in consumption china s zero covid policy with lockdowns and the corresponding drop in demand as well as the seasonal adjustments of dairy prices the new zealand dollar has lost 10 6 of its value since its peak in march it seems the expected positive relationship between commodity prices and the value of new zealand dollar is evident again that said a weak new zealand dollar is bad news for new zealand consumers as it increases the prices of imported goods including fuel further contributing to already high inflationary pressure it also makes it more expensive for new zealanders to travel overseas something many people were looking forward to after two years of closed borders read more new zealand is overdue for an open and honest debate about 21st century trade relations on the flip side a weaker new zealand dollar can give a much needed boost to the new zealand tourist and tertiary education sectors as it makes new zealand less expensive and therefore a more attractive travel and study destination a weakening new zealand dollar is also beneficial for exporters of products like wine as it makes them more competitive in global markets and increases external demand for these products while the war in europe had a global and unexpected impact on new zealand s currency the normal state of play is returning the reemerging trends can

article six months after the signing of president joe biden s 1 trillion infrastructure package the government said monday there are 4 300 projects underway with more than 110 billion in funding announced milestones the administration is publicly heralding as midterm politics intensify white house senior adviser mitch landrieu the former mayor of new orleans said the roads bridges and other projects are laying a foundation for tremendous growth into the future landrieu said biden and members of his administration have made more than 125 trips to highlight the bipartisan investments in infrastructure he declined to predict how much the storytelling will resonate with voters as construction starts i think that if americans step back we will all have to admit that for the last 50 years we ve had the need to do this and we haven t found the will or the way to get it done landrieu told reporters he added that this is a wonderful down payment on infrastructure needs in the country that total roughly 7 trillion related what s in the infrastructure bill biden s signature measure explained the administration made a strategic calculation that delivering results would help democrats retain control of the house and the senate in this year s elections infrastructure was a rare source of bipartisan unity as biden struck a deal that attracted several republican senators the law contains money to expand internet access and replace lead water pipes and for rail and public transit projects and investments to address climate change when biden signed the law on nov 15 he pledged to voters that america is moving again and your life is going to change for the better six months later the stock market is down inflation is near a 40 year peak russia s war in ukraine is pushing up energy costs and many americans feel pessimistic about the economy s health there is an open question whether voters will reward infrastructure projects in which the benefits are years away as part of what biden has portrayed as an infrastructure decade all we can do is tell the story about what we do and the impact that it has on the midterms will be whatever it s going to be landrieu said related biden signs 1t infrastructure bill into law as congress debates climate social bill of the 110 billion announced so far 52 5 billion is for federal highway funding this fiscal year and 20 5 billion for public transit there is another 27 billion over five years for bridges as well as money for safety rural highways airports ports drought resilience and other programs the infrastructure spending is also one area where political leaders will have to share credit with each other governors and mayors are responsible for 90 of the expenditures in the law while the federal government accounts for 10 of the spending the administration has actively tried to help state and local governments compete for the money with landrieu noting that even republican critics are generally eager to receive the funding some really smart person said you know even those people that voted no want the dough he said this is as close to consensus in my political life that i have seen the commerce department last week called on states to begin the process of submitting their plans for universal access to high speed internet biden has also taken steps to maximize the likelihood that construction materials are made domestically as the money has started to go out landrieu said the two biggest challenges of coordinating the spending have involved offering technical assistance to smaller governments and enabling workforce development to fill the jobs being created there are 7 6 million construction jobs in the u s with employers advertising about 400 000 openings in the sector landrieu said that those challenges are also an unbelievable opportunity to get right something that we actually haven t been collectively very good at in the country if the government succeeds with coordination and future administrations follow suit landrieu said america is going to grow exponentially faster and winning the 21st century is not going to be a challenge for us

new records are being set again in florida and not in a good way the state average price for gasoline reached a new record high of 4 49 per gallon on sunday the national average was one cent less this beats the previous record of 4 38 per gallon set back in march soon after russia invaded ukraine before this year the record high was 4 08 per gallon which was set back in 2008 according to aaa in palm coast gas today was selling at 4 49 a gallon at wawa and both racetrac stations on state road 100 it was selling at 4 51 at the shell closer to flagler beach and 4 49 almost everywhere else in the city but inflation adjusted figure suggest the prices are not yet at all time highs prices hit 4 39 a gallon in 2012 when the average for the year was 3 99 and 4 21 in 1981 in inflation adjusted dollars and 4 70 in 1918 though at that point the comparison loses validity the economy was not yet as dependent on oil nor americans as dependent on cars as they have been since still current trends make 5 a gallon gas a possibility before prices ease especially with memorial day s driving heavy holiday ahead and oil companies tendency to press a profitable pedal of their own around that time example even as stocks have generally been selling off exxon stock is up 46 percent over the year chevron stock is up 56 percent mobil is up 46 percent florida s average price jumped about 30 cents in the past week the state average is now 1 60 per gallon more than a year ago it now costs 67 for a full 15 gallon tank of gas that s 24 more than what drivers paid this time last year according to aaa aaa drivers are dealing with unprecedented pain at the pump and things could soon get worse before they get better said mark jenkins spokesman the auto club group we saw more big gains in the gasoline futures market late last week which could trickle down to yet another 10 20 cent jump at the pump in the near future what s driving rising gas prices global fuel supplies are tight keeping upward pressure on oil prices which account for more than half the price of gasoline the price of u s oil closed at 110 49 a barrel on friday 69 percent more than this time last year the fuel market was tight heading into 2022 as many oil producing countries had yet to return to pre pandemic levels even as demand rebounded the russian invasion of ukraine compounded the problem as the oil market effectively cut out one of its largest oil exporters in the world russia fuel price gains accelerated even more during the past couple weeks when the eu announced plans to ban russian oil by the end of 2022 the primary market driver of this news is that these countries are heavily reliant on russian fuels and will now have to find alternative sources in what is already a tight global fuel market oil prices are not at record highs but gasoline futures are u s gasoline supplies are declining as international demand for u s gasoline grows all while the market braces for a summer driving season that is stronger than last year u s gasoline supplies have dropped 6 percent over the past six weeks u s gasoline exports are 20 percent stronger than this time in may 2019 due to strong international demand for gasoline the increased competition both domestically and abroad has driven up the bidding price for each barrel of fuel while all this plays out on a global scale the u s fuel market is bracing for the summer travel season and analysts expect gasoline demand to be stronger than last year is there a light at the end of the tunnel the international energy agency forecasts that sky high fuel prices will cause u s oil production to return to pre pandemic levels by the end of 2022 according to latest reading from the eia u s oil production is at 11 8 million barrels per day which is about 10 percent below the pre pandemic record high of 13 1 million barrels per day a return to previously record high production levels could cool the fuel market and lead to lower prices however given the recent shifts in global supply and demand it may not immediately signal a return to 2 a gallon gasoline unfortunately 4 gasoline is likely to be that unwelcome passenger on most florida summer road trips jenkins continued at this point the state average is not expected to exceed 5 a gallon however the fuel market is extremely unstable and things are changing by the day either way

were 13 50 per share respectively however presentation of predecessor results not deemed comparable to results of successor given changes in capitalization and holding company results of operation management commentary during the first quarter we began building the foundation of our multi state cultivation focused cannabis business said mickey harley ceo of greenrose since acquiring connecticut based theraplant and arizona based true harvest in the fourth quarter of 2021 we have worked closely with the management and cultivation teams at each of our operating subsidiaries to streamline operations and optimize production capacity over the past few months we have worked to expand the production at each subsidiary and enhance our positioning for the early stage recreational market opportunities in connecticut and arizona while our first quarter financial performance reflects certain costs and operational interruptions associated with ramping this additional production capacity we believe our work to strengthen our infrastructure will help position our brands as high quality flower brands in connecticut and arizona s emerging recreational markets in connecticut we are closely monitoring the state s regulatory approach and timeline regarding activating the recreational market and we are taking steps that should strengthen our position for the expected commencement of recreational cannabis sales statewide during the fourth quarter of 2022 in the first quarter we completed our expansion of our cultivation facility at theraplant by 30 000 sq ft bringing our footprint up to 98 000 sq ft and increasing our total available canopy by over 80 while slower patient growth and illicit in market sales impacted our revenue we believe theraplant with its strong brand and wholesale presence with all 18 of the state s existing dispensaries is well positioned to benefit from the upcoming recreational market in fact we have already completed a population of all the rooms and we expect our last two rooms to complete their first harvests in early june to strengthen our inventory levels further we are actively pursuing opportunities for social equity partnerships in connecticut and if successful theraplant will be in a position to invest in retail licenses and dispensaries while supporting applicants from state communities disproportionately affected by the war on drugs we will continue to explore the market for opportunities to develop a retail footprint in the state to achieve vertical integration since acquiring true harvest at the end of 2021 we have focused on optimizing our canopy and seeking opportunities to establish a retail presence in arizona within our 76 000 sq ft facility we have activated two out of four planned additional grow rooms with the third and fourth room expected to be operational in the second half of 2022 though the grow room construction process caused some delays and interruptions in our production cycle and inventory levels we expect operational efficiency and product levels to rebound during the second quarter as this phase of expansion is completed from a retail perspective we are evaluating both social equity opportunities and potential acquisitions to secure dispensary licenses with our focus on high quality cultivation and superior products we are well positioned in arizona s early stage recreational market where the supply of high end flower products remains constrained we believe the shango brand secured by true harvest under license together with our improved cultivation processes will help true harvest deliver top quality flower at every price point in this market paul otto wimer president of greenrose added as we move further into 2022 we remain focused on growing our existing platform and seeking additional expansion opportunities from a production standpoint we will continue working to ramp our additional capacity at theraplant and complete construction on the additional grow rooms and improving post harvest processes at true harvest we also aim to deepen our footprint within the connecticut and arizona markets by working to build a retail presence enabling us to achieve vertical integration while early in the company s lifecycle we look forward to making additional progress on our strategy and working to establish greenrose as a vertically integrated cultivation led multi state operator first quarter 2022 financial results for the first quarter ended march 31 2022 the company s revenue net of discounts increased 15 to 8 2 million compared to 7 2 million in the prior year quarter the increase reflects incremental revenue contributions from true harvest compared to the prior year period which only included contributions from theraplant true harvest s first quarter revenue performance reflects the impact of construction related production interruptions during the facility s recent expansion while theraplant s revenue decreased period over the period reflecting demand headwinds in connecticut s medical market as well as increased competition particularly from the illicit market cost of goods sold net for the first quarter ended march 31 2022 was 6 4 million compared to 2 7 million in the prior year quarter the increase primarily reflects a significant adjustment from purchase accounting considerations in the fair value step up of inventory of 2 1 million and costs associated with ramping the company s recently expanded production capacity at both theraplant and true harvest the company also incurred additional start up costs related to initial planting and production processes in theraplant s new production facility gross profit for the first quarter ended march 31 2022 was 1 8 million compared to 4 5 million in the prior year reflecting a gross margin of 22 4 compared to 62 3 in the prior year quarter the decrease primarily reflects the aforementioned purchase accounting considerations in the fair value step up of inventory and the increased costs associated with ramping the company s production capacity as well as the softer than expected revenue performance during the quarter general and administrative expenses the first quarter ended march 31 2022 were 5 0 million compared to 1 4 million in the prior year quarter this increase was primarily due to incremental cost contributions from true harvest and additional corporate expenses of being a public operating company relative to the prior year period which only includes expenses from theraplant net income loss for the first quarter ended march 31 2022 was 14 6 million compared to 2 8 million in the prior year this was primarily attributable to the revenue impacts of the production interruptions at true harvest and the aforementioned demand headwinds in the connecticut market as well as increased interest expense of 6 6 million purchase accounting fair value inventory step up of 2 1 million and intangible amortization expense of 4 0 million adjusted ebitda for the first quarter ended march 31 2022 was 0 1 million compared to 4 1 million in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily driven by the aforementioned lower level of gross profit generated during the quarter higher corporate general and administrative expenses as well as expenses related to ramping the company s expanded production capacity at theraplant and true harvest cash and cash equivalents combined with restricted cash was 3 5 million at march 31 2022 compared to 9 1 million at december 31 2021 the decrease was primarily attributable to acquisition related expenses and debt obligations revised 2022 outlook due to ongoing demand headwinds within connecticut s medical market and the impacts of construction related production interruptions at true harvest greenrose has revised its 2022 outlook and the company is expected to generate between 100 million and 120 million in full year 2022 revenue 2022 net income of between approximately 5 million and 1 million and 2022 adjusted ebitda between the range of 65 million and 75 million excluding fair value adjustments to financial instruments and transaction related

the lifeblood of modern day america is oil president richard nixon said in 1972 it might be more accurate to say it is diesel more than 70 of us freight is moved by trucks most of them diesel fueled and more than 40 of the energy used in us agriculture is diesel its essential role means that demand for diesel tends to be resilient at the peak of the impact in the us of the covid 19 pandemic in april 2020 gasoline consumption was down 44 on the same period a year before demand for distillate fuel including diesel was down just 15 when diesel prices rise they put upward pressure on inflation for food and for any goods that are moved by road so the soaring price of diesel this year is an ominous sign for the us and the global economy the average retail price of diesel in the us rose this week to a new record high of about 5 62 a gallon up 76 over the past year according to the energy information administration prices are particularly high in the northeast averaging about 6 32 a gallon in the central atlantic region from washington to new york and about 6 34 a gallon in new england what is particularly noteworthy is that the prices of diesel and other products have become unmoored from the price of crude those record diesel prices came as brent crude has been trading in a range of 102 112 a barrel for most of the past month well below its record high of 147 in the summer of 2008 wide crack spreads have opened up between the cost of crude and the prices of oil products creating historically strong profit margins for refiners one would be reassuring argument about the current level of oil prices is that in real terms adjusted for inflation they are not particularly high by the standards of the past two decades but that reassurance does not apply to diesel adjusted for inflation brent crude today is still about 17 below its average during 2010 13 which were years when both the us and the wider world economy grew steadily current retail diesel prices however are in real terms about 20 above their 2010 13 average russia s invasion of ukraine in february is one factor behind these strong diesel prices but not because its exports have been cut off russia s diesel exports have so far remained pretty healthy says mark williams wood mackenzie s research director for short term refining and oil product markets it has been the prospect of possible future disruption caused by an eu ban on oil imports from russia now being debated by european leaders that has driven prices higher in recent weeks the impact has been intensified by the relatively low level of diesel stocks when the crisis hit high natural gas prices in europe were a constraint on refiners and a market in backwardation created an incentive to allow inventories to run down expectations about the transition to lower carbon energy have also played a role since the pandemic hit at the start of 2020 about 3 million b d of refining capacity has been shut down around the world for companies with aging refineries that required significant investment to remain viable it has been difficult to justify the spending in the face of a weak demand outlook particularly for gasoline as a result of increased fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles refining capacity in the padd 1 region of the us the east coast dropped from 1 22 million b d at the start of 2020 to 818 000 b d a year later meanwhile new refining capacity has been delayed in part because of the pandemic and weak refining margins and is only now becoming available the jazan refinery in saudi arabia started operations last year but only fully commissioned its diesel production units this month and the al zour refinery in kuwait is scheduled to begin operating very soon probably next month with demand growing buyers have been forced to bid up prices to secure supplies in the northeast us diesel markets have been particularly tight after jet fuel prices in new york harbor last month hit record highs encouraging refiners serving the region to maximise production of that stocks of distillate fuel oil on the us east coast have fallen 49 since the end of 2021 dropping last week to about 21 3 million barrels their lowest level since the series began in 1990 for refiners this has created market conditions of a kind that are rarely seen refiners that have are still choosing to process urals crude currently selling at a discount to brent of 35 a barrel or more have it particularly good wood mackenzie s calculated global composite gross refinery margin which has rarely been above 5 a barrel in the past few years has now risen above 30 a barrel as russia loses its ability to export crude and products to europe it will have to find new markets elsewhere russian diesel will increasingly move instead to africa and latin america with product from the middle east filling the gap in europe the whole global diesel market needs realignment williams says as that realignment takes shape some of the risk premium in the diesel price may fade the new refining capacity coming online in the gulf region should also help ease the tightness in product markets in the short term however the only way that the diesel market may really be able to come back into balance may be through a downturn in the economy that could result from the programme of interest rate rises that the us federal reserve has embarked on with the goal of curbing inflation which is being stoked by rising diesel prices the demand destruction that could come from these prices is substantial and the gdp loss could be substantial too williams says when we look at the tight market the natural conclusion is to say that a recession sorts this us members of congress aim to stop fuel price gouging proposed legislation intended to prevent price gouging for fuel in the us will be brought to a vote in the house of representatives the law would make it illegal for anyone to sell fuel during a designated energy emergency at prices that are unconscionably excessive and indicate the seller is exploiting the circumstances related to an energy emergency to increase prices unreasonably companies found to have breached the law could be made to pay penalties and compensation katie porter chair of the house natural resources subcommittee on oversight and one of the sponsors of the bill said big oil is price gouging families because they can enough is enough i m proud to help introduce this bill that will hold these corporations accountable stop their abuse and give families relief the legislation is unlikely to win sufficient support in congress to become law there is a broad consensus among economists that the price controls introduced by president richard nixon in the early 1970s were ineffective and caused long lines at filling stations as the us federal reserve put it the controls only temporarily slowed the rise in prices while exacerbating shortages particularly for food and energy in brief blackrock the world s largest asset manager has said it expects to support a smaller proportion of climate related shareholder proposals at this year s round of company annual meetings than the 47 it backed last year in a statement on its approach to shareholder votes this year blackrock said it was seeing more proposals this year that implicitly are intended to micromanage companies which it was unlikely to support those attempts at micromanagement include constraints on board decision making and demands to address issues not material to long term shareholder value blackrock noted that other investors were also less inclined to back detailed prescriptive proposals such as those demanding an end to providing finance to fossil fuel companies alignment to a specific 1 5⁰c climate scenario or absolute targets for cutting scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions hundreds of upstream oil and gas assets sold over the past five years by large international companies have ended up in the hands of smaller operators with lower profiles and fewer commitments to cut emissions according to the environmental defense fund a campaign group these transactions can make it look as though sellers have cut emissions when in fact pollution is simply being shifted to companies with lower standards andrew baxter of the edf said midland the oil capital of west texas is experiencing the fastest price inflation in the us electricity grid operators across the us from california to texas to indiana are warning that supply capacity is struggling to keep up with demand the wall street journal reported boris johnson the uk prime minister has refused to rule out the possibility of a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in september 2020 it was seen by some as significant that the market capitalisation of zoom the video conferencing company was greater than that of exxonmobil this week exxonmobil s market capitalisation was more than 14 times that of zoom quote of the week the key thing is not to give into this notion that oh ukraine has changed everything and so we will be building out infrastructure that we decided a little while ago that we can t do now some people are trying to interpret it as this means we gotta build coal but that s not our reality john kerry the us climate envoy used an interview with the financial times to urge governments to continue their progress towards goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions despite the strains on energy security and affordability caused by russia s invasion of ukraine chart of the week for a long time there has been a broad consensus in the transport industry that while electric vehicles might be highly competitive for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles heavy road transport would be difficult to electrify not least because of power to weight issues for trucks needed to carry heavy loads long distances however a fascinating new opinion column from prachi mehta a wood mackenzie principal analyst who follows evs suggests that there is a promising move towards heavy duty electrification thanks to strong support from manufacturers and governments this chart shows the gross vehicle weight ratings gvwrs and ranges for a selection of existing and proposed electric heavy trucks based on truck usage data mehta has estimated that about 42 of heavy duty single and combination vehicle sales and 21 of vehicle miles travelled vmt can be hypothetically electrified based on the 250 300 mile range available on the models to be released this year the full details of her analysis are available in this report source wood mackenzie

scientific officer conference call participants ed white h c wainwright michael mortensen westpark capital operator good afternoon and welcome to the vyant bio first quarter 2022 earnings conference call and webcast today may 16 2022 the company issued a press release summarizing results for the first quarter 2022 and filed its form 10 q today s discussion will provide an overview of activities in the first quarter and 2021 is being recorded and a replay of the webcast will be available on the vyant bio website following today s call alternatively the link can be sent to you by contacting ir vyantbio com all participants on this call will be in a listen only mode during the presentation the presentation will be followed by a question and answer session at this time i would now like to turn the conference over to jay roberts chief executive officer of vyant bio please go ahead sir jay roberts thank you operator and thank you all for joining the vyant bio investor conference call and webcast for the first quarter 2022 we re pleased to have a fresh start to the year for vyant bio beginning in many ways we spent the first quarter fully focused on progressing our scientific research and development business plan and our call today will articulate some of the scientific insights that we have gained in the quarter along with our financial results for the quarter as such on the call with me today is via bio s chief financial officer andy lafrence and our chief scientific officer dr robert fremeau following the safe harbor statement i will start out describing the corporate initiatives we have accomplished so far this year then dr fremeau will provide an overview and update on recent scientific achievements made in the quarter and the vision ahead finally andy lafrence will take us through a brief financial update and discuss key accounting matters for the first quarter 2022 i will make some closing remarks and then we will open up the lines for questions i will now turn the call over to our cfo andy lafrence andy lafrence thank you jay and welcome to all we would like to remind everyone that various comments about future expectations plans prospects constitute

events or circumstances that would occur after todayâ s date this conference call is also being recorded for audio rebroadcast on vyant bioâ s website at www vyantbio com with that i would like to turn the call back over to jay roberts jay jay roberts thank you andy as we begin the call i think it s important to remind everyone we committed to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2022 to solely focus vyant bio as an emerging global drug discovery company pursuing the discovery and development of novel and repurpose therapeutics to treat neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases such as ret syndrome cdkl5 deficiency disorder or cdd and parkinson s disease we believe that as we execute our focused strategy to develop and bring important therapeutic assets into our pipeline we hope to enhance our shareholder value let s begin with a few highlights as we ve discussed on our previous call we have 4 key discovery programs underway and today we will take you through some of our recent scientific data which dr fremeau will discuss in a few minutes we entered the first quarter of 2022 focused on bringing a repurposed drug candidate vynt 0126 into clinical trials in the first half of next year our first two novel drug candidates which support the two rare diseases we noted are in lead identification phase of discovery with our r d teams we have more work to complete on a compound selection through an iterative process including high throughput screening on our 3d microbrain platform the application of ai technologies on the chemistry which is being done by our partners as well as our own analytics are interrogating the biology to our own proprietary machine learning system we re hoping to report our lead candidates for these programs late this year as we move into the lead optimization phase early in 2023 i ll now highlight the key business accomplishments for the first quarter and related actions we are taking as we head into the second quarter of 2022 first as we discussed on our last webcast we announced an important collaboration agreement which we entered into with a promising company and scientific team from organotherapeutics a developer of proprietary patient specific organoids that recapitulate parkinson s disease pathology we believe this collaboration will accelerate our ability to discover small molecule therapeutics to treat patients with parkinson s disease the collaboration brings together the respective team s expertise in drug discovery using human derived cells high throughput biology and chemistry and machine learning based therapeutic design together we will focus on the identification of drug candidates that rescue the parkinson s disease phenotype through the development of disease linked clinically translatable assays and biomarkers through multiple molecular biochemical and cellular methods and applying machine learning techniques to yield unbiased results we know that therapies for diseases that affect the cns are difficult to discover and requires innovation and exceptional scientific expertise to tackle our collaboration like a few others we have entered is another in a series of strategic moves to focus our efforts while accelerating our position in drug discovery so the use of technologies that allow insight into human biology early into discovery of cns drugs second we ve made a strategic decision earlier this year to further focus our business and our people on drug discovery and move away from providing preclinical cro services we engaged an investment banking team with significant experience in transacting preclinical contract research organizations to assist us with the divestiture of our vivopharm preclinical services business we recognize that vivopharm is a well run business and a skilled scientific staff our exit from the preclinical cro services business will allow us to put all of our human and capital resources on our r d efforts to discover and develop therapeutic assets for cns diseases we are currently entertaining several indications of interest from qualified parties and have a robust m a expression of interest process that we believe will yield a favorable transaction for both sides the intended result of this transaction will be incremental non dilutive cash to our balance sheet that provides fuel for our business we are working hard to do our best in closing transaction in the next 60 days to 90 days further as we noted in prior calls and quarterly reports we have relocated our r d facilities in la jolla california to a new location thereby that move is substantially complete we now have redundancy and strong scientific r d teams in both of our r d facilities at maple grove minnesota and san diego california progressing on our internal cns drug discovery pipeline third we implemented two new financing vehicles to facilitate the raising of additional equity capital at the company s option with an equity line of credit provided to us by lincoln park capital allowing access to raise up to 15 million as well as signing and up to 14 5 million at the market or atm facility with canaccord genuity andy will discuss this further in a few minutes to highlight that our current cash balances future proceeds from the divestiture of our vivopharm business and future proceeds from the equity line of credit and atm are expected to fund operations well into 2023 fourth we re participating in investor conferences to get our focused vision in front of investors and our shareholders in january we presented at the h c wainwright bioconnect conference and last week we participated in the bionj s 12th annual biopartnering conference we will also be in miami next week presenting at the h c wainwright global investor conference i hope that you can join us there finally we re also focusing on additional shareholder engagement during the coming months to communicate our strategy to both retail and institutional investors with that i will now turn the call over to our chief scientific officer robert fremeau robert fremeau thank you jay i am thrilled to have the opportunity to discuss the vyant pipeline at vyant bio we are pioneering a new way to discover medicines for complex neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders we have developed a cns drug discovery platform that combines human patient derived organoid models of brain disease biology at scale and machine learning to discover novel cns drug candidates most drugs fail in the clinic due to lack of efficacy this is especially challenges the cns drug development where the available animal models have poor predictive value our approach is designed to allow us to identify therapeutic candidates that are active and assume a disease setting at the early stages of a program potentially bypassing the need for animal models with efficacy i have some exciting data to share with you today which is the validation we have been working on to support the identification of our lead clinical compound vynt0126 our first two novel drug candidates would support the two rare diseases we noted are in the hit the lead identification phase of discovery with our r d teams we have more work to be done on compound selection through an iterative process including high throughput screening on our 3d microbrain platform the application of ai technologies on the chemistry which is being done by our joint venture partner and collaboration partners as well as our own analytics for interrogating the biology through our own proprietary machine learning system we are hoping to report our lead candidates for these programs late this year and progressed to clinical candidate selection early in 2023 we are continuing to refine our focused scientific approach in validating our human first drug discovery platform our scientific team has pioneered the development of organoids models of human brain disease from patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells that are sufficiently robust and reproducible to be amenable to high throughput screening a key element of our strategy is the identification of relevant drug targets based on therapeutic hypotheses that we derive from our investigation of human disease type of physiology and the use of quantitative biomarkers to provide meaningful human biology derived preclinical signals of drug efficacy to drive compound advancement as we established our cns drug discovery platform we knew that we needed to employ the most innovative technologies to accelerate our drug discovery efforts and establish our competitive advantage to this end we established a proprietary technology platform analytix that is purpose built for progressing the processing aggregation and storage of large data files containing digital images of biological activity primarily derived from our organoids models for use in our downstream data analysis and machine learning models we have developed an efficient process to translate drug experiment designs from the lab into machine readable formats process large data sets sourced directly from laboratory equipment and to extract unbiased quantified representations of biologically relevant features to enable the characterization of disease states the profiling of treatment effects and the assessment of possible toxicity or adverse events rett syndrome is a rare genetic autism spectrum neurological disorder that leads to severe impairments affecting nearly every aspect of the child s life including their ability to speak walk eat and even breathe easily the hallmark of rett is near constant repetitive hand movements and seizures rett is usually recognized in children between six to 18 months as they begin to miss developmental milestones or lose the abilities they had gained rett is primarily caused by mutations on the x chromosome in a gene called mecp2 as you can see on this slide our rett tissue brain spheroids exhibit a unique disease specific functional phenotype that is markedly different from that of healthy controlled organoids and can be measured in a high throughput fashion using kinetic imaging systems such as flipr we used our assayanalytix program to extract and quantify the disease specific features of the rett spheroids wave forms showing the spheroids on the right including things like peak morphology peak heights and frequency among others as shown on this slide our ability to reproducibly generate rett neurospheroids that exhibit consistent and robust functional phenotype differences across multiple independent experiments provides a basis for our ability to screen for drug candidates that can rescue the disease phenotype we currently have two promising ongoing programs focused on rett a repurposing candidate vynt0126 and several novel compounds that are directed against two distinct targets that were identified based on a phenotypic screen of the smart library provided to us by the international rett syndrome foundation screens on our rett patient derived organoids this slide shows that vynt0126 it is the dose dependent rescue of the rett functional phenotype following chronic treatment that is correlated with target engagement in the rett spheroids the spider plot in the middle shows dose dependent rescue of individual parameters of the pipe wave form this data is summarized in the graph on the right which shows that rescue of individual super parameter occurs at nanomolar concentrations of drug and may not need full target engagement importantly vynt0126is known to reach these levels of concentration in the human brain the vynt0126 molecule is a promising repurposing candidate for several reasons the compound has already been approved by the fda as a cognition enhancing medication for dementia related to alzheimer s disease and there are readily available safety data vynt0126 exhibits a consistent dose dependent rescue of several rett disease phenotypes and our rett patient derived organoids and we are working with the international rett syndrome foundation to file an investigational new drug application for rett repurposing candidate in q4 of 2022 and the request orphan drug designation we are meeting with the clinical trial committee of the irs in may to prepare for a pre ind meeting with the fda we are also pursuing novel compounds for rett directed against two additional targets in collaboration with our joint venture partner atomwise we are applying machine learning to drive compound progression and are establishing in vitro binding and cell based functional assays for these targets to examine the relationship between target potency and degree of phenotypic rescue we expect to identify lead candidates in 2022 and identify potential clinical candidates in the first half of 2023 we re excited by recent evidence we have obtained that both vynt0126 and our novel rett candidates act on distinct biochemical targets and exhibit a differentiated mechanism of action from the most clinically advanced rett therapeutic candidates cdkl5 disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by early onset epileptic seizures intellectual delay and motor dysfunction although crucial for proper brain development the precise targets of cdkl5 and its pathophysiological link to patient symptoms are not currently understood while genetic testing is currently available to identify patients that have a mutation in the cdkl5 gene limited knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology has hindered the identification of potential therapeutic targets and the discovery of drug candidates cdd is an ultra rare neurodevelopmental disease with a defined unmet medical need with only one recently approved therapeutic treatment to investigate the selected vulnerability of neurons for cdkl5 mutation patients we conducted a single nucleus rna seq study of cdkl5 mutant versus healthy neurosteroids we observed the cdkl5 hyperexcitability phenotype is correlated with higher levels of expression of synaptic markers in cd neurons which we confirmed by immunostaining in addition we observed a higher neuron astrocyte ratio and a reduction of expression of markers for inhibitory gabaergic neurons we screened the custom library of approximately 5 200 molecules composed of fda approved drugs molecules that past phase 1 clinical trials and a panel phenotypic screening compounds with the goal to identify both novel drug candidates and potentially repurposing candidates for cdkl5 disorder approximately 288 compounds showed some degree of rescue of the cdd hyperexcitability phenotype we conducted further confirmatory screening and identified 40 compounds that produce a full range of efficacy resting a flipper phenotype in the cdkl5 specific manner we are currently conducting full dose response curves to these promising molecules in addition in collaboration with our â with our collaborating partner cyclica we are applying a machine learning approach utilizing in silico screening to identify novel candidate molecules for three potential cdd targets that we will screen in our cdd organoids we expect to identify potential lead candidates towards the end of 2022 and hope to identify cyclica candidate in the first half of 2023 parkinson s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects predominantly dopamine producing neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra parkinson s disease symptoms generally develop slowly over the years and include tremors muscle rigidity gait and balance problems and slow imprecise movements the etiology of parkinson s disease is poorly understood but it is widely accepted that a combination of genetics and environmental factors are the cause about 10 to 15 of people with pd have a family history of the condition and family linked cases can result from genetic mutations in a handful of genes including the glucocerebrosidase and l r r k 2 among others on march 29 we announced a collaboration with organo therapeutics to advance our work on the identification of lead compounds that are expected to be disease modifying in parkinsonâ s disease organo therapeutics has developed several proprietary familial parkinsonâ s disease patient specific organoids that recapitulate parkinsonâ s disease pathology the collaboration brings together the respective team s expertise in drug discovery using human derived cells high throughput biology and chemistry and machine learning based therapeutic design to gain insights in the patient specific responses to potential pd drugs scientists from both sites will utilize complex patient derived 3d organized models created from induced pluripotent stem cells to identify disease linked clinically translatable assays and biomarkers through multiple molecular biochemical and cellular approaches to identify drug candidates that rescue the familial pd phenotype our initial focus is on the gba and lrrk2 familial mutations by focusing initially on these familial parkinson s disease linked mutations we expect to identify common causes and potential therapeutics approaches that can be extended into the much larger sporadic patient population our teams are actively executing on a research plan that we believe will accelerate our work to discover novel therapeutics for the treatment of pd a debilitating disease impacting about 10 million patients around the globe in summary i am very proud of the progress the team has made over the first quarter of 2022 and we have become a fully integrated r d team working seamlessly across two sites in san diego california and maple grove minnesota through the close collaboration of our cross site and cross functional biology and data science teams we have made important discoveries identifying a differentiated method of action for our repurposed and novel rett candidates finally the maple grove team has successfully completed the transition from doing service related work to become a fully integrated r d team working closely with our san diego team to execute on our strategic vision to discover new medicines between neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders major causes of death and disability worldwide thank you for your attention and i now turn the call back over to andy lafrence our cfo andy andy lafrence thank you bob hello everyone and thank you again for joining our call today i will review our financial results for the quarter ended march 31 2022 first and foremost we ended the quarter with 16 4 million in cash we also implemented two new vehicles to facilitate the raising of additional equity capital at the company s options with the finalization of the lincoln park equity line of credit allowing us to access up to 15 million of capital as well as on a 14 5 million atm with canaccord genuity our current cash balances future proceeds from the sale of the vivopharm business and usage of the equity line of credit and atm are expected to fund operations well into 2023 during the first quarter of 2022 the company continued the process of divesting the vivopharm business which is expected to be completed this year therefore the vivopharm business is classified as held for sale and its financial information as discontinuing operations the company s loss from continuing operations aggregated 4 4 million in the first quarter of 2022 and included non cash depreciation and amortization as well as stock based compensation of 98 000 and 278 000 respectively and onetime severance charges of 437 000 discontinuing operations net loss for the march 31 2022 quarter aggregated 4 8 million and included a non cash impairment charge of 4 3 million resulting from changed market conditions for contract research organizations from december 31 2021 to march 31 2022 total revenue from continuing operations increased by 49 3 or 100 000 to 303 000 for the three months ended march 31 2022 as compared with 203 000 for the three months ended march 31 2021 as we previously noted we are winding down our revenue generation activities in the first part of 2022 to solely focus our resources on our research and development activities cost of goods sold service from continuing operations totaled 38 000 and 64 000 respectively for the three months ended march 31 2022 and 2021 resulting in cost of goods sold of 40 and 60 respectively of service revenue cost of goods sold product costs decreased by 12 or 48 000 to 348 000 for the three months ended march 31 2022 as compared with 396 000 for the three months ended march 31 2021 research and development expenses increased by 89 or 731 000 to 1 6 million for the three months ended march 31 2022 and from 820 000 for the three months ended march 31 2021 this increase is principally due to 336 000 of increased payroll related and consulting expenses a 315 000 increase in research and development activities at our maple grove facility and 48 000 of costs related to moving to our new facility in california selling general and administrative expenses increased by 128 000 or 1 5 million to 2 8 million for the three months ended march 31 2022 as compared with 1 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2021 the 2021 period reflects the company as a privately held company whereas the 2022 period reflects the company as a publicly held company the quarter ended march 31 2022 includes incremental of 564 000 of payroll related expenses including the one time contractual severance benefits

audit and other professional services and incurred 418 000 of additional insurance expense as a public company i will close for now and hand the presentation over to jay roberts for closing remarks jay jay roberts thanks andy as we come to the final part of today s call i d like to conclude with the following takeaways first i d like to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress our scientific teams are making on multiple fronts related to the existing programs we discussed today that our activities in the first quarter focused purely on establishing vyant bio s foothold in the biotech industry and helping to fuel our activities into the future quarter and the year beyond second we believe the total addressable market in the two rare disease categories where we are focused is approximately 2 billion worldwide and in the familial parkinson s area the addressable market is over 5 billion globally so we think our positioning and the competitive landscape in cns disorders is highly favorable stay tuned as we continue to make progress and also invite you listeners to become more familiar with vyant bio as news and information becomes available we ll be communicating updates via press releases linkedin our vyant bio website and other social media outlets interested parties are invited to sign up for press release distribution list please visit our website with that i invite andy and bob to join me as we open up the line for q a operator question and answer session operator thank you thank you your first question is coming from ed white of h c wainwright ed please pose your question ed white good afternoon so just a question on 0126 you had mentioned previously that you were going to meet with kols and hope to draft plans for a pre ind meeting with the fda i believe you had expected to make the request in may or june i m just wondering if you can give us an update on have you already done that or what your plans are for meeting with the fda jay roberts yeah ed so the meeting isn t set up yet but we are getting ready and in conjunction with the international rett foundation that bob had talked about and that s going to be part of that process but we are intending to stay on that schedule that you just defined perhaps bob you have want to add a little bit more detail to that robert fremeau sure we have a meeting scheduled with the clinical trial committee of irsf on may 23 to review our clinical development plan for 0126 and we expect to submit our request for a pre ind meeting at the end of june early july i believe and we re discussing progressing initially to an adult from this trial has just done from the two advanced clinical candidates and then to establish the data we needed to go into the pediatric population that s a follow on ed white great thanks bob and another question if i may you had mentioned in the past potentially targeting huntington s disease i was just curious if you ve made any progress or have any plans for that indication jay roberts so ed it s a great question thanks so we are very focused on these two rare diseases and parkinson s and given this really strong interest in focusing on neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases that s the place where we re going to put all of our energy and obviously our capital and human resources will focus there for the foreseeable future and then to the extent that we find other disease targets of interest we ll certainly be talking about that more but at the moment we really do think it s important that we focus in these four programs that we ve talked about today ed white okay thanks jay and perhaps a question for andy you mentioned the two financing vehicles i m just curious if you ve tapped them yet this quarter andy lafrence no we have not no ed we have not ed white okay thank you that s all the questions i have thanks for that jay roberts thanks ed operator okay our next question is coming from michael mortensen of westpark capital michael over to you michael mortensen yes folks thank you for taking my call my concern is first of all i ve got two questions has nasdaq contacted you in regards to being below 1 the stock jay roberts hey mike hi this is jay so yes so no we have not yet heard from nasdaq at this point michael mortensen well that s inevitable right at this price jay roberts we of course don t know what might happen tomorrow michael mortensen well there are requirements nasdaq has got a requirement to trade above 1 and within at the market i mean it s almost going to be below 1 unless something spec that happens and then of course from there it could become a potential reverse split which is never good for the shareholders and i m just wondering where all of this great technology and stuff is going to benefit us because again unless of course this meeting with the fda and my last be how soon will they contact you back after that meeting because it s just with at the market hitting the stock already below 1 to get it above that level i mean again you ll get to six months but i just don t see it i m just wondering how a shareholder is going to benefit from everything that s going on with their investment jay roberts yes so as we talked about today mike we re very optimistic but quite happy with the results of our scientific team and we re keeping our head down we re very focused on the business we ve made meaningful changes in terms of focusing in neurological diseases as we think that was an important step for us continuing to just put our effort and time and energy into executing on our business plan and we believe that we re on schedule and on time as it relates to that sort of the execution side of this is actually working as we have planned michael mortensen okay so if this fda meeting takes place on may 23 how soon could we expect the response from the fda jay roberts bob do you want to handle that but we believe that it s like a 90 to 120 day window robert fremeau the meeting on may 23 is with the international red simon foundation clinical trial committee will request a pre ind meeting end of june and then two months later we ll have the ind meeting which we anticipate will be in the september time frame and then probably is another 90 days before they give a response to the request for the ind the clinical trials will begin in 2023 assuming that we are granted the ind michael mortensen okay thank you very much operator thank you ladies and gentlemen i ll now hand back over to jay for any closing remarks jay roberts thank you operator and thank you all for joining the call today we re very happy with our progress so far and we look forward to keeping everyone informed of our progress along the way thanks again for joining

telemedicine online retailing or striving to bring medications over the counter through the pathways laid out by the fda commented fady boctor petros s president and chief commercial officer during the first quarter we experienced an impact of what has become a common supply delay provision across today s markets leading to disrupted availability of stendra to a market that continues to seek it out however a recent significant supply replenishment and product stability testing has strengthened our commercial availability for q2 and beyond in this recent supply replenishment and stability testing stendra was able to extend its shelf life which went from two years to four years enhancing stendra s market life viability while we now have ample supply of stendra for the foreseeable future we do anticipate some continued impact on revenue in q2 based on certain temporarily and strategically placed sales allowances implemented to mitigate certain market supply and demand dynamics importantly we believe that the current market conditions increasing demand and our strategic plans to both drive awareness and increase access will create conditions in which it may be possible to see petros become profitable by the end of 2022 we look forward to continuing to share our progress in all of our programs for stendra including expanded access as well as those earlier stage programs

builder covid 19 update rising interest rates fed intervention and rising monthly payments zonda s ali wolf and tim sullivan discuss how the current economic landscape is impacting housing and how builders and buyers are reacting to rising interest rates the current economic landscape is categorized by seemingly contradictory elements according to zonda chief economist ali wolf during the latest covid 19 update webinar wolf shares that some elements such as the stellar april jobs report the low unemployment rate 6 wage growth and high inflation rates flow together however gdp growth in the first quarter of 2022 contracted and lots of soft data gauging consumer sentiment and expectations is beginning to trend more negative if you look at consumers some of the sentiment data they don t feel that great whether it s about the economy or about how much they re paying every day wolf says about the housing market not too many people think now is a good time to buy while inflation as measured by the consumer price index decreased marginally from 8 5 year over year growth in march to 8 3 in april there is still no inflationary relief yet according to wolf after its first short term interest rate increase in march the federal reserve announced the second short term rate increase in april a 50 basis point increase aimed to combat high levels of inflation and help add relief to the overheating economy while the short term federal funds rate is up 75 basis points mortgage rates are up more than 200 basis points in part because the market isn t waiting for the fed wolf says the response on the ground has been varied according to zonda builder survey data according to a survey conducted in mid april 30 of builder respondents reported demand was slower than expected however more than 60 of builders reported that demand was either on track with what was expected or remained stronger than expected builders are seeing different responses in terms of what s going on with affordability and interest rates and consumers are having different reactions to what s happening wolf says you have some buyers that are motivated by the market prices are up inventory is up and people have a fear of missing out you also have some people looking at the market thinking inflation is at 8 3 and costs are increasing want to lock in the largest share of their monthly budget wolf says many buyers also are deterred in the current market either by fear of buying at the top or by force due to rising affordability concerns as a result of home price appreciation and changes in mortgage rates monthly payments in many major metros including dallas and austin texas las vegas jacksonville and tampa florida and raleigh north carolina are up 40 since the end of 2021 wolf says while 30 year fixed rate mortgages are nearing 6 adjustable rate mortgages arms only account for about 11 of outgoing loans much lower than the 35 rate at the height of the last housing cycle while nowhere near as high as the last cycle we are seeing arms increase as people are trying to use them wolf says arms are not inherently bad but we do know that some of the problems associated with the last cycle when the payment reset and people found themselves unable to purchase in part due to the rapid pace of monthly payment increases 35 of builders surveyed by zonda indicated that cancellations are increasing despite the increase wolf says there has generally been enough demand from prospective buyers that canceled homes ultimately are purchased wolf says the increase in cancellations coupled with rising monthly payments a larger share of builders offering incentives and many buyers on the margins deciding to opt out suggest the market is reaching an inflexion point price appreciation and buyer cohorts according to zonda data between 80 and 90 of actively selling communities across the country were raising prices as of march additionally the mid april builder survey found 84 of builders were raising prices month over month as we have seen interest rates go up and as we have the demand pool come down for now we still have more people that are willing to buy a home than homes that are available on the ground says wolf among buyer cohorts move up buyers relocation buyers and entry level buyers remain the most active shoppers however the share of active entry level of shoppers has decreased on a year over year basis since april 2021 as many prospective entry level buyers are sensitive to interest rates real time housing data zonda senior managing principal tim sullivan says builders are reporting that first time buyer price points are showing the most interest rate stress while build and cycle times are becoming stretched most builders also continue to report they are capping sales according to zonda data while interest rate changes are having differing impacts depending on buyer sentiment some buyers are still moving forward particularly those that are locked into mortgages but others are a little bit more afraid and looking to hold off sullivan says we are also seeing some indications that sales are slowing sullivan says builders top concerns in the current environment are still centered around rising mortgage rates and costs additionally a majority of builders are still reporting supply chain disruptions labor shortages land disruptions and challenges related to government services

the chula vista city council on tuesday will consider two ordinances intended to address disputes between renters and landlords the first proposed ordinance would limit the permissible reasons for terminating a renter s tenancy advertisement under assembly bill 1482 passed in 2019 landlords can use no fault just cause reasons to evict tenants if they are demolishing their property or removing it from the rental market moving into the property or planning a substantial remodel no fault evictions have become among the most common reasons why tenants have sought legal assistance or called on cities to issue eviction moratoriums said gilberto vera an attorney with the legal aid society of san diego the society has received more than 750 requests from tenants in chula vista seeking housing assistance since january 2020 chula vista s proposal still allows for substantial remodels as a fair no fault eviction but it imposes additional restrictions on landlords advertisement for example the state qualifies a substantial remodel as work such as electrical structural or plumbing that requires a tenant to vacate the property for their own safety for at least 30 days chula vista s ordinance would extend that to 60 days if a property was taken off the market and offered again for rent two years later the city s proposal would give the tenant displaced from that unit first dibs if they notify the landlord chula vista s ordinance also identifies eight more kinds of harassment than the state including that landlords cannot verbally abuse or threaten a tenant influence vacancy through fraud or coercion and refuse their rent payment the draft landlord and tenant ordinance comes after several tenants rights groups asked the city council for stronger renter protections after reports of tenant harassment and evictions particularly in west chula vista advertisement landlords renters and advocates on both sides have debated chula vista s proposal tenants mostly want a local law that will protect them where the state law does not property owners say the city s ordinance is too similar to ab 1482 and that jurisdictions have not yet seen what impacts the law could have on the rental industry due to eviction moratoriums implemented due to the covid 19 pandemic for months families have pleaded during council meetings for an eviction ban or additional rental assistance dora parra was one of the latest renters who broke down and asked council members during a may 3 meeting to protect her family from eviction as they had a month to vacate their unit and there s no affordable housing in san diego county advertisement property owners and landlord advocates worry the proposal s language favors tenants it s my understanding that chula vista is trying to close the gap on abuse with substantial remodels and that they had some bad actor landlords that were taking advantage of that but i don t think the language of how it s drafted now is addressing that said allison higley associate attorney at todd a brisco associates aurora murillo a chula vista resident and rental homeowner fears the ordinance is too strict on landlords ultimately forcing landlords to sell their properties and make way for big corporations to gentrify and rent units above the marketplace advertisement this ordinance is coming along with many other things that are affecting my security my income and also my tenants she said i ve been able to have the freedom to say ok these are my rules and i can help people but unfortunately my fear and the thing that is scaring me the most is that i won t be able to do that anymore there are nearly 79 000 housing units in chula vista of that figure more than 33 100 are rentals according to the city s 2019 housing stock data most of those rental units or about 16 100 are apartments with 10 or more units and an estimated 6 400 are single family detached homes when drafting the ordinance the city did not have readily available data from over the past two years to track trends related to evictions and other landlord tenant issues due to the pandemic and changes in its contract with housing nonprofit csa san diego according to the city last month the council renewed its contract with the organization for two years at 80 000 so that they could collect data and information about tenant needs advertisement city staff said its covid 19 rental assistance program did offer some data on recent tenant needs as of last month more than 7 300 people had applied and about 6 100 had been processed still without specific data the city said it was difficult to assess the potential impacts the ordinance could have on smaller landlords or city resources council members will also consider implementing an eviction ban to protect against no fault causes that moratorium would resemble san diego s ban which takes effect may 22 and expires sept 30

obligation to update any of these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release or to reflect actual outcomes unless required by law non gaap information to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company uses certain non gaap financial measures and non gaap ratios including i ebitda ii adjusted ebitda iii organic growth change and iv organic revenue management uses these non gaap measures and ratios as key metrics in the evaluation of the company s performance and the consolidated financial results and in part in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers the company believes these non gaap measures and ratios are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of the company in addition these non gaap measures and ratios address questions the company routinely receives from analysts and investors and in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data the company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors however these measures and ratios are not prepared in accordance with gaap nor do they have any standardized meaning under gaap in addition other companies may use similarly titled non gaap financial measures and ratios that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures and ratios accordingly our non gaap financial measures and ratios may not be comparable to such similarly titled non gaap financial measures and ratios used by other companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non gaap measures and ratios but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measures and ratios non gaap financial measures and ratios have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation they should be considered as a supplement to not a substitute for or superior to the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of these historic non gaap financial measures and ratios to the most directly comparable financial measures and ratios calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are shown in the tables below specific non gaap measures ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda non gaap is net income attributable to bausch lomb corporation its most directly comparable u s gaap financial measure adjusted for interest income taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda non gaap is ebitda non gaap further adjusted for the items described below management believes that adjusted ebitda non gaap along with the gaap measures used by management most appropriately reflect how the company measures the business internally and sets operational goals and incentives in particular the company believes that adjusted ebitda non gaap focuses management on the company s underlying operational results and business performance as a result the company uses adjusted ebitda non gaap both to assess the actual financial performance of the company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance management believes adjusted ebitda non gaap is a useful measure to evaluate current performance adjusted ebitda non gaap is intended to show our unleveraged pre tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors in addition cash bonuses for the company s executive officers and other key employees are based in part on the achievement of certain adjusted ebitda non gaap targets ebitda non gaap is net income attributable to bausch lomb its most directly comparable u s gaap financial measure adjusted for interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda non gaap is ebitda non gaap further adjusted for the following items asset impairments the company has excluded the impact of impairments of finite lived and indefinite lived intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and or size of acquisitions and divestitures the company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the company s operating performance although the company excludes impairments of intangible assets and assets held for sale from measuring the performance of the company and its business the company believes that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue generation restructuring and integration costs the company has incurred restructuring costs as it implemented certain strategies which involved among other things improvements to its infrastructure and operations internal reorganizations and impacts from the divestiture of assets and businesses with regard to infrastructure and operational improvements which the company has taken to improve efficiencies in the businesses and facilities these tend to be costs intended to right size the business or organization that fluctuate significantly between periods in amount size and timing depending on the improvement project reorganization or transaction the company believes that the adjustments of these items provide supplemental information with regard to the sustainability of the company s operating performance allow for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward looking guidance and as a result provide useful supplemental information to investors acquisition related costs and adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets the company has excluded the impact of acquisition related contingent consideration non cash adjustments due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates and the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of the company s acquisitions as well as the nature of the agreed upon consideration share based compensation the company has excluded costs relating to share based compensation the company believes that the exclusion of share based compensation expense assists investors in the comparisons of operating results to peer companies share based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing size and nature of awards granted separation costs and separation related costs the company has excluded certain costs incurred in connection with activities taken to i separate the bausch lomb business from the remainder of bhc and ii register the bausch lomb business as an independent publicly traded entity separation costs are incremental costs directly related to effectuating the separation of the bausch lomb business and include but are not limited to legal audit and advisory fees talent acquisition costs and costs associated with establishing a new board of directors and audit committee separation related costs are incremental costs indirectly related to the separation of the bausch lomb business and include but are not limited to it infrastructure and software licensing costs rebranding costs and costs associated with facility relocation and or modification as these costs arise from events outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations the company believes that the adjustments of these items provide supplemental information with regard to the sustainability of the company s operating performance allow for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward looking guidance and as a result provide useful supplemental information to investors other non gaap adjustments the company has also excluded certain other amounts including it infrastructure investment legal and other professional fees in connection with legal and governmental proceedings investigations and information requests regarding certain of our legacy distribution marketing pricing disclosure and accounting practices litigation and other matters net gain on sale of assets and certain other amounts that are the result of other non comparable events to measure operating performance these events arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations given the unique nature of the matters relating to these costs the company believes these items are not routine operating expenses for example legal settlements and judgments vary significantly in their nature size and frequency and due to this volatility the company believes the costs associated with legal settlements and judgments are not routine operating expenses the company has also excluded certain other costs including settlement costs associated with the conversion of a portion of the company s defined benefit plan in ireland to a defined contribution plan the company excluded these costs as this event is outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations and is infrequent in nature the company believes that the exclusion of such out of the ordinary course amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the financial results of the company from period to period and therefore provides useful supplemental information to investors however investors should understand that many of these costs could recur and that companies in our industry often face litigation organic growth change and organic revenue organic growth change a non gaap ratio is defined as a change on a period over period basis in revenues on a constant currency basis if applicable excluding the impact of recent acquisitions divestitures and discontinuations if applicable organic growth change is a change in gaap revenue its most directly comparable gaap financial measure adjusted for certain items as further described below of businesses that have been owned for one or more years similarly organic revenue a non gaap measure is gaap revenue its most directly comparable gaap financial measure adjusted for these same items organic revenue growth change is impacted by changes in product volumes and price the price component is made up of two key drivers i changes in product gross selling price and ii changes in sales deductions the company uses organic growth change and organic revenue to assess the performance of its reportable segments and the company in total without the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations and recent acquisitions divestitures and product discontinuations the company believes that such measures are useful to investors as they provide a supplemental period to period comparison organic growth change and organic revenue reflect adjustments for i the impact of period over period changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues and ii the revenues associated with acquisitions divestitures and discontinuations of businesses divested and or discontinued these adjustments are determined as follows foreign currency exchange rates although changes in foreign currency exchange rates are part of our business they are not within management s control changes in foreign currency exchange rates however can mask positive or negative trends in the business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is determined as the difference in the current period reported revenues at their current period currency exchange rates and the current period reported revenues revalued using the monthly average currency exchange rates during the comparable prior period acquisitions divestitures and discontinuations in order to present period over period organic revenue non gaap growth change on a comparable basis revenues associated with acquisitions divestitures and discontinuations are adjusted to include only revenues from those businesses and assets owned during both periods accordingly organic revenue and organic growth change exclude from the current period revenues attributable to each acquisition for twelve months subsequent to the day of acquisition as there are no revenues from those businesses and assets included in the comparable prior period organic revenue and organic growth change exclude from the prior period all revenues attributable to each divestiture and discontinuance during the twelve months prior to the day of divestiture or discontinuance as there are no revenues from those businesses and assets included in the comparable current

at lifehacker we independently select and write about stuff we love and think you ll like too we have affiliate and advertising partnerships which means we may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page btw prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting marvel and dc have plenty of comic book movies and tv shows coming out in the next 12 months but not all superheroes are good guys and you ll know that if you ve watched the boys prime video s adaptation of the hit graphic novel has spawned two successful seasons of the boys the show is a graphic raunchy drama about the corporatisation of superheroes and it s been a huge hit amongst audiences it should come as no surprise that amazon is bringing out a third season of the boys but what can we expect from this new batch of episodes and more importantly when can we expect them spoilers for the boys season 1 and 2 ahead the boys season 3 plot when we last left the boys things were getting as usual pretty hectic in an attempt to stop stormfront homelander s son ryan used his laser eyes and accidentally killed his mother becca in the process he then turned against his father and chose to stay with billy butcher after the boys were pardoned hughie took a job in neuman s office not realising she is the mysterious superpowered assassin they ve been looking for that sets things up for a pretty exciting season 3 so what do we know about it so far it appears season 3 will be picking up some notable storylines from the comics it ll be interesting to see how the herogasm miniseries is adapted considering it s one of the most controversial storylines the boys has come up with essentially herogasm is an annual event for vought s superheroes to gather at a remote retreat and partake in a weekend of anything goes sex drugs and partying are no strangers in the boys but herogasm takes it to a new level executive producer eric kripke told vanity fair in an interview there will be no topping up herogasm now that i ve seen the dailies of this thing i m like what have we done it s just so crazy advertisement another big addition to season 3 is jensen ackles soldier boy who is described as the world s first superhero and fought during world war ii parallels to marvel s captain america are obvious but soldier boy is in no way the same beacon of truth and justice that steve rogers is according to eric kripke soldier boy is a huge part of the direction of the new season season 3 delves a lot more into the history of how we got here through this character of soldier boy we were able to dig into both the history of the country and also really look at toxic masculinity and masculine roles and what a shit show that s overall caused another tease for what s coming up comes from the new poster for the boys season 3 soon it ll be time to level the playing field pic twitter com ssbjxggsut the boys theboystv march 10 2022 the image shows billy butcher with glowing eyes similar to homelander s this seems to suggest the boys tv series will be picking up another notable plot aspect from the graphic novels which sees the boys inject themselves with compound v to give them an advantage against the supes they are hunting we also have the official synopsis which gives us an idea of where things pick up it s been a year of calm homelander s subdued butcher works for the government supervised by hughie of all people but both men itch to turn this peace and quiet into blood and bone so when the boys learn of a mysterious anti supe weapon it sends them crashing into the seven starting a war and chasing the legend of the first superhero soldier boy the boys season 3 cast as mentioned the most notable addition to the cast is supernatural star jensen ackles as soldier boy but he s not the only newcomer this season sean patrick flanery is playing a judge dredd inspired superhero known as gunpowder who s very much about second amendment rights nick wechsler and gaston villanueva are playing blue hawk and supersonic respectively who are two new superheroes to the world of the boys it appears the boys is also adding another notorious comic character to season three with katia winter reported to be playing russian mob boss little nina the walking dead s laurie holden will also appear as crimson countess a member of soldier boy s crew who has heat powers amazon recently released a photo of holden in costume and she s giving off very scarlet witch vibes advertisement you can also expect a number of regular cast members to show up in season 3 of the boys including karl urban jack quaid karen fukuhara laz alonso tomer capone erin moriarty antony starr jessie t usher dominique mcelligott and chace crawford claudia doumit who played victoria neuman and vought s hero pr manager ashley barrett played by colby minifie have also been upped to series regular status for season 3 aya cash s stormfront appeared to be done for at the end of season 2 but we may not have seen the last of her yet however we will probably see more of giancarlo esposito s stan edgar is there a trailer as of march 2022 we finally have a trailer for the boys season 3 gaze upon it below it looks like season 3 will have more of pretty much everything the boys is known for lots of sex blood and superpowers the second full trailer for season 3 is even wilder it puts homelander front and centre who seems to be taking the betrayal of his son quite badly he promises that the people will meet the real me which we all know can t be good meanwhile the boys seem to be back on the straight and narrow but it doesn t take long before things kick off again jensen ackles soldier boy is far more prominent in this trailer and it seems like he might be the one person who stands a chance against homelander s reign of terror is season 3 good with the release of the first episodes of the boys season 3 imminent reviews have hit the internet the new season currently has a 97 rating on rotten tomatoes empire magazine wrote the boys third season doesn t forget to deepen its characters while delivering its requisite bloodbaths and holy shit moments advertisement inverse called it the best superhero show saying the boys season 3 is still the best superhero show by a longshot it s fun weird dark emotional and often extremely gross there s an entire episode called herogasm that would make the folks at disney lose their lunches and it s still plenty relevant too the boys season 3 release date now that you re all excited about the new season of the boys you re probably wondering when it s coming out filming took place in 2021 in canada and the cast revealed shooting had wrapped in september prime video announced when we can see the boys season 3 with the

when news of the white supremacist terrorist attack in buffalo new york hit the airwaves and interwebs most of the nation was struck by the atrocity there was an outpouring of sympathy for the victims and their families and well placed outrage at the individual alleged to have carried out the assault most viewed it as a tragedy advertisement unfortunately others viewed the attack as an opportunity once it was revealed that the alleged shooter was an avowed white supremacist progressive politicians and their comrades in the activist media couldn t wait to exploit the dead victims to advance their agenda they fell all over themselves to use the shooting to smear conservatives as vicious racists who somehow encouraged the attack progressives blamed people like fox news host tucker carlson and rep elise stefanik r ny claiming their rhetoric inspired the accused killer they did this knowing that the gunman in a manifesto published before the attack explicitly expressed contempt for fox news and conservatism while they ignored this part of the document they paid close attention to the shooter s embrace of the great replacement theory grt which progressives are using to portray as racist those who support stricter immigration policies in an op ed for the washington post author greg sargent accused stefanik of supporting the theory he referred to her statement that democrats efforts to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants were designed to be a permanent election insurrection this is a reference to the idea that leftists support open borders policies because immigrants from central and south america are more likely to vote for democrats by allowing legal and illegal immigrants to enter the country democrats can eventually give them citizenship which means they would have the right to vote in american elections this is what progressives are trying to label as the great replacement theory advertisement nikole hannah jones who like many of her compatriots never saw a dead black body she didn t wish to exploit also accused conservatives of embracing the great replacement theory she tweeted critical race theory literally explains why great replacement theory exists but now just days after a white supremacist massacre the same people who created an entire book banning hysteria around crt are justifying and promoting grt absolutely shameless absolutely shameful critical race theory literally explains why great replacement theory exists but now just days after a white supremacist massacre the same people who created an entire book banning hysteria around crt are justifying and promoting grt absolutely shameless absolutely shameful ida bae wells nhannahjones may 16 2022 the lincoln project in an eternal effort to gain a semblance of relevancy also pretended stefanik espouses grt it tweeted elise stefanik has to double down on the great replacement theory lies to prove herself to the racists now they re the ones who matter to her political future elise stefanik has to double down on the great replacement theory lies to prove herself to the racists now they re the ones who matter to her political future the lincoln project projectlincoln may 16 2022 but there is a serious problem with these and other arguments the left is making about its political opposition they are blatantly lying about what the great replacement theory actually is the anti defamation league adl explained the origin of the theory noting that it has its roots in early 20th century french nationalism advertisement a writer named renaud camus who popularized the term believed that native white europeans are being replaced in their countries by non white immigrants from africa and the middle east and the end result will be the extinction of the white race according to the adl the author focused mostly on the trend of muslim immigration to european nations but did not cast it as a jewish conspiracy this came later from the adl the great replacement philosophy was quickly adopted and promoted by the white supremacist movement as it fit into their conspiracy theory about the impending destruction of the white race also know as white genocide it is also a strong echo of the white supremacist rallying cry the 14 words we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children the organization continued since many white supremacists particularly those in the united states blame jews for non white immigration to the u s the replacement theory is now associated with antisemitism the alleged gunman s manifesto clearly reveals that he is anti semitic and believes grt is a conspiracy coordinated by jews conservative podcaster ben shapiro also pointed this out on twitter if you want to be accurate about the great replacement theory it is a conspiracy theory about jewish elites shipping in minorities to change the racial stock of a country that is precisely what the buffalo shooter says and it is echoed by neither political party if you want to be accurate about the great replacement theory it is a conspiracy theory about jewish elites shipping in minorities to change the racial stock of a country that is precisely what the buffalo shooter says and it is echoed by neither political party ben shapiro benshapiro may 16 2022 advertisement shapiro also noted the dishonesty coming from the left about grt the conflation of the great replacement theory with skepticism about illegal immigration or concerns about the cultural assimilation of immigrants is a sham designed to lump in white supremacism with mainstream political concerns and it s a perfectly obvious sham the conflation of the great replacement theory with skepticism about illegal immigration or concerns about the cultural assimilation of immigrants is a sham designed to lump in white supremacism with mainstream political concerns and it s a perfectly obvious sham ben shapiro benshapiro may 16 2022 there are obvious differences between what conservatives believe about immigration and grt folks on the right believe democrats wish to import more immigrants because it can give them an electoral advantage as stated previously it is believed by people on both sides that migrants from certain parts of the world would be more likely to vote democrat the data bears this out moreover when they take up residency in states friendlier to legal and illegal immigrants they increase the population potentially giving that state more electoral votes in presidential elections the vast majority of mainstream conservatives aren t casting this as a plot by the jews to replace the white race they simply believe this is a way for the left to gain advantages in elections nothing more nothing less whether one agrees or disagrees with this argument is irrelevant one can believe this isn t true while still acknowledging that it is not the same as grt no matter how badly people on the left wish it were advertisement to sum it all up high profile leftists are lying about grt they are trying to widen the definition of the term to include anyone who does not support open borders unfortunately we can expect to see them use grt as their new boogeyman for as long as they believe they can make it work the right cannot afford to remain on the defense on this one otherwise progressives might fool gullible or uninformed people into believing the lie this will be another area in which conservatives must fight smart

the troubled michigan baby formula factory that shut down in february claims the food and drug administration still hasn t given them the green light to restart operations despite the agency saying it could be back up and running in two weeks abbott laboratories revealed monday that it had entered into a consent decree with the fda that creates a pathway to reopen the facility however the timeline for operations remains unclear after fda approval abbott could restart the site within two weeks from the time of restart it would take six to eight weeks before product is available on shelves a company spokesperson told dailymail com on monday the federal regulator during a media call monday night confirmed it has not yet given its approval saying we are negotiating with abbott to get them up and running as soon as possible the agency has declined to answer questions about the timeline for the michigan s plants reopening and instead directed reporters to abbott i think we all know the treachery of giving exact timeframes to get these things done because as corrections are made sometimes new things are discovered and sometimes it goes very quickly fda commissioner robert califf said abbott itself has made a statement that they believe they could be started up within about two weeks and then up to full capacity in about two months i think they said you can refer back to them for details on this califf did add that he believes abbott s timeframes are reasonable fda commissioner robert califf pictured on april 28 has declined to provide a specific timeline for the reopening of america s largest baby formula producer frank yiannas deputy commissioner for food and policy response weighed in to the conversation offering another tiptoed response on timing when we went in to do the inspection at the time of the inspection abbott voluntarily ceased production and we issued our inspection report he said abbott has stated in the public domain that they have already been making adjustments and corrections to their facility and that s the timeline they re projecting two weeks to be back up in operations and another six to eight weeks for their products to start hitting store shelves we think that s totally reasonable and likely to happen the fda leaders also addressed the consent decree which was filed on monday in the u s district court for the western district of michigan and is decree is still subject to court approval califf said he doesn t expect the fda to delay abbott s reopening in terms of a consent decree it does mandate that we approve every step but it is in real time including independent consultants who are brought in to oversee the process the commissioner explained i don t expect delays on the fdas part on this unless we see a problem that needs to be dealt with yiannas stated the agency would review abbott s corrective action plans and also echoed califf s response saying we don t believe the fda will be a hindrance in getting them back up and running abbott told dailymail com on monday the facility has been working on corrective actions since the fda s inspection earlier this year the company claims it submitted its corrective action plan to the fda on april 8 even before its formal response abbott had begun working to implement improvements and take corrective action a spokesperson said some of these actions included reviewing and updating education training and safety procedures for both employees and visitors as well as updating protocols regarding water cleaning and maintenance procedures at the facility abbott immediately implemented corrections to address the items that the fda raised in its observations provided at the conclusion of the inspection the company has also been making upgrades to the plant despite these actions it still remains unclear when the agency will allow the agency to resume normal operations once the fda confirms the initial requirements for start up have been met abbott could restart the site within two weeks the manufacturer reiterated the company would begin production of elecare alimentum and metabolic formulas first and then begin production of similac and other formulas from the time abbott restarts the site it will take six to eight weeks before product is available on shelves the abbott laboratories factory has reached a deal with the fda that could see it reopen in as few as two weeks once the federal regulator grants its approval the agency during a media call monday called providing a specific timeframe for reopening treacherous and referred the press to abbott for more information abbott told dailymail com on monday it could restart the plant in two weeks after fda approval pictured a locked nearly empty walmart shelf displaying formula on may 10 the proposed consent degree between abbott and the fda obliges the baby formula manufacturer to take actions that are expected to ultimately result in an increase of infant formula products while ensuring that the company undertakes certain actions that would ensure safe powdered infant formula is produced at the facility once the court has approved the agreement abbott may restart operations and the plant could be back in business in as few as two weeks but products could take six to eight weeks from that point to reach supermarket shelves across the country robert b ford the ceo of abbott described the news as a major step towards resuming production our number one priority is getting infants and families the high quality formulas they need and this is a major step toward re opening our sturgis facility so we can ease the nationwide formula shortage he said we look forward to working with the fda to quickly and safely re open the facility we know millions of parents and caregivers depend on us and we re deeply sorry that our voluntary recall worsened the nationwide formula shortage on monday afternoon health and human services secretary xavier becerra admitted to being aware of a coming shortage since last year by august the nationwide out of stock level was already above 10 percent it is now at 43 percent fda has kept me apprised of this from last year becerra said on cnn we have been moving as quickly as we can the formula shortage is the result of supply chain disruptions and workforce issues but it was amplified by a safety recall of formulas made by abbott and an ongoing shutdown of its manufacturing plant the factory closed down in february after two babies who drank formula produced at the facility which makes the brands similac elecare and alimentum died from bacterial infections in an effort to curb the nationwide formula shortage the fda has issued a temporary measure streamlining the importation of foreign produced baby formula during monday night s media call pictured the agency explained that the process allows for more flexibility for foreign and domestic formula producers while the nation is currently under stress the fda in an effort to curb the shortage has issued a temporary measure streamlining the importation of foreign produced baby formula the guidance that we announced today is for 180 days so it is a temporary measure susan payne director of the fda center for food safety and applied nutrition said during monday night s media call she explained that the process allows for more flexibility for foreign and domestic formula producers while the nation is currently under stress there are some differences in our regulations with regard to things like nutrition between our products and those that are sold abroad payne shared some of that comes right from our statutes where the fda is required to take into account certain types of factors like the ability of these formulas to support growth and data supporting growth growth monitoring studies we do have certain criteria that we take into account but in this period where we are under stress we will certainly look at products that may not necessarily have the same types of data we would use in our notifications process but have a history of safe use in other countries and do support growth the formula shortage is the result of supply chain disruptions and workforce issues but it was amplified by a safety recall of formulas by the factory on monday afternoon health and human services secretary xavier becerra admitted to knowing about a looming baby formula shortage since last year abbott laboratories said its agreement with the fda to reopen is subject to court and fda approval the company said it would first produce the elecare and alimentum brands before moving on to similac and other products products could take as long as eight weeks to reach shelves after the plant begins production earlier on monday fda chief dr robert califf said it was quite likely that abbott which voluntarily recalled its own products amid scrutiny from federal regulators will open in two weeks califf defended the agency noting that ordering the plant to close down earlier would have led to a supply shortage anyway but committing to a full investigation of how the debacle has been handled every step of the way we have an obligation to make sure that the problems have been rectified and that the formula will be safe and also contain the constituents that are needed he added pointing out that there are 30 such constituents that make formula a suitable replacement for breast milk he stood up for the fda as concerned parents blast the government for not taking action earlier regarding the troubled plant there will be a full investigation of the timeline and we ll do anything possible to correct any errors in timing that we had so we don t repeat any mistakes that we ve made califf said he also revealed that the biden administration will soon announce plans to import formula from abroad the 4 billion us baby formula market is dominated by domestic producers with import options limited subject to high tariffs and onerous safety rules that include labeling standards these longstanding rules have exacerbated the current crisis and are central to officials efforts to ease the shortage califf cautioned that foreign products are labeled with instructions written in languages that american mothers and caretakers may not understand we also have to make sure we re testing the formula he said the sturgis plant which could reopen in just two weeks closed down in february after the fda uncovered multiple violations at the plant ranging from a lack of hand washing among employees to poor temperature controls more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 percent and 50 percent this chart shows how quickly the nationwide crisis has escalated the scale of the crisis is revealed in the new analysis which shows that only 43 percent of the usual national supply of baby formula is available in february the agency linked consumption of abbott produced formula to four infants who were infected with the bacteria cronobacter sakazakii a fifth infant developed a salmonella newport infection cronobacter may have contributed to the death of two babies the agency said multiple reports say the fda ordered the plant closed down but califf says the plant was closed voluntarily based on the findings of inspections murray kessler head of formula giant perrigo has warned shortages of baby food could last throughout 2022 on friday the ceo of formula giant perrigo murray kessler told reuters he expects shortages and heightened demand to last for the balance of the year kessler said his factories in ohio and vermont are running at 115 percent capacity to compensate for chicago based abbott s shutdown but added that supplies would remain erratic for the remainder of 2022 we have stepped up and are killing ourselves to do everything we can kessler said at the request of the fda perrigo is focusing on four items the store brand versions of similac pro sensitive and pro advance and enfamil gentle ease and infant kessler said his company and three others control 90 percent of the us market perrigo is working with retailers including walmart and target corp so they get something each week kessler said retailers allocations are based on an average of what the retailers received prior to this crisis he said concerned americans slammed biden and the fda for the

manufactured processed packaged or held baby formula fda officials also observed poor hand washing among abbott plant staff who worked directly with infant formula the fda also noted an instance of improper equipment maintenance and temperature control october 2021 a whistleblower sends the fda a 34 page document outlining potential concerns with the sturgis plant the document which was made public by congresswoman rosa delauro in april 2022 was written by a former plant employee the employee accused the plant of lax cleaning practices falsifying records releasing untested infant formula and hiding information during an fda audit in 2019 among other issues january march 2022 the fda conducted multiple inspections at the sturgis plant over the course of three months in 2022 a ten page inspection report revealed multiple violations at the facility the agency alleged the plant failed to ensure that all surfaces that contact infant formula were maintained to prevent cross contamination the report states the facility did not establish a system of process controls to ensure the baby formula does not become adulterated due to the presence of microorganisms in the formula or the processing environment officials also alleged the plant failed to disclose in an investigation report whether a health hazard existed at the facility additionally the report stated plant workers were did not wear the necessary protective material when working directly with infant formula february 17 u s health officials urgently warn parents against using three popular baby formulas manufactured at the abbott plant in michigan investigators claim the products were recently linked to bacterial contamination after an infant died and three others fell ill abbott voluntarily recalled

claims they are working closely with the fda to restart operations at the plant with the spokesperson noting we continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall the fda told dailymail com it was holding discussions with abbott and other manufacturers to increase production of different specialty and metabolic products but refused to say when the sturgis plant could reopen sen mitt romney issued a letter to the fda and u s department of agriculture usda urging leaders to address the

our formulas to these infant illnesses may 12 white house press secretary jen psaki defends the government s closure of the abbott plant president joe biden met with executives from infant formula manufactures and retailers to address the shortage may 13 biden addresses the formula crisis during a press briefing saying we re going to be in a matter of weeks or less getting significantly more formula on shelves the fda announced it was working to streamline a process that will get more products to consumers while also meeting safety quality and labeling standards may 16 abbott and the fda

for 180 days to increase imports of baby formula produced overseas may 18 biden invoked the defense production act to boost baby formula production and issued a directive for planes to bring in supplies from overseas after growing pressure from congress advertisement concerned parents are slamming the biden administration s perceived lack of effort on the crisis we re going to be in a matter of weeks or less getting significantly more formula on shelves biden said on friday after the food and drug administration fda announced it was working to streamline a process that will get more products to consumers this is unacceptable chris skates whose three month old grandson requires a special formula due to stomach sensitivity told dailymail com fda under biden is beyond incompetent as the parent of a newborn the baby formula supply issue was apparent three months ago rocky fernandez of oakland california tweeted sunday night a few sample canisters we were shipped for free were recalled and when i first went to buy some it was already limited to five items per customer defense production act idgaf fix it biden you all remember that time a fda goon not understanding how the economy works closed down a baby formula factory and caused a supply chain malfunction and then mothers could not find formula in the stores echoed another social media user and biden was like what s going on come on man bad times bad times while some americans pointed their fingers at biden secretary of transportation pete buttigieg blamed the worsening formula shortage on abbott nutrition fundamentally we are here because a company was not able to guarantee that its plant was safe and that plant has shut down buttigieg said sunday on face the nation let s be very clear this is a capitalist country the government does not make baby formula nor should it companies make formula and one of those companies a company which by the way seems to have 40 percent market share messed up and is unable to confirm that a plant a major plant is safe and free of contamination he added the administration s also been working with other companies to try to surge their production that s led to an increase in production which is helping to compensate but at the end of the day this plant needs to come back online safely buttigieg s commentary comes as the nationwide out of stock percentage of formula reached 40 percent the week beginning april 24 according to datasembly that s an increase from 31 percent at the start of april more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 percent and 50 percent according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations abbott s recall affected formulas including certain similac products made at a michigan plant after complaints about bacterial infections in infants who had consumed the products president joe biden met on thursday with executives from infant formula manufacturers and retailers pressing them to do everything possible to get families access retailers said their top ask is more flexibility on the types of formula they can sell while consumers need more flexibility on the types they can buy particularly through the wic program for low income families the white house said the nutrition program for women infants and children is a federal assistance scheme administered by u s states biden told reporters retailers like walmart inc were also looking for flexibility about the amounts of formula wic users could buy abbott said on friday it has shipped millions of cans of infant formula powder into the united states from its ireland facility particularly to serve consumers who use the wic program for low income families in states where abbott has the wic contract the company said it will pay rebates on competing products if similac is not available through august about half of infant formula nationwide is purchased by participants using wic benefits the white house said and rules set by individual states have a big effect on the availability and distribution of infant formula the shortage has taken an especially dangerous toll on women and children from underserved communities u s house speaker nancy pelosi said the house of representatives next week will bring up a bill to grant emergency authority to the wic program to address supply chain disruptions and recalls by relaxing non safety related regulations she said in a statement on friday pelosi also said an emergency spending bill to address the infant formula shortage would advance in the house in other measures on capitol hill the house oversight committee said it plans to investigate the four largest manufacturers of baby formula and seek answers on how to ramp up production and avoid any future shortage the committee said on friday it sent letters seeking information to abbott nutrition mead johnson nutrition nestle usa and perrigo the shortage poses a threat to families throughout the country the letter said particularly those with less income who have historically experienced health in equities two other house committees house energy and commerce and appropriations planned hearings on the issue ninety eight percent of baby formula is domestically produced and the u s regulations will not allow many external producers to import their products despite frequently higher standards because the labelling does not meet fda regulation furthermore the four companies abbott reckitt benckiser nestlé and perrigo control nearly 90 percent of the u s market for baby formula meaning that an issue in one has a huge impact swiss based nestle is the world s largest producer of baby formula french food and beverage company danone which also makes infant formulas said the unexpected abbott nutrition recall in february has led to a surge in demand in the u s market we are in discussions with the u s authorities to see how we can support them in addressing their shortages

cnn business california s efforts to mandate board diversity have been dealt another blow late last week a california judge in the superior court of los angeles ruled that the state s 2018 law requiring public companies headquartered in california to have a minimum number of women on their board violates the state s constitution the law required companies to place at least one woman on their board by the end of 2019 or face a penalty the california legislation also required companies with five directors to have at least two women by the end of 2021 and companies with six or more directors to have at least three women by the end of the same year among the reasons the judge gave for overturning the law the state failed to sufficiently prove that use of a gender based classification was necessary to boost california s economy improve opportunities for women in the workplace and protect california taxpayers public employees pensions and retirees this disappointing ruling is a reminder that sometimes our legalities don t match our realities said california senate president pro tempore toni atkins who coauthored the law in a statement more women on corporate boards means better decisions and businesses that outperform the competition that s a studied proven fact last month another california judge struck down the state s 2020 law requiring companies to have a minimum number of directors from underrepresented groups that would include people identifying as black african american hispanic latino asian pacific islander native american native hawaiian or alaska native or gay lesbian bisexual or transgender when the laws which both phased in their mandates over time were passed the expectation was that their effect would be felt beyond just company boards in california since so many companies headquartered there also operate in other states and internationally even though both laws have now been overturned the effect of the two statutes largely has already been felt said david bell co chair of the corporate governance practice at the law firm fenwick west bell noted that a longstanding fenwick annual survey on gender diversity at silicon valley firms shows a notable tick upward in women board members since the passage of the 2018 law which required companies to be in full compliance by the end of last year meanwhile the push for greater board diversity at many us corporations continues thanks to pressure from institutional investors and other stakeholders plus companies listed on the nasdaq must publicly disclose how diverse their boards are and if they don t have at least one board member who is a woman and one who is a member of an underrepresented group they must explain why like bell julie hembrock daum who leads the north american board practice of executive and board search firm spencer stuart said both california laws did boost the number of women and minorities on corporate boards particularly on boards that before were very homogenous most companies decided to take action even though they knew the laws might be struck down daum said now without the california mandates companies may not diversify their boards as quickly as they were obligated to under the struck down laws she and bell said but they both expect corporations will continue to diversify if not of their own accord then under pressure from shareholders the baseline has moved up daum said

amortization expense net interest expense income and taxes as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of when applicable expenses that are unusual or non recurring that we believe do not reflect our core operating results and non cash stock based compensation we believe that adjusted ebitda is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance for the current period and our ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes capital expenditures and debt service we understand that adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report adjusted ebitda our calculation of adjusted ebitda however may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies when assessing our operating performance investors and others should not consider this data in

in the midst of the stirring glory the musical centerpiece of the oscar nominated movie selma south side rapper common delivers a terse summation of how words melody and a protest merged during the civil rights movement we sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through he raps the blood of dozens of african americans was spilled in the first of three attempted voting rights marches to the alabama capital of montgomery from selma 50 years ago on march 7 1965 but as glory suggests the legacy of selma is hardly in the past the movement is a rhythm to us freedom is like religion to us common raps in glory then he draws a connection between the 50s civil rights pioneer rosa parks and last year s protests in ferguson mo over the police slaying of an unarmed african american resident michael brown that s why rosa sat on the bus that s why we walk through ferguson with our hands up in the months after the outrage stirred by the deaths of brown and another unarmed african american eric garner in new york singer d angelo released his first album in more than a decade black messiah which included references both glancing and startlingly direct to the chain of events between selma and ferguson all we wanted was a chance to talk he sings in charade stead we only got outlined in chalk it is the most recent evidence that the soundtrack for the civil rights movement continues to be written as newsweek said in 1964 history has never known a protest movement so rich in song in its original incarnation during the 60s african american freedom songs aimed to motivate protesters to march into harm s way and on a broader scale spread news of the struggle to a mainstream audience the gospel music of black churches spoke to a better life in the hereafter but soul r b and jazz secularized that message and speeded up the timetable so that the good life or at least an equal opportunity to live it could be experienced now as preachers and ministers such as martin luther king articulated the movement s goals artists such as chicago s curtis mayfield sam cooke and the staple singers crafted a musical counterpoint rooted in gospel but speaking the language of popular culture mayfield wrote and sang on a string of message oriented impressions singles including keep on pushing and people get ready cooke delivered the yearning a change is gonna come and there was also little milton s we re gonna make it oscar brown jr s searing driva man with max roach and abbey lincoln nina simone s mississippi goddam and the defiant repurposed spirituals and folk songs of the freedom singers all this creativity was inspired by pain struggle and bloodshed the three selma marches in 1965 aimed to draw attention to the struggle for black voting rights and proved to be a turning point in the struggle as police turned tear gas dogs and clubs on the unarmed protesters walking arm and arm across the edmund pettus bridge in selma with a ferocity that shook even the occupants of the white house pops staples patriarch of the acclaimed chicago gospel group the staple singers was touring when he saw media coverage of the event and was horrified he had become friends with king and he and his family had been appearing at rallies with him and on behalf of his civil rights agenda what he saw and experienced in the company of king politicized him if he can preach it we can sing it he told the members of his group daughters mavis and cleotha and son pervis after selma pops wrote one of the signature songs of the movement freedom highway and debuted it only a few weeks later in a concert at the new nazareth church on the south side the concert was documented on album also called freedom highway originally issued on epic records in 1965 it had since gone out of print but is finally being reissued in an expanded edition next month that secures its place as one of the great concert recordings ever an historic merger of time and place music and message singers and community the newly mastered recording puts the listener in the front pew after a stately version of we shall overcome pops staples pauses to introduce his new song from that march word was revealed and a song was composed he says and his opening guitar riff sounds like a trumpet calling citizens to action mavis cleo and pervis clap hands in intricate three part polyrhythms atop al duncan s drums and phil upchurch s driving bass line and then mavis sings pops lyrics with fierce determination despite a litany of racial slights and atrocities in african american history nothing will deter us from pushing forward she roars made up my mind and i won t turn around it s an exhilarating performance the congregation hearing the song for the first time but clapping along feverishly i wanna make heaven my home but i want to enjoy myself a little down here too pops says as the last chord fades i wonder can i get a witness tonight pops bore witness until his last days as his final recording attests don t lose this anti which will be released tuesday was recorded with his children in the years before his death in 2000 it includes the last performances of the final staple singers lineup pops mavis yvonne and cleo who died in 2013 the original late 90s recordings were stripped down by producer jeff tweedy who has worked with mavis staples on her recent solo albums he puts pops mississippi drawl and spidery guitar out front with his daughters providing backing vocals and adds some bass plus son spencer tweedy s empathetic drumming on sweet home pops and mavis duet over a treble soaked guitar as if taking stock the struggle they joined in earnest during the 60s shows no sign of abating lord i wonder will i ever get home they sing weariness frays their voices but they re still on the freedom highway greg gregkot com twitter gregkot
a pr nightmare for a beleaguered administration has finally led to a possible remedy for the baby formula quandary you got the sense of just how disorganized the biden administration is when one of their prominent mouthpieces on the most current crisis was transportation secretary pete buttigieg i don t know too many people who saw the former mayor with such limited transport experience he could not fix potholes as the logical choice to weigh in on enfamil rationing maybe he was regarded as an expert because he launched his new career with a two month paternity leave advertisement adding to the incompetence was the troubling news that as stores were going empty illegals at the border were looking at swelled shelves in immigrant holding facilities certainly there were factors like shipping and storage leading to this paradox of the babies of citizens going wanting as the gate crashers were stuffing the gobs of their toddlers but it became another face plant misstep for this administration in the starving infant fiasco even as the buck never arriving biden looks for excuses what is behind the shortage the problem is traced back to early february when the fda issued a warning about some lines of formula being recalled from a processing facility in sturgis michigan operated by abbot laboratories this is a plant that provides up to 40 percent of the national supply of baby formula it has been offline for three months and stop gap measures have been tried such as importing supplies to make up for any of this shortfall the lead question is how much of this was necessary there were some findings following inspections of the plant in january and subsequently the fda noted consumer complaints of cronobacter sakazakii and salmonella newport infections the automatic assumption was that contaminated formula was the cause following the voluntary recall of formula there were a handful of cases reported and two infant deaths reported leading to the facility being closed advertisement now questions have arisen as to whether the fda acted too broadly it was only this week when the idea that abbot might soon go back to operations was entertained it will take approximately two weeks for the plant to get back to being fully run then another six to eight weeks for their product to reach stores but was the fda correct in closing the plant abbot says it was not needed the cronobacter sakazakii that was found in environmental testing during the investigation was in non product contact areas of the facility and has not been linked to any known infant illness abbott abbottnews may 13 2022 the company has delivered its version of events and while it is just one side of the story there likely is some degree of validity or they d run the risk of incurring a further penalty for false information mind you now there is no such concern over the administration issuing false information on friday on her last day as press secretary jen psaki declared that the abbot plant was shut down due to infants who died from taking the formula except this is not accurate the fda never established a connection between the abbot formula and infants contracting illness through infection the cdc investigated the infections and through genetic sequencing of the viruses found no match to the abbot strains spotted in the factory further clearing the company was the fact that the two infants who died had unmatched strains suggesting infection from another source and cross contamination taking place inside the homes advertisement jake tapper thought he was refuting a claim made by abbot regarding the jen psaki comment he cites an article in bloomberg that was focused on an inspection report from september regarding inspections at the production plant but he seems to rest on the headline and misses the details bloomberg in its report from last week still states the abbot formula led to the infants getting sick this despite many qualifiers in its report emphasis added during a routine visit to abbott s sturgis michigan manufacturing facility in september inspectors determined that employees may have transferred contaminants including deadly cronobacter from surfaces to baby formula but the 39 page fda document reviewed by bloomberg shows that inspectors observed how the products could still become contaminated there is even an example of the plant testing its own product and pulling stock as a result of caution records showed abbott detected cronobacter in a finished batch of formula that may have been tainted by a worker who touched a contaminated surface without changing gloves that batch wasn t distributed the fda and cdc tests cleared the abbot formula of being the source of infant infections this was determined in april however and the plant was not given any clearance to return to production until today the announcement was made that the facility will be set to reopen soon and return to its production schedule this means there will be a return to something approaching normal supplies after the 4th of july advertisement it appears there is a strong desire from many sources to pin the current shortages on the abbot factory closure as a justified move as a needed safety precaution while safety is a top priority common sense and expediency could also have been applied here traits that are in even shorter supply in the government than stores currently face with formula
each day ashley beattie and her fiancé spend hours driving around bell county looking for baby formula to feed her eight month old son first h e b then walmart then target she searches until she can find something on tuesday a friend alerted her that there were eight cans of enfamil gentlease at a nearby sam s club the brand meant beattie one of nearly 200 000 texas moms whose lower income qualifies her to have her formula purchases paid for through the texas women infant and children or wic program had to quickly calculate how much that would put her budget behind yet again i feel stressed beattie said it s hard it s a lot of money being taken out of pocket since february parents across the country have been dealing with scarce supplies of baby formula after abbott nutrition one of the four major manufacturers of u s baby formula issued a february recall due to bacterial contamination resulting in a shutdown of its plant in sturgis michigan the shutdown and recall has hit retailers formula inventories hard many families have taken to their social media feeds to help locate stores with formula texas is being hit particularly hard with 52 of baby formula out of stock as of may 1 the third worst in the nation according to the retail software company datasembly both houston and san antonio are among the u s metro areas hit hardest by the shortage with houston the second worst in the u s at a 52 5 out of stock rate the data firm said but for wic moms like beattie the problem is even worse similac made by abbott was the brand she was initially told to buy with her texas wic card although texas health and human services added 75 alternative standard formula options within the first week after the abbott recall announcement in february word has not trickled down to wic users contacted by the texas tribune adding to the confusion is the fact that moms in different counties are being offered different guidance on what they can purchase with their state issued wic cards that s because according to hhsc local wic offices are telling their clients what to buy based on local supply levels and even though the state has relaxed what wic moms can buy through the program expanding the formula list to 90 brands that s not the message some moms are getting from their local offices so they re taking what they can find and paying for it themselves for beattie that meant that on tuesday she grabbed the available cans of enfamil gentlease she found at sam s club she calculates that she has been spending almost 500 a month for formula and has had to cut back on her family s other groceries sometimes she says she finds one of the brands covered by wic but it s always in a size larger than the 20 ounce she has been told by the state to buy briana vargas the texas tribune the walmart supercenter baby formula aisle in baytown on thursday i wish there was any cheaper way for this but there s not beattie said for low income mothers across texas the new expense is coming at a time of surging inflation when family budgets are already strained by rising food costs and soaring gas prices this is the worst timing for this situation said rachel cooper a senior policy analyst at every texan the left leaning policy group this would be complicated and confusing no matter what but when food prices in general are through the roof wic s ability to cover formula becomes even more important started as a pilot in 1972 and made permanent two years later the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children was designed to offer nutrition assistance to moms with children under the age of five today wic funded by the u s department of agriculture serves about half of all infants born in the united states according to a 2018 report nationwide about half of all infant formula is purchased by wic participants the biden administration said on thursday households must meet certain salary thresholds to qualify for texas wic for example a texas household of three with a gross annual income of 40 626 qualifies for the program texas health and human services commission spokesperson tiffany young told the tribune that texas wic employees have been in constant communication with both the families they serve and local wic clinics about the changing formula purchase rules the agency relies on a text messaging system to push out the latest information to their clients at this time the texas wic program and the contract formula company is covering the cost of almost any brand or size of standard milk or soy based infant formula that families can find young told the tribune in an email she said that if wic clients had any questions about whether formula purchases they should go to the texas wic website or check with the local clinics in their area texans can use this link to check if their baby formula was included in the recall young also said the agency has encouraged grocers to use maximum flexibility possible to ensure wic participants received safe formula including allowing redemption of one of the 90 additional formulas h e b confirmed to the tribune the state had informed them they could relax restrictions we have been actively coordinating with grocers in response to any reports from wic families who are having difficulty redeeming newly authorized products young said nataly romero 20 is a new mother of a 1 year old boy who lives in baytown and they re both enrolled in the texas wic program at her doctor s direction she had recently begun the transition from formula by adding milk to her baby s diet she said she spends hours each afternoon after work going from store to store with her husband looking for formula that she still needs to feed him at this time there is a wic app that tells you your benefits explained romero but on the app it did not show that i could expand to the different brands romero says she now spends 100 150 each month switching formulas is complicated by the fact that her son rejects many of the brands new to him and has reacted negatively to them after she contacted her wic office by phone romero was informed she could use two other brands she said due to the shortage if those two brands weren t in stock i would have to buy a different one out of pocket she said romero says she heard about the opportunity to switch brands after her friend sent her an article detailing how texas wic would now be covering different formulas after the recall although texas hhsc has said the agency has sent texts to wic mothers about the relaxing of what brands can be purchased romero says she never got one they should have been like just whatever you find will be covered romero said of texas wic romero s aunt veronica valencia of port arthur is also in the texas wic program and also struggling to find formula for her 10 month old twin girls valencia 35 has had to pay an extra 200 a month since the shortage started she was initially buying similac through wic but after the recall they switched her to gerber brands size 19 ounces valencia said she could never find the brand and size combination briana vargas the texas tribune baby formula on a counter in nataly romero s home everything was fine until the news came out that the formula was recalled and i stopped giving it to them valencia said in spanish i talked to wic they changed it for me but there wasn t any of what they gave me and i went to the stores on my own to look for the formula and all of the cans that i bought were out of pocket you had to buy them before the shortage texas wic normally covered the cost of one specific brand and size can of formula for mothers unless parents can provide a reason like an allergy why their child cannot use the state assigned brand most infants rely at least partially on formula about one in five breastfed infants in texas received formula in their first two days of life baby formula is critical to the neurological and nutritional development of children and is often the only option mothers have when lactating isn t possible for them also babies often grow dependent on one type of formula and switching formulas abruptly can cause the baby to throw it up or suffer a severe stomach ache infants have sensitivity to different foods and if they re introduced to something new at a young age then they re hypersensitive to it said rola el serag director of the baker institute s center for health and biosciences at rice university although texas mothers have been dealing with the formula shortages since february it was not until this week that gov greg abbott made his first public statement about it and only to condemn the biden administration for allowing the babies of undocumented families held in detention centers to receive formula president biden has turned a blind eye to parents across america who are facing the nightmare of a nationwide baby formula shortage the joint statement read while mothers and fathers stare at empty grocery store shelves in a panic the biden administration is happy to provide baby formula to illegal immigrants coming across our southern border in a statement to the tribune the usda acknowledged the ongoing shortages and said the agency takes seriously its role in safeguarding the health of families served by our wic program we know that this situation is causing stress and anxiety for many families the statement read usda is committed to providing technical assistance and maximum flexibility including regulatory waivers for state agencies as they work with their infant formula rebate contractors and other stakeholders to respond to the recent recall beattie romero and valencia all said beyond being costly the shortage and the relentless search for formula has caused them so much stress moms panic romero said you want to have food for your baby alexa ura contributed to this report disclosure every texan h e b and rice university have been

website at definitions non gaap financial measures funds from operations ffo the company evaluates performance based on funds from operations which we refer to as ffo as management believes that ffo represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders the company defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property hedge ineffectiveness acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized and lease acquisition costs that are not capitalized plus depreciation and amortization including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non consolidated reits and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from and to include the proportionate share of ffo from non consolidated reits however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization as well as the changes in the value of the company s properties that result from use or market conditions each of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company s results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of the company s performance is limited in addition other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as the company does and accordingly the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits ffo accordingly ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company s performance core funds from operations core ffo we calculate core ffo by using ffo as defined by nareit and adjusting for certain other non core items we also exclude from our core ffo calculation acquisition costs loss on early extinguishment of debt changes in the fair value of the earn out changes in fair value of contingent consideration non cash warrant dividends and the amortization of stock based compensation we believe core ffo provides a useful metric in comparing operations between reporting periods and in assessing the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance other equity reits may calculate core ffo differently or not at all and accordingly the company s core ffo may not be comparable to such other reits core ffo cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this press release

as prices soar in the international grain trade india has issued a sudden ban on wheat exports in order to support stable domestic prices and supply levels a brutal heat wave is expected to take a toll on india s grain production this year cutting into the indian government s hopes to increase exports amidst a tight global market india holds about 10 percent of the world s stored grain reserves and these tonnes are badly needed in the global market due to the loss of export volume from ukraine the russian invasion has shuttered all ukrainian seaports leaving one of the world s leading wheat exporters without a viable route to market for its crops between them russia and ukraine supply about 30 percent of the world s wheat and barley according to the world food programme wfp the indian government signaled last month that it would open its granaries and sell wheat to the world viewing it as an opportunity for farmers to capitalize on high international prices however the crushing heat wave that has hit the indian subcontinent has raised fears of a bad harvest in 2022 harish damodaraan a senior fellow at the centre for policy research in delhi told cnbc that yields are expected to fall by 15 20 percent in the most affected regions in response india s commerce department announced friday that it would ban all wheat exports that do not already have a letter of credit secured it will allow limited exceptions for exports to nations with vulnerable food supplies according to reuters the sudden ban is creating significant challenges for india s commodity traders who may have to declare force majeure on planned shipments that do not already have a letter of credit attached it is a stunning turnaround since official government policy had encouraged farmers to export their crop right up until the day of the ban now export bound stocks that are trapped in storage will have to be resold on india s domestic market and likely at a lower price helping to ensure an adequate food supply at a reduced rate of inflation for indian consumers while it may benefit the indian public in the near term the decision threatens to further increase the price of wheat for developing nations like syria and yemen which have already been hit hard by the shutdown of ukraine s grain terminals global wheat prices rose 20 percent in march contributing to inflationary pressures that are forcing the world food programme to buy less and cut aid rations in war torn and famine stricken regions the latest data from the international food policy research institute s food trade policy tracker show that since the ukraine invasion 23 countries have imposed export restrictions on food noted wfp chief economist dr arif husain in a bulletin issued monday it is critical that wto facilitates coordination between governments and encourages major countries holding reserves such as china india and the united states to release grain stocks onto international markets top image wheat harvest in central india scott wallace world bank cc by nc nd 2 0

by jeanne sahadi cnn business california s efforts to mandate board diversity have been dealt another blow late last week a california judge in the superior court of los angeles ruled that the state s 2018 law requiring public companies headquartered in california to have a minimum number of women on their board violates the state s constitution the law required companies to place at least one woman on their board by the end of 2019 or face a penalty the california legislation also required companies with five directors to have at least two women by the end of 2021 and companies with six or more directors to have at least three women by the end of the same year among the reasons the judge gave for overturning the law the state failed to sufficiently prove that use of a gender based classification was necessary to boost california s economy improve opportunities for women in the workplace and protect california taxpayers public employees pensions and retirees this disappointing ruling is a reminder that sometimes our legalities don t match our realities said california senate president pro tempore toni atkins who coauthored the law in a statement more women on corporate boards means better decisions and businesses that outperform the competition that s a studied proven fact last month another california judge struck down the state s 2020 law requiring companies to have a minimum number of directors from underrepresented groups that would include people identifying as black african american hispanic latino asian pacific islander native american native hawaiian or alaska native or gay lesbian bisexual or transgender when the laws which both phased in their mandates over time were passed the expectation was that their effect would be felt beyond just company boards in california since so many companies headquartered there also operate in other states and internationally even though both laws have now been overturned the effect of the two statutes largely has already been felt said david bell co chair of the corporate governance practice at the law firm fenwick west bell noted that a longstanding fenwick annual survey on gender diversity at silicon valley firms shows a notable tick upward in women board members since the passage of the 2018 law which required companies to be in full compliance by the end of last year meanwhile the push for greater board diversity at many us corporations continues thanks to pressure from institutional investors and other stakeholders plus companies listed on the nasdaq must publicly disclose how diverse their boards are and if they don t have at least one board member who is a woman and one who is a member of an underrepresented group they must explain why like bell julie hembrock daum who leads the north american board practice of executive and board search firm spencer stuart said both california laws did boost the number of women and minorities on corporate boards particularly on boards that before were very homogenous most companies decided to take action even though they knew the laws might be struck down daum said now without the california mandates companies may not diversify their boards as quickly as they were obligated to under the struck down laws she and bell said but they both expect corporations will continue to diversify if not of their own accord then under pressure from shareholders the baseline has moved up daum said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
press release science media centre the government has released its first plan on how to get to zero carbon emissions by 2050 the emissions reduction plan proposes economy wide changes to drive down new zealands emissions the smc asked experts to comment on an overview of the the government has released its first plan on how to get to zero carbon emissions by 2050 the emissions reduction plan proposes economy wide changes to drive down new zealand s emissions the smc asked experts to comment on overview emeritus professor ralph sims sustainable energy and climate mitigation comments well the emission reduction plan is yet another step forward in meeting targets but i don t detect any urgency most controversial issues suggested by the climate change commission have been deferred such as banning the import of petrol diesel vehicles by 2025 setting up a centre for climate action on agricultural emissions involves further r d investment to reduce biogenic methane nitrous oxides which is a good thing as we need to throw money at r d but we ve had the well funded nz greenhouse gas research centre aiming to achieve these goals for almost a decade without any tangible success in actually reducing emissions on farms the minister of agriculture emphasised r d on the potential for producing sustainable aviation fuels from woody biomass i e biofuels from short rotation forests but he doesn t seem to know that r d investment on achieving this goal has been underway in nz for over 4 decades but without commercial success to date so can we keep waiting for a breakthrough this is the problem with the emissions reduction plan there is little or no immediate action evident to significantly reduce emissions during the first 4 year budget but starting now the royal society report in 2016 transition to a low carbon economy for nz and several other reports from several years ago covered most of the mitigation options outlined in the plan so there is little in the plan that is new challenging and exciting as a way forward that will highlight nz internationally the ban on off shore oil gas exploration announced soon after this labour government came into power in 2017 hit world headlines nothing in this plan will have such an international impact where is the instant ban on further coal exploration there is a ban on installing new coal boilers but phasing out existing coal plants is not due till 2037 where is the regulation that no new buildings will have a natural gas connection there is a gas transition plan due in 2023 but a simple ambitious regulation could easily have been brought in immediately where is the directive to waka kotahi that all of their future investment decisions must demonstrate a significant carbon reduction before they can proceed some guidelines to reduce transport emissions have been outlined in government policy statements on land transport but the nz transport agency has failed to implement them where are the essential changes to the building code that we know has been in need of major review for several years there are incentives to improve insulation and an acknowledgement that many building materials are high carbon e g cement steel but no incentives for immediate change given that a building today will be consuming energy for heating cooling appliances for many decades overall the plan reads as being aspirational rather than having the ambition necessary climate change is here forever the recent ipcc mitigation report does show that using known low carbon technologies and incentivising behavioural change will help us stay below a 2 degree centigrade temperature rise we are not going to stay below 1 5 degrees as was the main target in the paris agreement given there is cross party political support for the three carbon budgets some more stringent policies could have been hoped for i would put money on nz s gross emissions continuing to rise for some years yet no conflict of interest professor bronwyn hayward director of hei puāwaitanga sustainable development and civic imagination research group canterbury university comments it s easy to be cynical but i do feel quietly optimistic that finally this is an emissions plan that starts us as a nation on a new journey of clearly reporting and measuring the difference we are making for our climate and our community having the climate commission regularly assess our progress is a very real difference to anything we ve had in the past all evidence shows that the countries that are able to sustain downward emissions reductions while also protecting populations are countries that that have an independent plan and an independent agency to assess performance over time this is why it matters that the nz climate commission sets out the budget for the amount of heat trapping gas we can produce as a country and assesses our performance their independence is crucial this emissions reduction plan makes a very big investment to diversify away from high methane emission agricultural practices with an initial 338 million dollars to be spent on research in the sector understanding what is to be commissioned from that research investment will be crucial to assessing how it helps move us towards a lower emissions and fairer economy transport also makes up a significant and rapidly growing proportion of our emissions so today s announcement of a range of transport investments from significant spending on public transport to trialling a scheme for trading in old cars owned by middle and low income families is welcome our transport stock is old and we don t have easy ways to quickly transition it to an integrated regional low carbon active transport system there is much long term work we need to do to turn around an economy which has produced the second highest rates of emissions per capita in the oecd lobby groups resisting change over the past 30 years in new zealand have come from all sides of the political spectrum but slowly that is changing as new voices with broader experience and more training have stepped up into leadership positions in all sectors pushed by an increasingly climate aware public particularly amongst younger voters in addition recent news of the impact of sea level rise in our shaky islands alongside our experiences of flood events droughts and now fuel price hikes have brought a harsh reality check to our climate conversations our communities now expect better protection from their government and our trade partners will increasingly expect we play our part in cutting global emissions this emissions reduction plan won t grab votes but as a nation we have to take long term practical steps to fundamentally change our economy the way we live our lives build our homes and protect our people we can t afford political magical thinking any more today we finally started to take our first steps on a long delayed journey towards a fairer low emission and more secure future for everyone no conflict of interest dr sara mikaloff fletcher principal scientist carbon chemistry and modelling niwa comments rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions must be the heart of any realistic plan to reach zero carbon the government s emission reduction plan lays out a clear pathway to cut emissions from transport stationary power agriculture and waste which is essential if we are to limit climate change in addition to emissions reductions carbon uptake by forests and other ecosystems can play a vital role in slowing climate change the emission reduction plan envisages a future in which aotearoa new zealand s land management strategy fosters both sustainable long term carbon uptake from our environment and supports our biodiversity goals our emissions trading scheme currently incentivises planting exotic trees over indigenous trees because exotic trees grow more rapidly and are thought to absorb carbon more quickly in the short term the emissions reduction plan supports a transition towards planting permanent indigenous forests to absorb carbon and restoring the forests we have while pine trees and many other widely used exotic species are relatively short lived native forests planted today can continue to absorb carbon for hundreds of years and come with a wealth of environmental co benefits in addition new estimates of forest carbon uptake based on atmospheric data suggest that native forests may absorb more carbon than previously thought looking beyond forests the plan highlights other ecosystems such as wetlands coastal areas and peatlands that could play a role the strategy laid out in the emissions reduction plan represents a welcome shift towards long term wholistic thinking around how aotearoa new zealand can care for our lands to support both our climate and biodiversity goals yet there are risks associated with both continued reliance of on forest carbon uptake and the proposed shift towards indigenous forests multiple lines of evidence from overseas research show that forest carbon uptake has started to slow or even reverse due to forest degradation and climate change this is likely to accelerate with future change as rising temperatures and changing weather patterns impact ecosystems around the world but it is not yet known how resilient nz s indigenous forests are to these changes a clear view of how our changing climate will impact native forests is essential to ensure the success of this plan no conflict of interest declared professor lisa ellis director of the philosophy politics and economics programme university of otago and member of he kaupapa hononga otago s climate change research network comments the good news from today s release of our first emissions reduction plan is that we finally have the legal and political infrastructure to drive the transition to a sustainable and equitable low emissions economy the mechanisms put in place with cross party support under the climate change response zero carbon act 2019 are working to produce at least the outlines of a path that would bring aotearoa new zealand to net zero by 2050 among the most important of these mechanisms is he pou a rangi the climate change commission charged with setting science based targets and plans for achieving them while remaining above the political fray last week the government announced targets in line with the commission s recommended emissions budgets four of five parliamentary parties confirmed that decision after a special debate on thursday this is all good news because it is hard to imagine successful transition without the reality check that independent science based targets provide the bad news from monday s announcement is that these emissions budgets are unfair and insufficient while the plan to implement even these weak targets is unlikely to succeed we know that greenhouse gases must be halved by 2030 if we are to keep the hope of a climate stable world alive and emissions of short lived high impact gases including methane must fall even faster as a country with one of the world s highest per capita emissions we have a responsibility to do our fair share by taking prompt action to prevent runaway climate change postponing substantial action yet again undermines our clean green image and our status as a good pacific neighbour despite that bad news we can still hope that the infrastructure for climate action now in place will eventually do its job pushing us toward the low emissions economy that will be better for us all no conflict of interest adjunct professor martin manning new zealand climate change research institute school of geography environment and earth sciences victoria university of wellington comments new zealand s emissions reduction plan covers what seems reasonable rather than what is needed a sense of urgency is buried under the details of a policy framework that is still being constructed and this while the world meteorological organization has just shown there is a 50 chance we will go over the 1 5 c target temporarily in the next five years the clean vehicle discount terminated in march reinstating that and bringing in additional support for low income people is highly commendable but lack of details shows a policy still under development how will it deal with low income people already having an average debt to the ministry of social development of 7 000 pricing of agricultural emissions by 2025 is important but it s still contentious as to whether these targets are consistent with the paris accord the intergovernmental panel on climate change scenario for the 1 5 c target has methane decreasing by 47 from 2020 to 2050 but that is the limit for new zealand reductions we are proposing a 10 cut in methane emissions by 2030 while the global methane pledge adopted at the united nations 2021 climate conference in glasgow set the target of a 30 cut by 2030 there can be reasons for new zealand being different but that should be made clear in a plan facing international scrutiny marginal changes in co2 uptake by new zealand forestry ignore the potential for reversing large scale deforestation that occurred in the past the one billion trees program was a start but has now stopped taking new projects and will cover just 260 km2 less than 0 1 of the land previously cleared by human activities as dame anne salmond showed our history shows a total misuse of land that must be reversed dramatically no conflict of interest declared dr gabriela baron design for sustainability conservation and social innovation university of auckland comments the emissions reduction plan presents a comprehensive roadmap that lists actions to transition to a zero emission 2050 for nz while its objectives focus on the socio cultural well being of new zealanders the actions presented in this plan are mostly technocratic technology will not save us from climate change as climate change is a political problem more than a technical one this report considers no limits to growth and no attempts for de growth only an attempt to have a de carbonized growth through technology and policy this means that there is no change in our economic paradigms just a greening of the same thinking that created the unsustainable situation that we find ourselves in this growth is inequitable the ongoing accumulation of wealth will further widen the gap between the wealthy and the most vulnerable what would de growth look like in nz only like a re distribution of wealth and a mindset of permanence of deep connection to the land where you are actually living in we need our representatives to set limits to the growth of corporations and focus on prosperity for all this means improving our living standards and still having a lower environmental impact while regenerating trust social cohesion equity and our natural habitats we are again losing an opportunity to set a courageous international example by genuinely basing decision making on mātauranga māori in this report the approach to indigenous worldviews is timid and sectorial as it is not informing the overarching guiding principles behind this economy centred action plan we cannot have genuine kaitiakitanga with a capitalist mindset hapori and papatūānuku must come before profit no conflict of interest declared transport adjunct professor ralph chapman school of geography environment and earth sciences victoria university of wellington comments the plan involves pretty modest total emission reductions in the first budget period less than 3 reduction in the 4 years to 2025 however the reductions increase and the 41 reduction targeted for 2035 is almost sufficient in terms of nz s playing its part overall in terms of the ipcc s advice based on the 1 5 degree target a more ambitious target would better allow for the risk of opposition under achievement of goals and the risk that the science will present us with more bad news in future reducing the overall emissions intensity of transport fuel by only 10 by 2035 is riskily slow with climate change delivering slowly is losing the heavy emphasis on public transport and improving active transport and shared transport is very encouraging nz needs to do this the plan will overall generate significant co benefits such as better health and better places to live that will come out of nz s transition to a low emissions transport system some of the policies such as improved urban form are highly desirable but will be slow to deliver changing the way we plan our towns and cities to make it easier and safer for people to reduce car travel is critical but will take time it s disappointing that the date set for phasing out imports of fossil cars is 2035 and not earlier e g 2032 it s also disappointing that the clean vehicle scheme which is an effective policy is not sharpened up the vehicle social leasing scheme might work but only alongside the more important policies of encouraging active and public transport it could have the undesirable effect of maintaining car dependence the vehicle scrap and replace scheme is likely expensive as a means of cutting emissions and again will have the undesirable effect of maintaining car dependence supporting the freight sector to purchase low emissions trucks could distort choices to the detriment of using rail and coastal shipping this policy needs to be accompanied by regulation to limit unnecessary use of trucking a sustainable biofuels obligation is desirable no conflict of interest declared distinguished professor robert mclachlan school of mathematical and computational sciences massey university comments the plan delivers or starts the process of delivering widespread changes the evidence is clear that most sectors are not on track to meet the carbon budgets and that the emissions trading scheme by itself will not do enough the direct funding 2 9 billion over four years is a good start for example new zealand has fairly high industrial emissions and the only significant changes until now are to close marsden and possibly tiwai point if industry needs money to prompt them to make the transition then so be it although it does risk creating moral hazard the freight emissions target has been strengthened from 25 to 35 cuts by 2035 which is welcome the biofuel target has been weakened from 15 to 10 cuts by 2035 which probably reflects the high level of uncertainty and technical difficulty here the reduction in driving is held at 20 by 2035 and it is good to see that targets for every city will be developed this year with detailed plans to follow a key step will be to develop the details on the proposal to incentivise local government to quickly deliver bike scooter networks dedicated bus lanes and walking improvements by reallocating street space including during street renewals it s also very good to see the initiative to establish a high threshold for new investment to expand roads including new highway projects if the expansion is inconsistent with emissions reduction objectives just two new highways could easily cost as much as the entire erp package and risk increasing car usage unfortunately there is no date yet for an end to the import of fossil fuelled cars and the big emissions reductions in transport are still pushed out to the 2030s it is disappointing to see the ban on coal remaining at 2037 many argued that this should be brought forward the initiative to establish a public private leadership body focused on decarbonising aviation is welcome the uk and eu are well ahead of us in their work in this area no conflict of interest agriculture dr robyn dynes senior scientist agresearch comments farmers are crying out for solutions to help them lower their agricultural greenhouse gas emissions so any new investment and impetus in the area of research and development is welcome while we have made progress in new zealand on farming practices and approaches such as breeding animals for lower methane emissions the development of new tools such as inhibitors vaccines or emission reducing feeds that can be applied to livestock invariably take a lot of time and resource greater investment allows more resources to be applied to accelerate the development of solutions any new tools imported from overseas also need to meet new zealand s regulatory requirements and need to be suitable for and deliver benefits to our farming systems that typically revolve around year round grazing livestock outdoors on pasture a lot of effort has gone into government iwi industry and science working together in the agricultural emissions space with an acknowledgement that everyone needs to play their part this is where the focus needs to remain on the research and development if we are to generate the tools and practices that help new zealand meet its climate change targets the he waka eke noa partnership which the science has fed into is an important partnership for decision making on how to price agricultural emissions into the future no conflict of interest declared professor craig bunt director of agricultural innovation programme university of otago comments the government s emissions reduction plan encourages technology and innovation without excessively adding more restriction on farming activities capping nitrogen fertilizer to less than 190 kilograms per hectare per year will encourage the use of fertilisers that reduce emissions such as urease and nitrification inhibitors and slow release products not adopting a blanket ban on so called synthetic nitrogen recognises agriculture requires nitrogen to grow plants combining a cap with technologies that more precisely delivery sufficient nitrogen to plants will lead to improved efficiency farming will respond by moving further away from the use of inefficient immediate release fertilizer to those that are more sustainable with reduced environmental impacts and emissions it is particularly encouraging to see the establishment of a new centre for climate action on agricultural emissions how the centre will drive emissions reduction technologies via a step change in research development and commercialisation will be a challenging investment to accelerate the development of greenhouse gas mitigations via a new public private joint venture with a focus on product development and commercialisation should be driven by further research but if it is to faster develop commercialise and enable uptake of emissions mitigation technologies those responsible for the new centre will need to be familiar with science led industry adoption of new and innovative technologies it will be interesting to see who an enhanced new zealand agricultural greenhouse gas research centre will partner with in the private sector for this new joint venture the introduction of emissions pricing for agriculture from 2025 could encourage early adoption of on farm changes to reduce emissions however the support for those early adopters will need to be considerable and what the government is considering should be introduced as quickly as possible considering the short timeframe acceleration of on farm trials of overseas technologies to adapt them for the aotearoa pastoral farming context should be approached with caution as research how best to do this will need to be directly transferable to or independently conducted here to validate these technologies regenerative agriculture is touched on lightly and mention of it in aotearoa new zealand s specific context should be expanded on regenerative agriculture practices cannot be simply uplifted from elsewhere and slotted into farming without appropriate research the potential for regenerative agriculture to increase soil carbon improve soil health and contribute to improved freshwater quality reduce the climate footprint of food systems and enhance biodiversity will require funded research focusing on the new zealand farming situation no conflict of interest energy dr john burnell energy futures research leader and senior geothermal modeller gns science comments te pū ao gns science has a strong focus on environment and climate and energy futures research including the climate system geothermal energy monitoring and understanding of the carbon cycle and materials for hydrogen production gns supports the intent of the emissions reduction plan as the first steps of aotearoa new zealand s path to net zero by 2050 energy powers our economy and underpins the wellbeing of our communities like other countries we are grappling with how we can meet changing demands for energy without causing irreversible impacts to our environment the proposed reductions in energy emissions will be challenging and require a significant transformation in both infrastructure and behaviour consideration must be given to the whole energy system during implementation to prevent actions in one sector negatively impact other sectors for example plans to increase zero emissions vehicles to 30 of the light fleet by 2035 will have implications for electricity generation currently 60 of our energy comes from fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases when used the electricity sector is crucial in our transition from these fossil fuels and must grow in a way that is sustainable resilient and affordable with oversight from central government we should be prepared to take a pragmatic approach to making choices based on the greatest reduction in overall emissions and not focus on individual outcomes transforming our energy system will require innovation and new technologies aotearoa new zealand has some unique advantages that we should build on for example a zone of unique high heat flow in the central part of the north island preliminary estimates suggest there are large amounts of energy stored in deep superhot geothermal systems in this zone that could provide all aotearoa new zealand s energy needs for hundreds of years no conflict of interest declared building construction distinguished professor philippa howden chapman department of public health university of otago comments most of today s existing buildings will still be in use by 2035 and lock in energy requirements so urgent action must be taken to remediate them as well as to improve quality standards for new buildings the birth of the building code which last received a major review in 2008 appears to be stuck in a breach delivery with spasms of consultation with companies about ventilation and insulation standards this is delaying the birth of world class building standards which can reduce embodied carbon immediately in the middle of the climate crisis and with cost of living a major issue aotearoa cannot afford to yet again be making piecemeal moves that will fail to reduce emissions and make homes more expensive to heat we know all too well that the quality of housing has a major effect on people s health and well being we must make a major investment now to retrofit insulation and heating in all houses if ireland which like us has a high proportion of households in fuel poverty can do it so can we to make essential progress to zero carbon by 2035 clear and consistent targets regulations and incentives need to be put in place that take account of the costs to low income households as well as the co benefits of sustainable buildings and associated renewable energy supplies the government s plan is indeed a step forward and outlines the welcome construction innovations kāinga ora homes and communities is building but it emphasises options rather than decisive implementation of energy certificates and other regulations the plan needs to signal the climate emergency by using strong incentives for companies to meet improved regulations and serious penalties if they are ignored if new york city with a population twice the size of aotearoa new zealand can enforce green building regulations for new buildings to be 100 percent net zero by 2030 so can we conflict of interest statement i m on the board of kainga ora but i m writing as an academic waste dr jeff seadon senior lecturer school of future environments aut comments the plan proposes encouraging behaviour to prevent waste at home broad brush national campaigns have shown to have little impact on waste quantities but are a nice feelgood action to demonstrate the government has recognised there is an issue targeting food and hospitality businesses to reduce food waste and separate out organic waste can make a significant difference provided the cost of separation is not exorbitant the people in food businesses can be easily trained to divert food waste from the general waste collection the success of kerbside collections depends on households using them correctly the increasing rates of contamination in the current kerbside recycling systems indicate that there will be a significant change to get low contamination levels in kerbside food collections food waste processors will need to have a contamination separation process in operation to make kerbside food waste collection viable garden waste is predominantly covered by private collectors who have been operating for several decades successfully and while a licensing system could be useful to maintain integrity further regulation is not necessary for areas with established operations investing in organic waste processing and resource recovery infrastructure is a necessity but moving these wastes over long distances raises the issue of carbon emissions emitted by transportation localisation of industry also supports local job creation in a variety of skill levels the key areas of waste in the building and construction sector are in the design procurement and onsite stages at least a third of all construction waste occurs at the design stage another 5 20 at procurement and the rest on site improving skill levels of on site employees can significantly reduce waste and the need to redo work of poor quality deconstruction rather than demolition can divert large quantities of waste to landfills however there needs to be a concurrent development of secondary markets to provide outlets to utilise these materials investing in sorting and processing infrastructure for construction and demolition waste will be a necessity along with establishing larger onshore markets for diverted products the investigation into banning organic waste from landfill by 2030 seems like it will be fruitless since who will notice a banana skin tucked in with the rest of the rubbish unless there are whole bins of organic waste being disposed of monitoring will be very difficult all modern large landfills consented since 1991 already have landfill gas capture in place and these landfills are world class smaller older landfills can be caught in the plan s regulations requiring gas capture which may cause more of them to close accessing accurate waste data has long been a difficulty for planning purposes and the proposal to develop a national waste licensing scheme saves each council from having to develop their own bylaws improving information on greenhouse gas emissions from waste disposal will be a necessity to enable better

growing demand for autonomous trains increasing demand for freight transportation and growing demand for subways metros are some of the major trends affecting the rolling stock market the rolling stock market size is projected to grow from usd 53 8 billion in 2022 to usd 64 8 billion by 2027 at a cagr of 3 8 the rising demand for energy efficient green transportation has increased the electrification rate of railway networks globally moreover growing traffic congestion increasing population and rapid urbanization have further increased the demand for efficient intra city transportation globally thereby the governments of various countries have started planning for new transportation routes for the cities as a result various new metro and suburban railway projects are coming up in various countries this is expected to increase the demand for rolling stocks all over the world in the coming years the rolling stock market is dominated by global players such as crrc corporation limited china alstom sa france siemens ag germany wabtec corporation us kawasaki heavy industries ltd japan stadler rail ag switzerland caf group spain hyundai rotem company south korea mitsubishi heavy industries engineering ltd japan talgo spain transmashholding russia and others download pdf brochure passenger coaches are expected to witness the fastest growth in the passenger transportation segment of the global rolling stock market during the forecast period the availability of robust infrastructure for both urban and intercity transport for mass transit in various countries especially in asian countries is the major factor driving the adoption of railways for passenger transportation globally there has been an increase in the ridership of passenger trains which is likely to propel the demand for passenger coaches globally apart from this passengers prefer railway transportation to cover remote distances as well owing to the wide connectivity of railway networks therefore the demand for passenger coaches is growing at a steady pace globally urbanization is also another major driver of the growth of passenger transportation by railways according to the world health organization who 2020 the urban population is projected to account for 60 of the global population by 2030 hence increasing urbanization is expected to further boost the market for passenger transportation in the coming years therefore the demand for passenger coaches is likely to grow at the fastest rate in the passenger transportation segment during the forecast period globally by application type the freight transportation segment is expected to be the largest during the forecast period cost savings government funding high efficiency and reliability are the major drivers of the growth of freight transportation in this market increasing government funding is expected to create a robust infrastructure for freight transportation moreover the increasing need for effective transportation of industrial as well as commercial goods is boosting the growth of the rolling stock market for freight transportation rail transportation is more efficient and cost effective than other modes of transportation therefore various countries are promoting the use of rolling stock for freight transportation for example in 2020 france announced doubling freight transportation from 9 2020 to 18 by 2030 in the fiscal year 2021 22 till august 2021 freight transportation accounted for a share of 79 1 of the total revenue generated by the indian railways hence it is expected that the demand for freight transportation is likely to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years globally inquiry before buying asia oceania is projected to hold the largest share by 2027 asia oceania is expected to account for the largest market share in terms of volume by 2027 significant urbanization coupled with significant volumes of goods transported through rail increased demand for the metro rail network and dedicated railway freight corridors are the factors driving the demand for rolling stocks in this region apart from this owing to increased production domestic demand capacity expansions by rolling stock manufacturers and larger order intake volume the region dominates this market globally this increase in production helps to cope with the rising demand for rail transportation and concerns related to fuel efficiency norms and regulations in addition to domestic markets there is an increase in demand from international markets for example in february 2021 crrc corporation limited won a supply contract of supplying 10 diesel locomotives to kiwirail of new zealand and the company won a supply contract of supplying 100 trams to bucharest town hall of romania in the same year moreover the region comprises some of the fastest growing economies in the world including china and india offering opportunities for rolling stock manufacturers governments in these

my how times have changed earlier this year nascar seemed poised to propose allowing teams almost unlimited testing dates for next season then the economy hit the skids and a week and a half ago a new policy was announced instead that will ban all cup teams from testing at all at least on tracks that hold nascar sanctioned races effective jan 1 2009 the really stunning part of this announcement was that the traditional preseason tests in preparation for the daytona 500 are also included on the list it wasn t that many years ago that nascar was trying to market those weeks as a must see fan event with driver meet and greets intended to eliminate the t wayne roberts charity event at charlotte where fans lined up to get a look at the new season s cars in their race livery and gather a few autographs as one of nascar s harshest critics or at least one of its harshest critics in the media i have to give credit where credit is due in this instance i think the powers that be made a decision with the best of intentions there s no doubting that all of us from the fans right on up to the top team owners are living in tough economic times right now i m not smart enough to know if the u s economy is in recession or on the brink of depression but i know from the stock market to the supermarket the average american is frightened right now possessing a rather gloomy view of the future ahead i know the big three automakers are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and in a worst case scenario if all three were to fail one in 10 americans would be added to the rolls of the unemployed a lot of big name race teams are at risk of going out of business especially with sponsorship money so hard to find right now and so many teams looking for backing it doesn t help that the spending on the cup side of the garage area has gone insane because reality is finally intruding its ugly little head into matters on the face of it all you d think eliminating testing will save teams millions of dollars a year and help them get by with limited or reduced spending and that s a good thing but as i reflect further on the testing ban i have my concerns first and foremost i am aware it s going to put an awful lot of hard working men and women who work for cup teams out of a job last monday was termed black monday in mooresville as a lot of employees of even the top teams learned that despite their best efforts the end of the 2008 season also meant the end of their employment i am mindful that these are real men and women who have been receiving decent paychecks and using them to raise families pay mortgages and make car payments now through no fault of their own they are suddenly out of work and with the current unemployment rate and almost all teams cutting back they have limited opportunities to find employment at the cup level or even working for a nationwide or truck series team most of these smart skilled and hard working folks shown the door were people who chased their dreams relentlessly to make it to the top level of this sport you or i might not know their names but we see their accomplishments in an era where small block engines akin except in the case of toyotas to what we drove on the streets in the 70s can routinely rev to 9 500 rpm and hurtle boxy stock cars to speeds over 200 mph maybe some of them will find work as mechanics at local repair shops and dealerships but only at greatly diminished rates of pay at least those fortunate ones will have jobs of course things have gotten out of hand when the big teams have testing teams never intended to field entries in the cup series but solely to develop and experiment with new cars and ideas for the real cup teams testing is hideously expensive and it s time even guys like roush and hendrick sober up and realize spending at the cup level has gotten totally out of hand but that doesn t change my concern for a fellow who worked hard and did a good job suddenly having to walk into his home he has a 30 year mortgage on after parking his heavily financed pickup truck to tell his pregnant wife he is unexpectedly unemployed and not sure what to do next i ve been there despite doing my best i lost a once good paying job when the internet bubble burst and it sucked i feel nothing but empathy for the newly unemployed and as a side note here i want to remind those of you reading this that sudden and unexpected unemployment isn t solely a nascar issue it s an issue hitting folks in our neighborhoods hard as well among those suddenly unemployed are our brave soldiers returning from a war fought on two fronts many with dehabilitating injuries that have changed their lives forever if you are fortunate enough to still have a job you need to consider tightening your belt another notch to give to charities that support our wounded gis as well as those that will give the less fortunate a decent thanksgiving dinner or a few toys for children who might not otherwise have gifts this christmas i am also concerned the testing ban is going to have unintended consequences on and off the racetrack this season has been dominated by three super teams that are still sitting flush with solid sponsorships proven race winning cars and large budgets as such i fear the testing ban could allow the big three gibbs roush and hendrick to exploit their financial strength to further distance themselves from the best of the rest or perhaps given the current economic climate the best of what s left roush and hendrick have previously considered and proposed building test tracks for their organizations and can still afford to do so zoning considerations might keep them from developing such test tracks at their current locations but there s nothing stopping them from building them somewhere out in the wilderness of wyoming especially considering they can afford to truck test cars and fly test personnel out there if the big three don t control their spending this could be a classic example of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer even lacking private test tracks the big organizations have a decided advantage over the smaller teams with their seven post shaker rigs computer simulations and wind tunnel time that aren t limited under the testing ban the big multi car teams also already have the advantage of sharing notes between several teams i d hate to see this sport dominated by three teams and their satellite organizations even while storied teams like petty engineering and the wood brothers fall by the wayside leaving unemployed workers in their wake and traditional fans like me heartsick but it s a distinct possibility i also have concerns for the next crop of rookie drivers unlike the old days when freshmen earned their stripes running for lesser funded teams and even had a couple of years to get up to speed once they signed on with a big organization nowadays rookies are expected to run competitively from the get go and to be able to run with the big dogs rookies have traditionally been able to do more testing to get themselves acclimated to the new cars and tracks where they will be competing the testing ban is going to hamper that effort and if i was joey logano right now i d be sweating bullets the same goes for the new teams of tony stewart and ryan newman who have to enter next year s daytona 500 with limited track time teams and drivers need time to get acclimated to each other and the less opportunity they have to spend together before the season starts paying points makes it a steeper mountain to climb if they experience early trouble i also have concerns on how the testing ban is going to affect the quality of racing we as fans see next year none of the big three teams much less the smaller outfits seem to have their arms completely around the car of sorrow quite yet instead everybody is still trying to sort out what these cars need to run competitively side by side and nose to tail a ban on testing with no points on the table limits the teams abilities to sort these new cars out so we as fans can see good racing again after a season notably lacking in many good races the economic meltdown has hit the sport at a vulnerable time were it to have happened a year ago nascar might have put the new car program on hold this year as they did with the nationwide series but with team owners having spent millions to convert their fleets to the car of horror already there s no turning back now that leaves track owners having to promote less competitive and exciting races to fans facing harsh economic realities themselves and thus unwilling to buy all those high priced seats given enough testing perhaps the team engineers could find a way to make these new cars able to run in close quarters and side by side but given the current economic reality and testing ban that s almost certainly not going to happen and if the quality of the racing doesn t improve then almost certainly there will be less fans in the grandstands next year if that trend is allowed to run its course i can certainly envision the sport imploding into itself at least nascar racing as we ve come to accept it and possibly cease to exist the testing ban was doubtless a difficult decision but it was still the right one given the severity of the hard times we re all facing unfortunately there are far reaching and unfortunate implications already isc is going to lose money not having their traditional preseason daytona test and there will be a ripple effect from that which spreads to local restaurants and hotels right down to the waiters and waitresses hotel maids and local gas station attendants i hate that it has to be the case but in this instance it s a matter of sharing the pain realizing the genuine hardship that some people will suffer from highly compensated engineers to barely getting by cabbies it is the responsibility of those with enough financial resources to easily weather this storm to act responsibly right now there s a cold war going on between the big three jack roush rick hendrick and joe gibbs each one has pledged lip service to the testing ban but all are keeping a wary eye on the other organizations at the first sign one of them is trying to circumvent the testing rules to gain an advantage the other two will respond in kind and it will spiral out of control from there just as it has under other testing limitations nascar has tried to impose on the teams so it s time for the big three to realize they have reaped a lot of wealth from this sport and they need to act in its long term best interests i d suggest a private summit perhaps at the upcoming nyc banquet where the big three team owners and maybe richard childress and roger penske sit down together behind closed doors and discuss these issues in private for example rick hendrick could tell jack roush yes my teams and i are going to live to the letter and intent of this new policy and if you feel someone in my employ is violating the spirit of these rules call me personally and we ll talk things out there s thousands of things that could go wrong here but only one reason they must not the future of the sport is on the line as are the livelihoods of people who either directly or indirectly draw their paychecks at least in part from the sport of nascar racing from millionaire drivers to waitresses who work extra shifts when the nascar circus is in town there s a lot of folks depending on this ban working out long term
severe shortages of infant formula across the united states have prompted glib dismissals of mothers concerns and increased pressure for women to breastfeed anti formula attitudes spreading widely on social media even from prominent celebrities at the moment follow decades of aggressive breastfeeding pressure from international public health experts trickling down from the heads of the world health organization w h o since at least the passage of the 1981 international code of marketing of breast milk substitutes the w h o has partnered with zealous anti formula organizations to pressure women into breastfeeding and condemn the use of baby formula as illegitimate dismissing medical evidence that many women simply do not produce enough milk to feed their child the w h o refers to breast milk as a vaccine implying that the use of baby formula causes unnecessary immunological damage to infants and commands that women breastfeed their children for two years it s

adequate substitute for women who cannot or do not want to breastfeed the w h o subsidiaries such as the pan american health organization paho and affiliated groups such as the world alliance for breastfeeding action waba have spent years attempting to erode popular trust in baby formula leading to mothers facing shame for using formula from friends acquaintances health workers lactation consultants and mike bloomberg among others the 1981 world health assembly the annual meeting of w h o member nations resulted in the passage of the international code of marketing of breast milk substitutes while not binding international law the code heavily pressures w h o member states not to promote the existence of baby formula in any capacity the code advocates that babies be breastfed if babies are not breastfed for whatever reason the code also advocates that they be fed safely on the best available nutritional alternative breast milk substitutes should be available when needed but not be promoted according to the w h o the code demands that governments control the marketing and distribution of formula the w h o s official explainer on the code claims that exclusive breastfeeding from birth is possible for most women who choose to do so a claim undermined by the fact that in america the vast majority of women do not exclusively breastfeed despite intense pressure from advocacy organizations and lactation consultants in february as the fda shut down abbott s michigan facility the w h o published a report attacking formula companies for marketing their products more than half of parents and pregnant women 51 surveyed for a new who unicef report say they have been targeted with marketing from formula milk companies the w h o asserted calling the marketing a

strong ties to the united nations the waba maintains a partnership with la leche league an extremely aggressive anti formula advocacy group particularly active in the united states state governments actively promote la leche league and classes for new parents at hospitals often cite it as a resource among the more extreme positions la leche league has recently taken is the promotion of breastfeeding to fight climate change and pressuring ukrainian mothers not to accept formula while feeling from the ongoing russian invasion in that country distributing a brochure titled methods of raising lactation in crisis anti formula activists routinely cite a host of dubious studies claiming that breastfeeding can improve a child s health future income intelligence levels and other life metrics doctors and scientists have greatly refuted the results of these studies as a 2010 article published in the journal early child development and care detailed breastfeeding promotion efforts sometimes overstate or misrepresent what the research actually supports about the benefits of breastfeeding psychological or cognitive benefits particularly for full term healthy infants may be overstated in some studies variables such as income education and maternal iq are not adequately taken into account the study concluded studies that do take these variables into account often find little or no association between breastfeeding and cognitive outcomes except in the case of premature or low birth weight infants although often promoted as a benefit of breastfeeding there is little

remember the fail whale back in twitter s early days the service was so unreliable that its overcapacity icon an illustration of a bevy of birds tethered to a whale caught in a net became almost a better known symbol of twitter than its bird logo it was never really clear what was happening in that illustration was the weight of the whale dragging the birds into the ocean pulling their tweets underwater had the birds captured the whale in their net and were now flying off with their ensnared prey were the tethers really the whale s webs that had shot out spiderman style and grabbed hold of the birds were the birds rescuing the whale the fail whale was brought back to mind today when shares of twitter fell below 39 91 where they closed on april 1 the last trading day before elon musk announced he had acquired a big stake in the company shares fell 8 1 percent and closed on their low at 37 39 the shares were down early in the day after elon musk tweeted over the weekend that he had been told by twitter s lawyers that he had violated his nondisclosure agreement with the company with some of his tweets challenging management data on the population of spambots on the service it s not that this was really all that bad but it certainly seemed to indicate that the deal is not going smoothly a few hours after markets opened however bloomberg news reported that musk had said during a miami tech conference that renegotiating the price of his acquisition was not out of the question the conference by the way was sold out at 7 500 a ticket musk appeared remotely we have said several times now that we expect musk might attempt to lower his purchase price given the turmoil in the stock market that has hit last year s high flying tech shares hard shares of snap for example are down 37 4 percent since april 1 when in an odd bit of market symmetry they closed at 37 39 if twitter shares had followed a similar trajectory which seems likely absent a takeover offer they d be trading around 25 right now no one thinking to buy twitter today would put in their opening offer at 54 20 empire state of mind the dramatic shift in consumer spending away from services and into goods has benefited u s manufacturing but monday s report from the new york fed raises the possibility that ongoing supply chain woes and rising prices may be taking their toll the empire state index of manufacturing activity nosedived 36 2 points to a reading of negative 11 6 in may as the measures of orders and shipments crashed even more disturbingly this took analysts by surprise they had forecast a slight decline from a reading of 24 to around 18 or so lloyd blankfein the former chairman and chief executive of goldman sachs might have been less surprised over the weekend blankfein said there was a very very high risk factor that the u s is headed for a recession homebuilders getting sadder we expect the slump in homebuilder sentiment to continue in the may survey scheduled for release tuesday the april survey showed builder sentiment sinking amid surging mortgage rates inflation in building materials costs and rising labor costs there s been no let up on the commodities inflation side or the labor market the expectations for interest rates are materially higher than a year ago that s likely to have home builders feeling worse than they were in april

intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non consolidated reits and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from and to include the proportionate share of ffo

not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as the company does and accordingly the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits ffo accordingly ffo should be considered only as a

fuel prices have crept higher and higher this year but the cause is quickly becoming a finger pointing contest with no real winner oil prices are a common topic of conversation around the office water cooler these days as you might expect perspective matters the folks at the halliburton nyse hal office in midland texas likely view the advent of 100 wti much more warmly than many others whose living doesn t depend on it directly at the other end of the spectrum truckers the good folks who deliver everything from baby formula to hamburger patties are pleading for relief from diesel prices that have doubled in the space of a year the old saying one man s meat is another man s poison probably never rang truer these pleas have caught the ears of many of our political leaders with few exceptions they have resolutely and indignantly laid the blame for high gasoline and diesel prices directly at the feet of the oil companies that produce refine and distribute these products the president also has made strident comments regarding oil companies in a number of recent interviews he has castigated them for diverting capital toward shareholders in lieu of break neck drilling to raise oil supplies with the desired outcome of lowering oil prices one can only wonder if the irony of that commentary is lost on the president president biden has been frustrated in his attempts to reduce oil prices or properly affix blame for them starting last year he publicly exhorted the saudis to raise production to reduce prices the attendant irony of making this request to one of the top global oil producers seems to once again be lost on the commander in chief the saudis not so politely demurred in an odd pivot he then sent emissaries to venezuela to see if they might be of some help along these lines data contained in the most recent edition of the eia weekly petroleum status report wpsr does not suggest this trip was fruitful undeterred earlier this year plans were made to personally renew his insistence that saudi arabia begins to pump more a notion that the saudis quickly discouraged shortly after receiving news of the visit being declined president biden then called the leader of saudi arabia sheikh mohammed bin salman mbs to make his case reportedly the sheik was not available when the call was made the russian invasion of ukraine then supplied the president with an obvious bogeyman for the high cost of fuel the president has often referred to putin s war as being responsible for the high cost of driving for americans an assertion that doesn t bear up under strict scrutiny there is a vague association that can be made however as the loss of russian supplies and near universal embargoes have stressed an already tight situation globally on two occasions biden authorized tapping the strategic petroleum reserve spr with the hope of dropping the cost of gas and diesel for consumers he has also authorized refiners to keep the e 15 blend to increase supplies of fuel during the summer driving season biden s attempt to deflect blame for the high prices and the attempt to flood the market with oil have both been perceived as failures and perhaps left people confused about the primary source of cost inflation in the world today in this article we will examine some data points and make a determination as to whether oil companies are responsible for the high price of refined products are high gasoline and diesel prices the direct result of high oil prices the high cost of the two primary transport fuels gasoline and diesel are on every pundit s lips these days you almost can t turn on the tv without seeing a panel of talking heads opine about the historic high prices for this commodity which moves the bulk of trade in global commerce high prices for diesel are certainly uncomfortably high and need to be brought into a normal framework asap but are high oil prices the root cause have a look at the eia graphic above you can see i ve put a 10 year range on it if you go back to 2014 oil prices were above 100 a barrel now look at the reference price for diesel it was right around 4 00 per gallon a far cry from the 5 65 a gallon that is associated with the current 100 oil price what changed root causes of high gasoline and diesel prices first let me acknowledge that there are a lot of moving parts here and it s tough to get too detailed without writing a 100 page essay avoiding that we will take a quick look at the key contributors to prices that are 50 higher now than the last time crude oil topped 100 per barrel reduced refining capacity is our first stop in 2020 refining capacity declined by about 900k bopd due to a number of plant closures demand was muted for the first half of 2020 but surged back as the promise of a vaccine gave people confidence that stepping outside their door was not a death sentence by the time may of 2022 rolled around we had almost matched 2019 passenger volumes in the eia graphic below you can see charted the supply and demand curves for the past few years in 2022 the lines begin to overlap and it should be noted this does not include the effects of the projected loss of 40 50 of the former 10 mm boepd produced by russia in other words there is probably a gap between demand and supply of about 4 5 mm boepd as bloomberg notes we are exporting more thanks to european refinery closures they need some of our supply with several hundred thousand barrels being shut down or in some cases being converted to biofuels the linked bloomberg article shows we exported a million barrels a day earlier this year related highest ever u s gasoline prices aren t destroying demand inventories in the u s are down substantially below 5 year averages and have held in a 410 420 mm barrel range since q 4 of last year that may sound like a lot but at consumption rates of about 20 mm bopd it s about a 17 day supply oecd inventories are in the same fix with the current 60 day supply well below the normal 80 mm bbl supply for this time of year in each case surging demand is meeting low inventories and contributing to prices pushing inexorably higher all of that brings us to the big reason for high refined product prices that diverge from the last time oil topped 100 per barrel the money supply has been increasing gradually since the financial meltdown of 2008 with what is termed an accommodative monetary strategy the fed has kept interest rates artificially low since that time creating asset bubbles of various classes but particularly in stocks savers have had no option but to invest in stocks for yield and the dow index has risen from 7k in feb of 2009 to nearly 37k in recent months you can see the curves for the stock market and the money supply track each other closely aided by the fed s printing press people poured money into the stock market pushing it ever higher inflation was kept in check for most of this period by an ample supply of goods and services advertisement the covid 19 shutdown that began in march of 2020 introduced a new wrinkle in global commerce supply chains and logistics were affected for the first time causing bottlenecks and backups that created substantial gaps between surging demand and the supply of everything this occurred just as the u s fed and central banks around the world began injecting liquidity into the system inflation had to be the result and the rise from 0 5 in 2020 to the present day is charted below so what s next for oil and gas and refined products the u s central bank the federal reserve has begun to shift its 15 year old posture of accommodation to remove excess liquidity from the system by increasing the discount rate the rate it charges lending institutions and reducing asset bond purchases the posture is known as tightening this will have the effect of increasing the interest rates paid by consumers and corporations and dampening demand for everything including petroleum refined products reduced demand will begin to relieve upward pressure on the prices of gasoline and diesel to what degree remains to be seen we still have all the other problems that make it an open question as to when or if they will begin to decline toward more affordable levels mixed messages from the government and outright obstruction in the form of over regulation and reduced leasing opportunities cast a shadow on the future supplies of crude oil your takeaway hopefully now you have a more complete picture of why gasoline and diesel prices are so high oil companies are not to blame for high prices or inflation they are price takers in a global market not price makers prices are set by a combination of market forces and government intervention right now the price of diesel and everything else largely reflects those forces and dilution debasement of the currency that occurred over the last several years only time and action by the central banks can begin to relieve the

accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in the quarterly form10 q including our unaudited consolidated financial statements to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons we use adjusted ebitda internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and

new york ny adrian lester a british actor from birmingham and the son of two immigrants from jamaica was nominated last week for a tony award for his performance in the lehman trilogy as emanuel lehman one of the german born jewish founders of fallen investment behemoth lehman brothers lester like the other actors in the three man play takes on several parts including female characters and at one point a thumb sucking toddler there has been no outcry about a british actor of african descent playing a german jew nor was there any fuss when he played bobby a character traditionally performed by white actors in a london production of stephen sondheim s company for which he won an olivier and why should there have been it s called acting there was no protest either about lester s co star simon russell beale born to british parents in what was then british malaya and a former chorister at st paul s cathedral playing a german jew adam godley the third actor in the play is jewish in real life but he s also gay not so in the play again it s called acting and beale and godley were also nominated for tony awards last week and yet countless actors have been criticized for playing people they do not resemble in real life earlier this year helen mirren was lambasted for portraying golda meir a former prime minister of israel in a forthcoming biopic even though she s not jewish engaging in what is now called jewface in a recent interview defending mirren ian mckellen who incidentally has played everything from a wizard to a cat asked is the argument that a straight man cannot play a gay part and if so does that mean i can t play straight parts he went on surely not we re acting we re pretending daring to take on parts different from oneself didn t always kick up a storm back in 1993 when tom hanks played a gay character in philadelphia he was hailed as brave for taking on homophobia and won an oscar today his performance no longer plays so well in some quarters straight men playing gay everyone wants to give them an award performer billy porter complained in a 2019 actor s roundtable yet many of our best gay lesbian and bisexual actors jodie foster alan cumming kristen stewart nathan lane have won awards for straight roles without even a murmur of complaint what we are effectively saying here without ever heaven forbid saying it out loud is that it s ok for actors from groups considered to be marginalized whether gay indigenous latino or any other number of identities to play straight white characters but it s not ok for the reverse also on artdaily beyond the châteaux new escapes in france s loire valley such double standards may not trouble you but if it s a problem that a miscast actor one who differs in identity from the character takes a role away from a properly cast actor when there are already fewer roles for underrepresented or marginalized groups then why not condemn simon russell beale for taking a job from a jewish actor why no outcry every time a 40 something actress bends biology to play the mothers of 25 year old actresses robbing older actresses who more plausibly fit the part if however the real problem is actors not being able to understand what it feels like to be part of a demographic group or to have a sexual orientation outside the confines of their own experience then none of these actors should be able to play anyone unlike themselves in other words no one should ever be allowed to play a part hollywood has wisely moved on from the offensive extremes of blackface and shylock stereotypes queeny stock gay characters and mickey rooney s embarrassing turn as a japanese landlord in breakfast at tiffany s there is plenty of room in the middle without ricocheting to the other undesirable extreme it s not that strict typecasting should never happen it can yield rewarding opportunities for both actors and audiences behold the deaf performers in the oscar winning coda but deaf performers can also act movingly in a musical like the 2015 deaf west revival of spring awakening which featured them in roles that were originally performed as hearing characters and performed simply as characters neither explicitly hearing nor deaf but transcendently human in their expression likewise in a recent revival of oklahoma ali stroker who uses a wheelchair was able to fully embody ado annie who spends much of her time in the movie and previous stage versions swishing away from her suitor will parker just as daniel day lewis once captured with extraordinary sensitivity in my left foot wheelchair bound writer and painter christy brown good actors are able to find a way to portray people who are not like themselves whether on the surface or well below which is what differentiates them from those of us who could barely remember our lines in a fourth grade production of a charlie brown christmas acting is a feat of compassion and an act of generosity those capable of that kind of emotional ventriloquy enable audiences to find ourselves in the lives portrayed on screen no matter how little they may resemble our own bravo to those actors who do that well bravo to the talented adrian lester who makes you
