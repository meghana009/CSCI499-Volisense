imagine if your job were to give away upwards of 500 million a year trying to make the world a better place that is the enviable or perhaps unenviable task of darren walker president of one of this country s largest and most prominent philanthropies the ford foundation a gay black man who grew up poor in a single parent home in rural texas darren walker is probably not who henry ford would have chosen to give away the proceeds of the family fortune walker believes that in this time of stark and growing inequality of staggering wealth for a few but stagnation for far too many philanthropy needs a major rethink and as we first reported this spring he s using his checkbook and his charm to make the case that generosity is no longer enough darren walker as ford foundation president darren walker oversees a 14 billion endowment and a landmark headquarters building in manhattan where more than 1 500 grants are made each year to non profit organizations in the u s and around the world its grants helped create giants like public broadcasting and sesame street human rights watch and head start a program walker says made a huge difference in his own life as a poor kid in east texas he was in its very first class lesley stahl were you even aware did you even know what the ford foundation was darren walker i had no idea what the ford foundation was i didn t know what policy was but i knew that i was a lucky child and i always felt my country was cheering me on walker fears that kids living in poverty now don t feel cheered on by their country so after he was chosen to lead the foundation in 2013 he d been a vice president before that he did something radical he announced that every ford foundation grant moving forward would have as its mission fighting inequality in all its forms darren walker inequality is the greatest harm to our democracy because inequality asphyxiates hope his argument is that generosity is insufficient the real goal of giving should be justice lesley stahl what s the difference between generosity and justice darren walker generosity actually is more about the donor right so when you give money to help a homeless person you feel good justice is a deeper engagement where you are actually asking what are the systemic reasons that put people out onto the streets generosity makes the donor feel good justice implicates the donor lesley stahl cause you re telling the donor they re gonna have to change themselves darren walker and that they contribute you re the person who won t let a homeless shelter come into your neighborhood lesley stahl makes you uncomfortable darren walker that s the point ford foundation video at the ford foundation we know that inequality limits the potential of all people as part of the foundation s new direction walker changed how it invests its endowment moving a billion dollars into what are called mission related investments like companies building affordable housing he reduced funding to marquee names like lincoln center while increasing grants to the apollo theater and studio museum in harlem another innovation a new program called build which gives a billion dollars in grants to nonprofits and allows them to decide how to spend the money even if it s on adding staff or new computers lesley stahl this is counterintuitive because i think most people really wanna know that the vast majority of the money they give is going to the program itself darren walker all of the unexciting parts of a nonprofit has to be paid for technology and infrastructure paying the rent it is both arrogant and ignorant to believe that you can give money to an organization for your project and not be concerned about the infrastructure that makes your project possible walker also made changes internally he sold the foundation s old art collection 400 works by white artists all but one of them men and bought new works by more diverse contemporary artists like this kehinde wiley portrait of a woman from brooklyn depicted as royalty which he put right at the foundation s entrance walker comes from a large southern family whose matriarch was the daughter of slaves he grew up in rural ames texas the segregated part of a county ironically named liberty covid prevented us from traveling to ames with walker but a local camera crew was able to find his first house now abandoned so he could give us a virtual tour darren walker this house was a little shotgun shack on a dirt road the thing about a shotgun house it usually has a door and two rooms walker s mother a nurse s aide raised him and his younger sister on her own lesley stahl did you ever meet your father darren walker i met my father once i was about four years old and my cousin brought me by and said joe this is your son darren and don t you wanna say hello to him and he wouldn t come out of the house i actually never saw his face because the screen door covered most of his face lesley stahl that is so painful darren walker i think it s painful but i think it s also there s a resilience that comes from that beulah spencer i knew the lord had something good in store for darren the resilience really came walker says from his mother beulah spencer beulah spencer education education education who saved up to buy the encyclopedia britannica for her kids one volume at a time lesley stahl what was darren like as a little boy beulah spencer oh my god i had to pay him to stop talkin so much lesley stahl laughter beulah spencer i d say darren if you d just be quiet for 25 minutes i m going to give you a quarter beulah spencer walker s mother he was a strong student was elected to his mostly white high school s student council and attended ut austin on scholarship for college and law school he moved to new york to work at a top law firm then in banking selling bonds and met his decades long partner david who passed away suddenly 2 years ago walker put his younger sisters through college then left banking to do community development work in harlem and has been in philanthropy ever since beulah spencer i m just proud of him very very proud of him especially so when that chatty little boy brought her to a state dinner at the white house where it was she who didn t stop talking beulah spencer i was talkin to president obama and darren s standin at the background sayin mother laugh move move darren walker but she broke protocol lesley lesley stahl what d she do darren walker because laugh she was supposed to briefly greet the president and move on she grabbed his hand lesley stahl laugh and held on darren walker with her hands laughter and wouldn t let go lesley stahl but she had something to tell the president right beulah spencer yes i told him we were praying for him if walker has a super power it s being able to get along easily with just about everyone pre covid he mingled comfortably with new york high society many his close friends with a salary of almost a million dollars he says he knows what it is to be in the bottom 1 and now the top darren walker let me be clear lesley i am a capitalist i believe there is no better way to organize an economy than capitalism but he says the system has gotten skewed with the richest 90 people owning as much wealth as the bottom half of the country combined walker on cnbc squawkbox darren walker i want to challenge capitalism to do what it s supposed to do and that is to provide opportunity so he goes on business channels calling on corporations walker on cnbc squawkbox darren walker what happened to those profit sharing plans for workers to stop putting shareholders ahead of their workers darren walker it s unthinkable to me that it has been normalized in american culture that you can work full time and still be poor that is antithetical to our idea of this country and lesley this isn t just an issue for african americans and latinx people we have for the first time in america a generation of downwardly mobile white people lesley stahl they re making less than their fathers did darren walker that has huge implications for our politics lesley stahl what s interesting is that usually when change comes the leader is outside the tent shouting in you re inside you re going to all these galas darren walker as a person who is sometimes in the room i think one of the things that i do in the room is to talk about uncomfortable truths and often people in the room are swayed walker pulled off a reconciliation between the ford family and the foundation after a nearly 40 year estrangement henry ford ii severed relations in the 70s after clashes over bringing women onto the board and policies he considered too liberal walker used that superpower of his and reached out to matriarch martha firestone ford then convinced henry ford iii to join a far more diverse board this was the board s last in person meeting before the covid 19 pandemic struck then george floyd was killed both thrusting issues of inequality to the center of the national conversation as never before just as nonprofits including those in the arts were fighting for their lives darren walker theaters went dark museums closed down all of the kinds of things that we support here at the foundation were in need so people were panicked working from home walker thought up a secret plan something no foundation had ever done raise a billion dollars by issuing bonds so the foundation could double its payments to needy grantees in the arts and racial justice the bonds were rated triple a and sold out in less than an hour lesley stahl it had to be that your background suddenly came in because you were a bond salesman darren walker to be totally candid it was less my knowledge of the bond market and more the urgency i felt to do something walker is calling on everyone to do something he s turned the ford foundation building into a vaccination site and in a provocative new york times op ed he wrote that people with wealth and power need to share some lesley stahl you re asking people who are invested in the system as it is that grants them all the privilege to give that up i don t know if it s within human nature darren walker i agree with you lesley it s not human nature to give up privilege particularly if you feel it s hard earned but at the end of the day we elites need to understand that while we may be benefiting from this inequality ultimately we are undoing the very fabric of america we are going to have to give up some of our privilege if we want america to survive produced by shari

when elected governor in 2018 tim walz inherited outdated statutes purporting to regulate disclosures by lobbyists political campaigns and public officials he also inherited a republican controlled state senate with no appetite for increased transparency as a former member of the entity charged with overseeing minnesota s disclosure laws i understand that the regulated are rarely enthusiastic about enhancing rules they must comply with yet the failure of the republican controlled senate and the dfl governor to address deficiencies in our existing disclosure laws is concerning minnesota s disclosure statutes have not been meaningfully revised for decades in the 2018 s w a m p states with anti corruption measures for public officials rankings of state anti corruption laws minnesota came in 37th in a 2015 report by the center for public integrity minnesota received a d grade regarding transparency accountability and anti corruption measures in a 2014 ranking of states regarding independent expenditure disclosures by followthemoney org minnesota was in the bottom half walz brought to the governor s office a strong record of raising the ethics bar and promoting greater transparency in campaigning for congress he decried the role of dark money in our politics as a congressman walz supported the stock act stop trading on congressional knowledge prohibiting elected officials from securities trading using information obtained in their official capacities he also backed the government by people act promoting greater public financing of campaigns and amendments to the lobbyist disclosure act regulating campaign contributions by lobbyists given this record and his electioneering forthrightness regarding his personal finances supporters of walz s gubernatorial candidacy myself included expected that he would prioritize bringing greater sunshine to the state perhaps the pandemic issues surrounding racial justice and the budget have absorbed walz s attention or perhaps he concluded that clashing with republican senators over greater transparency was too difficult whatever the reason no meaningful improvement to lobbyist public official and political campaign disclosure laws has occurred during the governor s watch the bipartisan minnesota campaign finance and public disclosure board cfb on which i served is charged with oversight of minnesota s statutes regulating disclosures by lobbyists campaigns and public officials for the past three legislative sessions the cfb along with citizen groups like common cause minnesota clean elections minnesota and the minnesota league of women voters have pushed to upgrade the statutes proposed changes include requiring lobbyists to clearly report the subject matter of their activities enhancing the reporting of economic interests by public officials and expanding the definition of express advocacy to ensure greater disclosure regarding independent expenditures furthermore certain house members pushed for legislation improving our public campaign financing system as well as disclosure laws these initiatives received little traction the governor did not throw the weight of his office behind these legislative efforts and republican senators expressed no interest in amending campaign laws with one exception contrary to cfb prior guidance the senate did pass a bill allowing senators to use up to 3 000 of campaign committee money to install security systems in their homes despite the governor acknowledging the cfb oversight as critical to ensuring ethical and transparent elections the cfb itself has been largely neglected for the past four months the cfb could not function due to lack of a quorum while much blame rests with republican senators whose commitment to inertia allowed appointments to lapse some fault rests with the governor s tardiness in making cfb appointments and failure to drive those appointments through the legislature further there has been no push to modernize minnesota s campaign financing laws in order to give average contributors greater voice in an october 2018 humphrey school of public affairs report entitled transparency and campaign spending in minnesota profs kathryn pearson and larry jacobs analyzed the advantage democrats were enjoying from independent expenditures in the 2018 election they observed that advantage to be largely driven by the flow of independent expenditures benefiting the walz campaign and noted that those expenditures made up 54 of walz s overall support shortly after the 2018 election the star tribune reported that 11 8 million in independent expenditures spent supporting walz surpassed by nearly 9 million independent expenditures benefiting his opponent cynics suggest it is naïve to think elected officials will reform the campaign financing system and disclosure laws under which they got elected since their opposition to improved transparency and our existing public financing system has been consistent minnesotans cannot look to republicans to initiate change however even with the headwinds of an intransigent senate one hopes that in a second term issues of meaningful transparency regarding lobbyists public officials and political campaigns would move up in gov walz s queue robert moilanen is a retired attorney who previously served as a democratic member of the cfb through appointments by govs mark dayton and tim walz
the sole purpose of government since aristotle and kautilya is to ensure the peace security and welfare of the citizenry the ancient greek athenians termed it eudaimonia or flourishing entire nations and civilisations have risen and fallen on the basis of the foundations on which their public finances were built if they are built on prudence and parsimonious discipline and accountability the society will flourish if on the other hand they are inspired by folly and wanton profligacy they will sooner or later come to grief the ministry of finance planning and budget recently released the details for the medium term expenditure framework and the fiscal strategy paper for 2022 to 2024 the document projects a staggering expenditure of n14 6 trillion for debt servicing during the period n3 6 trillion in 2022 n4 9 trillion in 2023 and n6 1 trillion in 2024 the minister revealed that in 2022 the government was projecting a revenue stream of n6 54 trillion accruable to the federation account and an additional n2 62 trillion in vat bringing total expected revenues for the coming year as n10 16 trillion the budget deficit is forecast to be n5 62 trillion which is a marginal increase from the 2021figure of n5 60 trillion for 2023 total revenue receipts are projected to rise to n13 98 the key macro assumptions are based on a crude oil benchmark price of 57 dollars per barrel for 2022 a production level of of 1 88 million barrels per day and an exchange rate of n410 to the us dollar an inflation rate of 10 and a nominal gdp of n149 369 trillion i find some of these to be rather optimistic we have never achieved single digit targets for inflation since 2015 it is high unlikely that we can bring it down to the projected 10 in an electioneering season in 2022 the recent decision to move forex sales from the bdcs to the commercial banks led to a marginal fall in the naira vis à vis the dollar with all the geopolitical tensions and uncertainties i do not envisage the naira stabilising any time soon these are not easy times for the managers of an economy like ours inflation and unemployment are spiralling out of control in the context of slow growth geopolitical tensions and widespread insecurity economists describe our current economic as stagflation two americans scholars robert rotberg and john campbell have designated our country as a failed state in an article they recently wrote in the influential journal foreign affairs in line with our introductory remarks the international ratings agency fitch has recently made a forecast to the effect that by year s end 2022 we shall be needing more than 300 of our revenues to service our debt obligations to better appreciate the challenges we face some trend analysis is useful as of march 31 nigeria s total stock of debt stood at n33 107 trillion us 87 239 billion in dollar terms the external component of the total national debt stock stood at us 32 86 billion n12 4 trillion nigeria s current debt to gdp ratio is estimated to be 31 94 per cent it has almost doubled from a low of 17 4 in 2014 and as we speak the national assembly has approved yet another binge of borrowing worth additional billions of dollars you and i know that you do not use gdp to repay your debt you use government revenue receipts to service debts in 2014 before the current apc led regime came to power the erstwhile goodluck jonathan administration paid n500bn for debt servicing this amounted to a mere 10 of total government revenue we were in a relatively comfortable position in the following year of 2015 coinciding with a global recession and precipitate fall world oil prices debt repayment bill tripled to the figure of n1 5tn amounting to 30 of public revenue earnings by 2017 the figure galloped to n3tn which amounted to 61 6 of government revenue in 2020 government made a total of n3 25tn in revenue while spending n2 34tn in debt servicing this amounted to 72 of revenue going into servicing our loans for that year it is instructive that during the same year government spent only n1 7tn on capital expenditure a recent budget implementation report indicates that the federal government spent n1 8tn in debt servicing in the first five months of this year alone representing 98 of total revenue earned during that period from january to may the government earned a total of n1 84tn in total revenue a massive shortfall of the projected figure of n3 32tn this obviously indicates that if the same trend is repeated for the rest of the year we would be spending 98 of all revenue on debt servicing interestingly the 2021 budget allocation for capital expenditure stands at n3 4tn which is 29 of the total annual budget a situation where debt servicing obligations outstrip capex allocation would be a rather worrisome one all the above suggests that there is an accelerating trend on the rise of both the quantum of debt and in percentage of revenue that is devoted to servicing our repayment obligations judging by the laws of statistical probability the change in percentage of revenue on debt servicing is likely to rise very substantially in the coming year as strenuous as the economic conditions are we do have some options the late john magufuli former president of tanzania decided to reduce the level of borrowing to the barest minimum with extraordinary results he had been offered a 10 billion loan by the chinese when he saw that in the fine little print they wanted to collateralise the port of dar es salaam for 99 years he turned down the offer he instead concentrated on boosting domestic revenue drastically reducing foreign travels and rigorously implementing infrastructure projects the results were outstanding tanzania was enjoying one of the fastest growth rates in the world without going through the binge of external borrowing we nigerians have a lot to learn from this as far as i am concerned if we must borrow at all let it strictly be for projects with guaranteed returns on investments we should also cut back on the cost of government while plugging some of the loopholes that haemorrhage our foreign exchange we can make government work while living within our means we must also keep a leash on the cost of governance government should also engage with our creditors with a view to restructuring our loans to ensure the fiscal space that will enable us to continue to grow while expanding the possibility frontiers of collective welfare the worst government can do under our circumstances is succumb to the penchant for raising taxes and tariffs this would amount to consummate folly in a time of economic doldrums there is the phenomenon of the laffer curve associated with the american economist arthur laffer it shows that there is an optimal level where government can impose taxes when you exceed that optimal level you would in fact experience a disproportionate fall in tax revenue this is more likely to be the case during a time of recession the great economist john maynard keynes taught that in times of economic troughs the managers of the economy should ensure that more money is placed in the hands of households firms and businesses in order to boost aggregate demand therefore expanding the tax net is the way to go many countries collect taxes through lifestyle audits when a man keeps a dozen exotic cars in the garage of his mansion and hires private jets for his travels the authorities have a duty to do a lifestyle audit on him to ensure that his tax payments reflect their high lifestyle i would also insist on a more rigorous system of accountability for the revenue generating agencies customs the federal inland revenue service nigeria national petroleum corporation and others we hear gory tales of trillions being withheld sometimes in private bank accounts boosting revenue in our circumstances would require also ensuring a sound macroeconomic environment and an attractive business eco system that enables businesses to flourish the current operating cost of government is way too high there are many lacunas and gaps that facilitate financial leakages and haemorrhages these must rigorously

xi jinping smiled and hinted at a policy bombshell that would soon roil stock markets from shanghai to new york it was mid june and the most powerful chinese communist party leader since mao zedong was holding court at an after school club for elementary students in the remote city of xining acknowledging the growing pressure on students and their parents to spend time and money on private tutoring xi promised to ease their burden we must not have out of school tutors doing things in place of teachers he said now the education departments are rectifying this while xi s comments went largely unnoticed by global investors at the time the crackdown on tutoring companies that followed has become the starkest illustration yet of the chinese president s commitment to a sweeping new vision for the world s second largest economy one where the interests of investors take a distant third place to ensuring social stability and national security call it progressive authoritarianism from exhausted couriers in the gig economy to stressed parents struggling with ever rising housing prices and tuition fees to small businesses battling tech monopolies xi is swinging the cudgel of state power in support of the squeezed middle class these challenges aren t unique to china but the policy response has been weeks after xi s school visit china said private education had been hijacked by capital and ordered tutoring companies to become non profits accelerating a selloff that at its most extreme erased us 1 5 trillion from chinese stocks and dented the portfolios of some of the biggest names in global finance combined with new requirements for data security reviews ahead of overseas ipos directives for food delivery firms to pay staff a living wage and escalating curbs on unaffordable housing the tutoring crackdown has triggered a growing realization that the old rules of chinese business no longer apply and left investors wondering which sector will be the next target for regulators for decades even as they kept strict control over strategic sectors like banking and oil china s leaders gave entrepreneurs and investors freedom to drive the adoption of new technologies and open up fresh opportunities for growth deng xiaoping set the tone back in the mid 1980s when he said it was ok if some got rich first now with growth slowing and relations with the u s increasingly hostile they re emphasizing different goals common prosperity and national security this marks a watershed shift in china s policy priorities said liao ming beijing based founder of prospect avenue capital which manages us 500 million the government is going after industries that are creating the most social discontent and true to their communist roots china s leaders have no problem trampling on the interests of venture capital private equity or stock investors when they conflict with its long term development plan liao said that focus is now on what has been dubbed the three big mountains the crushing burden of payments for education healthcare and property for now tech is still the main target in a flurry of action friday authorities summoned the country s largest technology companies for a lecture on data security vowed better oversight of overseas share listings and accused ride hailing companies of stifling competition new development phase china this year began a new development phase according to xi it puts three priorities ahead of unfettered growth national security which includes control of data and greater self reliance in technology common prosperity which aims to curb inequalities that have soared in recent decades stability which means tamping down discontent among china s middle class if xi executes on his vision and that is still a big if there will be important beneficiaries stretched workers stressed parents and squeezed start ups but so far the losers have been more visible tech billionaires and their backers in the stock market highly leveraged property companies including china evergrande group and foreign venture capital firms that had hoped to take chinese companies public in the u s for international investors many of whom got burned by this year s regulatory onslaught the old rule was that to make money in china it was necessary to align with the communist party s priorities the dawning realization is that finding common ground may be increasingly hard to do companies and investors have been behind the curve when it comes to anticipating regulation in china ren yi a harvard educated social media commentator known as chairman rabbit wrote in an online commentary that has received more than 100 000 views education researcher feng siyuan says investors should have seen the education regulations coming xi had said more than two years ago the sector shouldn t be profit driven part of xi s motivation is desire for popular support ahead of the once in a decade leadership transition next year where he is expected to buck tradition and stay on as party chief for a third term growing discontent including sporadic strikes among delivery workers have rattled the stability obsessed party wearing the distinctive yellow shirt of chinese delivery service meituan whose profits have boomed during the pandemic 22 year old motorbike courier mr tang complains about the lack of medical insurance there s nothing i can do about it if meituan doesn t pay for it he added the wealth gap between people in this society is too big the downside for investors is that a bigger slice of the pie for workers like mr tang has to come at the expense of the owners of capital meituan lost as much as us 63 billion of market value last week after beijing ordered it to improve worker protections china s leaders won t be shedding tears for the losses of foreign stock holders the bigger risk for beijing heavy state intervention might dampen the animal spirits that drive private investment and reverse an integration with the global economy that has helped drive growth in the last four decades following the logic of the prison yard beijing signaled the start of the new era for entrepreneurs and investors by taking a swing at the biggest inmate alibaba group holding ltd founder jack ma on nov 3 the initial public offering of ant group co the finance arm of ma s empire which was set to surpass saudi aramco as the biggest public listing of all time was unceremoniously squashed the regulatory pace intensified after december when a top economic planning meeting chaired by xi vowed to rein in the disorderly expansion of capital signaling the move against alibaba was part of a wider campaign backed by the apex of chinese power at first investors thought the phrase referred to anti monopoly efforts aimed at shrinking the power of tech giants which had converted their vast profits into venture capital investments spanning almost every sector that narrative was bolstered by the 18 2 billion yuan fine slapped on alibaba by anti monopoly authorities in april but developments in recent weeks suggest the slogan goes further in some sectors private capital especially foreign capital may not be wanted at all at the start of july china s cybersecurity regulator said tech firms with more than a million users would need to pass a review before listing overseas regulators made an example of didi global inc china s answer to uber which had squeaked through a u s ipo just before the new regulations removing it from app stores in the country and hammering its valuation later that month china s top administrative body the state council ordered companies teaching the school curriculum in the us 100 billion after school tutoring sector to become non profits and banned them from pursuing ipos or taking foreign capital the semi legal variable interest entity or vie structure adopted by the likes of alibaba to go public abroad was singled out for top level criticism for the first time while investors in the tutoring sector a focus of major funds from temasek to warburg pincus lamented the new rules many chinese parents welcomed them in big cities more than half of households report feeling under pressure from tutoring costs one of the hottest online terms in china this year has been involution the idea that parents are trapped in an endless cycle of educational one upmanship with the result not meritocratic progress but social stagnation liu shu a 39 year old manager at an insurance company in beijing says she and her husband spend 200 000 to 300 000 yuan about us 31 000 to us 46 400 each year on their nine year old son s after school classes in chinese english math and calligraphy that is more than three times the average disposable income for denizens of china s capital those fees underscore the underlying logic behind the tutoring crackdown the educational rat race risks burning out kids draining parents bank balances and by keeping family sizes small adding to the demographic drag revealed in china s once a decade census earlier this year this is why i don t want to have a second child liu lamented i just really don t have more energy on top of the issue of money to me raising a kid is too much stress china s other moves whilst extreme are also grounded in the logic of progressive economics pushing back against the power of monopoly firms to crush competitors squeeze workers and milk customers indeed regulators in the u s are making tentative moves in the same direction as china capitalism without competition isn t capitalism it s exploitation president joe biden said in july signing a sweeping executive order that signaled the beginning of a move against monopoly power in the u s but in contrast with america and europe where investors can generally keep pace with regulatory developments china s opaque political system makes decisions tougher to track xi or his economy czar liu he may signal a new direction with a speech or by coining a new catch phrase the meaning of which like xi s comments at the xining after school club might be lost on the markets officials scurrying to satisfy their superiors can often overdo things causing wrenching corrections and policy reversals a recent example of that came in 2016 when officials suddenly slammed the door on cross border capital flows following a botched attempt at yuan reform this time around there are also signs beijing is shifting to damage control mode on a hastily arranged call with major investment banks securities regulator fang xinghai attempted to restore a measure of calm to the markets signaling that the education policies are targeted and not intended to hurt other industries east vs west behind beijing s actions lies a political and economic philosophy that is fundamentally foreign to most modern western politicians and investors communist rulers see the economy as something that can thrive through state planning even if that rides roughshod over the rights of entrepreneurs and their backers coming on top of mounting concerns about human rights abuses in xinjiang and the crackdown in hong kong beijing s latest moves will add weight to voices in the u s and europe who want to reduce ties with china in the u s the securities and exchange commission has already moved to put the brakes on ipos for chinese firms one lesson though is that china is not the passive victim of u s led decoupling in areas seen as essential to national security beijing is also willing to sever ties efforts to boost self sufficiency in crucial technologies exemplified by the made in china 2025 plan for cutting reliance on imports in everything from industrial robotics to electric vehicles are already in train the latest barriers to overseas ipos and foreign capital in education flag a move toward selective decoupling in finance as well with beijing preferring inflows via stock markets in hong kong shanghai and shenzhen where it has greater control over who gets to list beijing is betting that the gravitational pull of an economy that will likely continue to generate more billions of dollars of growth opportunities than any other gives them leeway to throw their weight around even if some global investors get whacked in the process at least some of the evidence suggests they might be right foreign investment continues to flow into china including through domestic bond and stock markets which continue opening to overseas capital for all the talk of decoupling china s exports to the u s keep rising still structural shifts in policy have a slow burn impact the benefits of pro market reforms culminating in china s 2001 entry to wto played out over the best part of a decade before the 2008 financial crisis halted the export boom the costs of beijing s new turn away from the market will also take time to show even if the communist party continues to deliver on growth the focus on common prosperity suggests investors will have to settle for a smaller share of the spoils

it s august 1 and rent is due that s a big change for many americans who had been unable to pay rent but were protected from eviction by a federal moratorium now those protections are gone due to widespread job loss and the health risks of the covid 19 pandemic many renters in the us faced difficulty making their rent payments every month when the pandemic began in early 2020 and the federal government stepped in to prevent people from getting evicted in the midst of it as part of this response the centers for disease control and prevention instituted a moratorium in september 2020 that prevented landlords from evicting their tenants regardless of whether they could pay their monthly rent in full or at all last month the moratorium was already on borrowed time as the supreme court had warned that it would not extend the renter protection past the end of july several justices including justice brett kavanaugh supported this in my view clear and specific congressional authorization via new legislation would be necessary for the cdc to extend the moratorium past july 31 wrote kavanaugh the biden administration did challenge the supreme court decision on thursday two days before the program was set to expire by formally asking congress to pass an extension but congress would have had to pass new legislation to create an extension and did not do so in time before leaving for an august recess so the moratorium has officially expired no more eviction protection means paying late rent money renters don t have this changes a lot for renters who now have to reckon with their landlords some of whom have not received regular rent for almost a year renters are now required to pay any missed payments and in some states the landlord is owed late fees for any late payment since the moratorium was enacted utilities are a bit of a gray area but generally if the landlord is responsible for paying for a certain utility in most cases they are not permitted to turn it off rep cori bush d mo was at the forefront of the fight for a further moratorium extension as a formerly homeless person who has also faced eviction in the past she has been vocal about the need to extend the moratorium and slept on the us capitol steps on friday night in protest i am dirty sticky sweaty i still have on what i had on last night this is how people will have to live if we don t do something they deserve human dignity and deserve for people that represent them to show up do the work to make sure basic needs are met today she told cnn s jessica dean on saturday it s 2 am on sunday we haven t slept since thursday night the eviction moratorium expired so we re now in an eviction emergency 11 million are now at risk of losing their homes at any moment the house needs to reconvene and put an end to this crisis cori bush coribush august 1 2021 according to a study by the aspen institute and the covid 19 eviction defense project published in august of last year nearly 40 million americans were then at risk of eviction people of color were and still remain disproportionately at risk as they are twice as likely to be renters and the pressures that covid 19 added just worsened the statistics a june report by city life vida urbana and the massachusetts institute of technology found that in the first month of massachusetts s state of emergency during the pandemic 78 percent of eviction filings in boston were in communities of color people with lower income households are also more at risk as they are less likely to have savings to pay rent and more likely to have been employed in covid affected industries the moratorium aimed to help people like this who needed protection but although politicians like cori bush are fighting to bring the moratorium back it was never a complete solution renters would eventually have to start paying again whether their individual circumstances had changed or not while landlords were also struggling to make ends meet without rental income in an attempt to remedy this congress allocated 25 billion in rental assistance in december and in march another 21 5 billion was added this was a welcome relief to tenants and landlords alike but the problem was in getting the money to the people who needed it quickly confusion at the federal level about how to distribute that amount of money and which of numerous programs would handle distribution has also slowed getting the aid out as vox s jerusalem demsas has reported many renters in need of aid simply did not know that they were eligible for rent relief and if they did some were unable to provide the necessary paperwork because of their turbulent living circumstances lack of formal documentation of their work or nontraditional rental agreements renters were unsure if rent relief money would get to them in time while more than 1 5 billion was delivered to eligible applicants in the month of june which exceeded the amount provided in all three previous reporting periods combined only 3 billion of the total 45 billion allocated has been distributed according to the us treasury now that the federal moratorium has expired at least four states massachusetts nevada new york and oregon have temporarily continued the ban on evictions against those with a pending rental assistance application these state decisions will give renters time to receive their rent relief money when they might otherwise face eviction immediately but renters in states that are following the expired federal moratorium face large sums of back rent and if they are unable to pay possible eviction there s a lot of cases where tenants are getting evicted that have already been approved for rental assistance k lisha rutledge an attorney with legal aid of northwest texas told the texas tribune and their landlord knows that they ve been approved and they re just waiting on the check it might be easy to see landlords as the villains in this situation but tenants aren t the only ones struggling forty one percent of all rental housing units in the us and most of the affordable housing options are owned by individuals or mom and pop landlords and the rent they receive from their tenants is often a large part of their own income this means that the moratorium alleviated pressure from tenants by creating more pressure on landlords who still need to pay their own bills as vox s jerusalem demsas wrote losing more of america s already dwindling affordable housing stock is a looming emergency that could be exacerbated if small landlords are required to act as the social welfare state without any financial assistance the end of the moratorium potentially means money in landlords pockets but there are still roadblocks california is allowing landlords to get paid what they are owed from previous months without rent only if they waive 20 percent of the back rent and some landlords have taken such a hit that they will be forced to sell their property eliminating the opportunity to continue renting as a future source of income with over 50 percent of the us population vaccinated it may seem that now is an appropriate time to end the benefits of the moratorium but americans who took a financial hit during the peak of covid 19 or who lost their job may still need support the rise of the covid 19 delta variant is also a concern as research has shown that evictions lead to a higher likelihood of covid 19 infection and death concerns about the delta variant were also the main reason for the biden administration s push for a moratorium extension given the recent spread of the delta variant including among those americans both most likely to face evictions and lacking vaccinations president biden would have strongly supported a decision by the cdc to further extend this eviction moratorium to protect renters at this moment of heightened vulnerability the white house said in a statement based on the supreme court decision and absent action from the biden administration and congress this support is not enough with over 40 billion in rental relief left undistributed and a threat to public health still looming renters are in danger once again

in january of 2001 a startup news website broke a huge technology story a charismatic millionaire was secretly developing an incredible invention one that would change the world in his lab in new hampshire the news came via a leaked secret book proposal which had just sold to the academic publisher harvard business school press for 250 000 within hours the story was everywhere the proposal quoted steve jobs saying the invention would be as significant as the personal computer jeff bezos said it was revolutionary but what was surprising about the book deal wasn t merely the praise the invention and its inventor dean kamen garnered from tech world luminaries it wasn t merely the substantial investment the inventor had received from famed venture capitalist john doerr the largest in the firm kleiner perkins history what stood out most of all was the detail that harvard was paying a quarter million dollars for the book and it didn t even know what the invention was the inventor was paranoid about leaks and the book s author withheld that information from the proposal no one not even the literary agent who had submitted the proposal to editors swearing them to secrecy knew what the invention was all they knew was the single word of the book s title it the tech bubble was bursting and all across silicon valley paper fortunes were vanishing now here was something different something that felt new because it was old a real invention not just lines of html soon it was on lycos on npr in the new york times on late night talk shows an it message board thrown onto the internet by two entrepreneurial brothers received 100 000 hits in its first 24 hours the explosion of the it story in the winter and spring of 2001 represented an entirely new kind of media frenzy the birth of virality as we now know it advertisement and then it too popped in december 2001 a year after the initial leak the world finally learned what it was as dean kamen presented his invention on good morning america with great fanfare an actual curtain raised to reveal a bulky two wheeled scooter the segway kamen announced proudly that s it diane sawyer asked that can t be it the segway did not change the world it was not bigger than the pc it ended up a joke the province of mall cops and g o b bluth on arrested development the segway flopped so badly that one of its first boosters still keeps his in the garage to remind me he said of my own fallibility the segway also reminds me of my fallibility to this day thinking about it fills me with dread that s because in 2001 i was a young literary agent and dean kamen s book was my first ever big deal the cascading series of miscues that tanked the segway began with that book proposal its leak and the ensuing hype and i ve always had a sick sense that the leak was somehow my fault so i set out to report the story to wade back into the mess i made when i got in way over my head and to figure out once and for all the answer to a question that s eaten at me for 20 years did i kill the segway advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement listen to another version of this story on slate s decoder ring i still remember the phone call my boss rafe sagalyn was sitting behind his desk in the little office in bethesda maryland where i went to work every day rafe was and still is a big deal literary agent representing scores of washington journalists and business consultants behind him was the wall of books he d sold over the decades books whose authors i talked to on the phone all the time david maraniss jane mayer chris matthews one shelf held a rainbow of international editions of megatrends the megaselling 1980s business tome by john naisbitt that was rafe s first big hit the one that he said paid for my house advertisement i sat in a chair on the opposite side of rafe s desk the speakerphone between us i d organized this call a big deal for me i d been working my way through grad school as rafe s assistant for a few years by then and he was encouraging me to take the next step to find authors of my own to represent it was 1999 and i was 24 years old freshly married ambitious as hell i read every magazine that came into the office listened to npr and combed through the slush pile in search of a book idea i could sell steve jobs said that the invention would be as significant as the personal computer jeff bezos said it was revolutionary that s why steve kemper was on the phone steve was a freelance journalist who d built a modest career writing for newspapers and magazines he d long wanted to write a book and had bounced around ideas with a few other agents but not yet sold a proposal i read a feature he wrote for smithsonian magazine about the global importance of salt and thought that s a book microhistories books that used some small important innovation like longitude or the pencil to explain the world were the big new thing in book publishing an author named mark kurlansky had just had a hit with a book about cod of all things making the case that this humble fish unlocked a new understanding about the way the oceans and the world economy worked advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement i spent a month working with steve on a proposal for a book about salt a substance that had encouraged the growth of civilization and contributed to the rise and fall of empires then we learned that a publisher had just made a big deal for a history of salt to be written by mark kurlansky never mind that steve said he had another great story one no one could scoop him on it was about an inventor named dean kamen who had made his name by inventing the drug infusion pump and the first portable dialysis machine he was a millionaire many times over lived in a mansion in new hampshire and had his own private island now he had come up with his greatest invention yet advertisement steve had once written a profile of kamen and recently kamen had invited steve up to the manchester headquarters of his r d company deka for dean kamen telling him this is the most exciting thing i ve ever worked on now as rafe and i listened steve told us that the new technology was absolutely revolutionary this invention is going to change the world he said his voice crackling over the speaker from his house in connecticut he was a mild mannered guy generally but he was fervent about this i have complete access to the whole thing the engineers the designers dean ok well what is the invention rafe asked i can t tell you steve said rafe looked up at me eyebrows raised well how do you expect us to get you a book deal he said advertisement dean kamen hated high school math the problems were so easy he could do them in his head so teachers were forever accusing him of cheating his classmates would brag about getting a s on tests and he d say any chump can get an a on that test watch me i ll get exactly a 57 and then he did advertisement advertisement advertisement what he loved was building things while he was still in high school on long island he built audiovisual and lighting systems for rock shows and corporate conferences a few years out of high school he made the world s first drug infusion pump in his parents basement out of parts he bought at radioshack that invention changed health care forever and soon kamen did what any rich inventor with an anti authoritarian streak would do he moved to new hampshire where taxes were low and regulation was scant he bought a mansion and a helicopter and when he didn t love the helicopter the helicopter company by the 1990s he was rich enough and well connected enough that north dumpling island his island off the coast of new york which kamen had declared its own sovereign kingdom had signed a mutual nonaggression pact with the first george bush it even had its own national anthem sung to the tune of america the beautiful advertisement north dumpling north dumpling keep lawyers far from thee and mbas and bureaucrats that we may all be free dean was a great character steve kemper said when i reconnected with him this spring dean s quotable he s independent he s a little bit crazy kamen wore jeans and work boots everywhere accessorized with an army jacket whose pockets kamen filled with tools and screws that always set off metal detectors at for instance the white house he knew everything about science and nothing about anything else after that dinner at the white house he asked friends if they knew anything about the people he d been seated with who turned out to be warren beatty and shirley maclaine advertisement with deka kamen built a wonderland for ambitious engineers in a set of riverside warehouses that kamen bought for a song dean is the best possible boss you can have steve remembered one engineer telling him because he says do whatever you want fail fail fail over and over but learn something and then try something else to kamen experiments that don t work frog kissing he called it are as important to the work of engineering as the solutions that do work if you re not failing steve said you re not doing the work that dean wants you to do he s expecting spectacular failures because that means you re thinking big advertisement advertisement advertisement what made kamen inspiring to work for benge ambrogi recalled was his ambition and his brilliance ambrogi was an engineer at deka for 13 years i wouldn t call dean an engineer he said i d call him an explorer of the natural world he s amazing in his ability to pull things back to first principles those physical relationships between matter and energy the newtonian formulas that represent centuries of understanding of the way the world works dean understands that stuff just like in his fiber ambrogi said and so he can take that fundamental understanding of how the world works and then take it five levels up advertisement kamen s bone deep understanding of first principles meant he was always looking for a more elegant solution engineers at the company shared stories of presenting a prototype and having kamen suddenly blurt out some totally surprising idea that a was absolutely brilliant and b would absolutely send the whole team down a yearlong rabbit hole and delay the project one engineer told me that kamen liked to say anything worth doing takes at least a decade like that other lover of first principles archimedes kamen had his eureka moment in the bathtub or in his case getting out of the shower he slipped and windmilled his arms to regain his balance which made him think about how humans balance ourselves we instinctively understand how to shift our weight and change our stance we even in walking propel ourself into small controlled falls forward each interrupted by the next step if he could build a machine that could balance like a person does it could have incredible applications imagine a wheelchair that can stand up straight on two wheels or even climb stairs how many lives would that change advertisement advertisement advertisement in the early 1990s engineers at deka including ambrogi started the long slow work of turning kamen s eureka moment into an actual product the seemingly simple idea was fiendishly complicated in practice replicating the gyroscopes of our inner ears and the processing power of our brains requires a machine to make ten thousand measurements and calculations every second after a few years of work the group had a couple of prototypes a stair climbing machine that could with great effort make its way up a set of wooden stairs the team had built in the lab and a load balancing machine a sort of coffee table on two wheels you could set something on it and the machine would sense the uneven weight and rotate the wheels enough to balance it and then one day one of the engineers jumped on the coffee table and away he zoomed it was just so primitive but beautiful ambrogi remembered your body is the joystick you lean forward it goes forward the more lean you have the faster it goes and you lean back and it slows down engineers took turns zipping around the lab on their new toy it was a complete revelation ambrogi said how it felt like a natural extension of your body the stair climbing wheelchair remained the team s primary goal the product they imagined would one day make money but the engineers loved their toy and refining that coffee table on wheels became their nights and weekends project soon kamen decided the time had come to take the wheelchair project behind closed doors he had an inventor s paranoia that as soon as someone else found out about his best ideas they would steal them the project needed a code name which came from the odd elegant dancing motion the wheelchair made when it spun in a circle like fred astaire someone said and someone else said fred upstairs and so it became fred and that name in turn inspired the name of the spinoff doohickey that engineers loved to ride down the halls of deka who dances with fred ginger of course advertisement advertisement advertisement in 1995 kamen sold fred the wheelchair to johnson johnson and turned his attention to ginger ginger became its own secret department at deka its engineers given resources and attention that made them the envy of other employees this time though kamen didn t want to sell the idea to some big company and move on no ginger was too important ginger could solve the problem of city travel it could reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and free our cities from the scourge of the automobile it could change the world dean kamen planned to manufacture and sell the product himself deka filed patent after patent for ginger s technology kamen hired procurement experts software developers manufacturing engineers even a small marketing team eventually kamen would lease a 77 000 square foot factory in manchester that would he planned be able to push out 6 000 gingers a week meanwhile ginger s team worked to transform the janky prototypes made of plastic wagon wheels and store bought circuit boards into a product someone would buy an industrial designer preached the gospel of elegance and simplicity pushing the engineers to make things smaller more efficient more sleek the code was written rewritten refined safety was paramount kamen worried that one high profile breakdown would sink the project and the engineers at the company used what they d learned about making fda regulated medical devices like the dialysis machine to build something that could survive anything a rider could throw at it kamen even hired a lobbyist to begin the process of convincing local and national governments that ginger was safe enough to ride on the sidewalk that on a policy level it would be viewed like a better version of walking not like a bike after all said kamen when he invited steve kemper the journalist to manchester in 1999 once people tried a ginger who s gonna want to walk advertisement advertisement advertisement kamen made steve sign a nondisclosure agreement then keycarded him into the ginger offices on the top floor of the warehouse it was not impressive steve remembered it was held together with duct tape and there were little jagged edges and little toy wheels on it like from a wagon but when he stepped onto ginger and rode it it was like a magic carpet everyone i talked to about the ginger remembered their wondrous first ride kamen counted on it he knew that everyone got this dopey grin once they started zooming around that was when kamen knew he had his hooks in you he used the same technique on steve that he was already using on potential manufacturing partners employees he was trying to lure to manchester and most importantly investors and then he s trotting alongside you still pitching steve recalled this is ginger people are going to be gingering to the store gingering to work gingering to the subway it s going to be a verb it s going to be a new concept a new verb a new world basically i drank the kool aid steve said chuckling he is the most incredible salesperson you ll ever see in your life i saw him sell everybody and he sold me for sure kamen told steve that he thought the creation of ginger was so momentous that someone ought to write a book about it and offered to pay steve to do it steve said no but that as a journalist he d write the book if kamen gave him total access and total creative control he d write it on spec until he could find a publisher that s when he emailed me at the end of our phone call with steve rafe and i walked out to pick up lunch at a cajun sandwich shop we both liked steve s book seemed so exciting and so impossible but rafe thought it was worth pursuing and he told me he thought i should be the book s lead agent i emailed steve and told him keep reporting and we ll figure out how to sell this thing somehow advertisement advertisement advertisement you just had a real passion for this rafe said when i talked to him this spring my old boss is still an agent his one man shop acquired by icm we were doing it together but you were taking the lead rafe had high hopes for me at the agency he told me and saw me not just as an assistant but as a full fledged agent in waiting the question was does this person have the sensibility intellectual and business to you know elevate to being an agent and i thought you had all those qualities he paused and i don t know for some reason you took a different path through 2000 steve kemper visited deka two days a week observing the engineers hard at work and attending every major investor meeting with kamen meanwhile out on the west coast everything was falling apart the dot com bubble was popping the nasdaq reached its highest level in march and from then on dozens of web companies saw their fortunes plummet take pets com which in january aired an expensive super bowl ad in february launched a disappointing ipo and by november was declaring bankruptcy in the same magazines and websites that had breathlessly touted these companies as the businesses of the future commentators suddenly scoffed at the fact that anyone had ever believed in them said margaret o mara a historian of silicon valley and the author of the code of course there s a lot of rather gleeful you know oh you guys got too far out over your skis she said it turns out it s really hard to sell dog food on the internet the employees who d moved to the bay on the promise of stock options contributed rumors and gripes to a website called fucked company and watched their potemkin fortunes disappear advertisement advertisement advertisement kamen had always taken a dim view of the dot com boom he thought it was a ridiculous waste of talent and money compared to engineering steve said you couldn t see what the invention was you couldn t touch it but as the titans of silicon valley started looking for new projects to invest in kamen despite his disdain started turning to them why he needed money by 2000 deka had been working on ginger for five years and kamen was burning through a half million dollars of his own money each month r d is expensive especially when you make your engineers chase every brilliant idea you have in search of the most elegant solution with the help of a harvard business school professor named william sahlman and the investment firm credit suisse kamen had scraped together 30 million or so but he needed more it started with john doerr the legendary head of the venture capital fund kleiner perkins doerr had been an early investor in amazon and after kamen pitched him at a ted conference he flew his private jet out to manchester as soon as he rode ginger he got that same dopey grin the next day he was sending kamen mash notes over email thanks for the scope of your ambition which is breathtaking and inspirational and pressing to let him invest more and more in ginger in the end kleiner perkins pledged 38 million for about 7 5 percent of the company and doerr started calling his rich and famous friends and that s how in the fall of 2000 steve who d thought he was chronicling a simple engineering story suddenly found himself in the ballroom of the hyatt regency near the san francisco airport watching a laughing jeff bezos ride around on a ginger and steve jobs yell about how if they d hired real designers ginger would look so cool it would make people shit their pants then steve recalled they turned on the team of ginger employees in the room clearly conveying the feeling that they were rubes whose inexperience and idiocy would sink this world changing product it was an ambush steve thought a way for doerr to persuade kamen that what his product needed was the silicon valley expertise and money that only he could deliver advertisement advertisement advertisement in a very short period of time kamen went from mortgaging his house to pay for ginger to not only having enough thanks to the kleiner perkins investment but having extremely famous people begging to give him even more millions of dollars jobs alone wanted to invest 60 million and couldn t believe it when kamen turned him down kamen didn t want to give up that much control jobs agreed to take a spot on the board in hopes of convincing kamen to let him invest in a second round doerr predicted that five years after it launched ginger would be valued at 5 billion but kamen s obsession with secrecy was slowing everything down deka couldn t hire enough engineers because kamen only wanted people who would come to manchester on faith the marketing guys couldn t conduct market research because they couldn t tell anyone what the product was kamen belittled his marketing team calling them the three marketeers and then never gave them the resources to do their job at this point nearly everyone wished kamen would stop being so secretive about ginger so they could begin to get the project out the door twice one of kamen s investors said to steve kemper i think what we really need is a sexy leak but kamen wasn t having it that inventor s paranoia again he was convinced that if honda or ford got wind of ginger they d build their own and release it before he could he was holding on tight but ginger was about to be an impossible secret to keep when steve kemper told rafe sagalyn and me about that west coast ambush we all agreed it was time to sell the book steve had been reporting at deka for a year and a half and he needed to know that he was going to see a return on his time suddenly this was no longer a mysterious invention that some reporter insisted was going to be big it was a product that the biggest names in the business were fighting to throw money at it was news advertisement advertisement advertisement steve wrote up the hotel meeting by sfo as a sample chapter carefully excising details of what the invention was when the doors were locked the chapter read kamen opened the duffels and the boxes removed some components and used a screwdriver and hex wrenches to assemble two gingers he finished in ten minutes turned one on and the chapter was funny dishy and canny now it was up to me to persuade publishers to take the risk of buying a book about a secret technology even though steve couldn t tell them what it was even though he hadn t even told me what it was so steve and i came up with a book proposal i still have a copy it s really good it includes that juicy sample chapter but it s set up by a series of ginned up emails between me and steve me playing the doubting thomas and him convincing me over time that this invention was real and would indeed change the world to steve kemper from dan kois december 20 1999 sorry for the delay i ve been swamped and besides i m not sure what to say to you this is very frustrating all this dramatic vagueness kamen is just too secretive you act like he invented the wheel does he have investors what do they say or is that off limits too give me something concrete to tell publishers to dan kois from steve kemper date march 25 2000 dan my turn to apologize i was gone in january and have been catching up no kamen didn t invent the wheel but people far smarter than i who have seen ginger believe that people will talk about kamen the way they once talked about henry ford john doerr thinks kamen will do for the 21st century what ford did for the 20th and he calls kamen a combination of ford and edison advertisement advertisement advertisement smoke and mirrors steve said when we discussed it this spring i just had to make it so enticing that instead of an editor saying well this is crazy i don t know what i m buying they d say this is crazy and how do i get in on it i emailed the proposal to editors with a note reminding them how secret it was please don t share i said by new year s 2001 we had the entire package ready to go rafe made the list of editors we d submit the book to but the submission was going to come from me you taking the lead made it even more perfect rafe said because you weren t a known entity to these editors it was perfectly in theme with what we were doing not only was i an unknown to all the editors i was sending the proposal to by this point i didn t even live in the continental united states my wife had graduated from law school and gotten a clerkship with a federal judge in honolulu so we d just moved to the ground floor of a little house on top of a mountain with a view from diamond head to pearl harbor for some reason rafe let me keep working for him even though i was five time zones behind the east coast so here i was an unknown agent on an island in the middle of the pacific preparing to send this book proposal about a mystery invention out to editors i d never met at the last minute rafe had come up with the title it like just the pronoun it it was so last minute we didn t even tell steve about it the day after new year s at 8 a m hawaii time i sat down in that little office and prepared myself i knew what to do i d seen rafe do it dozens of times i scribbled out a little list of things to say to editors and i dialed a bunch of 212 numbers when each editor said sure i ll take a look i d email the proposal with a note reminding them how secret it was please don t share i said advertisement advertisement advertisement at the end of the day after i d emailed the last editor i exhaled drove downtown and met my wife at a bar in ala moana for taco tuesday all the clerks gossiped about their judges but i just drank margaritas and smiled about this secret thing i was doing that night while i was asleep i heard the office phone ringing and when i got up the next morning i already had messages on my answering machine holy shit i thought it s happening most of the responses were from the big trade houses all those 212 numbers but i d also sent the proposal to an editor named hollis heimbouch at harvard business school press an academic publisher of leadership books and business case studies i just remember reading it and saying wow this is incredible heimbouch now the publisher of harper business recalled i m thinking wow i d love to publish this and then thinking wow could we ever publish that here the big publishers were interested but with a caveat editors wanted to be able to get out of the deal if when they learned what it was they didn t think it was cool enough but heimbouch wasn t worried about that she said i didn t really care that much about what it was truthfully she said i just thought what an amazing opportunity to see that story unfold the process of innovation and so just a few days after sending out the proposal we sold it to hollis heimbouch and harvard business school press for 250 000 two hundred and fifty thousand dollars i couldn t believe it rafe of course was focused on how much we could ve made if only we could have told people what the invention actually was but i was over the moon just like rafe always did when he made a big deal i emailed a bunch of co agents and foreign rights scouts the people who help agents make translation deals advertisement advertisement advertisement steve too was thrilled his hard work was paying off and he was going to get to tell an incredible story that night i went up to a big banquet at dean s house he said i was very excited and i told dean about it and he was very excited and then like three days later it all blew up it was this funny hinge moment between the old and the new said kurt andersen a founder of inside com the website that broke the it story it was suddenly the future the mission of inside com which andersen founded with michael hirschorn was to report on the media entertainment and technology industries with a gimlet eye we had this idea of a kind of knowing smart fun journalistic thing andersen told me that would cover all these worlds in a way that it seemed to us neither the trade magazines or the new york magazines of the world covered with sufficient rigor closeness knowledge knowingness whatever andersen and hirschorn hired away reporters and columnists from big outlets the wall street journal new york because it was the dot com era and we could convince people to leave good jobs for a startup that seemed internet adjacent on the promise of stock options for the first months of its existence inside com struggled to capture the attention of general readers and then in the first days of 2001 an inside com writer named pj mark heard about our book deal and got his hands on the proposal for it on jan 9 three days after the deal the site ran with the story and ran with it big with a big headline what is it book proposal heightens intrigue about secret invention touted as bigger than the internet or pc advertisement advertisement advertisement the post broke down the business details of the deal but mostly focused on the proposal s secrecy though there are no specifics in the proposal as to what the invention is there are some tantalizing clues mark wrote is it an energy source some sort of environmentally friendly personal transport device one editor who saw the proposal went as far as to speculate jokingly perhaps that it was a type of personal hovering craft for steve the news came via a phone call from a reporter at his local paper the hartford courant asking him questions that could only have come from the book proposal how do you know these things steve asked oh the reporter replied you don t know that your proposal s been leaked compounding steve s confusion the reporter kept referring to the invention as it until steve who still didn t know about our title change asked what is it it was a perfect scoop for inside com and the perfect story for its moment as the dot com bubble was bursting here was an actual invention from an inventor like thomas edison or something it wasn t you know bits and bytes said andersen it was this physical thing the story got picked up everywhere the new york times cnn the washington post the bbc on good morning america a tech bigmouth named bob metcalfe claimed he d seen it and it was bigger than the internet kamen irritated told steve he d never shown ginger to bob metcalfe on npr s talk of the nation juan williams asked a wired editor so you think it might be some kind of anti gravity device it was one of the first genuinely viral stories on the internet so viral they were talking about it on the news advertisement advertisement advertisement and on the internet it was inescapable witness this trapped in amber artifact of early 21st century virality the lycos 50 blog post a kind of proto trending topics index of what people were searching for on the lycos search engine it was no 4 for the week ending jan 13 behind only dragonball britney spears and napster the blogger aaron schatz wrote this week was a textbook example of how the internet speeds information distribution faster than anyone can figure out what the information is at the beginning of the week hardly anyone had heard of it or dean kamen by week s end it became more popular than the nfl 6 or las vegas 8 and inventor kamen outpaced pamela anderson 16 and eminem 18 inside com seeing the splash its scoop made moved quickly to flood the zone it was huge for us andersen said inside ran a post with kamen s offended response to the leak then another post parsing kamen s response for clues it ran a post about it hype then another post asking if it was overhyped and andersen was ready to use the it story to build his new startup even bigger he and hirschorn wanted to launch a print magazine to soak up the print advertising money that was flowing to anything that even resembled technology they were friends with john battelle the founder of the wildly successful industry standard a print magazine about internet culture it was a weekly andersen marveled a weekly and it was bulging with advertising they literally i think didn t have enough editorial content to put between the ads he laughed we figured we know how to do magazines and they re barely online yet they are making a gazillion dollars with a weekly print magazine advertisement advertisement advertisement inside magazine s debut issue published in february on the cover what it is the author of the story a freelancer named adam penenberg had combed domain name registrations and public patent records and was positive he d figured out the answer it was a hydrogen powered scooter i was on like every show for a week penenberg told me i was on the today show with katie couric i don t know how many hundreds of interviews i must have done that week dean kamen hadn t been careful enough for the new world of the internet all those patents he filed his inventor s paranoia backfired in an earlier time a journalist would have had to do a lot more legwork to dig up those patents but now they were all right there on the patent office s website penenberg may have basically worked out that ginger was a scooter but plenty of people didn t believe it or maybe it was just more fun to speculate like crazy some of that speculation happened on sites like slashdot where one poster for example correctly pegged that the name ginger was meaningful but then declared authoritatively that it was a hoverboard because the ginger in question was the heroine of the animated movie chicken run who is convinced she can teach chickens to fly advertisement advertisement advertisement but most of the speculation happened on one it specific site run by the brothers james and greg bottorff the bottorffs already ran websites like bargainflix com a price comparison tool for online dvd sales and ps2bargains com the sites were successful enough that greg had quit his job as a pharmaceutical rep to manage them full time but nothing prepared them for the frenzy that met theitquestion com in its first 24 hours online theitquestion com just a collection of links and a message board for speculation and argument racked up 100 000 hits about a week after it launched a user found some drawings of a person riding a scooter in a deka patent application and the bottorffs uploaded the images to the site when time magazine linked to the images greg remembered the servers crashed in the middle of the night i had to race out to where our servers were physically housed he said and renegotiate our deal everyone was so hungry for speculation about it that the bottorffs started being quoted in the media as experts greg recalled james and i would laugh about the fact that you know he s sitting in cincinnati i m sitting in my spare bedroom in raleigh we have no idea what s going on all we did was put a board up and now we re the world experts on this new invention it even made it onto south park in the season 5 episode the entity mr garrison invents a revolutionary new transportation device called it which gets over 300 miles to the gallon we re going to have to rethink cities marvels steve jobs echoing our book proposal in classic south park style the only wrinkle is that it is controlled by the rider with four levers shaped like penises one held in each hand one in the mouth and one in the anus to keep the driver in place advertisement advertisement advertisement all of this hubbub felt completely new a wild confluence of the internet and old media birthing something we d never had before a print magazine spun off from a website that had scoured online patent applications venerable time magazine crashing a tiny little fan site because it didn t bother uploading its own images tv shows making jokes about things they read online in the wreckage of web 1 0 the new internet was stirring to rafe sagalyn a seasoned agent who d been through plenty of deals the publicity though unprecedented and poorly timed for a book that wouldn t come out for years was a thrill it was a once in a lifetime thing without a doubt he said i just think we were smiling all the way but the gulf between how rafe remembers the it feeding frenzy and how i remember it is a great clue as to why he has had an enormously successful career as a literary agent and i have not because i was miserable every morning i woke up out there on my island stressed and anxious i was supposed to be excited but instead i felt completely in over my head i didn t know how the story had leaked but i was sure it was my fault i would go to theitquestion com and click around the message boards and read everyone s debates about it i still didn t even know what it was but reading speculation was a way of avoiding all the emails piled up in my inbox advertisement advertisement advertisement a lot of those emails were from steve kemper who was still trying to report the book even though dean kamen was going crazy because his secret project was now front page news the company was in turmoil one employee told me that there were news crews parked outside and journalists hanging out in diners hoping to overhear a deka employee let slip it secrets within weeks john doerr seizing on the mess had convinced kamen to get rid of his ceo and head of marketing it didn t matter that the poor guy had never even had a chance to test market ginger because kamen wouldn t let him show it to anybody he was gone on the media side so was inside magazine which andersen and hirschorn sold in april by october the website was gone too steve had tried to salvage his relationship with kamen and his access the day after that first inside com post steve drove back up to deka to explain that he hadn t leaked anything at least not on purpose he didn t know how it had happened he had spent 18 months at deka and in some ways become part of the team on the wall of the ginger testing room where all the engineers autographed their notable crashes there was a big hole labeled in sharpie steve k those engineers told steve they were honestly glad that ginger was finally out there but kamen was beside himself the inventor told steve he still thought the book was important but the investors wanted to kill it the reporter reminded kamen that it was his call not the investors call when steve walked out of the building he realized he d forgotten something and tried to open the door but his key card no longer worked he was out advertisement advertisement advertisement the curtain finally came up on the segway personal transporter in december 2001 just under a year after the proposal leaked when kamen in his jeans and work boots went on good morning america it s sort of like putting on a pair of magic sneakers he told diane sawyer you think forward you go forward sawyer might have been dubious at first but she got that same dopey ginger smile as soon as she got a chance to take the segway out for a spin steve kemper watched on his tv in connecticut segway was a name he d never heard before the product of a high priced naming consultant the very idea of which he d heard dean kamen mock many times the thing was bigger than he thought it would be bulkier not the trim sporty version he d ridden but the heavier edition made in hopes it would be adopted by institutions i watched on tv at my mother in law s house in maryland my wife s clerkship was over i d quit working for rafe and we were hunting for an apartment in new york i had hoped and wished that it would be something incredible something bigger and better than the scooter inside magazine had predicted it was not advertisement advertisement advertisement time magazine put the segway on the cover and gave seven pages to the invention in that story kamen said the segway would be to the car what the car was to the horse and buggy jay leno rode out on a segway to do his tonight show monologue and then let the night s guests russell crowe and sting ride them too the next week the segway even appeared on the cover of the new yorker osama bin laden riding a segway along a mountain pass in afghanistan fleeing coalition forces in style yet despite this launch to end all launches the segway was not a hit it was of course a flop there are plenty of reasons why for instance you couldn t even buy one until a year after this big reveal and when you could it cost 5 000 dooming the segway to be a plaything for rich people no one at deka had ever been told the price point was too high because no market research had ever been conducted kamen had spent years believing that price didn t matter wasn t it jeff bezos who had told him you have a product so revolutionary you ll have no problem selling it but now even as kamen s regulatory team cleared the way with specially crafted legislation allowing segways on sidewalks in dozens of states and cities no one was purchasing the segways to ride on those sidewalks remember when kamen leased that factory to make 6 000 segways every week a year after launch wired reported that the segway factory was manufacturing not 6 000 not 600 not 60 but 10 segways a week advertisement advertisement advertisement the company had expected that any softness in consumer sales would be made up for by corporate and institutional partnerships with organizations like disney and the u s postal service but that never panned out even the police department in segway s hometown manchester ordered only four and didn t use them much they were fine for parking enforcement the department told a reporter but mountain bikes were cheaper and lighter and they never ran out of juice the segway s delays cost weight and battery problems all derived primarily from one issue how beautifully engineered perhaps overengineered the segway was the segway was almost absurdly well made with custom components and redundancies built into every system to avoid breakdowns and accidents segways even had two identical motors attached to two separate batteries just in case something failed william sahlman the harvard professor who helped dean kamen find investors and invested himself told a story that i m going to quote in full because it so perfectly explains how the segway was too well made for the market to bear the segway had a kickstand so you would get off you deploy the kickstand and it would stand there while you went away that was all terrific except that they were concerned the kickstand would deploy while you were riding and that would be quite unfortunate so they made the kickstand out of a relatively soft plastic so it would break off so within the first week of anyone owning one of these devices the kickstand broke it just they would lean on it and the kickstand broke so you say well that s not a big problem it s a little plastic thing you screw a new one on well it took a torque measuring wrench and a degree in engineering from caltech and 45 minutes to replace the kickstand advertisement advertisement advertisement the effect of all this redundancy and extra weight of course was to cause the batteries to drain quickly especially considering how early in the development of rechargable batteries 2002 was ideally you d be able to swap a drained battery for a fresh one except of course that the segway s battery compartment was hermetically sealed to make it waterproof william sahlman you needed a torque measuring wrench and a degree from caltech and mit to get the battery out there was also the dork problem riding a segway felt cool but it didn t look cool niles crane looked like a dork riding one on frasier g o b bluth looked like a dork riding one on arrested development but no one looked more like a dork riding a segway than paul blart the hero of paul blart mall cop a movie that made 146 million at the box office and cemented more than any other pop culture product the gooniness of the segway nick bakay who co wrote paul blart with its star kevin james said that as soon as they saw a mall cop riding a segway they basically knew they had a movie bakay spoke eloquently about what it is that makes a segway so uniquely uncool there s something about the motion he said it is more graceful than threatening he laughed you know you put a big man on one of those things and you re halfway to comedy right there this was never what kamen was envisioning back in 2000 kamen had met with steven spielberg and tried to convince him that what his upcoming sci fi mystery minority report needed to accurately depict the future was to put its cops on segways kamen wanted tom cruise on a segway instead he got paul blart advertisement advertisement advertisement but by 2009 when paul blart came out kamen was almost ready to leave the segway behind the company had gone through nine ceos and kamen was ready to sell the company was bought by a british millionaire named jimi heselden heselden who made his fortune selling a brand new kind of sandbag to the military loved segways and had big plans for the company all that ended in 2010 when heselden accidentally drove his segway off a cliff according to an inquest heselden backed up to make way for a dog walker on the trail lost his balance and spun out of control when i asked steve about this story he sighed remembering the long hours he spent watching deka s product safety team trying to envision every possible dangerous scenario a rider might put their invention in the machine is not totally foolproof he said finally because fools are so ingenious as the saying goes the death of the one guy who still loved segways enough to invest in segway killed by his segway basically seemed to put a cap on the dark comedy of ginger it was too expensive it looked doofy it was cursed end of story advertisement advertisement advertisement but i still think there was one more factor in segway s failure every once in a while a product comes to market and the seas part and everyone loves it immediately most of the time though new products are flawed and the audience doesn t quite understand them immediately they wobble but they get the chance to regain their balance the segway despite its ability to balance itself never got that opportunity the problem i think was the impossible dreams everyone had for it when it was a mystery it was the coolest invention in the world once you saw the segway it was just a scooter it could never quite recover from that letdown and that s why i can t stop thinking that the segway might still have had a chance but for the hype for what it s worth sahlman agrees there were no possible chances to live up to the hype he said that s as much hype as you can get about something period full stop and so everyone wanted a magic carpet the bottorff brothers who were so excited about it that they built a website so popular it sucked bandwidth from their actual moneymaking websites agree all these fantasies that ran through your head and all these amazing breakthroughs that were going to revolutionize the world are now in front of you james bottorff said but it didn t eliminate combustion engines it didn t do half the things that people were speculating on the board and kurt andersen who put it on the cover of the first issue of inside magazine agrees this it s going to change the world nature he said that s pretty easy to fall short of which led andersen to a question what if we hadn t done what we did he asked what if it had just been a thing and it came out and dean kamen did it advertisement advertisement advertisement if a 26 year old dumbass hadn t accidentally leaked the proposal who knows what would have happened because after all this time i do think the leak had a lot to do with how little i truly understood about book publishing and how little we all understood about what the internet was about to become leave aside the obvious in retrospect foolishness of swearing editors to secrecy and then sending them the book proposal by email a medium that absolutely invites immediate dissemination the real problem was what happened after the sale when i did what i thought agents were supposed to do i sent the proposal to book scouts who worked for foreign publishers but i was playacting i didn t really understand the way that ecosystem works that scouts trade material back and forth they gossip they share and once something enters their world it s everywhere you ask an editor to keep a proposal secret they ll do it you ask a scout you re basically telling them please don t do the thing that is the whole point of your job adam penenberg who wrote the inside magazine cover story told me as much he got the proposal from a scout he said and everyone he knew got it from scouts too including the inside com reporter pj mark who had once been a scout himself you know listen you blew it as soon as you tried to secure foreign rights he told me as soon as you sent that book proposal out it wasn t secret anymore once upon a time it wouldn t have mattered if a bunch of book scouts and their friends knew about this book proposal but all of a sudden sharing leapt the bounds of the real world and went online the internet was transforming into the all encompassing media eating real world changing monster we know now but we were transforming too collapsing the boundaries between the online and the real so that it would eventually become just about impossible to distinguish between the two advertisement advertisement advertisement when i talked to steve kemper this spring i finally told him the answer to the question that had occupied so much of our attention 20 years ago who leaked the proposal it turned out it was me in hawaii i said by accident but i leaked it all the same he let me off the hook i believed that you guys knew what you were doing he said and it could have happened to anybody but i see what you re saying dan i mean you were naïve like i was naïve he took a deep breath that s what happens to naïve people they take one in the forehead you know i stopped trying to be a literary agent not too long after all the segway stuff happened for a lot of reasons but in the back of my mind there was always my sneaking suspicion that it was my carelessness that ruined everything for steve i didn t want to do that to another author i eventually moved into journalism in part i think because i so admired what i saw steve do amid the swirl of speculation and hype and wild promises there was always his sure reporting steve did write the book on the segway it s called reinventing the wheel it s a very very good portrait of innovation and of how a promising project can go completely off the rails like everything having to do with segway it didn t work out the way everyone thought it would deka s lawyers managed to hold up publication just long enough that by the time it came out the bloom was off the rose rafe recalled it got good reviews but the frenzy was behind us and i think it probably sold fewer than 25 000 copies advertisement advertisement advertisement now in 2021 steve just turned in another book his fourth this one s about the last u s ambassador to japan before pearl harbor he told me he thinks it s his final one when i asked steve what lesson he took from the ordeal of the segway story he surprised me you don t get many chances at something like i got to do he said embed yourself with this kind of group of people this kind of main character and tell that story from the inside it just doesn t happen i wish i d had another opportunity to do something like it again dean kamen and deka are still up in manchester i left about a dozen voicemails for kamen s longtime administrator i sent word through friends and he never responded the company s still working on big projects like a portable water purifier it s still trying to make fred the stair climbing wheelchair work dubbed the ibot it bombed for johnson johnson because it was way too expensive but the next time you go to the movies you might see a different deka innovation the coca cola freestyle machine that miracle device that mixes flavors into your diet coke as precisely as kamen s first invention the drug infusion pump delivered medication at carefully calibrated levels and segways they re pretty hard to find these days a few weeks ago i walked over to capital segway one of those companies that runs tours of downtown d c the clerk a segway expert who had a very specific complaint about an inaccuracy in paul blart mall cop 2 gave me a short lesson put a helmet on me and sent me out to ginger around the national mall i could feel my dopey grin growing as i zipped across the gravel i understood finally why investor after investor lined up to give dean kamen money why people believed they would sell 6 000 segways a week why steve jobs declared that cities would architect themselves around this device it felt absolutely remarkable riding on it floating 6 inches above the ground propelled forward by a technology i could never understand in a million years a technology sufficiently advanced as to be indistinguishable from magic advertisement advertisement advertisement when i returned the segway i told the guy at the rental place how i d learned about all the incredible inspiration and innovation and work and skill that had gone into the segway all to make something that cost 10 times as much as a scooter and required a lesson from an expert to ride he said something i cannot stop thinking about yeah he said a bunch of really smart people got together but you needed one dumb person in the room to keep things on the level capital segway still receives product support from its parent company but segway now owned by the chinese company ninebot is no longer focused on the personal transporters in fact it doesn t make them anymore instead segway which declined to comment for this story now manufactures a significant number of the rental scooters the birds and the limes that you can see zipping around every american city in fact segway s children are everywhere scooters electric boosted skateboards all the new backbones of the short urban commute benge ambrogi the longtime deka engineer noted that there s a picture of a single wheeled hoverboard the kind you actually see cool people riding around cities in one of deka s old ginger patents the deka guys scoff at these cheaper flimsier transportation devices these hoverboards and stuff i mean i wouldn t get on one said mike ambrogi benge s brother who also worked at deka for years one hundred things could go wrong that could put your face right in the pavement you see those batteries they light on fire because they weren t very well designed that would never happen with a segway battery but of course astronomically more people own and ride cheap scooters and junky hoverboards than ever owned or used a segway heading back to my office just walking on my plain old feet i thought about how the segway was an elegant work of genius when what the world really needed was a good enough piece of crap maybe in the end i didn t kill the segway it might have had a chance if only i hadn t been the only dumb guy around

spanish prime minister pedro sánchez s recent three day trip to the united states has yet again made very clear the class interests defended by the spanish government formed by sánchez s socialist party psoe and his pseudo left ally podemos significantly sánchez did not visit the capital washington d c nor did he publicly meet with joe biden or any other official representative of the us government instead he met with investment bankers hedge fund managers and other major corporate heads sánchez was traveling not as a representative of the spanish people as is usually presented in the capitalist media but as a lackey in the service of spain s banks and corporations spain s prime minister pedro sanchez speaks during a news conference ap photo paul white the explicit aim of the trip was to attract investments from large vulture funds and other possible us investors using the 140 billion euros spain expects to receive in european union eu bailout funds in exchange for massive attacks on the working class pension and labour reforms and austerity the psoe podemos governments hopes to obtain an additional 500 billion in private investment during his visit sánchez met with a long list of banks and fund managers ares management corporation bank of america blackstone group bank of new york mellon brookfield asset management roko capital management j p morgan catterton partners lone star funds morgan stanley providence equity partners soros fund management wellington management group and also the us chamber of commerce in spain sánchez offered all of them guarantees that he will continue his attacks on the working class in spain podemos promotes the lie that a new labour reform is part of social measures to improve working conditions but in the united states sánchez made clear that he intends to escalate attacks on workers as el país explained the prime minister explained to them that the labor reform agreed with podemos and also negotiated with brussels will mean that spain is moving towards the german model of labor relations where there is social peace but also flexibility for employers to adapt to circumstances through the use of furlough schemes without redundancies by german model of labor relations sánchez really was talking about the notorious hartz laws which created conditions for the emergence of a huge low wage sector this in turn served as a lever to smash wages and working conditions wiping out many thousands of well paid industrial jobs the result of the model hailed by sánchez has been an explosion of social inequality in germany there are 136 billionaires and 542 000 millionaires on the other hand 13 million people live in poverty the highest number since german reunification in 1991 sánchez boasted to investors that pro podemos unions will suppress the class struggle el país added sánchez explained to them that spain is a country with few strikes with social peace and constant negotiation between employers and unions in other words the trade unions play a fundamental role in suppressing the class struggle and working with big business to impose wage cuts plant closures and pension reforms he also told them not to worry about his government s new housing law this was of special interest to these hedge funds blackstone is spain s largest landlord with more than 40 000 homes out of the nearly 240 000 managed by hedge funds in spain while lone star owns around 15 000 pedro sánchez made clear that he had no intention of limiting their profits by regulating rents this issue affects millions of workers and youth according the platform for those affected by mortgages pah since 2008 there have been more than one million evictions in spain in addition to the real estate sector other groups such as j p morgan morgan stanley providence or wellington have strong investments in various sectors such as mobile telephony energy banking food and other sectors in spain but it is global investment fund blackrock that has the largest slice of spain s economy with 17 billion worth of shares in 18 of the 35 companies of the ibex 35 spain s principal stock market index blackrock is the world s largest asset management corporation with 9 trillion in assets under management as of june 2021 it holds stakes in almost all major multinational companies including coca cola microsoft monsanto and apple among others to understand its size and influence it is enough to say that if it were a country it would be the world s third largest economy by size its president and ceo larry fink is known as the fixer for being the person who fixes things in the financial market sánchez reportedly held a private one on one meeting with fink podemos has covered for sánchez s visit podemos leader and deputy prime minister yolanda díaz declared i suppose they have talked about taxes adding that this is the only interesting thing about a visit to a large investment fund she concluded the president has done his job then cynically explained investment funds are in the world to make money and governments especially progressive ones are there to improve people s lives díaz s cynicism has no end she and her government have done nothing but work tirelessly with the collaboration of the trade unions to benefit these investment funds the examples are many spanish banks laid off 15 000 workers in the first six months of this year all rubber stamped by the trade unions and endorsed by díaz herself this has allowed the banks to announce last week 4 billion in profits which will keep blackrock and the ibex 35 happy the monthly rise in electricity bills that is ruining millions of workers green lighted by the psoe podemos government is benefiting large spanish corporations like iberdrola the latest pension reform signed by the government and trade unions with the employers opens the way towards the privatization of pensions through company pension plans in line with the aggressive promotion of these schemes by the hedge funds in spain and throughout europe these hedge funds have also profited from the herd immunity policy pursued by madrid and the european union prioritising corporate profits over workers lives while these firms made billions in profits the cost in human lives of this policy has been over 100 000 deaths in spain and over 1 1 million across europe europe is now confronting a new wave under the virulent delta variant as capitalist governments across the continent continue to aggressively reopen the economy sánchez s visit to america confirms the warnings that the international committee of the fourth international icfi has made about pseudo left parties like podemos and their political satellites workers cannot expect anything from sánchez podemos the trade unions or their political satellites they defend the interests of the billionaires and the big multinationals the critical question is the struggle to give a political perspective to workers for a struggle against the pseudo left by forming sections of the icfi in spain and throughout europe

by charles hugh smith the truth is america has lost its way if commoners pay a rate of 40 but its billionaires pay next to nothing as with everything else in polarized america billionaires proclaiming space tourism is the next big thing for humanity neatly divides opinion into two camps those who laud the initiative hard work and innovations of the billionaires as examples of the american can do dream and those who wished the billionaire space tourists had taken a one way flight to a distant orbit of blissful silence setting aside that bitter divide let s explore another divide how our two tier tax system enables billionaires to become billionaires while the rest of us get poorer whenever i discuss the taxes of the non billionaire self employed armies of apologists leap to the defense of the status quo with various quibbles the 0 9 medicare surcharge only kicks in above 200 000 the cap on social security taxes is 142 800 and so on setting aside the quibbles and recall the tax code with regulatory notes is thousands of pages let s deal with the real issue which is that billionaires and their corporations pay a thin slice of taxes as a percentage of total income gains if they pay any at all while self employed and small business pay extraordinarily high tax rates to all the quibblers please add the 15 3 social security medicare tax rate self employed sole proprietors pay both the employee and employer share of this tax to the federal tax rate of 24 for income above 85 520 it s 39 3 just how hard would it be to conclude that everyone earning more than 142 000 should pay at least the same rate the rest of us pay aren t we demonstrating all those same laudable traits of the billionaires just on a smaller scale why should we pay 40 and the billionaires pay essentially zero gee do you reckon paying no taxes might help folks become richer garsh nobody ever asked that question before and do you reckon paying 40 of your income might make you poorer over time golly gee how come the talking heads worshiping the billionaires never ask these questions since social security and medicare medicaid are the bedrock of america s social safety net why shouldn t billionaires pay to support these programs well why not just how lame do the excuses have to be to be recognized as laughably self serving here s the trick billionaires use to evade taxes there are countless ways for the super wealthy to evade taxes funnel earnings through an irish post office box buy a tax break in washington dc slide the money into one of dozens of global tax havens and so on but a simple one is to report no income and live large off borrowed money as the billions of dollars in capital gains pile up as the billionaire s stock holdings soar thanks federal reserve for the free trillions awful swell of you to give us all that free money there s no income generated until the billionaire sells some shares no sale no income just pay yourself 1 a year in salary borrow against your billions at super low rates of interest and voila you re tax free while you build your super yacht buy your private island and so on just as a thought experiment suppose the first 50 000 in earnings for everyone were tax free and a 40 tax rate was collected on all income above 1 million both earned and unearned capital gains not when the gains were realized in a sale but at the end of every tax year whether the shares that rose in value were sold or not so billionaire space tourist reaped 10 billion in capital gains from the appreciation of stocks held then the billionaire pays 40 of those gains 4 billion there is a way to not pay any taxes on capital gains have your portfolio lose value no gains no taxes and to close all the loopholes the tax rate is on all assets and income connected in any way shape or form with the u s first they pay the u s taxes then if they want to pay other nations taxes as well be my guest but the 40 is due and payable regardless of any other conditions you don t like it then stop selling any products in the u s or holding any assets in the u s why should billionaires get to set up immensely profitable monopolies quasi monopolies cartels and corporations in the u s but pay near zero in taxes why should billionaires be free to profit from america s economy but pay nothing to support its citizenry what precisely is the logic of reducing taxes on the wealthiest few to near zero if there is no logic then we re left with corruption america is a moral cesspool we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the truth is america has lost its way if commoners pay a rate of 40 but its billionaires pay next to nothing please note karma and divine retribution are not controlled by the billionaire s lackeys and apparatchiks in the federal reserve the pendulum of exploitation has reached its extreme and the reversal to the opposite extreme is underway if you found value in this content please join me in

casualties in the 2021 gaza war how many and who were they by eli nirenberg and lenny ben david map of hamas rockets that misfired and fell in gaza idf spokesperson during the eleven days of hamas rocket assault against israel 12 civilians in israel and an idf soldier omer tabib were killed by hamas terrorists â an additional 312 civilians and three soldiers were wounded in israel in gaza the hamas run ministry of health claimed 256 deaths â hamas leader yahya sinwar said that only 80 were combatants â the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha wrote at least 253 palestinians have been killed 129 of whom were civilians that means 124 of the dead were combatants close to a 1 1 ratio unprecedentedly low in terms of civilians killed in urban warfare according to the intelligence and terrorism information center in israel nine children and ten adults were killed by palestinian rocket fire â ocha concluded the result was hamas killing its own civilians and destroying infrastructure it is critical to emphasize that not all deaths in gaza were caused by israeli weaponry at least 680 palestinian rockets fell short or misfired landing inside gaza these rocket misfires account for some 15 percent of the total palestinian rockets launched history repeated itself for the unfortunate residents of gaza in 2015 a hamas rocket fell short and killed eleven children in the latest round of fighting a palestinian rocket struck power lines in the strip leaving many palestinians without power during the war israel s precision strikes spared civilians the israel defense forces sought to avoid civilians however in cases of senior hamas and palestinian islamic jihad commanders hiding amid civilians including their families the idf struck at theseâ militaryâ targets â all considered as such under international military law idf airstrikes also targeted the metro a massive underground network of tunnels built by hamas that contained command posts weapons storage rooms enabling the movement of fighters unseen in order to attack israel the idf has named 25 senior commanders and senior technical officials of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad who were killed in airstrikes among those were bassem issa commander of hamas in gaza city juma tahla head of hamas cyber command khazem khatib hamas chief engineer and dr jamal zabdeh an aerodynamical engineer and head of development the head of the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees unrwa in gaza matthias schmale told israeli tv that israeli airstrikes in gaza were precise and did not hit with some exceptions civilian targets â he later had to apologize to hamas for this statement israel s moral defense forces israel makes every effort to save civilian lives and every death is considered tragic british col richard kemp who fought against the taliban in afghanistan called the idf the most moral army in the world for good reason â there has never been another situation in modern urban warfare in which armed forces destroyed 1 000 military targets and such a low number of civilians were lost this result is not a coincidence it is because of intentionally cautious idf procedures that save palestinian lives the idf makes phone calls in arabic to residents near targets drops leaflets and even engages in roof knocking of buildings in which small bomblets are dropped on roofs to spur people to flee before the target is destroyed 10 â idf commanders give civilians ample time to flee and ensure that as many lives as possible are saved recently a journalist complained 11 â that the idf only gave him one hour to flee from an office building used by hamas 12 â he failed to mention that nobody was killed in the strike despite the building housing hamas facilities and offices here is the text of an idf phone call to a gaza resident in arabic prior to an attack that appeared on a un website how are you is everything okay this is the israeli military we need to bomb your home and we are making every effort to minimize casualties please make sure that no one is nearby since in five minutes we will attack a un stated on june 21 2021 the idf are on solid legal ground when attacking military infrastructure the problem being the infrastructure is interwoven with ordinary peoples lives emphasis added the idf should acknowledge that they will inevitably kill civilians who can t escape the conflict when destroying military targets in gaza and possibly find other ways to destroy military targets gaza s factions in turn should stop committing the war crime of firing rockets from residential areas towards other residential areas which would in turn not provoke a violent response from israel hamas turns palestinian civilians into a terror weapon while the idf makes every effort to protect the innocent hamas makes every effort to put them in harm s way hamas intentionally places its missile launchers mortars armories tunnel systems and other weaponry in civilian areas hamas terror tunnels have been found underneath schools apartment buildings and adjacent to hospitals missile launchers are concealed in densely populated residential neighborhoods with no regard to the lives of those who must live alongside them even the press has been threatened to accept hamas weapons in and around their offices according to a former journalist who worked for theâ associated press the deaths of children one of the most distressing aspects of media coverage of the 2021 fighting was the deaths of children the intelligence and terrorism information center in israel found that 62 children in gaza under 16 were killed however at least nine of these youth were killed by errant hamas rockets likewise under the cruel reality of the hamas regime many young individuals are already combatants and pose deadly threats to the lives of others before adulthood according to the coalition to save palestinian child soldiers at least 160 minors have died digging hamas tunnels and at least 29 have died as suicide bombers â hamas lauds the presence of youth in its armed wing promoting a culture ofâ jihadâ and martyrdom from a young age in education and media â though of course not all children who were tragically lost were involved in terrorist operations the incomprehensible truth is that some were hamas recruitment of children to the cause ofâ jihadâ is emphasized by the militants following the recent fighting the head of hamas in gaza yahya sinwar raised a child brandishing a gun and called for the elimination of israel kindergarten graduation ceremonies re enact the murder of jews hours of this type of footage may be seen in the gaza children s tv programâ self sacrificing fighter fida i â the show includes scenes that justify the murder of jews because they are all criminals on the israeli side five year old ido avigal was killed by rocket shrapnel when a hamas rocket struck his family s apartment building in sderot â sixteen year old nadine awad a muslim arab israeli girl from lod and her father were also killed by palestinian rocket fire mainstream media embraces inaccuracies regarding gaza children theâ new york timesâ provides a case study of inaccurate reporting on casualties among palestinian children on may 26 2021 theâ timesâ published a front page report entitled they were only children which displayed pictures of 67 children in gaza allegedly killed by israel it included 20 year old khaled al qanou and 15 year old muhammad suleiman both confirmed hamas members engaged in violent anti israel activity in addition in its initial publication â corrected later â the paper included an old stock photo of a young girl and falsely claimed that israel had killed her palestinians do not all die from the conflict hamas and other anti israel groups in gaza are known to blur the lines between those who died of natural causes and those who died in the war theâ cia factbookâ reports the natural death rate including infants in gaza to be 2 94 1 000 people â with a population of just over two million about 6 000 gaza residents die of natural causes in a year about 16 deaths per day these statistics do not include the deadly impact of the covid 19 virus in gaza it is safe to assume that many people in gaza also died of natural causes during the eleven day war in the strip where hamas tightly censors information it is difficult to know if some natural deaths were falsely attributed to deaths from the conflict especially during the time of the coronavirus pandemic it would not be the first time such errors are used for propaganda purposes in 2020 u s congresswoman rashida tlaib retweeted a tweet from palestinian official hanan ashrawi claiming that a herd of violent israeli settlers threw qais abu ramila into a well in fact the boy had accidentally drowned in a rain ditch the intrafada hamas murders other palestinians whenever israel retaliates against gaza terrorists and facilities the regime in gaza searches in its midst for possible spies and israeli collaborators hamas uses these victims as scapegoats for their own failures accusing them of providing information to israel but does not present evidence or hold a trial sometimes hamas does not release the names of those they execute leading some to suspect that they added these individuals to the civilian casualty toll intelligence collection on this subject is difficult in the immediate aftermath of war but nearly a year after the gaza war of 2014 amnesty international exposed that hamas executed 23 palestinians during the 50 day war including six in a public firing squad execution in february 2016 a hamas commander mahmoud ishtiwi was executed without trial accused of providing israel with information used in a failed attempt to assassinate hamas military leader mohammed dief in 2014 â following the 2021 fighting hamas arrested 43 people on charges of spying for israel some of the accused may have already been brought before a military field court â this is routine behavior for the authoritarian hamas leadership and extrajudicial killings likely occurred as a result of this war as well more details will probably come out after the fact as in the previous wars eli nirenberg is a student at washington university in st louis lenny ben david is the jerusalem center s director of publications ben david served 25 years in senior posts in aipac in washington and jerusalem he served as israel s deputy chief of mission in the embassy in washington d c he is the author

by lee kah whyesingapore august 2 ani last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat

bloomberg the spread of the highly infectious strain of the virus which drove hospitalisations and deaths higher in states such as florida missouri and arkansas coincided with the economy growing in

officials in orange county florida home to walt disney world said they were in crisis mode as new cases of covid 19 reached levels seen during the worst days in 2020 and employers such as google and the washington post began requiring their employees to get immunised yet even an intense flare up of the delta variant is unlikely to trigger the blanket restrictions on businesses that battered the economy last year analysts said americans might withdraw from face to face activities such as dining out and the scheduled fall reopening of schools could be interrupted in some communities fed chair jerome powell said on wednesday but the pandemic has caused less economic disruption with each succeeding wave of infections as americans got vaccinated and learned how to work around the health risks it seems like we ve learned to handle this powell told reporters it doesn t seem as though the effects will be very large while the economy s 6 5 per cent second quarter growth rate fell below

re not detecting any impact at all in the sometimes perverse logic of the financial markets any larger than expected economic fallout from the delta variant could contain a silver lining if renewed concern about the virus causes the economy to slow the fed would likely delay the monetary policy tightening that investment managers fear the fed is waiting until it sees substantial further progress toward full employment and 2 per cent plus inflation before it begins reducing its monthly asset purchases powell said this week that tapering which would start a shift to a more challenging environment for investors who have grown accustomed to having a fed backstop for their risk taking is now expected early next year loading but nancy davis founder of quadratic capital management said a deterioration in the pandemic could rewrite that schedule if the delta variant becomes more of a risk she said that might just result in looser policy bloomberg

airbus otc eadsy has navigated the covid 19 pandemic with much greater ease than top rival boeing nyse ba the european plane maker has consistently delivered dramatically more commercial aircraft than its american counterpart and its backlog advantage over boeing has grown that said airbus wide body lineup has remained a weak spot particularly the a330neo fortunately the company landed a new a330neo order last week which will buy it much needed time to shore up its backlog a strategic weak point last year airbus delivered 566 commercial jets meanwhile boeing handed over just 157 as the 737 max wasn t recertified for commercial service in any markets until near the end of the year while the 737 max has now been approved to return to service in 175 countries with china and russia being the notable holdouts it hasn t helped the u s aerospace giant much so far airbus delivered nearly twice as many commercial jets as boeing in the first half of 2021 airbus also has a dramatically larger order backlog as of june 30 it had 6 925 firm orders in its backlog compared to 4 155 for boeing however boeing remains the wide body market leader although its advantage has shrunk over time in the first half of 2021 it delivered 43 wide bodies despite a series of production miscues impacting its best selling 787 dreamliner family airbus delivered 39 wide body jets during that period furthermore boeing has 821 wide body orders in its firm backlog compared to 775 for airbus the a330neo which competes directly with boeing s 787 is in particularly bad shape airbus ended june with 268 firm orders for the a330neo that may seem like a sizable number but many of these orders are likely to be cancelled in the future indeed top customer airasia x which has ordered 78 a330neos is teetering on the brink of insolvency and plans to slash its order book garuda indonesia with 13 outstanding a330neo orders faces a similar situation additionally iran air ordered 28 a330neos but won t be able to take any of them unless the u s lifts its current sanctions aircraft leasing firms account for many of the remaining disclosed a330neo orders but they need to line up customers to take delivery of those aircraft a desperately needed order last week airbus announced that german airline condor had committed to add 16 a330neos to its fleet replacing the aging boeing 767 300ers it currently uses for long haul flights deliveries will begin in late 2022 and run through 2024 condor will buy seven aircraft directly from airbus these appear to be white tails that were originally built for airasia x and garuda indonesia it will lease the other nine while that won t directly lead to new orders for airbus it ensures that leasing companies will take delivery of some of the aircraft they have already ordered in the near term staying afloat last year airbus slashed production of the a330 family to just two per month so far it has no plans to increase output beyond that level at this production rate airbus will struggle to make much if any money on a330s but there s no guarantee that airbus can sustain even a two per month production rate in the first half of 2021 the aircraft manufacturer delivered just seven a330s barely more than one per month finding enough near term customers to keep production at a minimum of two per month could be crucial for protecting the a330neo s long term viability in this context the condor orders and relatively quick delivery schedule will help in a big way between u s airline giant delta air lines and condor airbus has now filled at least half of its a330 delivery slots for the next three years based on current production rates this gives airbus a little bit of extra breathing room while the long haul travel market recovers however the condor order is just a start airbus needs existing a330neo customers to start taking delivery of the planes they have ordered and ideally to keep finding new customers in order to make its upgraded a330 successful this article originally appeared in the motley fool adam levine weinberg owns shares of delta air lines the motley fool recommends delta air lines the motley fool has a disclosure policy

newsletter on monday ramaphosa reflected on his visit to two vaccination sites in tembisa and midrand last week dear fellow south african last week i had a chance to meet some of the heroes on the frontline of our fight against covid 19 when i visited two vaccination sites in tembisa and midrand these heroes include the health workers administering the vaccines and the many south africans who are coming forward to be vaccinated and thereby safeguard the health of the nation the number of vaccinations administered in south africa has now passed the 7 5 million mark around three million people are fully vaccinated at the present rate we are vaccinating on average 220 000 people a day in the coming weeks this rate will increase significantly due to the arrival of more vaccine doses nearly 1 5 million single dose johnson johnson vaccines have been handed to the department of health in the last couple of days over the past weekend a donation of 5 66 million pfizer vaccines from the usa government began arriving in the country this is part of a donation of vaccines from the united states to african countries and low and middle income countries in other parts of the world our country is also making history the first covid 19 vaccines produced in africa for africa were released by aspen pharmacare from its flagship manufacturing plant in gqeberha last week these vaccines will be made available to the rest of the continent through the african vaccine acquisition task team which we set up during our tenure as african union chair thanks to the efforts of all involved in the multisectoral vaccine acquisition response we now have a comfortable supply of stocks to vaccinate our population the two vaccination sites i visited are among an estimated 3 000 vaccination sites we have set up in the country these sites are currently providing vaccines to any person above the age of 35 healthcare workers and employees in participating workplaces to meet demand several sites around the country are now operating on weekends and many innovations like vaccination drive throughs and mobile vaccination units are in operation one of the two vaccination sites i visited is run by the private sector in partnership with government and the other is run by the government yet both facilities had similar levels of excellent service and professionalism our private sector including medical schemes has worked alongside government from the onset of the pandemic helping to mobilise resources and most recently helping us meet our national vaccination targets at the rabasotho community centre in tembisa i saw government s batho pele principles in action the process was efficient and streamlined from the covid 19 vaccination card people are issued with to help them keep track of their doses to data capturing stations to observation stations with doctors on standby for those who have just received their jab importantly the site has an information area where those presenting for vaccination are given clear information in their own language on the different vaccine options available we spoke with mama rosemary mabaso 67 who had come for her second dose she said that the staff at the centre had treated her with the utmost care and courtesy and helped allay her initial fears of getting vaccinated i am encouraged that so many south africans accept the need to be vaccinated the latest national income dynamics study nids coronavirus rapid mobile survey cram found that there is increased public openness to accepting a covid 19 vaccine only 1 in 10 south africans believe that covid 19 vaccines are unsafe the mathebulas a couple from tembisa who had come to the centre together to get vaccinated told us that they were initially hesitant because of negative stories going around but had decided to follow government s advice to get vaccinated such expressions of confidence are greatly encouraging as are the words of mama mabasa who said i want to tell everyone out there is no need to be scared this vaccine is safe and it is helping us indeed vaccines are safe they are our best protection against this disease and the national vaccination programme is our surest guarantee of a swift health and economic recovery i want to encourage south africans to continue to follow the guidance of the world health organisation and our department of health around covid 19 vaccines we need to avoid spreading misleading and false information that can cause confusion as we work to vaccinate as many people as possible by end of the year we salute the officials healthcare workers and staff of the vaccination centres who are working tirelessly to support the national effort but by far the greatest heroes are the south african people of whose resilience and steadfastness i remain in awe over a year and a half we have experienced a deadly pandemic severe economic and social hardship and recently serious unrest wrought by those who want to see our country fail by going out and getting vaccinated we aren t just protecting ourselves we are performing a patriotic duty to our country and our fellow citizens in this great race to preserve human life let us continue to work together in the interests of the health and welfare of our nation in this way we will ensure that recovery is certain with best regards

size along with sustainable and innovative service development becoming more and more important we are now creating a company with a property value of sek 157 billion combined with a strong balance sheet which together with a maintained rating enables attractive financing terms and thus enhanced competitiveness the focus of the combined company is to continue creating shareholder value and to reach our long term objective of an annual growth in profit from property management per share of 10 percent with a maintained dividend of at least 50 percent of profit from property management i welcome the shareholders of kungsleden the opportunity to join this growth journey rationale for the proposed combination castellum believes that the management and employees of kungsleden have built a highly successful company with an attractive commercial property portfolio in sweden the combination of castellum and kungsleden will create significant value for all stakeholders where the company s size strong balance sheet and maintained financial strength will result in an enhanced competitive position strengthen the position as the leading listed commercial property company in the nordics castellum will through the combination with kungsleden strengthen its position as the nordics largest listed commercial property company and the fourth largest listed commercial property company in europe 7 the combined company will have a continued focus on long term growth sustainability and financial stability the combination is expected to create growth and shareholder value through an efficient common platform within property management by continued property and project acquisitions as well as development of existing properties and project portfolio the combined property portfolio consists mainly of offices and warehouses logistics where the former segment has a large element of public authorities 7 in terms of property value based on the latest information available as of 30 july 2021 the comparison with commercial property companies in the nordics and europe excludes public property companies mainly focusing on residential retail hotel or public service properties leading market position in nordic growth regions through complementing property portfolios castellum will after the combination with kungsleden have a high quality property portfolio focusing on commercial properties with a broad geographic diversification within attractive growth regions in sweden finland and denmark kungsleden s and castellum s property portfolios complement each other well

within less prioritised areas after the combination castellum s and kungsleden s combined industry experiences unlock full potential from project development the combined company will have an attractive portfolio with ongoing and upcoming projects of commercial properties which are expected to create a good foundation for future growth and profitability castellum as well as kungsleden have

million attractive financial profile with a sustained financial policy and increased access to capital the combined company will continue to have a strong financial position with the aim to maintain castellum s rating meaning an actual loan to value ratio below 45 percent castellum s policy to have a loan to value ratio not exceeding 50 percent remains for the new group whilst actual loan to value ratio is estimated to be below the policy in order to meet the rating requirement in order to achieve a lower loan to value ratio castellum plans to issue hybrid bonds during the second half of the year of 2021 while also divesting a property portfolio from the new company the latter may only occur once the companies have been combined furthermore castellum s financial target of annual growth in profit from property management per share of 10 percent and dividend of at least 50 percent per share of the profit from property management remains the combination is given the company s size expected to strengthen the position and competitiveness on the capital markets the combined company is also expected to gain increased attractiveness from debt investors as a result of a continued strong balance sheet lower portfolio risk maintained good rating as well as the possibility of issuing volume with high liquidity the combination of the companies is therefore assessed to further increase interest in castellum s shares both in sweden and internationally kungsleden has sought and received waivers from kungsleden s financing banks in respect of provisions such as change of control provisions under existing financing arrangements that may be invoked as a result of the offer strong and experienced management enables continuity in the combined company through the

dumb and dumber after the movie by the same name when t mobile hired john legere in 2012 as ceo the executive was looking for a way to stand out among rivals like verizon at t and sprint instead of wearing a pinstriped suit with a crisp white shirt and tie legere who wore his hair rock star length came to work wearing a magenta t mobile t shirt sneakers and a t mobile jacket he also made fun of the competition calling verizon and at t after the movie by the same name with legere gone t mobile no longer needs to taunt its rivals christmas carol in this video verizon is scrooge and when he is awakened by a shadowy figure he asks are you the ghost of christmas future the figure turns around and reveals himself to be legere who says no dumb ass i m the future of wireless every holiday season legere would release a video making fun of his two main rivals such as 2016 s take off of the in this video verizon is scrooge and when he is awakened by a shadowy figure he asks are you the ghost of christmas future the figure turns around and reveals himself to be legere who says no dumb ass i m the future of wireless the next year s video was a blatant take off of those stop action animation christmas classics found on television every year such as frosty the snowman as usual t mobile and legere are the good guys while dumb and dumber are evil perhaps the best holiday video was the one released in 2015 when classic christmas songs were given new lyrics in order to attack dumb and dumber santa claus is coming to town oh you d better not gouge you d better not scam death star and big red we re hip to your sham un carrier is coming to town by the way death star was another pet name from legere for at t and big red obviously was verizon for example check out this lyric to the tune of oh you d better not gouge you d better not scam death star and big red we re hip to your sham un carrier is coming to town by the way death star was another pet name from legere for at t and big red obviously was verizon legere left t mobile after turning the wireless provider from the fourth largest in the states or dead last to second behind only verizon his departure coincided with the closing of t mobile s purchase of sprint giving it control over the latter s mid band 2 5ghz spectrum allowing the carrier to be considered as the early favorite in the battle over u s 5g leadership with legere s former right hand man mike sievert now running the show t mobile hasn t missed a beat but one change is coming according to reuters the wire service says that t mobile will no longer try to generate a buzz by making fun of its rivals the truth is that t mobile no longer needs to act so big to attract subscribers the company continues to generate great earnings every quarter and recently announced its second quarter numbers recommended stories t mobile s latest goal is to beat out its rivals in the stock market something that it is doing quite easily since sievert took over from legere t mobile s stock has risen 70 while both verizon and at t have declined by 4 during the same time period researcher maribel lopez explains the changes that have been made by t mobile now that it is no longer an underdog t mobile ceo sievert went to high school with a famous rocker lopez says legere made it sexy he was bombastic he was taking on everyone as the un carrier and then we come out on the other side of that at this point it s about positioning as an equal that s a different kind of corporate personality hey here s a interesting bit of trivia for you t mobile fans ceo sievert was in the same high school class as brian warner who is brian warner you ask perhaps you know him better by the name he uses to perform under marilyn manson sievert says while we did grow up in the same small town i guess we took rather different paths coming out of canton ohio speaking of different paths kevin roe of roe equity research explains the difference between legere and sievert stylistically sievert is obviously not legere roe says the latter s antics were good entertainment value but he was more of a sideshow a brash ceo is not necessary to deliver success
ah august in a word the oxford english dictionary defines august as impressive as has historically been the month of august for recall what we penned with august on the horizon that month has finished higher for gold in eight of the past 11 years moreover twas during august just a year ago when gold impressively printed its all time high at 2089 august indeed that august but from the that was then this is now dept what about this august shall it be another august august for gold or rather a month of directionless disorganization similar to the bedlam from one dr august balls of nice aka the great balls so dubbed by inspecteur jacques clouseau to be sure gold was at best disorganized throughout july price settling yesterday friday at 1817 having opened july at 1771 and not reaching below 1766 price could not clear 1835 the month s wee 3 9 trading range being gold s narrowest since that recorded over two years ago in may 2019 our take is that gold shall record another august august not necessarily up to its all time high 2089 let alone our forecast high for this year 2401 but nonetheless an up month in the offing and if for no other technical reason than price s refusing to succumb to the ongoing parabolic short trend as denoted by the rightmost red dots in this chart of gold s weekly bars from one year ago to date so mmb are you already eliminating august for gold reaching your 2401 level not absolutely ruling it out squire rather being seasonally realistic our sense is that gold s best shot to accelerate upward shall occur during the september october period when for everything else it all goes wrong such timely market turmoil you and i see as justified both fundamentally and quantitatively but to which the balance of the investing world seem out to lunch which is always how it is before it suddenly happens still to this day when we query money folk about how they re prepared to protect their or their client s portfolios upon waking up with the locked limit down it remains that the subject swiftly is changed and or we hear crickets and as we ve already cited upon the price earnings ratio of the reverting to its mean 19 2x which it has always done throughout the index s 64 year history the loss this time round regressed into dow terms may exceed 20 000 points in as little as three trading suspended days as a recent reminder exercise calculate the dow high from 19 february to its 18 march low of just a year ago and now dr anthony fauci declares our covid vaccinations shan t necessarily shield us from delta what s next omega got gold surely none of us wish to see gold soar because the world ends dow 2 we merely wish to see gold rise to meet its scoreboard debasement value presently shown as 3888 still to date in 2021 hardly is gold on any run for as we turn to our begos markets standings the yellow metal is but one notch above the bumbling bond course we cannot completely discredit the bond for as the red hot economy was instead cooling through most of q2 the price of the bond today is 7 6 above its 18 march low the yield since then having fallen from 2 505 to now 1 897 clearly that is indicative of bond traders who live in reality following the economic barometer whilst equity traders who live in lemming land chase earningless risk here s the baro its rightmost pale violet stint essentially representative of the metrics reported for q2 thus when you just saw the advanced gross domestic product annualized pace for q2 come in nearly flat 6 5 compared with that of q1 6 3 whilst all around were projecting a pace some 30 higher 8 5 hardly were you surprised when cnbs reported u s gdp rose 6 5 last quarter well below expectations but that s why you follow our stuff still with july s and the conference board s read on both improving june s was flat with hardly higher slowing and shrinking red hot not as so anticipated the federal open market committee their only talking taper as usual in again voting unanimously last wednesday to do nothing they know they re both stuck as well as a catalyst for it all going wrong the instant they jerk the rug a tad meanwhile we ve a positive read on q2 earnings season with 277 of the s p 500 s constituents having reported 88 having beaten their bottom lines of a year ago far and away the best year over year performance we ve ever recorded course going from shut to open makes for such substantive improvement in fact so august are earnings improvements that thus far they ve knocked our live p e for the s p down from 56 3x a week ago to 49 8x today why a return to the 19 2x median warrants an s p correction of now just 61 are you prepared crick crick crick crick crick crick as to the yellow metal s aforementioned state of disorganization so tis further emphasized here per our graphic of gold co s percentage tracks from one year ago to date all of which are under water save for barely franco nevada nyse 2 followed by newmont nyse 4 gold itself 7 the global x silver miners exchange traded fund nyse 11 agnico eagle mines nyse 14 the vaneck vectors gold miners exchange traded fund nyse 16 and from worst to first and back to worst pan american silver nasdaq 21 but upon their all going well when it all goes wrong don t forget the leverage luv now here s an eye opener that is as pro as ever in going round the horn for all eight begos markets by their daily bars from one month ago to date look notably at the ascending grey trendline for precious metal gold look as well at the ascending grey trendline for industrial metal and yet almost impossibly the same for silver is descending but here s the good news rare as tis this phenomena has occurred on a mutually exclusive basis six times since the beginning of 2020 and each time hence silver has within a matter of weeks settled at minimum of three full points higher so from the yellow and red metals to the white metal there s a tradable gift on a silver platter note too that silver s baby blue dots indicative of trend consistency have just kinked up next specific to the last fortnight here we ve the market profiles for gold on the left and silver on the right their nearby trading supports as noted with a little resistance up there for gold at 1832 and it being month end we can t quite wrap it without bringing up gold s structure by the monthly bars with respect to that mentioned earlier the rightmost bar shows us just how comparatively narrow was gold s july ahead of what we anticipate shall be a more robust indeed august august to close we ve these three observations from the ever popular they re just figuring this out now dept bloomy reported this past week that oil rebounds after industry report shows shrinking u s supplies given the perfunctory shutdown of otherwise potential u s oil transport facilities in the changeover of the stateside administration this past january ought we be surprised see too in leading the aforeshown begos markets standings oil 52 4 year to date thanks joe next week brings the oft dubbed mother of all numbers day friday 06 august when the department of labor statistics reports for july the expectation being for a 9 gain over those for june with the dropping from 5 9 to 5 6 that s nice cept the wednesday 04 august for july is estimated to be a 6 loss but who s counting right and last wednesday dow jones red hot economy newswires noted in spite of vaccinations covid continues to emanate from one surge to the next but that a host of adaptations by governments and businesses have also helped limit economic damage translated to layman s terms such adaptations are currency debasement and enterprise restriction reason enough to follow the stars for gold s august august that also shines for silver

federal reserve policymakers have gained an important ally in their effort to convince people that the current rampant is transitory the mainstream media is now mostly on board with this view financial reporters have been finding sophisticated analysts to back up the fed s view that price pressures are temporary supply chain issues and not structural however market indicators of moderate inflation five and 10 years out are open to interpretation that is the beauty of the market millions of investors weigh in with their bets but few of them talk about it an alternative interpretation is that rampant persistent inflation will force the fed and other central banks to tighten monetary policy including raising interest rates and yet another interpretation is that a resurgent pandemic will dampen growth and cool down the economy perhaps to the point of a recession meanwhile monetarists express alarm about and the risk that carries for inflation a survey of experts at the university of chicago s business school last month found 33 agreed that current monetary and fiscal policy risks prolonged higher inflation when weighted for the confidence each had in their forecast while 30 disagreed and 36 were uncertain opinion it seems is divided former treasury secretary and harvard economist larry summers is a virtual cassandra on the subject he attributes the rally in government bonds pushing down yields to technical factors and adds that markets in any case have a lousy record predicting inflation steven rattner another former democratic aide has stepped in as a wingman for summers on this issue in an opinion piece last week for the new york times rattner demurred on bond market breakeven rates of 2 4 over the next 10 years i m not so sure he said warning that high inflation even if short of the double digits four decades ago could force the fed to hike interest rates sooner than anticipated like every other issue in the u s right now inflation has become a political debate with president joseph biden asserting against historical evidence that trillions of dollars in additional government spending will tame inflation democratic policymakers and democratic leaning media is that redundant have to join the chorus insisting inflation is temporary fed chairman jerome powell who is waiting to see if biden will him has cast his lot with the democrats even though he has ostensibly been affiliated with the republican party even so mindful that history will also have a verdict powell is hedging his support for indefinite monetary stimulus the federal open market committee after months of insisting there needs to be a vaguely defined substantial further progress to its objective of maximum employment oh and price stability finally acknowledged last week that progress had been made the committee according to the policy statement will continue to assess this progress in coming meetings investors saw this as a clear hint that the long awaited tapering of bond purchases was now on the agenda at his press conference after the fomc meeting powell repeated the s guidance adding only that any change in the pace of our asset purchases will depend on incoming data economists continue to expect guidance on a timetable after the september or november meetings of the fomc however st louis fed chief james bullard something of an outlier on the fomc said on friday that he wants to start already this fall and finish the tapering process by march we are tilted too much to the dovish side bullard said in remarks to reporters after a webcast speech warning the fed is not in a good position to react if inflation persists at a high rate bullard who rotates into a voting position on the fomc next year says even if inflation slows down as expected he doesn t see it moderating completely in 2022 and is forecasting a rate of 2 5 to 3 in the meantime he says the fed needs to be ready to act if inflation does ease on its own he says we have a beautiful response just stay at near zero policy and push off the date of liftoff
for almost two decades the global economy has been administered a potent steroid lowinterest rates there is no doubt that this has prevented some economies from falling into a depression as first the financial crisis the stagnation in the eu economies and then the covid pandemic forced central banks to use monetary policy to help businesses survive the trillions of dollars and euros pumped into the global economies in the last two years will sooner or later give rise to high inflation however many economists think that this will be a very temporary experience a financial times opinion poll of leading academic economists has indicated that elevated inflation will compel the federal reserve to raise us interest rates at least twice by the end of 2023 like his counterpart at the ecb federal reserve chair jerome powell has persistently argued that raising interest rates may spook financial markets this reluctance on the part of central bankers to warn about the risks of increasing interest rates when there are clear indications that this might sooner or later become a reality could damage their credibility markets and investors are more pragmatic and are beginning to hedge against the risk of higher interest rates the sentiment now is that risk is not being sufficiently compensated for and yields on long term bonds are rising soon central banks and political leaders will have to start being honest about their plans to tackle the long term economic consequences of the pandemic sovereign and private debt is increasing at a very fast rate economic growth remains sluggish especially in europe when the escape clause in the stability and growth pact is withdrawn probably in 2023 eu governments have to announce their long term plans to reduce deficits and debts corporates will also have to start repaying the loans they received in the last several months to weather the headwinds of the pandemic those that were solvent before the pandemic will probably manage their repayment programmes effectively however there will still be many companies that are now so used to low interest rates that they will struggle to cope with a higher cost of money interest rates are very effective tools to price risk retail investors who stuck to conservative risk appetites will undoubtedly welcome better returns on their savings as long as their money is not locked in long term bonds however many have reacted to low yields by getting involved in non investment grade securities many of which under priced risk substantially there is a risk of moral hazard increasing if governments and central banks commit themselves to buy non investment grade corporate bonds to prevent incidents that threaten financial stability perhaps the most significant risk of low interest rates and loose monetary policy is that the fear of high inflation has encouraged price appreciation of real estate and many financial assets some countries are experiencing significant increases in pro perty prices partly because investors believe that this is the best way to hedge against rising inflation stock markets are booming despite the real uncertainty about how fast economies will recover one can expect a market correction that might puncture this bubble of assets appreciating partly on the back of the low cost of borrowing other factors are behind the accelerating growth of inflation china the global manufacturing powerhouse is no longer such a low cost producer the shortage of essential commodities like rare metals and semiconductors is driving prices up increasing transportation demand is affecting the price of oil as these factors combine higher inflation will start to worry central bankers who will be forced to raise interest rates economies that are more dependent on service industries like tourism also face challenging times allan timmermann an economics professor at the university of california argues that there is considerable uncertainty about how fast service sectors will bounce back whether labour market shortages will hamper growth and how savings and consumption will respond once the fiscal stimulus is dialled down fiscal rectitude has been put on the back burner for several years as central bankers and politicians used their most powerful fiscal and monetary weapons to fight the risk of a global depression but this situa tion cannot last forever interest rates are very effective tools to price risk keeping insolvent businesses in existence thanks to the low cost of borrowing subsidies financed by taxpayers and savers and light touch regulation could save a few jobs but will ultimately hardwire inefficiency in the economies of a country structural economic reforms cannot be postponed forever johncasarwhite gmail com

tehran iran ebrahim raisi who will be sworn in on thursday as iran s eighth president inherits a troubled economy whose fate has been intertwined with political upheavals the revolutionary government he s promised to form has a herculean task ahead to fix an economy that suffers from a toxic mix of united states sanctions the covid 19 pandemic and structural issues that have taken hold after decades of mismanagement one inescapable economic hardship that increasingly makes everyday life more difficult for iranians is inflation which many iranian economists and analysts expect to remain above 40 percent at least until later this year this is while the central bank had set a target of 22 percent for annual inflation for both the previous and the current iranian calendar year which ends in march 2022 unfortunately today we are on the brink of a severe and uncontrollable inflationary situation economist masoud nili warned in a meeting of economists with raisi in early july according to a government press release according to a report by the labour ministry food inflation crossed the crisis threshold in the month ending june 21 with over two thirds of staples like meat rice and fruits seeing an average annual price hike of at least 24 percent other food essentials have exceeded even that with prices of butter chicken and liquid oil skyrocketing by 121 percent 118 percent and 89 percent in the past year respectively global food prices have spiked this year as economies scale back covid 19 restrictions and reopen for business triggering supply bottlenecks but that has only exacerbated iran s inflationary problems that predate the pandemic a lightning fast increase in money supply has been the main culprit driving the devaluation of the iranian rial especially as us sanctions blocked the country s access to its own currency reserves outside the country us sanctions have also effectively cut iran out of the global economy slashing oil revenues and incomes as the administration of former us president donald trump barraged iran with one blacklisting after another the cash strapped government of former president hassan rouhani kept leaning on a dependent central bank to print more money since 2018 when the trump administration unilaterally abandoned iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a maximum pressure campaign to hobble the country s economy iranian officials have promised to introduce structural reforms to wean the country s overstretched budget off of oil revenues but even as the government was accused of shoring up its finances by encouraging ordinary iranians to jump into a stock market bubble that burst it still faced a massive budget deficit that is believed to reach as high as 3 quadrillion rials 12bn for the current fiscal year ending march 2022 meanwhile the unemployment rate for all workers was 9 6 percent for the calendar year that ended in march according to the central bank and 16 7 percent for youths aged 18 to 35 inflation as well as inequality corruption and housing were all issues that surfaced during televised presidential debates in june raisi promised to build four million homes in four years to alleviate a housing crunch overhaul the outdated banking system create one million jobs annually and slash inflation by half before gradually bringing it down to single digits his predecessors made similar promises on which they largely failed to deliver the jcpoa factor iran says by relying on its resistance economy doctrine of boosting local production it has largely weathered the storm of us sanctions and the deadliest pandemic in the middle east the central bank claims the economy grew by 3 6 percent during the previous calendar year ending in late march but even the country s hardliners who spent years bashing the nuclear deal as an abject failure have said it must be restored to lift us sanctions raisi has also promised to form a strong government that would be able to exact concessions from the west during talks over the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa as the nuclear deal is formally known and lift us sanctions for good but even if the nuclear deal is revived with little or no changes to its original text economist meysam hashemkhani says the immediate impact on the economy would be modest the whole world witnessed trump s withdrawal from the jcpoa and would consider the risk of something like that happening again in dealing with iran he told al jazeera even if they might have thought trump was wrong they saw what happened so now the jcpoa must remain stable for a few years for others to believe it s sustainable in the short term though hashemkhani believes a full restoration of the nuclear deal can prevent some further harm to the country and especially its beleaguered private sector businesses that have faced a myriad of challenges including but not limited to money transfer issues the government could sell more oil but hashemkhani said he s not optimistic that would translate into a major improvement for the oil dependent economy which has been dealing with similar structural issues for decades in the long run he said iran should capitalise on opportunities presented by the restoration of the nuclear deal by inoculating itself against the potential for it to fall apart again iran has to reach strategic alliances with countries in the region in the form of long term trade agreements lasting at least 15 years he said through these agreements and boosting tourism and investment deals regional interests would become so intertwined that the us would have to think twice before considering reneging on the jcpoa again he added hashemkhani also believes resolving long standing issues like budget deficits and inflation are not tied to sanctions and can be remedied through policy changes like abolishing the artificial currency rate for imports and similar measures that encourage rent seeking activities and waste billions each year he said neighbours iraq and afghanistan for instance have faced larger crises and constant instability but have maintained single digit inflation in contrast he said inflation in iran stood at an average of 15 percent during the three years the jcpoa was in effect

when i think of product design my silicon valley raised brain goes straight to software or electronic gadgets but every food product that stocks our grocery store shelves is also designed culinary wizards and food scientists with chemistry backgrounds are mixing hundreds of ingredients with slight recipe adjustments to create the next trendy oat milk or granola bar traditionally the two most important criteria to balance in this process have been taste and cost but simple mills and other environmentally conscious brands are adding a new aspect to their design specifications sustainability we make regenerative ag part of the design process said shauna sadowski vice president of sustainability at simple mills to that end the chicago based company is consulting soil scientists farmers and other experts to find and source new ingredients that can combat climate change and expand its product offerings this could mean substituting a water intensive grain for one that is more water adaptive or sourcing from farmers who practice regenerative agriculture or it could involve expanding the types of ingredients used in recipes to combat monoculture farming one of simple mills goals is to create more diversity in diets and by extension more biodiversity of crops grown according to emily lafferty senior manager of strategic sourcing at simple mills farmers want to grow more than just soy corn and wheat so simple mills talks to its farmers regularly to understand what types of crops they are interested in growing we re increasingly asking farmers what do you want to grow that we can help provide a market for she said what are additional crops that they want in their rotation that have ecological benefit or have high carbon sequestration potential that we can ultimately drive more demand for simple mills new pancake mix uses chestnut flour a tree that could help sequester more carbon in the soil courtesy of simple mills close authorship simple mills makes makes packaged crackers cookies bars baking mixes and frostings the company tries to use unconventional ingredients beyond the typical wheat flour many of its products use almond flour flax meal and coconut sugar but figuring out the best ways to combine these untraditional ingredients takes a lot of designing baking and testing as was the case with a new pancake mix the company developed during the pandemic during the 2020 summer simple mills senior research and development manager anna gensch was having daily pancake parties at the simple mills test kitchen in chicago but she was mostly by herself or with very limited staff sometimes dropping off pancakes at co workers houses we probably had 15 to 20 different flours that we were looking at she said i was making six or nine different types in a three day period chestnut flour was one ingredient that has been top of mind since simple mills ceo attended a permaculture class and came back singing its sustainability praises in 2019 chestnut trees are a powerful carbon sequestration crop that once dominated the u s landscape before being wiped out by two diseases the ink disease in the 1800s and the chestnut blight in the early 1900s they are now primarily grown in europe chestnuts are perennials meaning the tree reflowers and produces chestnuts every year farmers don t need to rip them out of the ground and plant new ones every year as is the case with annuals such as grains corn and wheat that only survive one season and represent most of the food we eat and grow harvesting annuals involves tilling and removing the carbon stored in the roots both terrible practices for carbon sequestration in the case of chestnuts they can grow for over 100 years sadowski said they might take a longer time to establish but once they re in the ground they re helping to not only have the above ground mass diversity but they re having below ground carbon sequestration because of the long root structures that help to feed the soil farmers would love to do more diverse crops they just don t always have a market for it according to gensch the chestnut flour also has a natural sweetness a characteristic that gave simple mills the opportunity to make a no sugar added product thus the no sugar added chestnut flour pancake waffle mix was born today customers can purchase the mix from amazon and simple mills direct to consumer website the chestnut flour pancake checks two of simple mills internal environmental activation areas increasing crop diversity and supporting proven regenerative agriculture practices the other two are fostering direct trade with farmers and supporting place based agriculture the product was extremely tasty i can corroborate as i tasted the product for my saturday morning brunch so the company turned toward figuring out scaling and commercialization this meant finding reliable suppliers for an uncommon ingredient we really had a desire to source chestnuts domestically from launch lafferty said but we recognized in the discovery process that just wasn t going to be commercially feasible for now simple mills is sourcing chestnuts from 5 000 small spontaneous non plantation orchards harvested by hand in italy and albania but the company is partnering with the savannah institute an agroforestry group working to bring back the u s chestnut we can help to be a market signal sadowski added farmers would love to do more diverse crops they just don t always have a market for it many food companies are in the process of finding sustainable suppliers for the ingredients in the recipes and products that made them successful but simple mills flipped the process on its head i think the challenge can be reverse engineering sadowski said when you have the opportunity to design from the get go you re basically building it from the ground up versus trying to reverse engineer from the back end which is always more challenging from any level

by going out and getting vaccinated we aren t just protecting ourselves we are performing a patriotic duty to our country and our fellow citizens writes cyril ramaphosa dear fellow south african last week i had a chance to meet some of the heroes on the frontline of our fight against covid 19 when i visited two vaccination sites in tembisa and midrand these heroes include the health workers administering the vaccines and the many south africans who are coming forward to be vaccinated and thereby safeguarding the health of the nation the number of vaccinations administered in south africa has now passed the 7 5 million mark around three million people are fully vaccinated at the present rate we are vaccinating on average 220 000 people a day in the coming weeks this rate will increase significantly due to the arrival of more vaccine doses read adriaan basson why i chose to be vaccinated nearly 1 5 million doses of the single dose johnson johnson vaccine have been handed to the department of health in the last couple of days over the past weekend a donation of 5 66 million pfizer vaccine doses from the usa government began arriving in the country this is part of a donation of vaccines from the united states to african countries and low and middle income countries in other parts of the world our country is also making history the first covid 19 vaccines produced in africa for africa were released by aspen pharmacare from its flagship manufacturing plant in gqeberha last week these vaccines will be made available to the rest of the continent through the african vaccine acquisition task team which we set up during our tenure as african union chair thanks to the efforts of all involved in the multisectoral vaccine acquisition response we now have a comfortable supply of stocks to vaccinate our population the two vaccination sites i visited are among an estimated 3 000 vaccination sites we have set up in the country these sites are currently providing vaccines to any person above the age of 35 healthcare workers and employees in participating workplaces innovations in place to meet demand several sites around the country are now operating on weekends and many innovations like vaccination drive throughs and mobile vaccination units are in operation one of the two vaccination sites i visited is run by the private sector in partnership with government and the other is run by the government yet both facilities had similar levels of excellent service and professionalism our private sector including medical schemes has worked alongside government from the onset of the pandemic helping to mobilise resources and most recently helping us meet our national vaccination targets at the rabasotho community centre in tembisa i saw government s batho pele principles in action read mpumelelo mkhabela why i think it is time for the govt to make covid 19 vaccinations mandatory the process was efficient and streamlined from the covid 19 vaccination card people are issued with to help them keep track of their doses to data capturing stations to observation stations with doctors on standby for those who have just received their jab importantly the site has an information area where those presenting for vaccination are given clear information in their own language on the different vaccine options available we spoke with mama rosemary mabaso 67 who had come for her second dose she said that the staff at the centre had treated her with the utmost care and courtesy and helped allay her initial fears of getting vaccinated i am encouraged that so many south africans accept the need to be vaccinated the latest national income dynamics study nids coronavirus rapid mobile survey cram has found that there is increased public openness to accepting a covid 19 vaccine only one in 10 south africans believe that covid 19 vaccines are unsafe the mathebulas a couple from tembisa who had come to the centre together to get vaccinated told us that they were initially hesitant because of negative stories going around but had decided to follow government s advice to get vaccinated such expressions of confidence are greatly encouraging as are the words of mama mabaso who said i want to tell everyone out there is no need to be scared this vaccine is safe and it is helping us indeed vaccines are safe they are our best protection against this disease and the national vaccination programme is our surest guarantee of a swift health and economic recovery i want to encourage south africans to continue to follow the guidance of the world health organisation and our department of health around covid 19 vaccines we need to avoid spreading misleading and false information that can cause confusion as we work to vaccinate as many people as possible by the end of the year we salute the officials healthcare workers and staff of the vaccination centres who are working tirelessly to support the national effort south africans are our greatest heroes but by far the greatest heroes are the south african people of whose resilience and steadfastness i remain in awe over a year and a half we have experienced a deadly pandemic severe economic and social hardship and recently serious unrest wrought by those who want to see our country fail by going out and getting vaccinated we aren t just protecting ourselves we are performing a patriotic duty to our country and our fellow citizens in this great race to preserve human life let us continue to work together in the interests of the health and welfare of our nation in this way we will ensure that recovery is certain with best regards

china s manufacturing pmi data has disappointed today clinging to expansionary territory but increasing fears that asia s powerhouse is slowing on saturday official manufacturing pmi fell to 50 4 well below the 50 8 expected while today s caixin manufacturing pmi for july tumbled to 50 3 well below the 51 0 expected notably in this morning s caixin number the new export orders sub index plunged to 47 7 across the rest of asia manufacturing pmis were very much a mixed bag australian japan south korea and taiwan s manufacturing pmis remained solidly expansive but regional asia sagged well into contractionary territory with thailand falling to 45 7 vietnam to 45 1 malaysia to 40 1 and indonesia collapsing to 40 1 also supply chain woes are affecting everybody to some extent especially china with semiconductors and magnified by the us entity list but in regional asia it appears that the delta variant gripping the region is making its presence felt in the data that had led to an interesting divergence in the morning session with us index futures the nikkei and australia performing strongly after wall street finished friday on a soggy note while china markets sank the pmi data and the emergence of 98 new cases of covid 19 on the mainland weighing on sentiment however much as investors started the week elsewhere in the inevitable buy the dip mode so it became for china markets which have rallied strongly with a heavy flow of funds down the stock connect pipeline from international investors sentiment may also have been helped by the unveiling of the bi partisan us infrastructure bill at a special sunday sitting of the us senate totalling around 1 trillion it contains 550 billion of new spending over five years being the first week of the month the data calendar is heavy internationally culminating in this friday s us non farm payrolls pan asia inflation data is released tomorrow although it is likely to show supply chain driven upward price pressures concern over the delta variant engulfing the region will likely offset that data with lockdowns spreading in australia with no end in sight for sydney the rba policy decision should be a non event tomorrow with covid 19 delta variant giving the rba all the excuses it needs to stay firmly in the uber dovish corner in contrast new zealand releases employment data tomorrow a strong result will make a rate hike by the rbnz at its next policy meeting a certainty in the minds of most analysts the new zealand dollar is likely to rally powerfully versus the australian and us dollars if employment data is robust similarly south korean trade data released over the weekend show a significant jump in imports hinting that domestic demand continues to recover that will keep the bank of korea on track to hike in q4 although the won will stay under pressure in the shorter term as the us dollar remains strong and the pmi data across asia suffers delta wobbles the delta variant is likely to stay the hands of both the reserve bank of india and bank of thailand this week as well realistically only the rbi was an outside chance to hike given that inflation remains stubbornly above its target range something that ever higher oil prices will complicate thailand remains in a virus induced slow down anyway but the rbi is more likely to focus on supporting a post second wave recovery than worrying about inflation right now the bank of england will also hold fire as news emerges today britain is preparing a mass third shot booster programme later in the year however brazil will likely buck the trend hiking by anywhere between 75 and 100 basis points later in the week wednesday will see the release of pan europe plus us manufacturing and services pmis and thursday a swath of asian cpis there is plenty of data interspersed as well however i believe the week will be dominated by three themes first the trajectory of the covid delta variant especially if cases rapidly increase in mainland china that could cause another bout of virus fright in global stock markets the passage of the now released us infrastructure bill which should be a positive for us markets particularly dow jones and russel 2000 inhabitants and finally all roads will lead to the us non farm payrolls on friday with preliminary estimates hovering around the 750 000 mark that will probably change quite a bit as the week progresses and after so much promise of 1 million number earlier this year which never happened the risks are skewed towards a lower number us market will likely take severe fright if it comes in under 500 000 jobs added asian equities in buy the dip mode asia s heavyweight markets have started the week on a very positive note after china initially dipped on weak pmi data china s shanghai composite csi 300 and hang seng all dropped in early trade with the mainland exchanges abruptly reversing course as foreign investors pumped nearly a billion dollars down the hong kong to shanghai shenzhen connect that has seen a stunning reversal as regulatory risk has been forgotten the shanghai composite is 2 10 higher the csi 300 has leapt by 2 50 and the hang seng is 0 90 to the positive wall street finished on a soggy note on friday after us inflation data disappointed that pushed us yields down but equities could not rally as fears of peak recovery led market heavyweights like amazon lower the s p 500 fell by 0 54 the nasdaq by 0 71 and the dow jones by 0 42 i suspect some month end rebalancing of portfolios by institutional investors played its part as well with no significant event risk emerging over the weekend however investors could not resist piling into buy the dip in asia as the week started us index futures on the s p 500 nasdaq and dow jones are up over 0 50 reversing all fridays losses in asia the nikkei 225 has leapt by 1 60 the kospi is 0 55 higher with taipei climbing by 1 10 australian markets have also roared higher after square announced it would buy australia s afterpay the asx 200 is 1 25 higher while the all ordinaries has climbed 1 35 with the sydney bank holiday and the spread of state lockdowns to queensland all but forgotten regional asia has fared less well with investors attention seemingly focused on the worst performers of last week being the best performers this week that has left regional asia markets out in the cold with investors focused on delta variant nerves and a deteriorating political situation to boot in malaysia s case the government is rapidly running out of teflon to slip a no confidence vote over its handling of the economy and the pandemic all of that sees singapore falling 0 65 with kuala lumpur 0 35 lower with jakarta just 0 15 higher today as covid 19 cases fall its due to lower testing and restrictions appear to have been eased bangkok is unchanged european markets are likely to look at the performance of the us futures and the asian heavyweights today and move straight into buy the dip mode themselves in a classic case of euro fomo with so much heavyweight data out we are indeed in for another volatile week ahead but if today teaches us nothing else it is that there is still an ocean of capital looking for a home in a zero per cent world therefore any material dips in asset prices such as equities will inevitably be short lived the us dollar rallies on month end flows us inflation data disappointed on friday sending the us yields lower once again it was therefore surprising to see the us dollar actually rally instead the greenback fishing the week on a firm note versus both developed and emerging market currencies i put the us dollar strength down to two processes month end investor portfolio rebalancing flows and haven buying to hedge weekend event risk the dollar index rose 0 30 to 92 09 on friday edging slightly lower to 92 05 in a non descript asian session the dollar index is now mid point between its breakout lower at 92 60 and structural support at 91 50 and also home to its 100 and 50 day moving averages versus the majors another week of choppy range trading looms with a break of either 91 50 or 92 60 signalling the next big directional move eur usd faded at 1 1900 on friday with the single currency moving lower to close around 1 1875 where it remains today a daily close above 1 1900 would signal a further rally targeting 1 2000 in the

top news hsbc pays 3 billion dividend as profit more than doubles hsbc beat expectations this morning as it revealed profits more than doubled in the first half of the year supported by the release of cash set aside to cover bad loans during the pandemic revenue fell 4 to 25 6 billion due to lower interest rates and a drop in income from markets securities services but reported pretax profit more than doubled to 10 83 billion from 4 31 billion the year before and basic eps surged to 0 36 from 0 10 that was better than the 9 45 billion and 0 35 expected by analysts earnings were boosted by the release of 700 million worth of credit impairment charges that had been set aside for potentially bad loans spawning from the pandemic whereas last year results were dragged down by an almighty 6 9 billion charge the year before hsbc said it possibly expects to book a net release of provisions over the full year these are good results that reflect the return of growth in our main markets and marked progress in the execution of our strategy we were profitable in every region in the first half of the year supported by the release of expected credit loss provisions our lending pipeline began to translate into business growth in the second quarter and we further strengthened that pipeline during the half this performance enables us to pay an interim dividend for the first six months of 2021 said chief executive noel quinn hsbc is paying an interim dividend of 0 07 for the first half hsbc did not pay a first half interim dividend last year as the pandemic erupted but did make a 0 15 payout in the second half when payouts were restricted the bank of england removed the last of the restrictions on uk bank dividends last month allowing them to return as much cash to shareholders as they like in total the interim payout is worth some 3 05 billion hsbc said it expects to be hitting its dividend payout ratio of 40 to 55 of reported eps in 2021 as the economic outlook continues to improve looking forward hsbc said there are emerging signs that unsecured personal and commercial lending is starting to rebound where next for the hsbc share price after rising steadily across the start of the year hsbc hit a post pandemic high of 462 in late may since then the share price has eased lower trading in a descending channel the hsbc share price trades below its 200 and 50 sma on the daily chart the rsi points higher although remains in bearish territory any meaningful recovery in the share price would need to retake the 200 dma at 410p and the upper band of the descending channel at 414p before testing the 50 dma at 423p a break above this zone of contention could see the share price head towards 462p failure to retake the 200 sma could see the price test 385p the lower band of the descending channel and the july low ahead of 376p the year to date low takeover battle for sanne group heats up as rival bidder surfaces sanne group said it has told apex group that it would be inclined to support a takeover offer worth 920 pence per share as the battle to buy the ftse 250 listed specialist alternative asset fund intensifies sanne said it has been in advanced discussions with apex about a possible offer apex will have until august 30 to make the offer firm or walk away that price if offered would represent a 52 6 premium to its closing share price on may 13 when offers started to come in for the business sanne group shares soared 8 5 in early trade this morning to 916 0p the battle for sanne kicked off in may when cinven tabled several offers for the business the first one to be made public was at 830p per share and was raised to 850p before being rejected by sanne and described as opportunistic a fifth and still unsolicited bid was made by cinven worth 875p per share which was enough to entice sanne into talks notably the deadline for talks with cinven are due to expire at the end of play on friday apex will be able to revise its offer if another party including cinven tables another bid for sanne the latest offer comes after sanne group released a first half trading update last week where annualised new business wins in the first half

authority as part of the deal sse said its current stake in the business was valued at 744 4 million at the end of march demonstrating the premium it has managed to achieve the business contributed 88

successful investment for sse during the past 16 years it is a strong business delivering consistently for customers and will have a key role to play in the future development of the hydrogen economy however it has become purely a financial investment for sse as we have sharpened our focus on our low carbon electricity core and it is therefore the right time for sgn to continue to thrive under new

of things and the fourth industrial revolution and the potential for further market share gains as we broaden our addressable market and product range said chairman james peters xp power said the main

a decade saphnelo is a first in class type i interferon receptor antibody that will be used on patients receiving standard therapy for moderate to severe sle our treatment goals in systemic lupus erythematosus are to reduce disease activity prevent organ damage from either the illness itself or the medications especially steroids and improve one s quality of life said richard furie one of the principal investigators in the spahnelo clinical development programme today s approval of anifrolumab represents a big step forward for the entire lupus community physicians will now be able to offer an effective new treatment that has produced significant improvements in overall disease activity while reducing corticosteroid use he added the approval by the us food drug administration comes after the latest trials of the drug including two phase iii trials and a phase ii trial those showed that patients experienced a reduction in disease activity across their organ system including skin and

by lee kah whyesingapore august 2 ani last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is

ramaphosa don t spread misleading and false vaccine information indeed vaccines are safe they are our best protection against this disease ramaphosa said after his visit to vaccination sites president cyril ramaphosa said he had a chance last week to meet some of the heroes on the frontline of our fight against covid 19 when he visited two vaccination sites in tembisa and midrand he commended the health workers who administer the vaccines as well as the many south africans who are coming forward to be vaccinated and thereby safeguard the health of the nation he said by far the greatest heroes are the south african people of whose resilience and steadfastness i remain in awe in his latest letter on monday ramaphosa called on everyone to follow the guidance of the world health organisation and urged south africans to avoid spreading misleading and false information that can cause confusion by going out and getting vaccinated we aren t just protecting ourselves we are performing a patriotic duty to our country and our fellow citizens read ramaphosa s full letter below dear fellow south african last week i had a chance to meet some of the heroes on the frontline of our fight against covid 19 when i visited two vaccination sites in tembisa and midrand these heroes include the health workers administering the vaccines and the many south africans who are coming forward to be vaccinated and thereby safeguard the health of the nation the number of vaccinations administered in south africa has now passed the 7 5 million mark around three million people are fully vaccinated at the present rate we are vaccinating on average 220 000 people a day in the coming weeks this rate will increase significantly due to the arrival of more vaccine doses nearly 1 5 million single dose johnson johnson vaccines have been handed to the department of health in the last couple of days over the past weekend a donation of 5 66 million pfizer vaccines from the usa government began arriving in the country this is part of a donation of vaccines from the united states to african countries and low and middle income countries in other parts of the world our country is also making history the first covid 19 vaccines produced in africa for africa were released by aspen pharmacare from its flagship manufacturing plant in gqeberha last week these vaccines will be made available to the rest of the continent through the african vaccine acquisition task team which we set up during our tenure as african union chair thanks to the efforts of all involved in the multisectoral vaccine acquisition response we now have a comfortable supply of stocks to vaccinate our population the two vaccination sites i visited are among an estimated 3 000 vaccination sites we have set up in the country these sites are currently providing vaccines to any person above the age of 35 healthcare workers and employees in participating workplaces to meet demand several sites around the country are now operating on weekends and many innovations like vaccination drive throughs and mobile vaccination units are in operation one of the two vaccination sites i visited is run by the private sector in partnership with the government and the other is run by the government yet both facilities had similar levels of excellent service and professionalism our private sector including medical schemes has worked alongside government from the onset of the pandemic helping to mobilise resources and most recently helping us meet our national vaccination targets at the rabasotho community centre in tembisa i saw government s batho pele principles in action the process was efficient and streamlined from the covid 19 vaccination card people are issued with to help them keep track of their doses to data capturing stations to observation stations with doctors on standby for those who have just received their jab importantly the site has an information area where those presenting for vaccination are given clear information in their own language on the different vaccine options available we spoke with mama rosemary mabaso 67 who had come for her second dose she said that the staff at the centre had treated her with the utmost care and courtesy and helped allay her initial fears of getting vaccinated i am encouraged that so many south africans accept the need to be vaccinated the latest national income dynamics study nids coronavirus rapid mobile survey cram found that there is increased public openness to accepting a covid 19 vaccine only 1 in 10 south africans believe that covid 19 vaccines are unsafe the mathebulas a couple from tembisa who had come to the centre together to get vaccinated told us that they were initially hesitant because of negative stories going around but had decided to follow government s advice to get vaccinated such expressions of confidence are greatly encouraging as are the words of mama mabasa who said i want to tell everyone out there is no need to be scared this vaccine is safe and it is helping us indeed vaccines are safe they are our best protection against this disease and the national vaccination programme is our surest guarantee of a swift health and economic recovery i want to encourage south africans to continue to follow the guidance of the world health organisation and our department of health around covid 19 vaccines we need to avoid spreading misleading and false information that can cause confusion as we work to vaccinate as many people as possible by end of the year we salute the officials healthcare workers and staff of the vaccination centres who are working tirelessly to support the national effort but by far the greatest heroes are the south african people of whose resilience and steadfastness i remain in awe over a year and a half we have experienced a deadly pandemic severe economic and social hardship and recently serious unrest wrought by those who want to see our country fail by going out and getting vaccinated we aren t just protecting ourselves we are performing a patriotic duty to our country and our fellow citizens in this great race to preserve human life let us continue to work together in the interests of the health and welfare of our nation in this way we will ensure that recovery is certain with best regards cyril ramaphosa now read da wants mkhize fired as siu seeks to recover r150

by lee kah whyesingapore august 2 ani last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load

one of the first questions we got from our frantic editors on monday morning after the news had dropped was did you see this coming fair question and the answer is well yes and no but mainly no hints of a strategic buyer there were a few hints in april though as we were writing an epilogue which included afterpay s announcement it had plans to list in the united states we pinned this as an appropriate bookend for the afterpay journey as america becomes increasingly important but the rationale for a us listing didn t seem all that obvious to us since rival affirm had gone public in january there was no evidence of a nasdaq premium that would lift their valuation and lower their cost of capital compared with the asx advertisement but we were told the us was where afterpay s future lay while there were hints that a strategic buyer might emerge sometime but who most of afterpay s competitors had launched their own bnpl offerings with some success paypal was among this group so they had little reason to spend in the tens of billions snapping up someone they thought they could beat as for the banks afterpay had got too big to acquire and they were also busy copying afterpay s product in any event we decided not to end the book by trying to predict the future we figured we were bound to get that wrong and felt the book should document the state of play up until we downed our pens finding a buyer who needed it enter square a payments juggernaut that needs afterpay s special formula to grease its ecosystem afterpay found the buyer that needed it and which could help afterpay as buy now pay later morphs into something bigger advertisement what doesn t surprise us is that the afterpay duo of anthony eisen and nick molnar have once again executed masterfully throughout afterpay s history they have emerged from clutch situations from business model busting regulation to the arrival of big scary competitors and many sharemarket gyrations and when they ve had the wind at their backs they ve taken full advantage the deal with square if it s approved is yet another well executed opportunity albeit the largest afterpay s management can worry a little less now about the rising competitive threat and whether their hefty valuation could withstand even small speed bumps or what many believe is an inevitable fall in revenue received from merchants easier exit for founders the founders will also be able to tap their 2 7 billion fortunes with far greater ease than before as directors of an asx listed company share sales had to be done in large disclosed blocks advertisement but now they will hold shares in square there s no doubt the scrutiny of running a high growth public company in australia will ease afterpay s deal will also be welcomed by some large australian institutions that have been haunted its rise up the index ranks forcing them to take a position on a highly valued as yet unprofitable company the buy now pay later sector has taxed the minds of all australian investors splitting them into two distinct camps of lovers and haters but there s something in this deal for the bears as well the implied price of 126 is far from stratospheric it s some way off the 160 that afterpay s share price peaked at on february 10 it s also lower than the median 145 mean share price target of analysts that cover afterpay and represents just a 6 per cent year to date gain it could therefore be taken as a sign that afterpay agrees that as a standalone operator it has taken the idea as far as it could advertisement the valuation from here is what it could bring to a strategic partner rather than the profit it could create on its own in researching afterpay there were few other australian companies that can claim to have exported its model so successfully one is mall operator westfield there are some parallels in that westfield helped bring retailers and consumers together and extracted a share of economic profits along the way afterpay has done similar for merchants in the digital age after decades westfield s founders knew when it was time to sell amid signs of the death of the mall at the hands of e commerce the circumstances with afterpay are very different buy now pay later is just getting started but for afterpay in its current form the journey also ends buy now pay later the extraordinary story of afterpay by jonathan shapiro and james eyers will be published by allen unwin on august 3 32 99rrp

united with earth considers itself the most innovative company in the dates industry we have noticed that we have become the trendsetter said daryoush davidi founder of the berkeley ca based company which employs a host of renewable and environmentally friendly growing practices and is a proud member of california certified organic farmers one such trend was pairing its product line with walnuts creating a super fruit snack pack we have the most unique product line as we not only supply dates but also figs and we are starting to see other date companies marketing figs as well davidi said i always felt it was a big compliment when other date companies follow in our footsteps united with earth also pioneered a date locator tab on its website a feature that has allowed consumers to easily find the product line near their homes the company s newest addition to that product line is the fresh yellow barhi date in the past they have been mainly sold in bulk and few instances in larger consumer packs davidi said but we like to be the leading company so we have a program for the season to offer them in one pound clamshells in the past they have been mainly supplied to the ethnic stores but with our high graphic branding and marketing we have brought this long awaited release to mainstream channels the season starts in early august and lasts up to two months so far this year there s been record heat which means dates will most likely be harvested sooner than last year every year we oversell our projection and grow about 10 15 percent davidi said it s a scalable model that i am very proud of we are seeing other regions with 20 million pounds of carryover this year we are always open to partnering with other suppliers to grow the category and sales by partnering with multiple packing facilities it gives united with earth a big advantage in reducing lead time and as a result it can turn pos over faster during the covid 19 pandemic we were getting panic calls from new customers that their supplier had a longer lead time and in some cases they were closed down davidi said in most cases we were able to load them the same day i think covid 19 was a wakeup call for every company s infrastructure if you could pivot fast have a strong partnership with the origin of the source and a flexible team to work from various settings then you had the advantage during the pandemic sales for consumer packs were very strong and bulk was less popular getting containers to ship overseas was challenging but orders were much heavier and most importers were looking to stock up davidi said because retailers rarely get a chance to see actual fresh dates on a stem in their produce section this is something the company is hoping to change this season i feel the fresh yellow barhi dates can be a good signal that the new crop is here davidi said

on sept 9 2020 california energy commission chair david hochschild opened a scheduled meeting with a somber observation that morning bay area residents woke to darkness as wildfire smoke blotted out the sun and an eerie orange glow enveloped the region it is ten o clock in the morning and it looks like midnight hochschild said looking outside the commission was set to discuss reach codes building efficiency standards that exceed state requirements for two bay area jurisdictions the timing was apt evidence of the need for climate friendly buildings was just outside according to people who attended the virtual commission meeting and connected the air quality to increasingly treacherous wildfires fueled by climate change one public commenter called the scene outside his san francisco window a literal hellscape all urged the commission to adopt the more efficient codes and to go further to rule out the use of natural gas in new buildings statewide we have the lights on in our house because there s no sunlight said sasan saadat a policy analyst at earthjustice who dialed into the meeting from berkeley this is not the outlier it is the trend you all have this opportunity on your lap to set a new precedent for the end of fossil fuels in our built environment saadat told the commissioners we re hiring please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom see jobs to date more than 40 california jurisdictions have established policies that either entirely ban natural gas in new construction or encourage electrification and in the months since san francisco s sky glowed orange the california energy commission has proposed state building standards that require electric ready equipment and encourage electric heating rather than the use of natural gas last year california became the first state to enact standards that encourage the installation of rooftop solar on most new homes if regulators approve the electric ready code it will be another first in the nation state standard and california will have accomplished both policies through an often overlooked mechanism codes that govern the design and construction of new buildings though california is often seen as a trailblazer in climate policy similar efforts are increasingly cropping up around the country advocates and progressive code officials are trying to push forward building codes that help drive decarbonization energy consumed in buildings produced more than 30 percent of u s greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 making them a key part of the climate challenge and the window to decarbonize them is narrowing analysts at organizations such as the international energy agency have said that new construction worldwide will need to start switching to all electric around 2025 if nations are to limit global warming to below 1 5 degrees celsius 2 7 degrees fahrenheit in this century the place that we are working right now is to get a better code on paper said kim cheslak director of codes at the new buildings institute a nonprofit that works with utilities and governments on energy efficient codes the place we need to work after that is to make sure that cities states and building departments have the resources to enforce full compliance crafting codes the united states does not have a national building code instead states follow model codes the international energy conservation code iecc for homes and standard 90 1 a building energy standard of the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae for commercial buildings certain states amend those standards to make them weaker or more stringent or allow local governments to adopt codes other states like california set codes outside of the iecc process this decentralized approach leads to wide variation in code adoption nine states rely on iecc codes more than a decade old according to tracking from the department of energy twelve states use standards set in 2015 for efficiency advocates that creates diffuse policy battles you could be involved every three years in 52 fights over the code because you ve got 50 states plus the district of columbia and the national model codes said cheslak a former d c codes official this year those conflicts floated to the highest levels of national code development the iecc development process which takes place every three years was embroiled in controversy when a significant number of local government officials turned out to vote on code changes enacting efficiency improvements that could trickle down to jurisdictions across the country in response and reportedly under pressure from industry the code council s board of directors voted to change the process to one where local officials have less sway now a growing group of clean energy and efficiency advocates including cheslak are focusing on instituting local code amendments that improve on the model code the new buildings institute is also already preparing language to submit in the iecc s next code cycle which will set standards for 2024 just one year before experts say building electrification needs to take hold california s quantum leap california generally establishes more efficient energy standards than other states as part of its efforts to reduce emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by mid century the state s 2019 codes which all but required solar on most new homes starting in 2020 represented a quantum leap forward said energy commissioner andrew mcallister in may in august the commission is expected to go further finalizing codes that provide incentives for home builders to move away from natural gas heating and towards more efficient heat pumps while many environmentalists hoped for an all out gas ban the standards could result in electrification of more than half of the homes built after jan 1 2023 according to pierre delforge a senior scientist focused on building decarbonization at the natural resources defense council that would have the capacity to significantly impact the state s emissions he said because as california s electric grid gets cleaner gas is becoming responsible for a larger portion of building emissions building stock overall accounts for about a quarter of california s annual greenhouse gas emissions the current draft building code also delicately sidesteps a controversy surrounding the groundswell of california jurisdictions that have made efforts to eliminate natural gas in new construction those initiatives have faced opposition from the building gas and restaurant industries the state code would give builders incentives to pick heat pump water and space heaters rather than gas fueled models success relies on a carrot and stick approach according to delforge if builders do choose to install gas heating they will have to enact more extreme efficiency measures in other parts of the home the format is similar to the one regulators used to encourage solar installation on most new homes as in 2019 the flexibility built into the 2022 draft code eventually helped make builders more comfortable said chris ochoa senior counsel at the california building industry association we appreciate the no mandate on total electrification said ochoa builders have raised concerns that such requirements would increase the cost of constructing new homes we ve got a climate crisis we get it but we also have a serious housing crisis said ochoa we ve got to balance all these things out a changing tide code officials who have watched california s process are hoping that similar climate forward policies will take root elsewhere in the united states the biden administration has framed building decarbonization as a key element in its plan to reduce u s greenhouse gas emissions 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 but the current code process means most changes must be local this story is funded by readers like you our nonprofit newsroom provides award winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising we rely on donations from readers like you to keep going please donate now to support our work donate now i deeply care what california does because it s a good place to watch and learn and get ideas cheslak said but when michigan passes an electric vehicle mandate into their code that s when we ll see change there s a lot of traction in the middle of the country right now i think if we see a couple of major wins in the midwest that will change the tide in minnesota a coalition of cities and environmentalists are advocating for policy that would shift commercial buildings to net zero by 2036 the new buildings institute nbi has submitted code proposals in that state that would make new buildings electric ready nbi has crafted other proposals for wisconsin and is working on proposals in michigan cities and states including new york seattle and massachusetts have taken steps to strengthen building codes beyond the national standard said experts like delforge and cheslak but lawmakers in nearly 20 states including wyoming iowa and colorado have also considered legislation this year that would prohibit bans on gas in new buildings an indication that disputes over codes are only beginning to heat up progress will be slow in states where legislatures are leery of such changes said kim havey director of sustainability for the city of minneapolis but making progress he said is crucial more than 60 percent of minneapolis energy use is tied to commercial buildings according to havey until we stop creating buildings that create carbon we re never going to be able to get ahead of this he said share this article
what is city talk city talk allows marketers to connect directly with our audience by publishing content on cityam com what does china s stock market meltdown mean for investors chinese markets have hit headlines again in recent weeks geopolitical tensions surrounding trade remain but market behavior and performance particularly in the tech sector has also come to the fore we asked tom wilson schroders head of emerging market equities what s causing the upset the chinese government seems to be cracking down on tech why in the first instance there is a need in certain circumstances for stricter regulation the pace of innovation has run ahead of legislation a theme we ve seen unfold in developed markets especially in relation to tech companies there is also in china a desire to enhance the chinese communist party s legitimacy and a new focus on what is termed common prosperity in recent decades china has seen huge economic success but inequality has also been rising regulation is partly a desire to to see economic gain more widely spread in a way there are similarities here to what s going on politically in developed markets there are also the strategic goals of the state that companies increasingly need to align with the private sector as we mentioned earlier needs to be more considerate of the common good however us china tensions could also mean a more polarised world and that could potentially lead to issues in china s access to leading edge technology so the chinese have a strong desire to move towards tech self sufficiency you have huge intellectual and financial capacity in the private sector to support that ongoing push be it from a software standpoint in relation to artificial intelligence or maybe from a hardware perspective in relation to semiconductors yes effectively you have uncertainty driven by broad based regulatory pressure the main thrust is on antitrust issues of inequality gig economy labour practice etc but you have other elements of regulation relating to a potential review of vie structures generally regulation drives uncertainty which in turn drives a higher risk premium and potentially the suppression of returns so market deterioration is normally expected when there are relatively broad based changes to regulation you mentioned vies could you explain what they are and why they are having an impact on markets vie structures basically get used to navigate limits on foreign ownership if you re a china tech company seeking to attract capital from foreign shareholders but there s a limitation on foreign ownership you might employ a vie structure in order to list in the us vie structures variable interest entities are contractual agreements that provide access to the economic benefit of a company without actual ownership of the underlying assets they ve been an accepted norm for some time and represent a reasonable share now of the msci emerging market benchmark so what s happened recently we have seen moves to review vie mergers and acquisitions m a and in recent days tied into the education reform we have seen a move to disallow vie structures in the private education space the moves led to a reassessment of risk as to whether the structures are under threat any stock that employed a vie structure saw a marked increase in risk premium discover more at schroders insights and click on the links below why china s stunning vaccine surge could be good news for the world which emerging markets will be the winners and losers from energy transition what does sluggish emerging market growth mean for investors can you explain why the government has put particular pressure on educational companies education is highly competitive in china it s very competitive to get into the top universities which can define your life chances as a result there is very strong demand for private tutoring this brings with it two issues one you get a very serious burden on young students that can bring with it issues of societal harm two there s a very heavy cost of private tutoring which can exacerbate issues of inequality put them together and there is a potentially negative impact on the birth rate china has an ageing population and the birth rate has been falling this may be because as a parent you want to focus all your attention and resources on a single child so there may be implications in terms of the birth rate and inequality this actually ties into other issues such as general cost of housing which might also deter people from having more children this all ties back into reform being driven by a combination of communist party legitimacy and national interest chinese companies have listed in the us through so called american depository receipts adrs a practice the chinese government has indicated it does not favour what do you think is going on there i think that s an issue of control that is linked into the regulation e g the control of data and a simple desire not to see chinese companies list in the us obviously the us itself might drive delisting the holding foreign companies accountable act signed at the end of trump s term basically specifies that within three years certain documents relating to audits must be supplied to the pcaob public company accounting oversight board if you don t do that then the relevant stock gets delisted so it might not be the chinese who force delisting it might be the us but it is clear that the chinese would prefer that chinese companies do not list in the us we don t necessarily see a hong kong sar special administrative region versus a us listing as being detrimental the us represents a huge pool of capital and tech companies from china might also want to list there for reasons of status and comparability with us listed tech but when you list in hong kong sar you can also get approval for southbound connect enabling chinese mainland investors to buy your stock and there is a huge pool of savings in china so our expectation is that us listed chinese companies probably will if they don t already have listings in hong kong sar have a dual listing in hong kong sar they might also delist from the us but we don t expect this alone to be materially detrimental to their valuation some very well known chinese technology companies have seen shares fall 35 50 is that overdone you ve got a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment regulatory uncertainty could impact upon corporate returns the push to better align the interest of the private sector with national interest could also impact corporate returns vie structures are under scrutiny and there is broader uncertainty around the impact on the economy and the private sector of a shift in policy towards what is termed common prosperity all of that uncertainty has lifted the risk premium and driven an expectation that returns may be suppressed that has driven market stress so what now now you would hope that you would get some degree of confirmation from the chinese authorities that vie structures will be respected that s important secondly hopefully you ll begin to see a degree of regulatory stability if new rules are established and you see a degree of stability in regulation that might give people the opportunity to assess the operational impact we might then see the risk premium begin to come down but it could take time how would you view china as an emerging market investor we have been cautious throughout the first half of the year on china initially it was a function of valuations china had a very good 2020 it managed covid 19 well in terms of implementing stringent lockdowns controlling the virus seeing normalisation ahead of other countries it also had a supportive composition of benchmark being relatively heavy on the tech names which performed very well through last year this year we ve been concerned about a couple of things there was a rollover in china s credit impulse the change in the level of credit extension that peaked in q1 and has moved negative second was the broadening out in regulatory pressure we ve also had a softer than expected consumption environment we were already cautious and we have remained cautious looking forward from here regulatory headwinds could potentially fade you might also see the authorities take the foot off the brake in terms of stimulus withdrawal china is still a very large market with high levels of innovation it is highly integrated with the global economic system and will remain a major supplier to the rest of world for a very long period of time even so tensions between china and the us will in our view persist and there may well be implications from that for more visit schroders
