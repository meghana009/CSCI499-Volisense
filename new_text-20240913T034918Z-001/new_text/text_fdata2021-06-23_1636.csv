days after cameras captured him walking alongside president donald trump across a square near the white house that had been violently cleared of protesters army gen mark a milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff sat in his office across the potomac assessing the fallout people whom milley respected had issued scathing condemnations of his role in the president s june 2020 photo op saying it represented a military endorsement of trump s suppression of peaceful protests and a chorus of commentators called for the general to resign friends urged milley a gruff ebullient and sometimes impulsive career soldier to stay on for the good of the country milley tried to explain that the episode had caught him off guard that he hadn t known trump s intentions when they walked into an area where just minutes earlier authorities had used tear gas to disperse protesters milley also knew that to the cold gaze of history it might not matter advertisement the whole thing was f ed up milley loquacious and often profane told others after the fact a former altar boy milley s catholic faith informed a feeling that he needed to publicly account for what occurred you confess your sins do your penance and you move on he later told a colleague equally important milley believed he was one of the few officials who retained influence with trump who many aides feared would heed calls to attack iran or drag the military into his quest to remain in power the washington post reconstructed who did what to clear protesters from lafayette square which sits north of the white house on june 1 watch how it unfolded video sarah cahlan joyce lee atthar mirza the washington post on a cold day outside the capitol seven months later milley stiffly saluted a different commander in chief one who promised to restore order but also harbored a deep skepticism of military influence and intended to sweep away many decisions and some remaining officials from the trump era advertisement milley who declined to be interviewed for this article is one of a handful of senior officials to straddle a fraught presidential transition characterized by conspiracy theories and violence the success with which milley navigates that transition will not only define his legacy but also test whether the nonpartisan nature of the military s most esteemed positions can survive a hyperpartisan time he is one of the people who bear the scars of the trump years said john gans a former obama administration official who wrote a book about national security decision making that may not be his fault but that is the fate of being in the wrong place at the wrong time which was being chairman under donald trump a tough guy ice hockey helped milley who grew up in a working class neighborhood outside of boston find his way to the ivy league he inherited the love of the sport from his father a navy corpsman who took part in the battle of iwo jima and brought his hockey skates to the pacific advertisement milley played hockey at belmont hill a prep school outside boston before he started there in 1972 his mother who had served as a wartime navy nurse took him to a used clothing store to get him a sport coat and tie milley was intimidated by the academics at the elite all boys institution but he excelled on the ice he went on to play at princeton where he worked campus jobs joined the rotc and was an unremarkable student i was in the half of the class that made the top half possible he later joked moving up the army ranks milley was known for having a big commanding personality and a burly physique to match he relished storytelling and roasting peers his willingness to make unorthodox decisions won him promotions he has a sharp mind and had a vision for where he wanted to take the army said a former senior army official who worked closely with milley and who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide candid thoughts and recollections he s also a blood in the water type guy if you let on fear or if you don t know your stuff you re going to get blown out of the water he said advertisement detractors say he sometimes domineered those around him allowed his temper to erupt and according to another former official has an ego the size of the empire state building in 2015 president barack obama nominated milley to be army chief of staff vaulting him over more senior officers to the service s top job there milley sought to repair damage done by earlier budget cuts and prepare for 21st century wars in 2018 he caught trump s eye as a possible replacement for joseph f dunford jr the marine general who served as trump s first chairman defense secretary jim mattis whose relationship with trump was rocky by then preferred gen david goldfein the air force chief of staff but trump did not connect with goldfein a pilot whose f 16 was shot down over serbia in 1999 for one thing a former trump administration official said the president didn t like the look of f 16s he preferred f 18s advertisement he s a hell of a brave guy but the president asked what kind of airplane he flew the former official said of goldfein these were the things that would go into his decision making image was more important than anything milley on the other hand had the look and manner of a hardened infantry leader the president was fascinated by milley s uniform asking him what different ribbons and medals signified you re a tough guy i like tough guys trump told milley according to the former official a spokesman for trump did not respond to requests for comment from the moment milley became chairman in september 2019 he and pentagon leaders were consumed by crises generated by trump those included the president s intervention in the navy s handling of a seal accused of war crimes and his greenlighting of a turkish offensive in syria which endangered u s allies and necessitated a pullback so rushed that u s pilots had to bomb their own base advertisement milley s bluntness and combat credibility made him more effective with the president than some other top aides current and former officials said share this article share when george floyd s killing by police sparked nationwide protests in may 2020 milley and defense secretary mark t esper pushed back against trump s desire to deploy active duty troops on american streets they sought to placate the president by placing combat soldiers outside washington but hoped they wouldn t be used on june 1 after trump summoned esper and milley to the white house he asked them to accompany him and a cohort of other aides outside milley who was in combat fatigues followed the president as trump strode across lafayette square there the president surrounded by other aides but not milley posed for the cameras and raised a bible in front of a nearby church advertisement to critics the moment suggested that the military supported the harsh treatment of protesters and trump s divisive approach to governing mattis former chairman of the joint chiefs martin dempsey and hundreds of u s military academy alumni were among those who spoke out current and former officials said milley considered resigning but weighed that against his influence with trump who was already signaling he might not respect the results of the november election in an address the following week to graduates of national defense university the next generation of military leaders milley issued an apology unprecedented in recent military history my presence in that moment and in that environment created the perception of the military involved in domestic politics he said it was a mistake that i have learned from and i sincerely hope we all can learn from it regular order in the months that followed milley repeatedly spoke about the duty troops have to the constitution and the rule of law rather than to any person or political party we all committed our lives to an idea that is america he said in one message to the force advertisement some officials thought trump angered over statements that were seen as an implicit rebuke might fire milley who was slated to serve a four year term if he gets reelected you re dead meat the former official told him but while trump dismissed esper in november he left milley in place throughout the remainder of 2020 military leaders grew increasingly uneasy as the president suggested he might not respect the results of the election raising the possibility of further crises involving the armed forces to replace esper trump tapped christopher c miller a little known counterterrorism official and several loyalists were installed around the acting defense secretary the last time milley spoke with trump was jan 3 when he visited the white house with miller three days later trump supporters smashed their way into the capitol in a riot that left five people dead despite the criticism that the pentagon should have moved faster to assist on jan 6 experts credit milley with reinforcing the military s nonpartisan status during the months surrounding the election he s the first chairman who s had to answer serious questions about will there be a peaceful transition said peter feaver an expert on civil military relations at duke university as biden s inauguration approached speculation mounted that the new president might nonetheless ask milley to step aside in the past a small number of chairmen have served shorter tenures most recently when marine gen peter pace stepped down after he was not nominated for a second two year term in 2007 but a senior administration official said such a move was never seriously considered he said that milley as governing ground close to a halt during the trump administration s final weeks helped spearhead security planning for biden s inauguration when incoming officials feared supporters of the outgoing president might mount another attack a lot of us have strong views about what happened at lafayette square but we also have strong views that values the career of government and career expertise including our military the official said and we have worked very closely and i think very successfully with gen milley and many others who served in the previous administration this spring milley spoke with apparent relief about the restoration of what he called regular order in national security decision making including a return to frequent cabinet meetings the renewed rhythm allowed him to make his case for keeping troops in afghanistan amid the new administration s first major foreign policy debate at the white house milley made an impassioned case that leaving could permit the kabul government to collapse and provide a foothold for terrorists when biden informed milley and defense secretary lloyd austin a retired general in april that he had decided to withdraw milley sought to illustrate what he has referred to as the saluting point where military officials stop making arguments and start executing orders retired adm mike mullen who served as chairman to presidents george w bush and obama said that switching between commanders in chief was a familiar shift for career officers who know they must provide advice and comply with decisions whatever they may be that is literally a switch for us it s something that s ingrained he said whoever the president is that s what we go do in another potentially revealing move milley recently changed his position on proposals to alter how the military handles sexual assault dropping his opposition to stripping commanders of authority to refer cases to trial the move reflected the failure of earlier efforts to curb sex crimes but also signaled he would not stand in the way of changes supported by biden in addition to the shadow of trump another element milley must negotiate as he seeks to make inroads with his new boss is biden s complex relationship to the military the president reveres those who serve making frequent reference to his son beau who served in iraq but he also harbors deep skepticism toward military leaders based in part on the heated 2009 debates over afghanistan when he warned obama against letting the generals jam him biden s selection of the seasoned but introverted austin suggested his desire to avoid the foreign policy battles of the past when the brass sometimes pushed back through the media biden also prizes loyalty and personal relationships suggesting he may keep milley at a distance in favor of those with whom he has long worked closely including national security adviser jake sullivan he recognizes he s operating in a challenging environment jim golby a former army strategist who teaches at the university of texas said of milley milley has previously compared his role to that of a stock broker who advises clients on different elements within their portfolio my job is to say here is the cost and the risk and here s my recommendation he said this spring so far milley s directness his speed in demonstrating support for presidential decisions and his brio mixing expletives with references to xerxes or the wehrmacht appear to have smoothed his shift to biden s national security team milley s a colorful guy always has been biden s a colorful guy always has been a former senior military official said there are possibilities there in terms of things that are similar that would connect them whether milley eventually develops a close relationship with biden experts said the decision to keep him in place goes a long way to repairing the harmful politicization of the military that occurred under trump an early exit would have reinforced the idea that the armed forces are part of the political fray a notion antithetical to the military ethos there was certainly potential for a much nastier situation where he played an obstructionist role or the administration undermined him or ousted him we haven t seen that truly ugly outcome golby said it was a real test of our system

home blogs gus leonisky s blog the aliens are glowing in the dark and taking the piss fermi the quantum physicist was not the first scientist to ask about aliens konstantin tsiolkovsky in an unpublished 1933 manuscript had written people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe because if such beings exist they would have visited earth and if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence this has not prevented many of us fantasising about aliens in science fiction and about them having given us signs such as the pyramids and some cave drawings some people have even suggested that our junk dna is the remnant of alien life code which is useless on this planet i might only see blurry aliens after a katzenjammer giving drinking session which has been quite rare even more so in my old age but let s not dismiss the aliens we never saw otherwise the religious nutcases have seen angels and demons which of course could only be aliens from other planets on a sea gull wing and a prayer unless they had anti gravity light speed scooters under their long dresses er i mean robes this fermi paradox was going against other people who basically declared the non existence of extraterrestrials since fermi believed in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel he proposed the a modified zoo hypothesis becomes a more appealing answer to the fermi paradox the time between the emergence of the the zoo hypothesis thus speculates on the assumed behaviour and existence of technically advanced extraterrestrials and the reasons they refrain from contacting earth it is one of many theoretical explanations for the fermi paradox the fermi hypothesis is that alien life intentionally avoids communication with earth and one of its main interpretations is that it does so to allow for natural evolution and socio cultural development avoiding interplanetary contamination similarly to people observing animals at a zoo i disagree possibly pissed but elevated in the high sciences of quantum physics and the speed of light fermi and his co workers started to speculate about cartoons of aliens falling in love with trash cans in the streets of new york york wrote in 1984 that fermi followed up with a series of calculations on the probability of earthlike planets the probability of life given an earth the probability of humans given life the likely rise and duration of high technology and so on he concluded on the basis of such calculations that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over so what s the caper some intelligent earthians are proposing that the rarity of cosmic alien visitations is due to the phosphorus equation by chance planet earth is a lucky planet apart from the moronic human species that babbles and bickles as if to destroy the place planet earth has a carbon equation a lovely median temperature with little extremes water salt an atmosphere a bit too thin really and a relative abundance of phosphorus compared to the rarity of this element in the rest of the universe as observed but this does not mean that phosphorus has not concentrated on exo planets like it did on earth as this element is hungry for other elements to combine with such as oxygen and thus would quickly vanish from the cosmos soup as far as we know without phosphorus still a rare element on this planet compared to carbon oxygen nitrogen and silicon there would be no life some traces of phosphorus have been found on meteorites but this does not mean that our phosphorus came after the formation of the planet 4 5 billion years ago from the congealing cosmic dust of the solar system life need phosphorus this oxidising element is

laboratory heating a mixture of sand and charcoal with a tar like substance produced by boiling down about 1 200 gallons of urine over two weeks he then maintained the mixture at the highest temperature his furnace could reach after many hours a white vapor formed and condensed into thick drops that gleamed brightly for hours the glowing waxy substance had never been seen before brandt called it phosphorus a latin term for things that give off light brandt s was an era that still saw a world made up of four elements fire air water and earth and like the fascinated colleagues to whom he showed his new compound brandt assumed it was composed of these elements a little more than a hundred years later antoine lavoisier replaced this worldview with another of elements as simple substances that could not be further decomposed whatever his categories brandt s phosphorus was a spectacular sight artist joseph wright of derby immortalized this moment a century later in his painting the alchymist within 50 years of its discovery phosphorus was being produced and sold to apothecaries natural philosophers and showmen who made the element the centerpiece of demonstrations at princely courts and scientific societies within 100 years phosphorus was appearing in chemistry textbooks such as p j macquer s popular elements of theoretical and practical chemistry within another 50 years the element was making its way into matches fertilizer and bombs once mineral phosphates had replaced urine as the best source material so what s the beef are we going to run out of phosphorus should we use it too much of it in plastics that will lock it up for a long time the world tonnage of phosphorus production from rocks is somewhat secret or unknown plants extract phosphorus from soils and we use it as fertiliser in various forms we know about some are aliens coming to this planet to steal our phosphorus and is this why aliens glow in the dark or is guano alien

contact us a modified zoo hypothesis becomes a more appealing answer to the fermi paradox the time between the emergence of the first civilization within the milky way and all subsequent civilizations could be enormous monte carlo simulation shows the first few inter arrival times between emergent civilizations would be similar in length to geologic epochs on earth just what could a civilization do with a ten million one hundred million or half billion year head start even if this first grand civilization is long gone their initial legacy could live on in the form of a passed down tradition or perhaps an artificial life form dedicated to such a goal without the risk of death beyond this it does not even have to be the first civilization but simply the first to spread its doctrine and control over a large volume of the galaxy if just one civilization gained this hegemony in the distant past it could form an unbroken chain of taboo against rapacious colonization in favour of non interference in those civilizations that follow the uniformity of motive concept previously mentioned would become moot in such a situation if the oldest civilization still present in the milky way has for example a 100 million year time advantage over the next oldest civilization then it is conceivable that they could be in the singular position of being able to control monitor influence or isolate the emergence of every civilization that follows within their sphere of influence this is analogous to what happens on earth within our own civilization on a daily basis in that everyone born on this planet is born into a pre existing system of familial associations customs traditions and laws that were already long established before our birth and which we have little or no control over

on june 21 2021 the u s supreme court held in goldman sachs group inc v arkansas teacher retirement system no 20 222 2021 that courts may consider at the class certification stage the generic nature of alleged misrepresentations as evidence of the lack of price impact in determining whether a defendant has rebutted the presumption of classwide reliance recognized in basic inc v levinson even though this may entail overlap with the merits question of materiality the court further held that defendants seeking to rebut the basic presumption bear not only the burden of production but also the ultimate burden of persuasion to prove lack of price impact by a preponderance of the evidence justice barrett delivered the opinion of the court in which chief justice roberts and justices breyer kagan and kavanaugh joined in full and justices thomas alito gorsuch and sotomayor joined in part justice sotomayor also filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and justice gorsuch filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which justices thomas and alito joined background the case arises from a putative securities class action in the southern district of new york under section 10 b and rule 10b 5 of the exchange act in which the plaintiffs alleged that petitioner goldman sachs made material misstatements concerning its procedures for managing conflicts of interest the alleged misstatements included generic aspirational statements that are common among issuers e g ur clients interests always come first and integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business the court previously held in basic inc v levinson that investor plaintiffs can establish a classwide rebuttable presumption of reliance if they show that i the defendant s misstatements were publicly known ii their shares were traded in an efficient market and iii the plaintiffs purchased the shares at market price after the alleged misstatements were made and before the truth was revealed to invoke basic s presumption of reliance the shareholders in goldman relied on the inflation maintenance or price maintenance theory which posits that misstatements can artificially maintain an already inflated stock price respondents argued that the statements fraudulently inflated the company s stock price which then dropped when reports of alleged conflicted transactions became public in addition to presenting expert testimony to demonstrate the absence of price impact goldman sachs countered that the basic presumption was rebutted because the alleged misstatements were by their nature too general to have any significant impact on a security s price in a divided opinion the u s court of appeals for the second circuit held that considering a statement s generic nature at the class certification stage would really be a means for smuggling materiality into rule 23 which is irrelevant at the stage and is unrelated to the issue of whether common questions predominate over individual ones 1 the court affirmed the certification of the shareholder class holding that the company failed to satisfy its burden of persuasion to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the price decline was due to something other than the alleged misstatements 2 in a dissenting opinion judge richard sullivan reasoned that nce a defendant has challenged the basic presumption and put forth evidence demonstrating that the misrepresentation did not affect share price a reviewing court is free to consider the alleged misrepresentations in order to assess their impact on price the mere fact that such an inquiry resembles an assessment of materiality does not make it improper 3 the supreme court s decision the supreme court rejected the second circuit s approach holding that although a court cannot consider materiality and loss causation directly at the class certification stage it can consider the nature of the alleged misrepresentations to the extent that review relates to an analysis of price impact reconciling its prior decisions in amgen inc v connecticut retirement plans and trust funds in which the court held that materiality should be left to the merits stage and halliburton ii in which the court held that defendants may rebut the basic presumption at the class certification stage the court held that in assessing price impact at class certification courts should be open to all probative evidence on that question regardless whether the evidence is also relevant to a merits question like materiality 4 the court noted the particular importance of the generic nature of an alleged misrepresentation to the price impact inquiry in cases resting on a price inflation maintenance theory observing that the inference that back end price drop equals front end inflation starts to break down when there is a mismatch between the contents of the misrepresentation and the corrective disclosure in those circumstances there is less reason to infer front end price inflation that is price impact from the back end price drop 5 the court concluded that because the second circuit s opinion did not make clear whether it had in fact considered the nature of the alleged misrepresentations as to price impact the case should be remanded for further consideration while the court s resolution of the price impact question can be viewed as a win for defendants the court also held that defendants bear not only the burden of production in rebutting the basic presumption but also the ultimate burden of persuasion on that question rejecting the argument that the burden shifting structure of rule 301 of the federal rules of evidence applies to the basic presumption instead pointing to language in those precedents requiring defendants to show a lack of price impact and to sever the link between a misrepresentation and the price paid by a plaintiff the court concluded that its decisions in basic and halliburton ii had already assign to defendants the burden of persuasion to prove a lack of price impact 6 finally the court observed that the allocation of the burden of persuasion is unlikely to make much difference on the ground because a district court s task is to assess all evidence and decide whether it is more likely than not that the alleged misrepresentations had a price impact accordingly he defendants burden of persuasion will have bite only when the court finds the evidence in equipoise a situation that should rarely arise justice sotomayor concurred in the court s analysis of both legal questions but noted in dissent that she would not have remanded the case because in her view the second circuit did not reject the notion of considering the generic nature of alleged misstatements in evaluating price impact justice gorsuch in a partial dissent joined by justices thomas and alito joined the court s decision as to the use of materiality evidence to rebut price impact but would have held that rule 301 applied to the basic presumption and left the burden of persuasion with plaintiffs the goldman decision adds some constraints to plaintiffs ability to use the combined impact of the basic presumption and the price inflation maintenance theory to meet their class certification burden the decision could also serve as a broader mandate to the lower courts to consider all relevant evidence at the class certification stage even if the same evidence is also relevant to a merits question such as materiality and although the placement of the burden of persuasion as to price impact on defendants might initially seem to temper that effect the court s clarification that district courts need only weigh all evidence of price impact under a preponderance of evidence standard can be viewed as a win for defendants on the whole and reinforces that class certification will continue to be an active battleground in many securities cases _______________ 1 arkansas tchr ret sys v goldman sachs grp inc 955

gov greg abbott signed into law a bill last week that restricts how current events and america s history of racism can be taught in texas schools it s been commonly referred to as the critical race theory bill though the term critical race theory never appears in it but in signing the bill abbott said that more must be done to abolish critical race theory in texas and announced that he would ask the legislature to address the issue during a special session this summer meanwhile the debate has taken hold across the nation last year conservative activist christopher rufo began using the term critical race theory publically to denounce anti racist education efforts since then conservative lawmakers commentators and parents have raised alarm that critical race theory is being used to teach children that they are racist and that the u s is a racist country with irredeemable roots u s sen ted cruz and others have called the theory racist itself for centering the nation s story on racial conflict in addition conservative commentator gerard baker has argued that critical race theory bans critical thought in favor of what resembles religious instruction those who study the discipline say that the attacks have nothing to do with critical race theory but instead are targeting any teachings that challenge and complicate dominant narratives about the country s history and identity they say that critical race theory itself actually shifts emphasis away from accusing individuals in history or in the classroom of being racist which tends to dominate liberal discussions of racism instead it offers tools for shifting public policy to create equity and freedom for all so what is critical race theory and why is it relevant to texans and why is there an effort against it in texas and around the nation what is critical race theory critical race theory is a discipline analytical tool and approach that emerged in the 1970s and 80s scholars took up the ways racial inequity persisted even after a whole set of landmark civil rights laws and anti discrimination laws passed during the civil right movement daniel hosang professor of ethnicity race and migration and american studies at yale university said these scholars and writers are asking why is it that racial inequality endures and persists even decades after these laws have passed hosang said why is racism still enduring and how do we contribute to abolishing it hosang described critical race theory not as content or a set of beliefs but rather an approach that encourage us to move past the superficial explanations that are given about equality and suffering and to ask for new kinds of explanations in the introduction of critical race theory the key writings that formed the movement a seminal collection of the foundational essays of the movement edited by principal founders and scholars like kimberlé crenshaw and neil gotanda the editors write that critical race theory is about transforming social structures to create freedom for all and it s grounded in an ethical commitment to human liberation key concepts racial formation one key concept in critical race theory is racial formation developed by sociologists michael omi and howard winant the theory rejects the idea that race black white asian is a fixed category that has always meant the same thing instead it traces the way that race has been defined understood and constructed in different ways throughout history omi and winant define race as an unstable and decentered complex of social meanings constantly being transformed by political struggle for example they write that in the u s the racial category of black was created as slavery was established and evolved africans whose specific identity was ibo yoruba or fulani in africa were grouped into the category black as they were enslaved in america part of the meaning of being black in america was being less than human and therefore enslavable james baldwin wrote in on being white and other lies that europeans who moved to america became white through a process of denying the black presence and justifying the black subjugation omi and winant describe racial formation as the process by which social economic and political forces determine the content and importance of racial categories and by which they are in turn shaped by racial meanings a process that has continued throughout history monica martinez a history professor at the university of texas at austin who specializes in latinx history described how one way racial formation has played out in texas is in the racialization of mexicans and the history of anti mexican violence before this region became texas there were debates about the character of mexicans as a group of people she said figures like stephen f austin and john calhoun cast them as treacherous people thieves and murderers from 1910 to 1920 she explained hundreds of ethnic mexicans were victims of lynchings as well as violence at the hands of police and the texas rangers many of them were american citizens and they included labor organizers and journalists who were writing about race and injustice this amounted to an effort to remove mexicans from having economic or political or cultural influence she said oppression was enacted through violence and it was sanctioned by governors texas legislators and local courts she said oppression was furthered by juan crow segregation laws that racially segregated communities relegated mexican american children to poorly developed schools and intimidated mexicans from voting this system of laws and policies had lasting effects on mexican americans and how they re conceived of today rhetoric has played a role in racial formation as well continually loading the term mexican with racial meaning 100 years ago people talked about mexicans as bandits as thieves and as a threat she said today they talk about them as potential cartel members and gang members this language contributes to racial profiling and violence today in communities in south texas anybody who looks mexican or looks like an immigrant can be targeted not just with policing but also by hostility she said racism is structural the mainstream understanding is that racism is an individual prejudice and choice the default is to be free of bias and racism so racism is an exception from the norm it can be addressed by individual measures such as humiliating and punishing the person who messes up and enforcing moral codes on an individual level on the other hand critical race theory says that racism is inherent in our institutions and structures of governance it s ordinary and it s baked into all our consciousnesses in complex ways through our education government the media and our participation in systems racism must be addressed not just by punishing individuals but by shifting structures and policies hosang the yale professor explained that critical race theory isn t focused on the stock characters of a racist such as bull connor who directed police to use fire hoses on civil rights protesters in birmingham alabama hosang said that a focus on denouncing individuals is not a good use of our energy instead he said the question is even in places where civil rights and anti discrimination laws passed why do these forms of inequality persist so actually says no we shouldn t be preoccupied with trying to discern who is the racist here because that moves the attention away from the structures he said one example of this is in housing segregation how many many complex layers of policies around zoning lending and redlining around private realtors and developers have reproduced unequal access to housing which in turn furthers gaps in generational wealth and stability hosang said in his article for the austin american statesman dan zehr traces how this process has played out in austin which has one of the highest levels of income segregation in the nation in 1928 city plans created a negro district east of interstate 35 and denied public services and utilities to black people outside of it pushing black residents to the eastern part of the city when the government began offering loans to promote homeownership and help citizens rebuild wealth as part of the new deal after the great depression neighborhoods for people of color were excluded through a practice called redlining austin s negro district was the largest redlined zone in the city zehr writes as most americans gained equity in new homes or upgraded the value of their existing houses the black population saw a racial wedge driven deeper between anglo affluence and african american poverty he explains all these processes are systemic you can t explain through any one person s biases and prejudices hosang said is critical race theory being taught in k 12 classrooms experts and teachers put it plainly nobody in k 12 is teaching critical race theory andrew robinson an 8th grade u s history teacher at uplift luna preparatory in dallas said if i tried to walk in and teach critical race theory my kids would just have a blank stare on their face critical race theory is not being taught in schools martinez said keffrelyn brown a professor of cultural studies in education at ut austin and a teacher educator agreed a vast majority of teachers in k 12 schools don t know critical race theory she said they are not coming into the classroom and saying i m going to teach critical race theory hosang pointed out that to begin with critical race theory is not a body of content that can be taught given that abbott s calls to abolish critical race theory in texas make no sense those who study it said i don t think you can abolish a theory brown said how does texas new law and surrounding debate discuss critical race theory while it has gained the ire of national republicans on fox news and elsewhere for months critical race theory was thrust in the political spotlight in texas this spring because of the progress of hb 3979 lawmakers claimed that it combats the theory the wording of the bill is vague for example it bans discussion of current events unless a teacher strive to explore those topics from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective and teacher s can t teach that with respect to their relationship to american values slavery and racism are anything other than deviations from betrayals of or failures to live up to the authentic founding principles of the united states which include liberty and equality in an early statement supporting the legislation lt gov dan patrick said that critical race theory is a woke philosoph that maintain that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex or that any individual by virtue of his or her race or sex is inherently racist sexist or oppressive the phrase critical race theory does not appear in the bill once however brown described the way the term critical race theory has been mobilized as a label that has nothing to do with critical race theory itself it has become the catch all phrase for any kind of perspective or any kind of framework or any kind of knowledge that shows the roots of racism and how deeply they are embedded in our society she said experts pointed out several key mischaracterizations of critical race theory political discourse has claimed that critical race theory unfairly assigns guilt and blame to individuals based on their race in one section that lists concepts teachers can t teach the bill prohibits teaching that an individual should feel discomfort guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual s race or sex has nothing to do with sentiment guilt or shame hosang said in fact one of its premises is that those are not actually helpful places to examine it s taking us out of racism as a psychological and emotional question and is focusing much more on the structures the policies that people create that govern our lives martinez said the worry comes out of false claims that when you teach histories of slavery or race or racism that you make some white students feel guilty or shame for being white to focus on directly instilling racial guilt would be taking a liberal individualistic approach that critical race theory actually critiques the bill also prohibits teaching that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex or that an individual by virtue of the individual s race or sex is inherently racist sexist or oppressive whether consciously or unconsciously if anything martinez said the current longstanding way of teaching texas history already teaches that one race is superior look at how it teaches the history of the texas revolution that people like stephen f austin are racially superior to the treacherous mexican like santa anna she said texas history has been taught in a way that celebrates people who were fighting for the institution of slavery that were espousing publicly that mexicans were an inferior race hosang agreed there s so much of the dominant curriculum that does just what the bills claim they re objecting to in terms of constructing a moral ideology he said one could argue the current curriculum promotes intolerance and animosity against indigenous people and that it does the same for immigrants future impact brown the ut austin cultural studies professor described the new texas law as an effort to try to stop the momentum over the last year and a half of families and communities saying we need to know more about racism we need to understand so that we actually can get to a place where we are operating with justice with equity with fairness she said instead she said the bill may create enough confusion and possible concern that teachers or districts would just simply not talk about issues of race or racism for fear that it s going to create some conflict abbott s press office did not comment on what he additionally wants the legislature to do about critical race theory during this summer s special session but many teachers worry about the chilling effect that the new law will already have on their attempts to teach history well which includes nurturing students critical thinking skills by bringing in multiple perspectives on historical events and showing how the past has impacted present day issues what they re trying to say with this is that the actions of the past aren t affecting the present said robinson the 8th grade history teacher in dallas they want us to act like slavery and jim crow have no bearing on the issues in our society right now and if that s the case then they should cancel my class disclosure university of

opinion the story goes joe kennedy knew it was time to short stocks just before the 1929 crash when the shoeshine boys were dispensing investment tips the market frenzy was complete everyone had bought in and no more fools were left to add the new oxygen necessary to keep a bubble going now with inflation the fed has convinced itself and financial markets the recent surge in prices is temporary that forecast is politically expedient it s in line with president biden s budget the fed predicts price increases will fall to 2 1 percent next year and stays there for the foreseeable future and the pace implied by inflation indexed bonds is not much higher but the business leaders that actually pay wages buy computer chips and basic commodities confront electric bills and purchase equipment see prices going up a lot faster the disconnect is so stark because the bond market takes its cues from the fed chairman and senior policymakers who in turn are influenced by staff macroeconomists those sorcerers have a penchant for reducing a 21 trillion economy with supply tentacles reaching to the edges of the globe to just a few equations but beneath those behavioral rules like the fabled phillip s curve are a myriad of real world conditions that are changing rapidly while econometric models are estimated with historical data pandemics like wars create barriers to accustomed patterns of spending restaurant closures this time and food rationing in world war ii when crises pass folks go back to old ways but not completely hybrid offices will permanently cut purchases of food at city eateries and elevate demand for home office space equipment and collaborative software many restaurants and jobs for working class and minority americans are lost for good the demand for materials like copper chips and software to equip and enable a more distributed professional workforce won t go back to 2019 levels shortages and booming prices and wages for skilled workers in those industries are here to stay unless the fed exerts considerable monetary discipline over the two decades new home construction has been depressed but now millennials on the upper leg of the k shaped job market commuting less are ploughing into suburban home ownership builders are responding but are butting up against shortages of building lots lumber and other materials and skilled tradesmen from years of underinvestment in sawmills factories and vocational education that the fed can t fix as its inflation forecasts require as the commerce department only includes the implied rents homeowners pay themselves with a lag and those account for 24 percent of the consumer price index we know two things home prices will continue to rise at a quick pace and their impact on measures of consumer inflation will continue for years over the last two decades manufactures and consumer service providers read call centers at amazon and credit card companies have stretched supply chains into china and elsewhere in asia in search of the lowest wages pandemic shutdowns shortages of imported components showed the vulnerability of such strategies and diversification and reshoring away from the lowest price source are the buzz words and the lowest price source isn t what it used to be china s working age population is shrinking all that points to prices rising a lot more than over the past decade american workers can be retrained levi strauss is retooling brick and mortar retail workers for skilled digital positions with a two month intensive bootcamp in coding and data analytics instead of piggy backing on such efforts mr biden wants to offer two years of free community college levi s trainees get paid and pay their rent at community colleges displaced restaurant workers will be subjected to woke indoctrination questionably useful training delivered by proselytizing professors and borrow for living expenses the fed is enormously pressured to validate that folly along with a plethora of social programs demanded by the hard left ideologies staffing the biden administration a good deal of the president s 3 trillion in proposed non infrastructure social spending would be financed by the fed buying bonds to suppress interest rates his budget projections don t work without that during the pandemic the fed printed over 3 trillion to buy bonds and its balance sheet now exceeds 35 percent of the national debt held by the public at its june policymaking meeting it said it will keep buying billions in treasuries and mortgage backed securities all that money chasing goods in short supply will ultimately leave messrs biden and powell as ricky ricardo would say with some splaining to do peter morici pmorici1 is an economist and emeritus business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist
on may 28 2021 the us department of the treasury treasury released the fiscal year fy 2022 budget and green book which provides detailed insights into the proposals of us president joe biden s recently released american jobs plan and american families plan this article summarizes the key proposals affecting businesses and provides further insight on planning considerations in depth country by country regime to apply to gilti and foreign branch income the current global intangible low taxed income gilti regime operates on a global blended basis such that excess taxes paid in high tax jurisdictions may be used to offset residual us taxes on income earned in low tax jurisdictions the green book raises a concern that global blending incentivizes us companies that have operations in high tax jurisdictions to invest in low tax jurisdictions and us companies that have operations in low tax jurisdictions to invest in high tax jurisdictions in either case per the treasury us companies are encouraged to invest outside the united states whether the foreign tax rate is higher or lower than the us tax rate thus the green book proposes to create a new standard under which a us taxpayer s gilti inclusion and foreign tax credit limitation would be determined on a country by country cbc basis if enacted this proposal would constitute both a significant tax increase and a major compliance and tax administration burden for taxpayers and the internal revenue service irs similar to computing a us shareholder s gilti inclusion and foreign tax credit limitation on a cbc basis the green book would expand the cbc regime to foreign branch income citing the same global blending concerns that exist in the gilti context the treasury was presumably concerned that taxpayers might shift from gilti structures into branch structures if the cbc approach were to extend only to gilti however taking a cbc approach to foreign branch income will introduce additional complexity to foreign tax credit limitation determinations particularly where there is a foreign branch loss in a particular country repeal of subpart f and gilti high tax exceptions the green book proposes to repeal the subpart f and gilti high tax exceptions this proposal goes significantly further than simply revising the high tax threshold upward along with the proposed increase in us corporate tax rates many may criticize the green book proposal as overly burdensome on companies with overseas operations driven by business necessities as opposed to tax benefits the proposal to repeal the high tax exceptions would be especially impactful to companies that use these exceptions to mitigate residual us taxation on gilti or subpart f income where the application of the expense allocation and apportionment provisions results in a foreign tax credit limitation under section 904 principles or where the utilization of losses adversely impacts the section 250 taxable income limitation replacing beat with shield additionally the green book proposes to replace the existing base erosion and anti abuse tax beat with a new tax regime stopping harmful inversions and ending low tax developments shield according to the green book the current beat regime does not adequately address the concern of erosion of the us corporate tax base by inefficiently favoring certain activities over others instead of imposing a minimum tax shield would disallow deductions to domestic corporations or branches with respect to gross payments made to low taxed members of the same financial reporting group as in the case of the proposed excess indebtedness interest disallowance rule a financial reporting group is any group of business entities that prepares consolidated financial statements as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap international financial reporting standards ifrs or other method authorized by the us secretary of the treasury secretary and includes at least one domestic corporation domestic partnership or foreign entity with a us trade or business accordingly the majority of multinational enterprises with us presence would be treated as one or more financial reporting groups for this purpose low taxed members generally means any members of a financial reporting group whose income is subject to an effective tax rate that is below a designated minimum tax rate the designated minimum tax rate is either the rate agreed to under pillar two of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting beps project pillar two agreement or before a pillar two agreement is reached the us global minimum tax would be 21 under the green book proposal this means us parented multinational groups would not be subject to shield as gilti prevents any relevant payments from being low taxed thus this element of president biden s plan would be a rare win for us based multinationals in that beat concerns would be eliminated without any need to contend with the beat replacement regime similar to beat shield provides a de minimis exception under which shield does not apply to financial reporting groups with global annual revenues that do not exceed 500 million notably while beat does not treat cost of goods sold cogs as base eroding payments the green book specifically indicates that under shield other types of costs such as cogs would be disallowed up to the amount of the payment made to low taxed members which would be an extremely harsh outcome for those subject to the new regime in addition shield includes rules that apply to disallow deductions of domestic corporations on an aggregate basis with respect to the entire financial reporting group these rules would treat a portion of payments made to members that are not low taxed as payments made based on the aggregate ratio of the financial reporting group s low taxed profits to its total profits in other words if the financial reporting group as a whole is subject to an effective tax rate lower than the designated minimum tax rate all deductible payments made to other members of the financial reporting group would be subject to shield finally shield provides the secretary with authority to exempt from shield payments that meet a minimum effective level of taxation on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis expansion of section 265 to disallow partial deductions under sections 245a and 250 section 265 a 1 generally disallows a deduction for any amount that is allocable to certain classes of income that is wholly exempt from us taxation this rule does not apply to the 100 dividend received deduction for the foreign sourced portion of certain dividends under section 245a or the 50 deduction of foreign derived intangible income fdii under section 250 because those provisions constitute deductions as opposed to rendering any income wholly exempt from us taxation the existence of section 904 b 4 which the green book would repeal as no longer relevant demonstrates that congress understood that present law section 265 does not apply to deny these deductions the green book includes an interesting footnote that implies present law section 265 could be interpreted as already applying to disallow these deductions but there appears to be no basis for that statement under the current code and regulations the green book describes the current rules as effectively providing a tax subsidy for multinationals foreign investments by allowing a domestic corporation or a foreign corporation with us corporate subsidiaries to receive a deduction against us taxation with respect to certain income derived outside the united states thus the green book proposes to reduce the 50 deduction under section 250 to 25 further the proposal would expand the application of section 265 to disallow deductions allocable to income taxed at a preferential rate through a deduction in addition to deductions allocable to wholly exempt income with respect to such partially exempt income the new section 265 under the proposal would disallow a portion of the deductions under sections 245a and 250 and provide rules for determining the amount disallowed as noted above the green book would also repeal section 904 b 4 which applies to disregard deductions allocable to income from foreign stock other than gilti or subpart f income inclusions for determining a taxpayer s section 904 foreign tax credit limitation excess indebtedness interest disallowance rule originally proposed but not enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja legislative process section 163 n would limit interest deductions of multinational corporations specifically members of multinational groups that prepare consolidated financial statements financial reporting groups the green book revisits this concept and proposes a limitation on a financial reporting group member s deduction for interest expense generally the limitation would apply where the member s net interest expense for financial reporting purposes exceeds the member s proportionate share of the financial reporting group s net interest expense reported on the group s consolidated financial statements recognizing some groups may have an administrative burden in calculating and or substantiating their relative us and international interest expense the proposal provides an alternative calculation under this alternative the member s interest deduction would be limited to the member s interest income plus 10 of their adjusted taxable income either limitation would apply in addition to a taxpayer s limitation under section 163 j which was introduced by the tcja section 163 j generally limits a taxpayer s business interest expense deduction to business interest income 30 of their adjusted taxable income and floor plan financing interest the green book describes this change as a way to prevent multinationals from reducing their us tax on income earned from us operations by incurring a disproportionate amount of their debt financing in the united states multinationals may respond by asserting numerous non tax motivated reasons for why their us operations and non us operations might require differing amounts of leverage more importantly unlike earlier versions of the proposal the green book version would not apply to us based multinationals fdii repeal and introduction of r d regime the green book proposes to repeal the fdii deduction and use the resulting revenue to expand on more effective research and development r d incentives but provides no details on what those incentives might be 15 book tentative minimum tax on large corporations as part of his campaign president biden proposed a 15 alternative minimum tax on book earnings of large corporations the green book proposes to impose a book tentative minimum tax btmt on corporations with an income over 2 billion a corporation s btmt equals 1 15 of the corporation s worldwide pre tax book income minus 2 certain business credits such as r d clean energy and housing tax credits it remains to be seen whether there will be any appetite in congress for allowing such an unprecedented encroachment of financial accounting principles to override provisions of the tax code and adopting a new regime that would be tremendously complex and controversial internationally new tax incentives to create job opportunities in the united states according to the green book the current tax regime encourages offshoring us jobs while providing limited tax incentive to onshore foreign job opportunities to provide a tax incentive for relocating foreign jobs to the united states the green book proposes to create a new general business credit equal to 10 of the eligible expenses incurred in connection with onshoring a us trade or business onshoring a us trade or business means reducing or eliminating a trade or business currently conducted outside the united states and moving the same trade or business within the united sates to the extent that this action results in an increase in us jobs in the event the eligible expenses are incurred by a foreign affiliate of a us taxpayer the business credit can be claimed by the us taxpayer for the expenses additionally to address offshoring concerns the green book proposes to disallow deductions for expenses incurred in connection with offshoring a us trade or business for this purpose offshoring a us trade or business means reducing or eliminating a trade or business currently conducted inside the united states and moving the same trade or business outside the united states to the extent that this action results in a loss of us jobs for example in determining a us shareholder s subpart f inclusion or gilti no deduction would be allowed for expenses a controlled foreign corporation cfc incurred in moving a us trade or business outside the united states to the extent offshoring results in a loss of us jobs significant expansion of anti inversion rules the green book proposes to modify the anti inversion rules in several ways first the current inversion rules would be modified to treat a foreign corporation as a domestic corporation based upon a 50 continuity ownership threshold as opposed to the existing 80 threshold second the green book proposes that regardless of the level of shareholder continuity an inversion transaction would occur if 1 immediately prior to the acquisition the fair market value of the domestic entity is greater than the fair market value of the foreign acquiring corporation 2 after the acquisition the expanded affiliated group eag is primarily managed and controlled in the united states and 3 the eag does not conduct substantial business activities in the country in which the foreign acquiring corporation is created or organized the green book would expand the scope of an acquisition to also include a direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the us trade or business assets of a foreign partnership furthermore the green book also proposes to cause a distribution of stock of a foreign corporation by a domestic corporation or a partnership that represents either substantially all of the assets or substantially all of the assets constituting a trade or business of the distributing corporation or partnership to be treated as a direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of such assets effective dates in general most of the proposals of the american jobs plan and american families plan take effect for taxable years beginning after december 31 2021 but there are a few notable exceptions the beat repeal and shield enactment would take effect for taxable years beginning after december 31 2022 for calendar year taxpayers the us corporate tax rate would increase to 28 beginning after december 31 2021 however for fiscal taxable years beginning after january 1 2021 and before january 1 2022 the current rate would apply to that portion of the taxable year occurring in calendar 2021 and the new rate would apply to that portion occurring in calendar 2022 the capital gains tax rate would be effective for capital gains required to be recognized after the date in which the increase was announced which is presumably april 28 2021 the date in which the american families plan was released it remains to be seen whether such a broadly applicable retroactive tax increase will be viable in a closely divided congress

think growth and value can t coexist think again traditional value investors pick stocks that are trading below their fundamentals based on a wide variety of measures as a result and by definition many dismiss growth companies altogether but one manager believes that ignoring growth stocks out of hand is fundamentally flawed value investor applied finance with 1 25 billion in assets under management argues that traditional metrics such as low price to book and price to earnings multiples don t provide investors with a comprehensive framework and are inadequate in identifying stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value in fact companies that are trading on apparently high multiples may actually be undervalued in terms of their overall valuation thus creating opportunities for large returns we re redefining what value is the term has been tortured and confused with cheapness said rafael resendes co founder of applied finance who initially started the firm as a consultancy for corporations the argument comes as investors have debated for years the reasons behind the long underperformance of value strategies even though these stocks have recently staged a comeback in fact academics and practitioners have regularly debated the definition of value investing itself warren buffett the most famous value investor has evolved from looking for so called cigar butts to higher quality stocks bill miller the former portfolio manager of legg mason value trust and now cio of miller value partners famously owned high flying technology stocks in his value portfolio launched in 1995 from a basement in chicago applied finance s unconventional approach includes performing weekly valuations on 20 000 stocks and selecting companies not based on the cheapness factor employed by many value diehards but through a valuation based discipline comprised of r d growth potential competition and risk one of the things we ve been doing since 1995 is capitalizing on research and development costs said resendes this is something that is just now being viewed as transformational in the value investing universe applied finance focuses on a company s allocation to r d but weighs them differently between companies for example a dollar allocated to r d for alphabet google s parent will be worth more than a dollar of that for ibm owing to the difference in growth potential explained resendes the firm then makes projections based on the return of those investments generated cash flows before figuring out a company s economic profit horizon it s understanding the economics of a firm not just its accounting economic profit in this context is defined as the cash remaining after a firm has provided investors the minimum return they require for providing the company capital the firm s models then extract how much a company will reinvest in the future by looking at its history the competition facing a particular company and the risks associated with the investment that is how much the firm is willing to pay until a company performs well marketwise or vice versa this matters especially for value stocks since investments are made for the long haul a primary goal of value based metrics is to eliminate the numerous distortions in accounting data to provide comparability across time firms and industries stated applied finance in a 2000 report according to applied finance the strategy has generated returns that have outperformed the s p 500 over the past five to ten years despite having invested in what were considered growth stocks some of these companies include monster mastercard apple and nvidia one of its best bets was buying nvidia for 13 per share in 2011 and selling it for 525 apiece this past august the firm which invests in 50 companies at any given time doesn t commit to a particular sector precisely because of its valuation approach resendes said the question is why value is still tied primarily to cheapness part of the reason according to resendes has to do with financial academia and research widely used by investors the academic literature is rigorous but financial analysis is very poor the findings he explained fail to focus on valuation and are concentrated in statistical properties of stock prices rather than the fundamental properties of a company they re always using backward looking data said resendes what s missing is live and out of sample data other academics have recently echoed similar sentiments expressing that the old ways have outlived their usefulness applied finance s position comes less than a week after the federal reserve signaled raising interest rates sooner than investors had expected twice by 2023 sending tech stocks soaring and value stocks such as cyclicals finance industrials energy and commodities to retreat though some of these stocks have since rallied from last week s decline the shift in the fed s stance and thus the performance of certain stocks may of course be overstated research by acadian asset management last week challenged the simplified narrative on the relationship between rates and value arguing that it depends on the confluence of many factors and more importantly the need for a nuanced approach a call that value investors like resendes are increasingly pushing for

black households trail white ones in terms of savings in part because of historical and institutional obstacles including a lack of financial wisdom passed down within generations of families what s surprising is that while black households still lag behind their white counterparts even after a college education racial wealth gaps disappear once adjusted for income morningstar associate editor keith reid cleveland moderated the panelists four panelists discussed savings disparities between black and white households last week at a morningstar event closing the gap building black dollars morningstar associate editor keith reid cleveland moderated the panel which included morningstar behavioral researcher michael thompson ceo and founder of adasina social capital rachel robasciotti and advisor brian thompson of brian thompson financial the data morningstar presented research about black households which showed huge gaps in wealth and savings based on factors like income age and education we re hoping these broader results can help morningstar and other partners and organizations interested in this problem to work on interventions that help all families to save more says michael thompson behavioral researcher at morningstar we re hoping these broader results can help morningstar and other partners and organizations interested in this problem to work on interventions that help all families to save more michael thompson says but realizing that not one size fits all we want to figure out ways that we can help black households in particular and for that we need specific strategies that look at income gender age education and region for a much broader holistic approach for every dollar made the median white family saves about seven cents while the median black family saves a penny or less but when compared to families with the same income the racial gap disappears says morningstar s michael thompson this means that the key driver is not cultural and probably the best way to address the racial savings gap is to reduce the racial pay gap he says age is also a factor in the savings gap among black households the biggest increase in savings does not occur until after 45 years old which means it may take those households longer to achieve their retirement goals location also matters morningstar found black families in the south tend to save more than those in the midwest we re trying to understand some of the differences in the regions we notice in the south there is lower racial segregation and higher proportions of minority owned businesses and higher bank account ownership michael thompson says concerning education there was not a racial wealth gap for households headed by non college graduates however when morningstar looked at households headed by college graduates it found that debt may play a major factor holding higher educated households back from saving black families with a college graduate as a head of household do save more than less educated households but white families led by college graduates save even more michael thompson says you graduate college and you have debts and often as is the case with me personally and many other successful black professionals that i know we re not only supporting ourselves but we also have extended family members to support just because of the total community impoverishment that s happened as a result of the injustices that are part of living in the united states as a black person robasciotti says we also just as a community don t end up having as much money because we don t inherit the funds that would allow us to have debt free college education because public schools do not generally teach financial literacy investment advice is passed down within families which plays a role in the racial wealth gap robasciotti says you can imagine that that education about how to preserve and grow wealth is something that s being passed down within certain families and we just don t have consistent avenues inside of the black community for ensuring that that happens she says it s not necessarily always that we ve been targeted as much as that white individuals and families in this country have been given numerous advantages and so i think those are some of the very unique issues that come up for us rachel robasciotti ceo and founder of adasina social capital solutions another issue robasciotti says is the lack of black financial professionals she and other panelists recommended looking to groups such as the association of african american advisors the xy planning network the certified financial planner board and the national association of personal financial advisors to find black advisors the panelists agreed reparations or so called baby bonds could be a solution to closing the wealth gap morningstar s research found that baby bonds could close the wealth gap to 56 as opposed to 90 where it stands now the idea is that they will take those funds which could potentially be as high as 50 000 and use that to kickstart the next phase of their lives which would be used to pay for school or to buy a home along those lines reid cleveland says we need bigger systemic solutions in order to make sure that we are on the same level and are on the same playing field to repair the harm that s already been done and that s really stunted our growth for centuries after centuries we take two steps forwards and then we have to take three steps back because of racism or systemic discrimination brian thompson says advisor brian thompson of brian thompson financial he mentioned the biden administration s announcement earlier this month of its plans to tackle the wealth gap the white house is launching an interagency effort to address inequity in home appraisals and grow federal government contracts with small disadvantaged businesses by 50 or an additional 100 billion over five years according to a statement by the white house robasciotti says the finance industry also has a debt to the black community our industry was the distribution and management system that allowed slavery to function as an economic model what is now wall street was actually built by enslaved people and it actually became the official home of the slave market for new york she says what most people don t know who are in finance is that the first american bond market started with enslaved people as collateral for lending so the very first mortgages in this country were not on homes they were on people s lives and today we manage

details and proof of id your best bet is to partner with one of the best brokers a lot goes into choosing a brokerage account than the mere convenience of setting it up first you ll need to look at your broker s fee structure an online broker may inadvertently hoodwink you with commission free trading at the expense of exorbitant account maintenance fees ensure you are comfortable with your broker s fees otherwise you ll feel resentful when they eat into your investment profits you might be just learning how to buy stocks but your broker shouldn t take the wind out of your sails with limited investing options you don t want to be limited by only trading in the new york stock exchange your broker should provide access to other publicly traded exchanges lest you forget you may want to explore other securities like options cryptos forex warrants and etfs most brokers will introduce you to a web based trading platform today s universal standard for traders go the extra mile to confirm whether a broker also has a desktop platform that supports chatting capabilities or a mobile app for you to execute trades on the go fortunately millennial investors have access to vast information that can guide their choice of an online broker step 2 decide how many shares you want the number of fastly shares you buy depends on the amount of capital you re willing to invest and the current price of fsly stock market deals primarily transact based on the share count to determine the number of shares you want to own take the dollar amount you d like to invest and divide it by the stock s market price for instance if you want to buy 2 000 worth of fsly stock at the price of 57 per share you ll own 35 whole shares 2 000 57 35 09 since the number of shares doesn t represent a whole number you ll want to partner with an online broker that supports fractional share ownership while this isn t an industry standard it lets you invest small amounts without worrying about the

remain void if the market price doesn t reach your designated limit price assume the current market price is 50 if you submit a buy limit order at 47 and later the market price pulls back to 47 your buy limit order is triggered and filled at a price not exceeding 47 of course an executed trade assumes enough shares are trading to fill your order stop order stop orders go live at a predetermined stock price and fill at the market price if the stock price never hits the stop price your order won t be triggered the stock price doesn t guarantee any specific filling price since it executes as a market order assume the current market price of fsly is 50 if you enter a buy stop order at 60 and later the market price rises to 60 then your buy stop order will be triggered it becomes a market order that starts to fill at the closest price to 60 depending on the volume at that market price stop limit order a stop limit order will go live at a predetermined stop price and fills at your predetermined limit price or better assume the current market price of fsly is 50 if you submit a buy stop limit order with a stock price of 60 and limit price of 70 and later the market price rises to 60 your buy limit order triggers and fills at a price not exceeding 70 step 4 execute your trade once you place your order your broker should fill it according to your instructions when your order

city southern kcs a transaction which significantly enhances competition cn s open gateways offer is a big deal it means new enhanced rail to rail competition but for this to even be considered the stb must first approve the cn kcs voting trust i was stb s chief economist for 10 years and i am surprised by the lack of attention to the open gateways commitment this commitment ensures that shippers who today enjoy competitive joint line routings with either cn or kcs will continue to have those routings available to them in a post cn kcs merger environment even if a merged cn kcs could handle the entire movement via a single line routing this means continued competition and we know that competition encourages lower rates better service and innovation the commitment is not just about maintaining physical routings but also about ensuring that the routings are commercially reasonable to the shipper what is meant by open on commercially reasonable terms this means all market participants railroads and shippers will benefit they will get a fair chance to compete they will pay and receive remunerative rates and get efficient service if a shipper is not happy with their service they can switch to another carrier because they will still have a choice a cn kcs combination will create a strong new rail to rail competitor that will provide new single line rail movements in competition with other rail carriers in addition with the gateway commitment shippers will also have the option to use an existing routing or other routings involving more than just the merged cn kcs single line hauls have long been a strong benefit of rail mergers because they are more efficient eliminate costly and time consuming handlings and often create better routes in the past there was concern that such new single line combinations might result in closing such gateways and preventing shippers from using routes involving multiple railroads this is why cn kcs s offer to protect existing gateways commercially is a gamechanger the stb and its predecessor the interstate commerce commission used to impose rigid gateway protection in order to protect a shipper from losing alternative service in a rail merger for more than three decades the icc imposed so called dt i conditions those conditions required the merged railroad to preserve the gateway and to maintain and keep open all routes and channels of trade via existing junctions and gateways between it and another railroad that connected at that gateway it also imposed a rate equalization condition which froze rates in other words in addition to the single line service that the merged railroad could offer the imposition of the dt i conditions kept another option in play because the merged railroad could move the freight to the gateway and hand it off to another road that multi railroad move acted as a competitive constraint to the single line move of the merged railroad that was a good thing but the rate equalization requirement requiring equal rates to all railroads at a gateway meant that the newly merged railroad could not reduce its own rates at the gateways to reflect its new found single line efficiencies this rate equalization requirement actually inhibited competition by preventing railroads from adapting to ever changing market conditions or to reduce rates depending upon the route so as to respond to the increased competition by other modes as such the icc abandoned the dt i gateway conditions and stopped imposing them it realized that the onerous rate equalization feature of that condition prevented rather than enhanced competition cn s gateway commitment is intended to preserve the commendable parts of the dt i conditions which were intended to preserve shippers choices but without the anticompetitive elements of rate equalization keeping gateways open on commercially reasonable terms will enhance competition by supplementing the benefits of new single line routes with the opportunity for customers to access other railroads at gateways affected by a merger the commitment avoids the anti competitive rate equalization features that doomed the prior approach in favor of one that favors flexibility customer choice and enhanced competition besides keeping gateways open cn and kcs have also committed to divest kcs s 70 mile parallel rail line to cn s rail line between baton rouge and new orleans to address the minimal competitive overlap between the two networks this too is commendable as a result of both the divestiture commitment in louisiana and the gateway protection commitment the result is a combined cn kcs network with no competitive overlaps commercially open gateways and a stronger railroad able to offer new and vibrant single line service to compete rail to rail with other class i s especially the two dominant western railroad carriers union pacific and bnsf the merger thus allows cn kcs up and bnsf to compete across major u s rail gateways that include kansas city chicago new orleans st louis and memphis these are the central hubs of u s rail commerce the cn kcs merger with its divestiture commitment and its offer to protect gateways commercially is a huge step forward for competition but shippers will not be able to avail themselves of either the new single line efficiencies or the gateway commitment if the cn kcs merger is never allowed to be considered by the stb in the first place for the merger to even be considered the stb must first approve the use of a voting trust that is why i am supporting cn s proposal to use a voting trust and urge shippers and other interested parties to do so as well without the voting trust shippers will not benefit from the pro competitive commitments made by cn and kcs squandering the unique opportunity to enhance competition through the gateway commitment i support this new enhanced competition in the rail sector and ask others to do so as well dr huneke is former

liking or following specific topics and searched for tatmadaw the burmese name for the armed forces it filtered the search results to show pages and selected the top result a military fan page whose name translates as a gathering of military lovers older posts on this page showed sympathy for myanmar s soldiers and at least two advertised for young people to join the military but none of the newer posts since the coup violated facebook s policies however when global witness s account liked the page facebook began recommending related pages with material inciting violence false claims of interference in last year s election and support of violence against civilians file anti coup protesters march in yangon myanmar thursday feb 25 2021 facebook s recommendation algorithm amplifies military propaganda and other material that breaches the company s own policies in myanmar even though the social media giant says it s treating the situation there as an emergency following february s military coup a new report by the rights group global witness has found a month after the military seized power in myanmar and imprisoned elected leaders facebook s algorithms were still prompting

local voices like henry ford minnesota must lead opinion our economy is dependent upon respecting our past successes and challenges june 21 2021 gov tim walz s decision to adopt the vehicle emissions standards originally set by california and now adopted by 14 other states is right for minnesota s economy citizens and future our economy is dependent upon respecting our past successes and challenges but more so embracing our present and building a future that protects our environment and builds our economy like henry ford did in the early 1900s by first adopting a livable wage for his employees minnesota needs to commit to the clean cars minnesota position of supporting electric vehicles evs and the opportunities it will create for citizens dealers and the economy like ford motor company did in 2008 09 when the company stood alone amongst the three domestic automotive manufacturers not needing a federal bailout yet supported it for other automotive companies we need to support the clean cars initiative and be leaders into the future like ford did last year by being the only domestic automotive manufacturer supporting california s position and opposing the short lived federal rollback of stronger emissions standards now is the time for our state to support the clean cars initiative minnesota is a state that leads as a rural automotive dealer on the canadian border i recognize the challenges with evs but one argument that i strongly disagree with is that dealers will be swamped with unwanted evs i don t believe it we have over 50 reservations for the f 150 lightning and i have more demand for the all electric mustang mach e than i can supply consumers want to buy evs i want to sell them challenges aside evs have many advantages for consumers and dealers while it s true that upfront ev costs are more charging costs are lower than using gasoline or diesel and with significantly fewer moving parts they require less maintenance the sticker price is more than offset by all these savings the clean car standards will not substitute or ban any vehicles rather it will complement internal combustion sales along with providing more options evs are fun to drive with incredible torque even my 90 year old stepfather can t wait to get his own f 150 lightning the longer we wait the less choice consumers have and the less opportunities minnesota auto dealers will have it is highly unlikely that evs will be in stock at minnesota dealerships until we are a clean cars state those vehicles will instead go to states that have adopted clean cars programs waiting to adopt clean cars will put us at a disadvantage for receiving the highly anticipated f 150 lightning as well as all evs it would be shortsighted not to acknowledge that vehicle electrification is one of the best ways to reduce planet warming greenhouse gas emissions the younger generation is demanding this transition i realize change is hard i grew up and continue to live in a farming community of 900 people my best friends and neighbors are farmers they face change more than most farming is significantly different today than it was even five years ago without adapting to change my friends would not be farming today the automotive world is adapting to survive too manufacturers are heavily invested and committed to evs general motors will be all electric by 2035 within five years ford expects to sell over 1 million evs government is changing with the new federal leadership and inclined to adopt policies that were previously in effect prior to 2017 fourteen states have adopted low emission vehicle standards and zero emission standards aligned with california s tougher rules most importantly public opinion is changing consumers overwhelmingly support the option to purchase evs there is an argument that minnesota should pump the brakes on this but i would argue like henry ford did in the 1900s and ford did a century later we should hit the accelerator and be leading instead of following the economy supports the future of evs i am fully supportive of minnesota s efforts to increase ev sales we must move forward smartly and effectively to set up minnesota for success the minnesota reformer is an independent nonprofit news organization dedicated to keeping minnesotans informed and unearthing stories other outlets can t or won t tell

a new york times analysis found no identifiable tuna dna in subway s tuna sandwich the newspaper reported over the weekend citing tests conducted by a commercial lab the times bought 60 inches of subway tuna sandwiches from three different subway locations in los angeles a reporter for the newspaper then removed and froze the tuna and sent it to an unidentified commercial food testing lab the newspaper said it paid roughly 500 for the lab to conduct a pcr test to see if the substance had one of five different tuna species after a month the lab said it found no amplifiable tuna dna was present in the sample and so we obtained no amplification products from the dna therefore we cannot identify the species the lab said elaborating on the results a spokesperson for the lab told the times that there were two different conclusions one it s so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out we couldn t make an identification the spokesperson said or we got some and there s just nothing there that s tuna in a statement to the hill subway said that the test result indicates that dna testing is an unreliable methodology for identifying processed tuna dna testing is simply not a reliable way to identify denatured proteins like subway s tuna which was cooked before it was tested the company said the fact is subway restaurants serve 100 wild caught cooked tuna which is mixed with mayonnaise and used in freshly made sandwiches wraps and salads that are served to and enjoyed by our guests the taste and quality of our tuna make it one of subway s most popular products and these baseless accusations threaten to damage our franchisees small business owners who work tirelessly to uphold the high standards that subway sets for all of its products including its tuna the times noted that the food and drug administration identifies 15 species of nomadic saltwater fish that can be labeled tuna the test comes as subway faces a class action lawsuit alleging that its tuna sandwich is not actually made of tuna the suit was first filed in a california federal court in january in an amended complaint dated june 7 the plaintiffs allege that subway claims to sell sustainably caught skipjack and yellowfin tuna but was instead selling anything less than healthy stocks subway has been selling and continuing to sell some mixture that is deceptively and dishonestly being passed off as in line with their representations to purchasers but are not actually compliant the suit states commenting on the lawsuit subway said the claims were untrue and have absolutely no merit given the facts the lawsuit constitutes a reckless and improper attack on subway s brand and goodwill and on the livelihood of its franchisee the company said inside edition did its own test of the tuna sandwich in february in which it had a florida based lab test sandwiches from three subway locations in new york that test confirmed that tuna was in the sandwiches updated at 11 58 a m

march 3 2021 by arthur northrop this article is a recap of an interview with john hare edgefield county water and sewer authority s ecwsa administrator hare provided an overview of ecwsa s structure and operations as well as the challenges facing edgefield county in the future the article is divided into three parts part 1 operations and structure part 2 present and future challenges and part 3 ecswa s role in edgefield county s growth edgefield county water and sewer authority provides potable clean and safe drinking water to 25 000 people with 3 000 of those folks living in aiken county our number one driving factor is to protect peoples health we have 25 0000 people putting in their bodies what we are making said john hare administrator of ecwsa ecwsa is a special purpose district which means it receives no tax dollars for its water and sewage operations the only revenue ecwsa receives is from the rates charged to its customers and occasional state and federal grants part 1 ecwsa structure and operations hare explained that ecwsa draws its water from a pumping station just south of stephens creek dam on the savannah river the water from the savanna is pumped 1 5 miles to a water treatment plant on freeland drive the ecwsa draws 4 to 10 million gallons a day of raw water from the savannah river to its treatment plant each day where the water is tested and treated hare said the condition of the water in the savannah river impacts ecwsa s treatment processes when the savannah river is churned up there are more sediments from agriculture and development upriver that must be removed and treated ecwsa constantly runs tests and adjusts its chemical feed to treat the water depending on the river s conditions the raw water treatment process involves the water passing through sedimentation basins that have sand and anthracite filters that process filters out stuff normally found in river at that point chlorine gas is used to kill all the pathogens bacteria and viruses hare noted that at this time there are no wells feeding ecwsa s water supply system once the water is cleaned and drinkable it leaves treatment plant and goes into the water distribution system it is pumped from the savannah river up highway 25 to trenton where it forks off to johnston and edgefield from edgefield the water travels up highway 283 to walker road hare noted ecswa s water distribution system is wide spread and very rural ecwsa does not add fluoride to its customers water on the other side of its operations ecwsa has around 2 500 customers on its sewage system there are sewage treatment plants in johnston and edgefield the treated waste water in johnston is released in an unnamed tributary that flows to the south fork of the edisto river and the edgefield s plant s treated waste water is released in beaver dam creek the majority of sewage travels through gravity mains but there are pumping stations in the system the sewage from highway 25 and parts of the merriwether area ends up in the regional sewer system that sewage is treated at horse creek waste water treatment plant in aiken county where it is discharged into the savannah river part 2 present and future challenges hare said the challenges ecwsa faces are the same as most of the water authorities across america he explained one of the biggest challenges is the aging infrastructure of ecwsa s treatment and distribution systems hare said the treatment plants were approaching 50 years in age and there were sewer lines built in the 1920s and 30 s approaching 90 years old in the towns hare said decisions will have to be made as to whether to upgrade or build new plants in the future he also said decisions have to be made regarding increasing sewer and water capacity for the growth happening in our county hare explained the water supply cannot be figured on the average amount of water used he said water supply capacity has to be based on peak demand and not average demand hare estimates that in seven to ten years ecwsa will have to tackle some major infrastructure projects and population growth is a variable in that decision he said ecwsa hopes to begin a water systems master plan within the next 18 months hare said major projects could be funded through municipal bonds usda loans state revolving fund loans or any other sources that may be available at the time the authority also utilizes available grant funding from entities such as the south carolina rural infrastructure authority but hare noted those funds are usually limited to 500 000 hare said this time of year ecwsa averages around 3 5 million gallons per day he said in may through september that amount jumps to 6 7 million gallons a day he said one person filling up an inflatable pool washing a car or watering a garden does not impact the system but he explained that when 25 000 people do those things it stacks up quickly hare said his job at ecwsa is to try to plan for the future five to ten years down the road none of us have a crystal ball if we did it would make my job a whole lot easier mused hare hare noted that he manages the system s assets while planning for the growth happening in the county he said he has to make decisions about how far to push some of the infrastructure before replacing it another challenge ecwsa faces is getting prepared for upcoming regulations that are constantly coming from the state and federal levels down to the local level particularly from the epa environmental protection agency hare said the epa drives all the new water quality regulations hare attempts to anticipate what the regulations may be five to ten years down the road so ecwsa can meet the new standards with its facilities and treatment processes the last challenge hare shared is how to keep customers water affordable while meeting the infrastructure and regulations needs they epa dhec are constantly coming out with new compounds we have to test for and sample and eventually have to treat for said hare hare explained that cost of water to ecwsa s customers is impacted by infrastructure needs and regulations hare is convinced that in the future water will become much more valuable and will cost more than it does right now because every time a new treatment technique is required water is exponentially more expensive while the quality of water is ecwsa s primary concern hare explained that primary mission when water plants that were originally built was to provide water that would not kill people the chlorination process at the turn of the 20th century prevented viruses and bacteria once water was rid of those hare said millions of lives were saved worldwide hare said the technology is there to provide near distilled water but doesn t think most people want 500 water bills when is good good enough reflected hare hare said that question is asked worldwide and the issue is much bigger ecwsa hare said at some point decisions have to be made about the cost of water and the gains in water quality finding that balance point is always a struggle said hare part 3 ecwsa and county growth in the next few years the number of homes on ecwsa sewage system will increase by around 740 homes or over 20 three subdivisions copperfield winsor and tavern hill account for the projected increase the sewage from those subdivisions will be pumped back to highway 25 the increase will be in phases as the homes are built and then occupied hare explained that the developers hire their own engineers to design what is in each subdivision the developer has to pay all the construction costs of the infrastructure within the development in addition to hiring engineers and preparing drawings that will be acceptable by dhec at that point hare said the plans are given to ecwsa and are reviewed ecwsa provides specific feedback for needed changes and details about pumps and fittings to ensure it meets the ecwsa specifications the developers then make corrections and revisions and send the plans back to ecwsa to ensure all requirements are met hare said at that point the plans go back to dhec to get permitted all these steps are done prior to the authority providing a letter that the developer s engineer needs to submit to scdhec stating that ecwsa has the capacity and willingness to serve the subdivision after the project is completed ecwsareceives the new infrastructure for ownership operation and maintenance the developer also has to provide one year s warranty on the installed infrastructure part 4 bonus details hare discussed the weather event that took place in texas a few weeks ago he said edgefield county s last ice storm and sub freezing weather for multiple days in a row created problems for ecwsa s customers hare said his distribution staff worked around the clock helping people cut off their water because of the large number of them who had busted pipes we needed to do that to keep from hemorrhaging water explained hare hare said there were no issues with ecwsa s infrastructure during the ice storm hare said power outages affect ecwsa as bad or worse than anybody because of ecwsa s need for power for the 39 sewer pump stations that all run off electricity hare said ecwsa has back up diesel pumps and generators to try to manage and mitigate power outages he noted if you can t get fuel to the generators because of weather conditions that can cause major problems hare also said ecwsa along with various federal agencies are very aware of protentional dangers and threats to water supplies and appropriate precautions are taken to assure safe drinking water to its customers
here s what you need to know the strength of north korea s infantry remains questionable infantry weapons have long been a pillar of the north korean people s army or kpa for short the kpa that invaded south korea was largely an infantry army and despite significant mechanization in the 1970s the foundation of the army has been its infantry forces today the bulk of the kpa s 1 1 million army is infantry with approximately 200 000 light infantry and special forces after the korean war north korea followed the soviet union s lead in infantry weapons the oldest gun still in service is the kpa type 58 assault rifle a clone of the soviet ak 47 the type 58 was produced in two factories 61 and 65 located near chongjin between 1958 and 1968 the type 58 was a basic ak pattern rifle with a 30 round magazine and a rate of fire of up to 650 rounds per minute approximately 800 000 rifles were produced and while the 7 62 millimeter assault rifle is no longer in service with frontline units it allegedly still equips reserve units and militia a new rifle the type 68 was a clone of the soviet akm assault rifle and manufactured beginning in 1968 in practical terms the type 68 had few major improvements over the type 58 although it did come with a folding stock the type 68 was also extensively exported abroad to el salvadoran marxist guerrillas and across central and south america these rifles are also likely still in service with reservists and rear area units as north korea is undoubtedly still sitting on a considerable supply of 7 62 rifle ammunition the kpagf s main weapon is the type 88 assault rifle the weapon is similar to the soviet ak 74 although at least one report suggests it may be derived more from the chinese copy of the ak 74 than the original soviet weapon the weapon represents a major logistical break for the kpagf using 5 45 millimeter ammunition instead of the the 7 62 round utilized by previous rifles the type 88 may have started out in special commando units but appears to have gradually spread out into regular army units north korean watchers have spotted the type 88 using helical magazines capable of carrying more than one hundred rounds of ammunition and the rifle also formed the basis for north korea s version of the u s army s objective individual combat weapon a combination gun grenade launcher weapon equipped with an advanced gunsight north korea also maintains a small arsenal of m 16 pattern rifles several such rifles were reportedly found on the bodies of infiltrators during the 1996 gangneung incident the south korean military at one time used m 16a1 rifles and the weapon could have been used by agents and saboteurs to impersonate south korean military personnel it s not clear where these weapons came from one report suggests the rifles could have been chinese norinco cq rifles but north korea s history suggests that the weapons could have come from central or south american guerrillas or even vietnam north korea s early squad automatic weapon the type 73 was an idiosyncratic weapon based on the soviet pkm machine gun it featured a dual feed ammunition system allowing it to accept metal belted ammunition but also vertically loaded 30 round magazines similar to the czechoslovakian vz 52 or british army bren machine gun the dual feed system has always been something of a mystery as the type 73 uses different ammunition than north korean assault rifles and as such there is no commonality vertical magazines do however allow machine gunners to fire from the prone position and while belted ammo can do the same thing feeding belts can allow the machine gun to ingest debris and jam even more intriguingly the type 73 can fire rifle grenades north korea s follow on machine gun and their current squad level support firearm the type 82 was introduced in 1982 and is a more orthodox weapon the type 82 bears greater similarity to the pk pkm machine guns lacks a magazine fed option and is belt fed only north korea s light infantry and special forces are taking on increasing importance as the country s aging mechanized units starved for technology and fuel are likely becoming less relevant to the country s war plans the guns of the kpa ground forces help ensure north korean sniper airborne and marine infantry units remain operationally relevant now and into the near future whether this impoverished country with an economy smaller than panama s can arm their infantrymen as well as their american and south korean counterparts while simultaneously affording an expanding nuclear arsenal is another question kyle mizokami is a defense and national security writer based in san francisco who has appeared in the diplomat foreign policy war is boring and the daily beast in 2009 he cofounded the defense and security blog japan security watch you can follow him on twitter kylemizokami this article first appeared several years ago image reuters

adobe stock it s called the gem state for a reason idaho by far has some of the most underrated markets across the country in my opinion one of the most notable areas within the state is the boise treasure valley market which has become one of the most sought after markets for home buyers and companies across the nation not only has the boise treasure valley market experienced a dramatic increase in out of state home buyer activity many companies have expanded their operations to the market and have helped bolster an already thriving economy prior to the covid 19 pandemic the boise treasure valley market had been creating an average of approximately 13 000 new jobs each year for the prior five years once the pandemic hit the market lost a total of 25 800 jobs as of april 2020 however based on the most recent numbers released from the bureau of labor statistics bls the boise treasure valley market has experienced a net increase of 1 300 new jobs as of march the local economy appears to be healing and expanding at a rapid pace one of the other major contributors to the local economy has been the large number of household formations from out of state buyers thousands of people continue to move into the boise treasure valley market from other states bringing jobs and equity with them which is also contributing to the local economic growth and stimulating the housing market during a recent conversation with one of our builder clients they noted that roughly 50 to 60 of their new home sales were for out of state buyers and most of them are either paying cash or putting down a significant amount of money on the home according to deed record transactions approximately 40 of all home transactions in the boise treasure valley market have been purchased with cash which is up from 35 compared with this same time last year this is also slightly above the average of 37 in 2011 and 2012 as for the local housing market it can only be described as hot as can be not only are out of state buyers purchasing homes but also the local pent up demand for housing has been surging since the recession making homes in the market the hottest commodity around over the past 12 months builders have started a total of 7 446 new homes in the boise treasure valley market as of march which is a 5 increase compared with last year at this time and up 28 compared with 2019 while not quite back to the peak levels in 2006 new home starts are projected to surpass that peak in the very near future provided building materials are available to allow annual new home closings in the market have increased 12 compared with this same time last year for a total of 7 216 with the gap of starts and closings being only 5 there is a very limited supply of finished available new homes on the ground for purchase during the process of our quarterly lot by lot survey of every subdivision zonda tracks all new homes that are under construction and those that are finished and vacant otherwise known as spec homes an acceptable level of under construction inventory should range between six and nine months currently there is a 7 1 month supply of new home inventory in the boise treasure valley market both attached and detached for sale homes which is at the lower end of equilibrium one of the most important numbers we monitor is finished vacant inventory the number of finished and vacant homes in the market has decreased 53 compared with this time last year and currently is a 0 9 month supply as a reference we consider this equilibrium to range between two and a half to three months therefore the current level is extremely low while builders have tried to deliver more finished vacant homes to the market they have struggled because consumers are buying these homes as fast as possible while increasing homes sales is extremely beneficial for the overall market one of the most significant drawbacks are finished home prices currently the median price for a new home in the boise treasure valley market is 426 100 which has increased 18 4 compared with this time last year and is up 7 5 from just three months ago while local new home prices continue to increase and put the squeeze on affordability out of state buyers continue to flood into the market as our home prices are significantly lower when compared with larger metropolitan markets across the country it will be imperative for the market to embrace more multiuse housing projects where builders can offer a slightly higher dense product in order to build more attainable homes for the entry level buyers in the market while the boise treasure valley market may have some hurdles in the future there is no doubt that it remains one of the strongest markets across the country in terms of housing and economic growth the gem state continues to live up to its name and more people are finding out the secret behind this diamond in the rough market

washington federal reserve chair jerome h powell s steady as she goes piloting of the u s economy despite creeping inflation represents a bet that developments in an industry far removed from the central bank s marble headquarters will explain the post pandemic recovery if he s right the nation could be headed for a remarkable period of strong growth and rising incomes but if the fed chief has it wrong prices for everyday goods and services could jump in a way that most americans have not experienced in decades if at all sawmills and lumber yards are where powell looks to understand the snarled supply chains that have pushed up prices across the economy and sparked concern that the fed is mismanaging the recovery even as he acknowledged quickening inflation last week powell pointed to the recent roller coaster in the lumber market to explain why it will subside lumber prices rose more than 260 percent over the past year as the pandemic reshaped americans spending patterns and disrupted industrial pipelines but since early may those prices have plunged by nearly half related spike in lumber prices not helping most maine wood suppliers the abrupt turnabout offers lessons that are likely to guide policymakers as they run the economy at full throttle accepting what they regard as a temporary bout of inflation in hopes of generating more than 10 million new jobs lumber s wild gyrations show that today s hiring troubles and shipping delays reflect short term reopening kinks not a lasting shift that will push prices higher and higher our expectation is that these high inflation readings that we are seeing now will start to abate and it ll be like the lumber experience powell told reporters on wednesday prices that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like they should stop going up and at some point they in some cases should actually go down and we did see that in the case of lumber advertisement indeed lumber s recent cooling appeared to vindicate powell s easy money policies even as the government reported the sharpest 12 month rise in wholesale commodities prices since records began in 1974 former treasury secretary lawrence h summers has repeatedly warned that by keeping interest rates near zero and by buying 120 billion in bonds each month the fed is risking a repeat of the inflationary spiral that began in the late 1960s after a majority of the fed s policymaking committee said it may raise rates in 2023 sooner than first forecast summers on friday said the central bank was coming around to his view that overheating is now the main economic risk the fed has increased its inflation forecast for the next three years but the lumber market shows why powell is staying the course at least for now when the pandemic first hit sawmills furloughed workers and cut production to prepare for a punishing recession but while housing starts fell to their lowest level since the financial crisis a decade before they rebounded by summer catching sawmills with low inventories and covid thinned crews panic buying set in as consumers remodeling their houses for the work from home era rushed to avoid being caught short prices peaked may 7 at 1 686 per thousand board feet a standard measurement up from about 460 before the pandemic advertisement shutting down an industry and restarting it it s not a flip of a switch said economist dustin jalbert who heads the lumber team for fastmarkets risi a data and research firm lumber costs this year added roughly 36 000 to the price of the average single family home according to the national association of home builders that was bad news for consumers but it helped drive record profits for wood product makers and residential construction companies on thursday lennar a miami based home builder reported 831 million in second quarter net earnings along with the fattest profit margins for that period in the company s history weyerhaeuser the largest u s lumber producer reported 681 million in profit for the first three months of this year its best first quarter results since the collapse of the housing bubble the company s stock is up 47 percent over the past year rising more than four times as fast as the broader market we ve been in a great environment for lumber pricing here over the last several months it s really been a result of extraordinarily strong demand that hasn t been met by the available supply devin stockfish weyerhaeuser s ceo said at a june 9 investor conference the lumber market shows that basic economic laws are reasserting themselves amid the nation s sometimes clumsy economic reopening advertisement lumber prices fell over the past month as some potential home buyers recoiled from soaring home prices and seasonal forces took hold a return to normal life meant consumers began spending at restaurants movie theaters and ballparks rather than on home remodeling projects sawmills meanwhile boosted output as furloughed workers were lured back to their jobs by higher pay and new machinery came on line there s been a decrease in demand combined with an increase in production said paul jannke a lumber specialist with forest economic advisors in littleton mass mills are making piles of money they re spending it on de bottlenecking and investing in technology home builders also slowed construction of new homes as lumber windows appliances and other essentials remained in short supply in may the number of new homes that contractors obtained permits to build but did not begin work on rose 53 percent from the year ago level to 142 000 units according to the census bureau that was the highest figure in nearly 15 years the need to rush out and buy has lessened a bit said george staphos senior wood products analyst for bank of america merrill lynch the action in lumber markets reflects broader supply chain headaches throughout the economy the pandemic inspired economic chill was unlike a typical recession instead of an across the board slowdown the health scare prompted consumers to shift spending from dining out or going to the movies to buying laptops and televisions they could use while stuck at home millions of americans also opted to buy new homes in the suburbs or remodel the ones they already owned advertisement like the fed white house economists say the wood products market offers lessons about the future of supply chains throughout the economy lumber s recent fall from record highs is an early sign that some shortages may be short lived two economists with the council of economic advisers wrote thursday in a blog post but the volatile market illustrates the complexity of the fed s challenge in steering the post pandemic economy forecasting lumber prices requires fed economists to track sawmill expansion plans trucker staffing housing permits and the infestation of western canadian forests by ravenous pine beetles the central bank also must factor in the impact of more than 5 trillion in government spending and the aftereffects of a once in a century medical emergency this is an extraordinarily unusual time and we really don t have a template or any experience of a situation like this and so i think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data powell told reporters it s not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market about inflation about the path of policy we need to see more data we need to be a little bit patient lumber prices decline since early may signals that the worst of the price increases is over market analysts said while lumber prices have dropped significantly in recent weeks they are not likely to revert to pre pandemic levels as prices rose last year lumber producers began sketching plans to expand capacity west fraser timber north america s largest lumber manufacturer says it will invest 150 million at five of its mills in the southern united states to boost output advertisement yet wages for sawmill workers are up more than 10 percent over the past year and strong demand for new homes to make up for years of subpar construction following the housing bubble is expected to outpace supply and keep prices higher than the historical average industry executives said analysts say prices will remain elevated compared with pre pandemic marks though well below the recent peak eric cremers ceo of potlatch deltic a forest products company based in spokane wash said this month that he expects prices to settle around 800 per thousand board feet by year s end the direction points

by howard schneider and ann saphir washington reuters federal reserve chair jerome powell on tuesday reaffirmed the u s central bank s intent to encourage a broad and inclusive recovery of the job market and not to raise interest rates too quickly based only on the fear of coming inflation we will not raise interest rates pre emptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation we will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances powell said in a hearing before a u s house of representatives panel recent price increases have pushed the consumer price index to a 13 year high prompting republicans on the committee to offer charts detailing spikes in consumer items like bacon and used cars to suggest price increases are getting out of hand we have unstable employment and higher inflation said representative jim jordan an ohio republican referring to the fed s congressionally mandated goals of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices something has to give the recent high inflation readings however don t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates powell said referring to a perfect storm of rising demand for goods and services and bottlenecks in supplying them as the economy reopens from the pandemic those price pressures should ease on their own powell said in setting upcoming monetary policy the fed chief pledged that the central bank would keep its eyes focused on a broad set of labor market statistics including how different racial and other groups are faring we will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment powell told the members of the house select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis we will look at all kinds of measures that is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared markets were little changed over the course of the hearing powell s comments were not really much that we haven t heard before said michael brown a senior analyst at payments firm caxton london a sensitive pivot but the session at times a sparring match between democrats and republicans over the biden administration s economic plans hinted at the delicate line the fed must walk in coming months as it balances inflation risks with its promise to ensure the economy recovers all the jobs lost after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic until recently there was little perceived conflict between those goals yet since powell last appeared before the subcommittee in september the central bank s outlook for inflation has doubled projections released by the fed last week showed prices in 2021 are expected to increase at a 3 4 rate compared with the 1 7 projected as of last september recent job growth meanwhile has been slower than hoped some of powell s colleagues are now openly suggesting the pandemic prompted so many people to retire it may be unrealistic to think the united states can return to the pre crisis level of employment before the fed needs to tighten monetary policy that is a stance counter to powell s own focus on restoring the economy to the conditions of early 2020 and to that of the subcommittee s influential democratic chairman representative james clyburn of south carolina who pushed powell on tuesday to ensure a fair and equitable jobs recovery millions of americans are depending on the fed to continue to support the economy s recovery said clyburn who has close ties to president joe biden biden must decide in coming weeks whether to reappoint powell to a second four year term in the closing minutes of the hearing the fed chair received a glowing review from another ranking democrat house financial services committee chair maxine waters of california waters noted that powell was ready to think big about policy as the pandemic took hold and said she wanted to thank him not only for his leadership but his creativity still a rapidly improving economic landscape is beginning to reshape views at the fed about when to reduce some of those pandemic efforts as the crisis recedes at their meeting last week fed officials projected they may raise interest rates as soon as 2023 perhaps a year earlier than anticipated and powell said during a news conference that the central bank was beginning talks about when to pare down its 120 billion in monthly purchases of government bonds and securities used to support the recovery powell told reporters the economy is still a ways off from the progress in rehiring that the fed has said it wants to see before making any changes a cue that the timing of an actual policy shift remains up in the air but the change in tone and projections surprised markets which are now keenly watching to see if the fed is hedging its job market promises market trading in inflation protected and other securities shows investors betting the fed will raise rates even faster than policymakers project a potential loss of faith in the central bank s willingness to run a hot

across the globe as e commerce accelerated ds smith also makes much of the cardboard packaging you find on supermarket shelves so sales for this channel also held strong through the crisis but ds smith was boxed in by higher costs from making the workplace covid 19 secure to the rising cost of materials unfortunately the group wasn t able to recoup these expenses in the first half and that dented overall profits significantly while this wasn t unexpected it s understandably disappointing the market thought ds smith would weather the storm a bit better 12 27pm investors await fed chair s

cbi factory survey as well as growing pricing pressures uk manufacturing output volumes in the three months to june grew at the fastest pace on record since 1975 according to the latest monthly cbi

federal reserve chair jerome powell which is hardly surprising given that the fed s slightly more hawkish view on interest rates last week combined with subsequent comments from various members of the central bank sent markets into a tizzy powell s initial comments have already been released and appear more dovish neil wilson at markets com said in prepared remarks ahead of his congressional testimony today fed chair jay powell reiterated that the fed is not unduly concerned that hot inflation readings are here to stay transitory supply effects abate inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal he says his testimony from 7pm bst is likely to be market moving particularly if he says anything considered as hawkish we will want to see whether he seeks to row back on

pretty much in line with expectations and down 19 4bn on a year ago but it was still the second highest may figure on record as the country continues to deal with the finance burden of covid 19 danni hewson aj bell financial analyst said the pandemic has left big scars on the nation s finances and reopening is a salve but one that needs careful application too much too soon and those inflation worries that have caused so much concern will come to bear not enough too slow or if variants demand another reverse then there will be difficult conversations about spend vs taxation but today feel

surprised by the market reaction after a weekend spent mulling it over and some slightly dovish comments from the new york fed s john williams said market analyst jeffrey halley at oanda if there is one thing the last 15 months has taught us it is the power of the buy the dip strategy as central banks continue pouring free money into the world s financial system last night was a classic case in point as the great post fomc bullard unwind of the global reflation trade abruptly halted and reversed he said the us dollar fell overnight stocks notably the unloved s p and dow jones rallied gold picked up and the us yield curve steepened as yields on the long dated bonds rose once again so has the global reflation trade unwind run its course we don t really know is inflation transitory or

have you been eyeing h r reit tsx hr un and watching it recover from the pandemic it s still a decent value pick for income and total returns here s why buy this canadian reit for income and more income in the future the pandemic triggered dividend cuts in several real estate investment trusts reits including american hotel income properties and h r reit tsx hr un american hotel eliminated its entire dividend it wasn t as bad at h r reit which cut its cash distribution by half last year the reit is still good for income a solid dividend h r reit s first quarter results reveal a very safe dividend its funds from operations ffo payout ratio was 43 5 much lower than the 76 5 from a year ago ffo fell 12 year over year on a per unit basis ffo fell 11 this suggests that management prudently cut its cash distribution much more than needed providing more financial flexibility for the diversified reit since h r reit s payout ratio is so low investors can expect its cash distribution to be at least partially restored down the road it has done this before during the global financial crisis around 2009 the reit cut its cash distribution only to start restoring it by 2010 currently h r reit yields 4 2 however if it were to restore its cash distribution to the pre pandemic levels with a payout ratio of say 76 5 we re looking at a yield on cost of more than 7 4 when will h r reit start restoring its dividend we can only take an educated guess on when h r reit will start restoring its dividend first and foremost management focuses on keeping the company s financial position strong and strategically positioning its real estate portfolio from 2016 to 2019 the reit s debt to total assets was in the 44 range that ratio increased to about 48 last year due primarily to fair value adjustments to certain office and retail properties totaling 1 2 billion importantly h r reit has relatively high debt repayments scheduled for this year and next year specifically about 35 of its debt repayment totaling 2 06 billion is due through 2022 another 24 totaling nearly 1 4 billion is due from 2023 through 2024 that totals about 59 of its debt repayment about 60 of the debt to be repaid over these four years is mortgage payments totaling nearly 2 1 billion which should free up some room on the balance sheet for potentially more acquisitions moreover the company hasn t remained idle in may management noted that in the past year we have completed substantial dispositions and acquisitions completed successful developments and advanced future development projects which will commence in 2021 and 2022 and expect to complete further property dispositions in the remainder of 2021 these activities have laid the foundation for more significant strategic changes which we hope to provide more details of in coming months to be conservative my educated guess is that h r reit could begin restoring its cash distribution by 2023 should you buy h r reit h r reit s office and retail assets make up 38 and 31 respectively of its portfolio s fair value as of q1 2021 that s close to 70 of the portfolio however they provide higher cap rates than its residential and industrial portfolios its office portfolio also has an average remaining lease term of about 12 years with a recent occupancy of 99 7 similarly its retail portfolio has an average remaining lease term of about 6 5 years with a recent occupancy of 90 3 its residential and industrial portfolios remain resilient during this testing time the north american economy is recovering covid 19 vaccine rollouts are helping on that matter h r reit is also a recovering story with about 28 upside potential to return to its normalized levels if you re looking for a value name in this expensive market you can consider h r reit which is still depressed from pre pandemic levels and offers a safe 4 2 yield that can go higher from here
