resume their decline it would be a big headwind market rally analysis the stock market rally retreated for a second straight session though the damage was rather limited the 10 year treasury yield had a big gain but is only recouping a portion of its recent slide the fed s early warning on taper talk and rate hikes gives the market rally plenty of time to digest the news and move forward as of wednesday s close the major indexes held up ok though the dow jones is now below its 50 day line financials did well understandably but there were a few other breakouts including generac gnrc and occidental petroleum oxy sometimes there s a day two reaction to fed meetings and that could be positive or negative ultimately if the stock market rally can t handle a 10 year treasury yield above 1 5 and shield your eyes moving toward 2 amid a booming economy then this isn t much of a rally what to do now look for the stock market rally to decisively break out above old highs especially on the s p 500 and nasdaq doing so would signal real strength and a green light to step up exposure investors may want to rethink holdings amid ongoing rotation homebuilders were slumping even as interest rates were falling rising treasury yields put further pressure on that sector miners continue to struggle while steelmakers are trying to fight financials like goldman stock are flashing some buy

driving home from dinner with a friend the other evening sober and well within the 20mph speed limit i was shocked to find a vehicle undertaking me at speed i thought e scooters were not capable of surpassing 15 5mph but this one was clearly going considerably faster than me and gave me a terrible shock as it wobbled by did the culprit have lights no was he wearing a helmet absolutely not the government is currently trialling e scooters in 30 cities and towns across the uk including bournemouth liverpool and several london boroughs but this looked privately owned which is against the law souped up and frankly it scared me to death nor should he have been riding it at all outside certain permitted parts of the capital i slowed down terrified that if he came off into the road in front of me i could be responsible for his serious injury and possibly demise it s not the first time i ve had an encounter with one of these deathtraps the other occasion was far more scary because i had no personal protection from my car the government is currently trialling e scooters in 30 cities and towns across the uk including bournemouth liverpool and london pictured london s walking and cycling commissioner will norman i d been walking the dogs in the park the exit takes you directly onto a wide pavement alongside a busy road i emerged from the park and bang a teenage boy on an e scooter crashed into me i managed to keep my footing just and hung onto the dog leads they barked i screamed in pain shouting what on earth are you doing on the pavement he shouted back f off you old bag and scooted off into the sunset could i trace him and report him no there was no way of identifying him or his vehicle apart from blue jeans black sweatshirt and a cap the uniform of any teenager i was bruised and shaken but it could have been much worse a 65 year old film actress lisa banes died earlier this week ten days after being mowed down by an e scooter in new york the first electric scooter death in the uk happened in july 2019 emily hartridge a tv presenter and youtube star was killed when she collided with a lorry in london an itv investigation found hundreds of injuries have been caused by this new mode of transport as well as evidence of dangerous driving anti social behaviour drunkenness while riding and plenty of complaints about them from passers by i m with nick freeman the road traffic lawyer known as mr loophole for his talent for getting celebrities off driving offences who has launched a parliamentary petition for greater control of e scooters and bicycles he s right when he points to the risks faced by cyclists and scooters and the threat they present to other road users and pedestrians jenni murray pictured said cyclists and scooters should be licensed and display a number just as a car or lorry must helmets should be required together with effective lighting at night cyclists and scooters should be licensed and display a number just as a car or lorry must they should be fined for breaching the highway code running red lights is commonly observed and have their licences taken away for riding drunk none of this can happen if we can t find them so a registration number is essential prominently displayed of course there are obedient cyclists just as i m sure there are level headed e scooter users cycling is good for the rider and for the reduction of pollution as the new scooters are said to be but there are lots of us using the roads as fear of public transport continues during the pandemic and surely it s only just that we all share the same rules meanwhile consideration for the pedestrian so often neglected in concerns about road safety must not be forgotten the pavement is for us and only us i ve been seriously thinking it ll be us who need a crash helmet for our walks if the current climate persists as a survivor of breast cancer i m horrified at the number of women an estimated 10 000 who won t have had the treatment they need during the pandemic i understand the fear of going for a mammogram or to see a gp i was frightened in march last year when i was called for mine because there was talk of a new killer virus but i went don t be put off a huge backlog needs to be cleared the nhs is doing its best don t delay i m clear for 15 years believe me it s safe and it s worth it too right you should say sorry giovanna jenni said giovanna fletcher and her husband tom pictured were right to pay back the taxpayers money from claiming furlough to pay an employee how interesting that giovanna fletcher author and winner of i m a celebrity and her musician husband tom from the boyband mcfly worth around 8 million between them should suddenly think they made a huge error of judgment and a mistake when they claimed thousands from the government s furlough scheme to pay an employee at the start of the pandemic they have now done the right thing and paid the taxpayers money back but was it only nosy questions asked on social media that prompted them to come clean after such a long time they wrote on instagram we should have thought more about the situation and funded it ourselves too right they should hurrah for birth of pelvic floor clinics for far too long millions of women have been afraid or ashamed to admit the number of times they ve been taken short and couldn t find a ladies anywhere urinary incontinence which affects seven million of us in the uk young and old commonly as a result of childbirth is finally to be taken seriously by the nhs there are to be special clinics for new mothers which will eventually be open to all of us to strengthen the pelvic floor just remember the advice of physio and comedian elaine miller pull up for ten secs then ten quick flicks three times

married at age 16 with a private member s bill stock image having married at 21 and realised i was too young i ve always thought it ridiculous to consider 16 old enough to take on such responsibility the former home secretary sajid javid hopes to end the practice with a private member s bill to be introduced next week it would raise the age to 18 clearly some 16 year old unions have succeeded where the couple and the parents have been willing but 16 is still childhood and across the world far too many girls are forced or coerced into marriage domestic servitude and no education at 18 a girl is old enough to vote and make her own choice under less pressure no matter where she lives

our traditional track record of delivering quality and value across all of our well developed trade channels strong operating performance sales for the year ended march 31 2021 increased 2 8 to 393 0 million compared to the prior year due to the covid 19 pandemic consumer purchasing patterns changed resulting in an increase in sales through the company s new e commerce platform at provincial liquor stores and other retail channels partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in hospitality and licensee sales due to covid 19 closures and lower duty free export sales due to restricted travel when the pandemic was announced in march 2020 the company saw an increase in sales as a result of higher consumer purchases due to uncertainty around trade channels for alcoholic beverages remaining open furthermore given the pandemic was not announced until march 2020 it had minimal impact on the company s sales channels during fiscal 2020 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 sales in hospitality and licensee channels decreased due to covid 19 closures and duty free export sales decreased due to restricted travel when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales from the company s new e commerce platform at provincial liquor stores and other retail channels as a result of these factors sales for the three months ended march 31 2021 declined to 79 1 million from 82 1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 management believes the diversified nature of its well established network of trade channels will generate a return to sustained sales growth as the pandemic eases gross margin as a percentage of sales was 35 5 and 39 8 for the three months and year ended march 31 2021 respectively compared to 43 3 and 43 5 in the prior year gross margin in fiscal 2021 has declined as a result of higher imported wine costs an increase in consumption of lower margin products revenue declines in higher margin trade channels increased distribution costs resulting from the new e commerce platform and increased co packing costs related to the company s growing refreshment beverage categories the company expects margins to improve in post covid 19 periods selling and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year due to a deliberate effort to conserve cash resources by temporarily reducing advertising and promotional spending and staffing levels during the covid 19 pandemic as a percentage of sales selling and administrative expenses were reduced to 23 8 compared to 27 4 in the prior year going forward as the pandemic eases and activity in the hospitality and licensee channels increases and the company invests in growth opportunities selling and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of sales compared to the fiscal year ended 2021 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the company began to increase staffing and marketing expenses in preparation for the return to more normal markets as the impact of the covid 19 pandemic eases as these expenses were incurred before the majority of government mandated closures were lifted the company is expecting selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to decrease in future quarters when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 earnings before interest amortization net unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments gain on debt modification and deferred financing fees other income expenses and income taxes ebita for the three months and year ended

the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it may act sooner than previously planned to start dialing back the low interest rate policies that have helped fuel a swift rebound from the pandemic recession but have also coincided with rising inflation the fed s policymakers forecast that they would raise their benchmark short term rate which influences many consumer and business loans twice by late 2023 they had previously estimated that no rate hike would occur before 2024 in a statement after its latest policy meeting the fed also said it expects the pandemic to have a diminishing effect on the economy as vaccinations increase thereby allowing for more growth progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states it said amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened related us housing market booms as buyers enter bidding wars amid low supply taken as a whole the fed s latest policy statement reflected its recognition that the economy and inflation pressures have gained momentum in the wake of the recession much faster than expected thanks in part to the pace of vaccinations accordingly the central bank raised its forecast for inflation to 3 4 by the end of this year from 2 4 in its previous projection in march yet the officials foresee price increases remaining tame in the following two years that outlook reflects chair jerome powell s view that the current inflation spikes stem mainly from supply shortages and other temporary effects of the economy s swift reopening from the pandemic fed officials expect the economy to grow 7 this year which would be the fastest calendar year expansion since 1984 it projects though that growth will slow after that to 3 3 in 2022 and 2 4 in 2023 soon after the fed issued its statement wednesday u s stocks fell further from their record highs and bond yields rose the yield on the 10 year treasury note rose from 1 48 to 1 54 in addition to having pegged its key rate near zero since march of last year the fed has been buying 120 billion a month in treasury and mortgage bonds to try to hold down longer term rates to encourage borrowing and spending related mortgage interest rates fall below 3 for first time in 2 weeks the fed officials are widely believed to have begun discussing a reduction in those monthly bond purchases at the policy meeting that ended wednesday a first step in pulling back on its efforts to stimulate the economy there was no mention of paring those bond purchases in the written statement the fed issued after the meeting the fed is grappling with a dilemma inflation is rising much faster than it had projected earlier this year and america s increasingly vaccinated consumers are now comfortable venturing away from home to travel go to restaurants and movie theaters and attend sporting events solid consumer spending is accelerating economic growth and manufacturing and housing have significantly strengthened yet hiring hasn t picked up as much as expected monthly job growth has remained below the 1 million a month level that powell had said in april he would like to see though employers are clearly interested in hiring more having posted a record number of available jobs since december the fed has said it wants to see substantial further progress toward its goals of full employment and inflation modestly above 2 before it would begin tapering its bond purchases with inflation having spiked in the past two months the fed is under rising pressure to consider slowing those bond purchases but with the unemployment rate at a relatively high 5 8 and the economy still 7 6 million jobs short of its pre pandemic level powell and many other fed policymakers have suggested in recent weeks that the economy is still far from achieving that progress economists generally expect the fed to continue discussing tapering its bond purchases and then by late august or september to outline specifically how and when it would begin that would set the stage for a reduction in bond purchases to actually begin near the end of this year or in early 2022 last week the government reported that inflation jumped to 5 in may compared with a year earlier the largest 12 month spike since 2008 the increase was driven partly by a huge rise in used car prices which have soared as shortages of semiconductors have slowed vehicle production sharply higher prices for car rentals airline tickets and hotel rooms were also major factors reflecting pent up demand as consumers shift away from the large goods purchases many of them had made while stuck at home to spending on services prices for such services which had tumbled at the outset of the covid 19 outbreak are now regaining pre pandemic levels with more people gradually returning to work in person the reopening of the economy has also forced up prices for clothing yet such price increases may not last another key consideration for the fed is whether inflation persists long enough to affect the public s behavior if americans begin to expect price increases those expectations can trigger a self fulfilling cycle as workers demand higher wages which in turn can lead their employers to keep raising prices to offset their higher labor costs so far bond yields and consumer surveys suggest that while higher inflation is expected in the short term investors and most of the public expect only modest price gains in the long run powell has long maintained that the public s perceptions of future inflation evolve only slowly
article the federal reserve s federal open markets committee fomc held its latest meeting this week announcing wednesday that it would hold the federal funds rate at the targeted 0 to 0 25 range and raised its inflation outlook more members also projected we will see interest rate increases in 2023 or perhaps as soon as 2022 while this doesn t mean interest rates will be 0 on your home loan student loan personal loan or any other line of credit it could cause interest rates to remain near record lows the federal funds rate does not match or control market interest rates but in general interest rates are indirectly affected and will follow the direction of the federal funds rate the federal reserve s effect on mortgage rates what to know the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 over the longer run with inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 for some time so that inflation averages 2 over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 the fomc said in a statement the committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved over the past year mortgage refinances boomed as homeowners sought to capitalize on today s low refinance rates many chose to refinance their mortgage loans in order to save on their monthly mortgage payments after mortgage rates plummeted in 2020 and the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate to stimulate the economy if you are interested in seeing how much you could save on your monthly mortgage payments with lower mortgage rates check out credible to compare rates and mortgage lenders the federal reserve s effect on student loans what to know interest rates could remain low for a while too in march 14 of the 18 fed members said they don t expect to increase interest rates through 2022 while 11 members said they don t expect to see rates move through 2023 now however seven voting members projected there could be an interest rate increase in 2022 and just five said rates will remain the same through 2023 the money markets are also are becoming increasingly confident that we will see an interest rate hike by the end of next year if you want to save money before interest rates increase consider a private student loan refinance to improve your personal finances with a lower refinance rate check out credible to see a rates table and compare multiple lenders at once fixed rate student loan refinancing rates drop to new record low the economy see could rates move due to some volatility in the near future as it copes with rising inflation and other factors that economists say will be short term expect markets to get much choppier in the months ahead as investors wrestle with the pace of job growth higher inflation and the fed s evolving view on tapering bond purchases bankrate chief financial analyst greg mcbride said the big picture is that the economy is roaring back corporate earnings are roaring back and consumers are poised to spend all things that portend well for the stock market despite near term volatility the economy is improving as personal finances improve as well and that is expected to continue over the next few years treasury secretary janet yellen recently projected the economy could reach full employment by 2022 she also said interest rates may need to rise soon to combat inflation however raising doubt to the view that today s inflation surges are a temporary result of the growing economy with refinance rates at record lows mortgage refinances and student loan refinances have surged alongside new home loans and personal loans americans also used stimulus money to pay down credit cards and saw improved credit scores causing inflation to increase if you are interested in seeing what kind of interest rate you could get on a personal loan before rates go up contact credible to see options from multiple lenders and get pre approved in minutes janet yellen interest rates may need to rise to ensure economy doesn t overheat the federal reserve is keeping interest rates where they are for now although the need for future rate hikes are increasingly being debated if you want to see what interest rate you could get on a mortgage student loan personal loan or other line of credit contact credible to get in touch with a loan expert compare rates and get your questions answered

years of my high school experience very quickly i began to spend more time at my local ag barns than i did in my own living room the hard work and responsibility that i developed from showing livestock have developed me for my future and built a strong work ethic that i can continue to build upon for years to come when asked what it meant to wear the ffa jacket and serve as a representative of the texas ffa association day noted how his understanding of the iconic symbol has developed i never understood what it meant to wear the corduroy jacket of the ffa noted day what may appear to some as an outdated and uncomfortable jacket has become a symbol of opportunity and growth for me i m proud to wear this jacket and serve as a representative for the greatest youth organization in the lone star state to see 10 000 members all wearing these symbols of our organization at state convention is truly powerful and i m thankful to have been a part of it tanner roberts post high school plan differs greatly from day s though ffa has also helped build skills necessary in his field of study my future plans include attending blinn and majoring in nursing stated roberts i will earn my bachelor of science in nursing and work as a registered nurse rn for a few years before returning to school to earn my doctor of nursing science degree and achieve my ultimate goal of being a nurse practitioner roberts explained his experience with ffa and how the organization is a lot more than what many might initially think from other people s perspective many do not know what the ffa is other than stock shows said roberts every time we were doing anything in the community and we had our jackets on i would always have people come to me and ask what animal do you show these people had no clue that the ffa had anything else to offer the ffa and agriculture in general are much more than farmers and ranchers there are people from every aspect of life that work in agriculture and this is shown in the ffa the ffa has more than just stock shows and livestock judging there are also business events entomology wool judging etc take me for example i am going into nursing after high school if i told someone i was in hosa future health professionals and ffa in high school most people would be surprised if i told them that the ffa helped me more the ffa is not just about agriculture it helps develop skills that will help anyone no matter what aspect of life they come from roberts also shared what he thinks might improve the image of agricultural education and faa in schools i believe that the organization is great but there is always room for improvement noted roberts i feel that the organization is largely misunderstood in many people s minds the first thought is i m not a farmer or a rancher so why would i join the ffa so the first thing that should be done is to make the ffa seem more attractive to people outside of just agriculture the point of the organization is to learn about agriculture and appreciate it which will cause a lot of people to become inspired and pursue a job in the agriculture sector but it should not be the goal the goal of the ffa should be to make better doctors lawyers teachers etc scholarships like this one are a great way to attract these people to the ffa and i am confident that if people get involved in the ffa then the organization will get them to stay bhs ffa advisor and ag science teacher chelsea wilson congratulated day and roberts on their accomplishments mr wilson myself and the brownwood ffa are very proud of the young men hunter and tanner have become said wilson we are excited about their future endeavors and wish them the best of luck

premium pay affordable housing tns mobile ala mayor sandy stimpson on tuesday urged the city to copy birmingham and give a 5 000 bonus to every full time city employee and 2 500 to part time workers stimpson says the money would come from federal relief for covid 19 the mobile city council could vote on the plan sometime after june 29 birmingham city leaders have already endorsed their plan and the bonus checks are expected to go out to 3 500 full time employees this month mobile and birmingham are among the first two cities in alabama to pitch 5 000 bonuses to employees who worked through the coronavirus pandemic last year they are also the only two alabama cities with city elections scheduled for august 24 officials in both cities say that bonuses are acceptable uses for the federal money approved in march through the american rescue plan arp act and officials say they should not be viewed as a one time effort to bolster political points ahead of crucial elections those kind of questions come but this had to with the opportunity in funding from the federal government mobile mayor sandy stimpson said tuesday after his administration rolled out a proposal for 58 2 million the city is getting in the next two years from the federal relief plan if you look at how the federal act came out and how the money should be mandated for use there is a huge focus on employees it was pretty easy to say hey let s give the employees a bonus the bonuses are part of one of the uses the rescue act allows in the form of premium pay for essential workers in mobile 5 000 will be provided to 2 000 employees costing 10 million total an additional 2 500 will be doled out 200 part time employees costing an additional 500 000 birmingham s 16 8 million plan endorsed by its city council earlier this month provided 5 000 bonuses to 3 500 employees with about 1 100 of them in the birmingham police department an additional 2 500 went to part time workers the money is coming from 148 8 million the city is receiving from the rescue act representing the highest allotment to a city in alabama mobile s allocation is the second most followed by montgomery at 41 6 million and huntsville at 34 4 million neither montgomery nor huntsville have unveiled plans for how they plan to spend their money which cannot be used to make up loss revenues from a tax cut and cannot be used to cover pension shortfalls the money also cannot be used for routine city street repairs though allocations can go toward water and sewer infrastructure needs city officials say they hopes to utilize covid 19 grant money funneled through the state for water and sewer upgrades the u s treasury department determined the allocations to each city based on the typical formula to fund the annual community development block grant cdbg program a city s population size housing stock age and poverty rates all play in determining how much in cdbg money a city gets each year stimpson said the city looked at what birmingham was doing and realized that maybe that was the threshold regarding the bonuses few other alabama cities have utilized the money for bonuses though prattville s council recently dedicated 1 37 million to provide a 4 000 one time bonus to 340 full time employees and 2 000 to five part time workers according to the montgomery advertiser mobile unlike some other cities in alabama did not authorize hazard pay or any other special compensation programs last year as the covid 19 pandemic was at its height montgomery city and county officials for instance utilized a portion of their coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act money to give an extra 2 50 per hour for qualifying workers via hazard pay the extra compensation went to first responders and other emergency workers during the last half of the year many other cities have given some type of employee incentive or bonus over the covid period of time stimpson said we felt it was the best opportunity we had to use federal funds in order to do something for the employees he added you know they worked diligently many did not take a day off work during that period of time it s a great use of the money aside from the bonuses mobile s plan for utilizing its federal allocation places a heavy emphasis on providing affordable housing the highlight of that plan includes 8 million for the rehabilitation of the former gayfers department store in downtown mobile into a 94 unit affordable housing complex the building which was first constructed in 1905 last operated as a department store in 1985 it has largely sat unused ever since one of the things we ve known for several years is affordable housing is the biggest challenge that we ve had said stimpson so much of it is encumbered by red tape through the u s department of housing and urban development department and the mobile housing authority it s a huge challenge he added the gayfers project specifically is something we talked about with a private developer for the past three to four years what we have here is a huge building that has been vacant for almost 40 years that i almost impossible to renovate economically there has to be an incentive to do that stimpson said he envisions commercial businesses on the building s bottom floor that faces historic bienville square the city last fall compared the renovation of the building to the pizitz building in downtown birmingham which was renovated into a 143 apartment unit atop a bustling food halls the project has the potential to not only increase housing options in downtown mobile but also give life to a prominent historic building said stephen mcnair of mcnair historic preservation in mobile the exterior will be preserved in accordance with the historic standards and the interior will be designed to reconfigure the gayfers layout into residential units the city s other plans for the money include the development of 20 owner occupied homes in midtown mobile near memorial park on houston street the two year project will include the acquisition and demolition of existing properties to make room for the new development an additional 16 million for affordable rental housing in the maysville community according to jamey roberts the city s senior director of neighborhood development the project will involve a newly constructed apartment complex near rv taylor plaza is located that consists of 40 to 50 units the city is currently looking for the right location for the project a 1 million additional to assist low to moderate income homeowners with replacing damaged roofs from recent hurricanes the city plans to spend 13 8 million in the next two years on addressing negative economic impacts from the pandemic the money will go toward bolstering mobile s rental and small business assistance programs also the city will utilize 4 million to assist homeowners with down payment assistance another 1 4 million will be utilized on marketing efforts to bolster tourism which was a hard hit sector during the pandemic another 3 million will be spent to boost the city s broadband network to connect underserved areas of the city mobile city councilman fred richardson said he would like to see community centers and public parks connected while stimpson said the administration will consider other areas of the city as well

berlin ap german vaccine maker curevac said wednesday that interim data from late stage testing of its coronavirus shot show a comparatively low effectiveness in protecting people against covid 19 the results appear to be a significant setback for curevac s efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine and the company s stock value tumbled in after hours trading while not all the data from its trial involving 40 000 participants in latin america and europe have been assessed yet the company said interim results show the vaccine has an efficacy of 47 against covid 19 disease of any severity this did not meet what the company said were its prespecified statistical success criteria though it didn t state what those were the world health organization has said vaccines with an efficacy above 50 are worth using though many of those already approved have a far higher rate curevac said that the study was hampered by the broad range of variants found among the covid 19 cases reviewed in the trial and that final results may still change while we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging its chief executive franz werner haas was quoted as saying haas said curevac would continue to work on a final analysis and the overall vaccine efficacy may change the company said it has sent the data to the european medicines agency which is conducting a rolling revue of the vaccine the study is continuing to the final analysis and the totality of the data will be assessed for the most appropriate regulatory pathway curevac said outside experts called the data so far disappointing but cautioned against comparing it directly with other shots already authorized for use deborah fuller a professor of microbiology and vaccine specialist at the university of washington school of medicine said curevac was dealing with quite a different environment than some of its rivals who had tested their shots when the original variant was still dominant curevac s trials took place in 10 different countries she noted the more countries you re testing in the more variants you have to test against another issue could be the mrna technology used in the curevac shot which is slightly different to that employed in the biontech pfizer and moderna vaccines said mark slifka a professor of microbiology and immunology at oregon health and science university curevac uses unmodified mrna which may trigger a different immune response in the body that affects the efficacy he said it could be the variants it could be the type of mrna or it could be a combination of all of the above said slifka haas the chief executive said the large number of variants curevac encountered in its trial with only a single case of covid 19 attributable to the original variant underlines the importance of developing next generation vaccines as new virus variants continue to emerge ___ follow all of ap s pandemic coverage at and copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
monkeybusinessimages istock new york one year after the murder of george floyd spotlighted issues of systemic racism in the u s a new study found corporate america has made great leaps to increase diversity in boardrooms of the 456 new independent directors added to the boardrooms of companies listed on the s p 500 this past year nearly three quarters 72 were either women or people of color according to an analysis released wednesday by spencer stuart an executive recruiting and leadership consulting firm that has been collecting data on board diversity for over 30 years broken down further a record 47 of new independent directors were black asian or latinx compared to 22 the prior year and 14 a decade ago the study found the data means major companies tripled the number of new directors who are black comprising 33 of new directors compared to 11 last year and doubled the number who are latinx making up 7 of new directors compared to 3 last year a third of the new independent directors are black or african american and that s three times what it was last year julie daum the north american board practice leader for spencer stuart told abc news we ve been collecting this data for a long time and we ve never seen a jump like that new asian representation in boardrooms fell slightly declining from 8 to 7 the number of new female directors being added to boards dropped to 43 from 47 the previous year despite the modest diversity gains over the past year however the data still indicates that corporate boardrooms remain largely white and male daum said most companies tend to start looking for new directors in september noting that floyd s murder and last summer s black lives matter protests likely loomed large over that decision making process i think that a lot of boards and management teams were very thoughtful about the issue and recognized that perhaps their board wasn t as diverse as it should be that it didn t represent their consumers that it didn t represent their employee base and that this was an issue that was very important to everybody daum said when employees looked up in the company they did not see anyone who looked like them and they were starting to speak out about it she added another aspect of this year s data that was different from years past is that companies are disclosing the ethnicity of their directors daum said in the past it was really hard for us to do this data collection because people didn t really report it she said adding that firms are coming forward and saying either what percentage of their board is diverse or going director by director and naming who s diverse there has been renewed pressure over the past year for companies to disclose their diversity statistics especially in boardrooms and at the upper levels of management last december nasdaq proposed a requirement that all companies listed on its stock exchange publicly disclose the diversity statistics of board directors also late last year california passed a law that requires publicly traded companies headquartered in the state to have at least one board member from an underrepresented community dozens of companies separately pledged to add a black director to their boards through an initiative dubbed the board challenge there have been a lot of studies done about the importance of diversity and how diverse groups make better decisions daum said she thinks this is a big part of what people are thinking about when recruiting new board members they want their management team and they want their board to be a group of people who are qualified and really working hard to make good decisions she said copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

the fountain events in south bend allow the opportunity for food truck operators to reach customers on a more consistent basis but as a side effect of the pandemic renting out food trucks for special private events have become even more popular several area food truck operators say they ve gotten many calls from couples who want tacos or pizza for their wedding and companies who want to entice employees to work from the office and so are hosting special lunch events businesses like barnes and thornburg have taken it a step further planned to occur every two weeks the law office at 201 s main st in downtown south bend will host a food truck philanthropy event where a food truck will park in front of the new building and a portion of the proceeds will go to a non profit last thursday

restaurants bars and eateries offer outdoor seating when we moved into the new building we really wanted to use the new location to connect with our community and now that things are opening up and the pandemic caused such a negative impact on nonprofits we thought how could we try to get our downtown neighbors together and do some good said amy kintz marketing service manager with barnes and thornburg who spearheaded the event then i had the idea to get some food trucks down here as a way to support a lot of our local food truck vendors and give back kintz said the charity and food truck option will rotate frequently with the food truck business ultimately deciding how much of the proceeds to donate to the nonprofit kintz hopes to continue the event through the fall with the next event to be on june 24 with real grille and benefiting real services but with the increased demand many area food trucks are already booked through the summer and the national staffing issue also has

focus on staffing its restaurants first we have just put it on pause and to take care of the restaurants right now he said things are looking better in the restaurants but food trucks are a different

middlebury started his food truck three years ago and offers large pizza by the slice salads and for special occasions pasta rulli said that while his brick and mortar restaurant currently struggles

the back preparing pizzas and his grandsons taking orders rulli said he s noticed an uptick in demand for special events and says he takes calls and orders on an almost daily basis and plans to

the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it may act sooner than previously planned to start dialing back the low interest rate policies that have helped fuel a swift rebound from the pandemic recession but have also coincided with rising inflation the fed s policymakers forecast that they would raise their benchmark short term rate which influences many consumer and business loans twice by late 2023 they had previously estimated that no rate hike would occur before 2024 in a statement after its latest policy meeting the fed also said it expects the pandemic to have a diminishing effect on the economy as vaccinations increase thereby allowing for more growth progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states it said amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened related us housing market booms as buyers enter bidding wars amid low supply taken as a whole the fed s latest policy statement reflected its recognition that the economy and inflation pressures have gained momentum in the wake of the recession much faster than expected thanks in part to the pace of vaccinations accordingly the central bank raised its forecast for inflation to 3 4 by the end of this year from 2 4 in its previous projection in march yet the officials foresee price increases remaining tame in the following two years that outlook reflects chair jerome powell s view that the current inflation spikes stem mainly from supply shortages and other temporary effects of the economy s swift reopening from the pandemic fed officials expect the economy to grow 7 this year which would be the fastest calendar year expansion since 1984 it projects though that growth will slow after that to 3 3 in 2022 and 2 4 in 2023 soon after the fed issued its statement wednesday u s stocks fell further from their record highs and bond yields rose the yield on the 10 year treasury note rose from 1 48 to 1 54 in addition to having pegged its key rate near zero since march of last year the fed has been buying 120 billion a month in treasury and mortgage bonds to try to hold down longer term rates to encourage borrowing and spending related mortgage interest rates fall below 3 for first time in 2 weeks the fed officials are widely believed to have begun discussing a reduction in those monthly bond purchases at the policy meeting that ended wednesday a first step in pulling back on its efforts to stimulate the economy there was no mention of paring those bond purchases in the written statement the fed issued after the meeting the fed is grappling with a dilemma inflation is rising much faster than it had projected earlier this year and america s increasingly vaccinated consumers are now comfortable venturing away from home to travel go to restaurants and movie theaters and attend sporting events solid consumer spending is accelerating economic growth and manufacturing and housing have significantly strengthened yet hiring hasn t picked up as much as expected monthly job growth has remained below the 1 million a month level that powell had said in april he would like to see though employers are clearly interested in hiring more having posted a record number of available jobs since december the fed has said it wants to see substantial further progress toward its goals of full employment and inflation modestly above 2 before it would begin tapering its bond purchases with inflation having spiked in the past two months the fed is under rising pressure to consider slowing those bond purchases but with the unemployment rate at a relatively high 5 8 and the economy still 7 6 million jobs short of its pre pandemic level powell and many other fed policymakers have suggested in recent weeks that the economy is still far from achieving that progress economists generally expect the fed to continue discussing tapering its bond purchases and then by late august or september to outline specifically how and when it would begin that would set the stage for a reduction in bond purchases to actually begin near the end of this year or in early 2022 last week the government reported that inflation jumped to 5 in may compared with a year earlier the largest 12 month spike since 2008 the increase was driven partly by a huge rise in used car prices which have soared as shortages of semiconductors have slowed vehicle production sharply higher prices for car rentals airline tickets and hotel rooms were also major factors reflecting pent up demand as consumers shift away from the large goods purchases many of them had made while stuck at home to spending on services prices for such services which had tumbled at the outset of the covid 19 outbreak are now regaining pre pandemic levels with more people gradually returning to work in person the reopening of the economy has also forced up prices for clothing yet such price increases may not last another key consideration for the fed is whether inflation persists long enough to affect the public s behavior if americans begin to expect price increases those expectations can trigger a self fulfilling cycle as workers demand higher wages which in turn can lead their employers to keep raising prices to offset their higher labor costs so far bond yields and consumer surveys suggest that

u s fed can raise rate quickly to curb inflation but it might not be pleasant fed advisor federal reserve officials signaled that the pace of the u s economic recovery from the pandemic is bringing forward their expectations for how quickly they will reduce policy support chair jerome powell told a press conference wednesday that officials had begun a discussion about scaling back bond purchases after releasing forecasts that show they anticipate two interest rate increases by the end of 2023 projecting a faster than anticipated pace of tightening the economy has clearly made progress powell said noting that policy makers had debated how far the economy has traveled toward their threshold for scaling back us 120 billion in monthly bond purchases while reaching the standard substantial further progress is still a ways off participants expect that progress will continue he said you can think of this meeting as the talking about talking about meeting if you like he added following a two day gathering of the federal open market committee the central bank held the target range for its benchmark policy rate unchanged at zero to 0 25 per cent where it s been since march 2020 the fomc vote was unanimous the dollar rose stocks declined and yields on 10 year treasuries jumped following the news it s a hawkish surprise said thomas costerg senior u s economist at pictet wealth management referring to the rate projections we are looking at a fed that seems positively surprised by the speed of vaccinations and the ongoing withdrawal of social distancing measures the quarterly projections showed 13 of 18 officials favored at least one rate increase by the end of 2023 versus seven in march eleven officials saw at least two hikes by the end of that year in addition seven of them saw a move as early as 2022 up from four the dots should be taken with a big grain of salt powell said referring to the interest rate forecasts he cautioned that discussions about raising rates would be highly premature the fed marked up its inflation forecasts through the end of 2023 officials see their preferred measure of price pressures rising 3 4 per cent in 2021 compared with a march projection of 2 4 per cent the 2022 forecast rose to 2 1 per cent from 2 per cent and the 2023 estimate was raised to 2 2 per cent from 2 1 per cent consumer price pressures have proven hotter than expected over the last two months labor department figures showed a 0 8 per cent jump in prices in april and a 0 6 per cent rise in may marking the two biggest monthly increases since 2009 as the reopening continues shifts in demand can be large and rapid and bottlenecks hiring difficulties and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect powell said labor department reports on employment published since the last gathering of the fomc in late april on the other hand have disappointed relative to forecasters expectations the u s unemployment rate was still elevated at 5 8 per cent in may with total employment still millions of jobs below pre pandemic levels fed forecasts still the fomc median projection for unemployment in the fourth quarter of 2021 was unchanged at 4 5 per cent and the median estimate for the same quarter a year later was marked down to 3 8 per cent from 3 9 per cent the 2023 forecast was held at 3 5 per cent the u s economic recovery is gathering strength as business restrictions lift and social activity increases across the country robust demand from consumers and businesses alike has outstripped capacity leading to bottlenecks in the supply chain longer lead times and higher prices fed officials have said such fits and starts are to be expected given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and expressed optimism about the outlook for the second half of the year as more americans get vaccinated the fomc raised its projections for economic growth gross domestic product was seen expanding 7 per cent this year up from a prior projection of 6 5 per cent it maintained the 2022 expansion forecast at 3 3 per cent and raised the 2023 estimate to 2 4 per cent from march s 2 2 per cent

oil prices rallied to their highest levels two and a half years after opec recently agreed to extend its historic production cuts on friday wti was trading at 70 91 per barrel while brent crude was changing hands at 72 69 levels they last touched in 2018 by wednesday morning wti was trading above 72 and brent had climbed above 74 beginning on may 1 opec cut production by 9 7 million barrels per day with the cuts scheduled to start declining beginning july 1 opec now says july s production cut will be 9 6 million bpd after mexico said it remains committed to the group s prior agreement consequently oil inventories that had built up in the middle of last year due to oversupply amid weak demand due to the pandemic now appear to be on pace to fall below historical averages as early as next month meanwhile u s supply remains subdued as companies have held back production to conserve cash opec is optimistic that shale production won t disrupt the delicate balance it has worked to establish for at least two years another important catalyst a growing wave of climate activism with corporate boards putting pressure on big oil to adopt climate friendlier policies after souring on the sector for years wall street is increasingly turning positive on energy with a growing number of analysts expressing optimism that the worst could be in the rearview mirror goldman sachs says the markets are underestimating oil demand and sees brent at 80 this summer s p global platts has forecast oil prices to stay above 70 a barrel from mid 2021 driven by a more broad based pickup in

america sees oil prices hitting 100 we think in the next three years we could see 100 barrels again and we stand by that that would be a 2022 2023 story part of it is the fact we have opec kind of holding all the cards and the market is not particularly price responsive on the supply side and there is a lot of pent up demand we also have a lot of inflation everywhere oil has been lagging the rise in prices across the economy blanch has said goldman has suggested that oil and gas investors should consider a barbell strategy with some exposure to more volatile names as well as cycle winners here are our top picks for large cap mid cap small cap volatile and cyclical oil stocks for the perfect portfolio as oil prices continue to climb 1 large cap conocophillips last year houston texas based shale producer conocophillips nyse cop earned accolades after announcing some of the deepest production cuts at a time when many shale companies were reluctant to lower production and relinquish market share the company lowered its north america output by nearly 500 000 bpd marking one of the biggest cuts by an american producer this year conocophillips has kept drilling activity subdued and also kept a tight lid on capital expenditures and those austerity measures are now paying off conoco has become the first large u s independent oil producer to resume its share buyback program after suspending it during last year s oil crisis conoco says it has resumed stock buybacks at an annualized rate of 1 5b and also plans to sell off its cenovus energy nyse cve stake in the current quarter and complete the sales by year end 2022 proceeds from the sale valued at 2 billion will be used to fund share buybacks cop stock is rallying again after bank of america upgraded the shares to buy from neutral with a 67 price target calling the company a cash machine with the potential for accelerated returns according to bofa analyst doug leggate conoco looks poised to accelerate cash returns at an earlier and more significant pace than any pure play e p or oil major leggate cop shares have pulled back to more attractive levels but with a different macro outlook from when oil peaked close to 70 but best of all the bofa analyst believes cop is highly exposed to longer term oil recovery but bofa is not the only wall street punter that s gushing about cop in a note to clients raymond james says conocophillips stock price is undervaluing the flood of cash the oil and gas company is poised to generate related judge blocks biden s ban on oil leasing that s quite remarkable considering cop shares are up 39 3 in the year to date the bullish notes appear well deserved with wti price in the mid 60s conocophillips would have little trouble generating copious amounts of free cash flows given the company s cash flow breakeven level of under 30 bbl 2 mid cap marathon oil marathon oil nyse mro is one of the most popular stocks on the stock trading app robinhood and for good reason oil field services companies and oil refiners have been hardest hit by the energy crisis and marathon oil nys mro and valero energy nyse val have not been spared despite oil prices appearing to have stabilized around 50 indeed marathon oil s management is confident enough about the company s outlook that it recently reinstated the dividend after suspending it in june albeit at a lower rate of 3 cents a share compared to 5 cents before the cancellation that modest dividend is good for a forward yield of 3 03 according to the company s management mro becomes cash flow positive at oil price around 35 barrel meaning the current wti level of 61 50 gives it a nice cushion despite rallying 102 ytd mro is still trading considerably lower than 2018 levels marathon oil looks like a good bet due to its relatively strong balance sheet including an untapped credit facility of 3 billion 3 small cap northern oil and gas northern oil and gas inc nyse nog has a rather unique modus operandi in that it invests in oil producing properties acting as a financial partner to exploration and production names the company has more than 6 000 gross producing wells primarily in the bakken nog has soared 119 6 in the year to date with the rally dating back to september after it announced that it had agreed to acquire its first non operating interest in the delaware basin in a 12m deal that piece of news would have hardly turned heads if the buyer was an exxon or a chevron the fact that a financially distressed company with more than a billion dollars in long term debt and a high debt to equity ratio made such a bold move still deep in the throes of the crisis means that nog really believed that an oil price rebound remained firmly in the cards in which case its latest purchase could end up being a massive bargain further nog has upped its production guidance further nog s recent marcellus shale acquisition is expected to return an average 18 fcf yield on the investment making the shares appear deeply undervalued despite the recent run back in february northern oil and gas announced it acquired reliance marcellus llc s non operated interest in appalachia natural gas assets according to the company the acquisition will generate 125 million of free cash flow over the next four years with an average 18 fcf yield on the investment 4 volatile oil plays cenovus energy canadian oil

energy sector and has advised investors to focus on oil companies with the potential to grow their free cash flows through consolidations or other cost reduction measures naming devon energy nyse dvn pioneer natural resources nyse pxd and eog resources nyse eog turns out bofa was right on the money with dvn stock surging 85 3 ytd thanks to strong earnings and continuing cost discipline including a

270 million cash from operations before changes in working capital clocked in at 719m vs consensus of 700 9m while free cash flow of 260m beat the consensus of 206 2m but what s got investors particularly excited about this company is its continuing capital discipline it is important to reiterate that we have no intention of allocating capital to growth projects until demand side fundamentals recover and it becomes evident that opec spare oil capacity is effectively absorbed by the world markets ceo richard muncrief declared during the company s earnings conference call devon has adopted a variable dividend structure something that has gone down well with wall street devon paid an 0 11 share regular dividend and a 0 24 share variable dividend during the quarter implying an annualized 5 5 yield further the company has forecast a dividend yield of more than 7 for 2021 if current trends hold illustrating its commitment to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends whenever cash flows permit some wall street analysts have pointed to the potential for dvn to sport a dividend yield of as high as 8 by year end raymond james recently upgraded dvn shares to

posted wednesday june 16 2021 7 26 pm regional the phones rarely stop ringing at aronson boat works these days and the conversations with would be customers are pretty predictable if you d like to buy a boat motor or most any of the accompanying accessories we ll put you on the list but it s a long list it s the same story at marinas across the region as an unprecedented spike in demand for marine products as with many other manufactured goods has run head on into a supply crunch that shows no signs of easing anytime soon the situation has turned a business that is already busy for the mom and pop owners of many area marinas into an all consuming experience april was especially over the top said john niemiste who operates aronson with his wife gretchen and it was the busiest fishing opener we ve ever seen the niemistes are used to a hectic pace during peak season at their marina on lake vermilion but they say they ve never experienced such high demand for their product and services as they ve seen since the start of the covid 19 pandemic a year ago last march it s not the only outdoor industry that s been affected demand for a wide range of outdoor recreational gear jumped sharply as americans adapted to indoor health restrictions by getting outside the trend caught many by surprise which has only exacerbated the shortages when covid took off i didn t think i would sell anything last year said chris raridon who owns and operates frank s marine on pelican lake in orr instead it went crazy i think people were just tired of being locked in the house at the same time the stimulus packages passed by congress over the past year have also put more money into the pockets of most americans notes raridon who believes some of those dollars trickled down to marine dealers if customers weren t looking for new boats or motors they were looking to service equipment they hadn t used in a while we had a lot of people come in with boats that hadn t been run in four or five years said raridon others opted for used boats and motors given that new product isn t available the used market has gone crazy said raridon i talked to one guy who said he put his used boat on craigslist for five minutes and had ten calls from people with cash in hand who wanted it if people can t find boats to buy they re looking to rent our rental business has been up like we ve never experienced said jeff sanborn who owns and operates handberg s marine in crane lake with his wife lori while they may be at the literal end of the road that isolation hasn t kept the impact of the product shortage at bay boats we ordered for customers back in december haven t even been built yet said sanborn outboards we ordered a year ago have still not been delivered sanborn said the industry is facing a combination of a huge and unforeseen spike in demand for products at a time when manufacturers are experiencing shortages of both the parts they need as well as manpower to assemble it all one of their big challenges is shipping said sanborn asian shipping is way up and companies can t get containers as a result since boat manufacturers rely on components manufactured in asia in some cases the shipping showdown has slowed their ability to maintain a steady production flow even if you re missing just one part you can t run a line noted sanborn niemiste notes that even when manufacturers have been able to obtain parts they ve also struggled to attract the workers they need lund is looking into robotic riveters because they can t find people he said the situation has created a quandary for marina operators since they have seemingly endless demand for a product they currently can t supply for a time niemiste was traveling sometimes hundreds of miles to pick up product from other dealers who were willing to part with excess stock but that s not possible anymore since virtually no marine dealer has any stock remaining we re out of product to sell at this point said niemiste and i know i m not going to get anything else in this summer anything that does come in is already sold raridon agreed there s little point in searching from other dealers at this point i have people calling from other parts of the country looking for things like motors that tells there s nothing available there either upset customers the situation is frustrating to customers as well as marina operators and it that has added another layer of stress as owners and staff try to deal with potential customers who aren t used to hearing no when they have cash they want to spend you have to get a little short with people at times said niemiste raridon acknowledges that some customers get frustrated but he said most now recognize that the shortage of manufactured products is not confined to the marine industry you can t get anything right now said raridon car lots are sitting nearly empty it s months of waiting to buy something like an atv he said so most people have been pretty good the supply crunch in so many sectors has encouraged some customers to order earlier than ever niemiste said he s had people putting down money in may for boats that likely won t be delivered before next summer raridon said he s seeing the same thing and that s why he expects no short term letup in the intense pace being experienced by marinas across the region i think it s going to be another decent year next year he said in fact niemiste notes that some forecasters for the industry see strong demand for marine products through at least the next 3 5 years while the industry has certainly been impacted by the effects of the pandemic niemiste suggests there may be more to it we ve basically changed to a new generation he said finding down time while the marine business in the north country has always been intense in the spring and to a lesser extent in the fall as marinas prep boats for winter storage there were times for marina owners and workers to catch their breath where do these business owners find time for a personal life right now we don t have one said sanborn you throw in some community service like being on the fire department and no you don t have a life outside of that for the niemistes winter used to offer a break and they would often spend at least a month in florida as a way to unwind from the hectic pace the rest of the year but we really didn t get that this past winter said gretchen niemiste we did get to florida but we were on the email all the time trying to keep up with everyone wanting boats and motors she said it certainly wasn t the break it used to be our business has really become year round the intense nature of the business can be daunting at times when first contacted by the timberjay for this story the usually cheerful and upbeat lori sanborn said she simply didn t any time to talk i ve got ten different things going on she said sounding a bit exasperated it was a feeling that the niemistes say they know well john said he tries to take at least a moment out of the day to do something for himself even if it s just buying something he needs at the store he and gretchen are in the process of building a small boat access cabin as a kind of retreat we call it our mental health cabin he said jeff sanborn that the pace can be draining at times and said there s no end in sight you expect it to be busy in the spring but now it looks like we ll going at this pace at least through august he said
construction of the dillon valley vistas a workforce housing community is pictured nov 19 2020 dillon valley is one of the proposed opportunity zones highlighted in summit county housing director jason dietz s housing strategy presentation photo by liz copan studio copan at the summit board of county commissioners work session meeting tuesday june 15 staff from the summit county housing department unveiled a robust plan of short mid and long term strategies to help mitigate the affordable housing shortage the primary goal laid out by the county is to get 1 000 additional units on the market within the next 12 to 18 months by implementing some of the short term strategies county officials and staff had mentioned in previous meetings that the workforce housing issue was of top concern and that it s a complex problem that will take a multitude of strategies to solve we really can t attribute this crisis to one single thing it s just a perfect storm of issues that created this situation that we re in now county commissioner elisabeth lawrence said during the presentation summit county housing director jason dietz noted that staff had come up with short term strategies focused on the next 12 to 18 months mid term strategies that focused on the next 18 months to three years and long term strategies that focused on the problem in the next three or more years some of the short term strategies dietz presented to the board included increasing short term licensing fees which dietz said currently cover only two thirds of the program s costs a few strategies laid out by dietz focused on the county s current housing stock and how it could turn existing short term rental units into long term rental units one such measure was focused on collecting data dietz suggested the county create a neighborhood mapping and metrics program to see how these areas are changing for good or for bad with regard to short term rentals another strategy suggested was to create and appeal to opportunity zones or neighborhoods that historically house locals including dillon valley wildernest french creek and summit cove dietz said there s currently 870 short term rental units within these types of neighborhoods and that the county could develop a conversion program to turn these units into long term rentals part of the effort would be to understand how individuals use their units one of the next steps is to develop a targeted survey to those opportunity zone neighborhoods targeting those short term rentals to get a better understanding of how they are using those short term rentals dietz said this survey would ask owners when they use their units how they determine a rental price and whether they are willing to convert their unit with that information dietz said the county could determine what incentives to offer on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis these incentives to convert rentals could include a grant dietz said the amount which is yet to be determined would be based on neighborhood as well as home type and size other options include a security guarantee meaning the county would guarantee rent and a security deposit up to a certain amount and a property manager finders fee which would help offset some of the revenue owners might lose from converting the county also could expand the housing works initiative and launch a locals landing type program which would match tenants with homeowners we want to develop a marketing campaign so we can target those short term rentals within those opportunity zones to convert to those long term rentals dietz said we still have some work to do on that but that s the direction we re aiming right now is to really make a targeted approach toby babich president of the summit alliance of vacation rental managers said he supports these conversion efforts babich noted that it s also not just short term rentals causing the issue and said he hopes myriad solutions will be used to solve the problem moving forward i think we all need to realize that this is an entire community issue and it s going to take an entire community to solve the issue babich said the short term rental community is going to be part of that discussion and try to present any solutions we can but we are one of several factors that are creating the housing crisis that we are witnessing unfold right now all three county commissioners agreed it s going to take a combination of solutions to solve the affordable housing shortage overall i m supportive of all of these strategies and i think it s going to take a combination of all of them to be successful commissioner tamara pogue said in addition to appealing to short term rental unit owners dietz noted that the county is working with a local hotel where the entire property would be master leased into condos which would then be leased to other businesses or workers within the community during the meeting dietz said the contract is being finalized this month and that he d like occupancy to begin july 1 according to the presentation the annual subsidy for the project is estimated at 286 868 county manager scott vargo said the team is targeting a rental rate of around 850 per month the board gave staff praise for the unique solution to some of the housing needs and pogue noted that if there are other hotels and motels within the county interested in a relationship like this the owners should reach out to county staff part of dietz s presentation also mentioned working with developer gorman co to produce more units at the wintergreen property in keystone dietz said the project was approved for 243 units and that only 196 were built dietz reported that the company has already expressed interest in developing additional units according to the presentation the county would contribute a 15 000 subsidy for each of the additional 47 units that are already allowed in addition to these planned efforts the board agreed to waive all county fees on workforce housing projects for the next 12 months which dietz noted was a small move the board could make to help move projects along i would say this is something we do today right this second and we make sure nobody in summit county doesn t know we ve already done it pogue said dietz also mentioned a few county owned plots of land that could be developed including a parcel near silverthorne elementary a parcel near the summit county justice center a parcel near the snake river wastewater treatment plant and a 5 5 acre parcel that s partly owned by breckenridge the board continued to show support for other short term strategies such as working with the u s forest service to use various campgrounds in the offseason for those living in rvs or vans launching a new accessory dwelling unit grant program starting a program that brings non compliant accessory dwelling units into compliance creating a standalone accessory dwelling unit stock plan program increasing the summit combined housing authority s down payment assistance program hiring a consultant to audit and modify the housing and development code working with habitat for humanity to develop the soda creek parcel that is 0 2 acres acquiring properties owned by denver water and coordinating a housing summit for the end of june or early july that would provide a forum to discuss collaborative projects in addition dietz reported that the town of breckenridge has offered to split the cost of the buy down program which allows the county to purchase market rate units and place deed restrictions on them for properties in the upper blue river basin allowing the county s money to go further in securing housing
german pharmaceutical company curevac reveals amazing results in its mrna tests covid 19 vaccine the slowdown is expected to help meet the global need for effective inoculation curevac said on wednesday that its blow was 47 percent effective in the provisional analysis of late stage tests to protect against coronavirus making it the most effective of the coronavirus vaccines tested to date earlier this week u s drug pharmacist novavax said it was a protein based shooting 90 percent effective modern and biontech pfizer owners are 95 percent resistant to the original strain of the virus when it comes to fighting coronavirus shares of curevac s nasdaq were down 50 percent after the new york market the company attributed the deplorable results to the new strains of the virus that were circulating in 10 countries in latin america and across europe as tests were carried out in a study of 40 000 people curevac said 13 variants were found in volunteers more than half of all cases of coronavirus caused by the variant of concern however uk data this week showed two doses of biontech pfizer messenger mrna or ribonucleic acid 96 percent of the vaccine was effective in preventing the hospitalization of those infected with the delta variant that was first detected in india this week the u s centers for disease control and prevention added delta strain to the list of variants of concern recommended curevac has partnered with german manufacturing conglomerate bayer to produce the coronavirus vaccine and has an agreement with british pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to create the next generation of owners the poor results of the trials call into question the viability of these projects curevac aims to produce 300m doses of its vaccine this year and 20 billion in 2022 while we hoped to achieve a stronger interim result we recognize that it is a challenge to show great effectiveness in this vast diversity of unprecedented variants said franz werner haas ceo of curevac he added that many of the variants emphasize the importance of developing next generation vaccines the vaccine is also being studied in the uk as part of a booster trial that involves giving different shots to people who have already received two doses of oxford astrazeneca or biontech pfizer vaccines like modern and biontech pfizer vaccines the owner of curevac uses mrna but its mrna is natural and unchanged his shot uses a lower dose 12 micrograms compared to modern s 100 mg and biontech pfizer s 30 mg this has a lower production cost and is stable at normal refrigerator temperatures curevac said it will continue with two dose mrna vaccine trials and decide on the most appropriate regulatory route after evaluating the final trial data
sandboxes aren t just play areas for toddlers increasingly state and national governments around the world are creating so called regulatory sandboxes programs that allow software companies to skirt regulations in order to test a new product or service the most common u s sandbox programs serve companies that make financial technology such as digital payment apps or software for assessing credit risk governors in six states have in recent years signed laws creating such programs the federal consumer financial protection bureau runs two on the national level and the idea is spreading lawmakers in 11 states and washington d c this year proposed bills that would create financial technology sandboxes according to the libertas institute a libertarian leaning think tank based in lehi utah that promotes the sandbox concept nationally sandbox laws allow companies to test prototypes without getting a state license while proposed and enacted laws vary they drop requirements such as net worth amounts collateral deposit amounts and interest rate limits several laws say that in a sandbox none of the state s financial services laws apply and it s up to regulators to decide if any laws or regulations should apply to protect consumers or licensed banks from a certain product test states also have created sandboxes for companies developing insurance legal real estate and other new products and services supporters say legal wiggle room can help banking and lending startups grow and create jobs but consumer advocates say loosening licensing rules could expose customers to unfair or abusive products such as loans with high interest rates they like to quote new york s former head banking regulator maria vullo who once said toddlers play in sandboxes adults play by the rules just because there s a claim of innovation or that technology is involved doesn t mean it s automatically good said lisa stifler director for state policy at the center for responsible lending a washington d c based nonprofit that fights predatory lending state financial technology sandboxes also have struggled to attract businesses in the four states accepting applications this year arizona florida utah and wyoming no companies are currently enrolled in arizona only 10 companies have participated those companies may or may not have gotten through their actual test said assistant attorney general sam fox who oversees the state program financial technology sandboxes are best understood as signaling mechanisms attempts by lawmakers to show their state is forward thinking said lee reiners executive director of the global financial markets center at duke university school of law they re not going to help that many firms he said playing in the sandbox arizona gov doug ducey a republican signed a law creating the first u s financial services sandbox in 2018 backed by business groups and blockchain enthusiasts the law has since become a template for other states companies can participate in the arizona program without having an office or employees in the state once admitted they can offer products and services mostly loans money transmission services and investment advice backed by new technology to up to 10 000 state residents for two years without getting a state license state regulators monitor participating companies participants can handle only a limited amount of money money transmitters can offer transactions of up to 2 500 at one time or 25 000 per consumer for instance and they must comply with the state consumer fraud act arizona s 36 annual interest rate limit for small consumer loans still applies so far participants have included a cryptocurrency payments company that serves marijuana businesses a company that gives consumers cash in exchange for a percentage of their future earnings and a company that s developed an algorithm for evaluating renewable energy projects brightfi services a company whose software lowers the cost of administering bank accounts used the sandbox in 2019 to test an iphone banking app aimed at people who lack accounts it chose a small group of test users including some of its own employees and asked them to share feedback on the app s features supporters say sandbox programs help regulators learn about new financial products and services which in turn can inform better laws let s make sure that the regulations that we have in place are the absolute best possible form of regulations we can have said james czerniawski a policy analyst at the libertas institute many sandbox backers also want to show that their state welcomes high tech companies but opponents say that because of the loosened regulations the programs could harbor abusive or misleading products we re really concerned about predatory lending to low income families and low income individuals said jackson voss economic opportunity policy analyst at the louisiana budget project a left leaning public policy nonprofit the nonprofit opposed a financial technology sandbox bill proposed by louisiana gop state rep mark wright this year companies that use sandboxes are really experimenting on the people of whatever state adopts the sandbox voss said and that seems problematic even some conservative lawmakers are skeptical i have a problem just saying if you come up with a product you can ask the regulators to waive all the laws that we put in place presumably for good reason said louisiana republican state sen jay morris during a commerce committee hearing on wright s bill arizona officials say their program has consumer protections in place and note that it s overseen by a consumer protection lawyer but neither the companies admitted to the program nor the attorney general s office have published information about tests conducted in the sandbox so it s hard to know whether customers have been helped or harmed consumer advocates have filed public records requests seeking more information but haven t received satisfying answers said kelly griffith executive director of the southwest center for economic integrity a tucson based consumer advocacy group that lack of transparency for us raises a big red flag state leaders don t have to bend the rules to help regulators learn about new financial products and services said stifler of the center for responsible lending she pointed to california where lawmakers last year created an innovation office to study novel financial services and cryptocurrency companies playing by the rules in most states with a financial services sandbox and some states where they ve been proposed the banking industry is regulated with a relatively light touch that may limit how many businesses benefit from the programs during the louisiana committee hearing wright struggled to identify products and services the sandbox would bring to the state his only answer was a vague reference to cryptocurrency companies which didn t satisfy morris you can purchase cryptocurrency now morris said holding up his phone for emphasis you can get on coinbase buy all you want we don t need this bill to buy crypto because it s allowed already wright s bill failed in committee other sandboxes allow an industry to operate period for instance before hawaii s cryptocurrency sandbox launched last year the state s strict licensing rules made it too expensive for cryptocurrency trading platforms to do business there without the sandbox program we probably wouldn t have been able to operate in hawaii frankly said alexandra gaiser director of regulatory affairs at river financial a bitcoin trading app and one of 11 companies in the state s program river financial legally operates in 35 states including arizona florida utah and wyoming it has a money transmitter license in 14 states in the others gaiser said the company either doesn t need a license or has an agreement with state regulators that allows it to serve customers without one it s not participating in other sandboxes financial technology companies generally aspire to operate in all 50 states so a one state program may not be compelling although some sandbox laws include reciprocity agreements companies still need to apply to every state program they d like to use i think for them to be really useful they would need to string together a number of states so they create bigger markets and create some firmer understanding with the feds said andrew lorentz a lawyer for davis wright tremaine who co chairs the national law firm s financial technology practice startups also have another way around costly banking rules and regulations rather than serving consumers directly they can sell their software to established banks and credit unions and avoid licensing hassles altogether at brightfi company leaders jettisoned plans to create an affordable bank not long after testing their app now the company is selling its technology to traditional financial institutions for smaller fintechs sometimes it s easier to partner up with a bank that already has a license lehman said the arizona sandbox helped convince brightfi to move to phoenix in 2019 but the firm had other reasons too and it eventually found that making connections not lighter regulation was the program s main benefit i don t think we would be where we are right now had we not been introduced to some of the people banks regulators even nonprofits that we were introduced to said crystal lehman brightfi s chief technology officer it was immeasurable this story was republished from stateline an initiative of the pew charitable trusts where it was published june 15 2021 with the headline relaxed rules attract entrepreneurs to state sandboxes
the news of the end of slavery in america was delivered to slaves in texas in 1865 more than two years after lincoln declared the end to slavery washington the end of slavery in the united states is often recognized by president abraham lincoln s emancipation proclamation of 1863 but the day commemorating the freedom of african americans juneteenth june 19 was recognized only after the last slaves were told about the president s order nearly 2 1 2 years later on thursday president joe biden signed legislation establishing a new federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery saying he believes it will go down as one of the greatest honors he has as president why is it called juneteenth the word juneteenth is a combination of the month and date that the holiday is observed on june 19 on that day in 1865 union troops led by maj gen gordon granger arrived in galveston texas with news that the civil war was over and that all remaining slaves were free lincoln announced the emancipation proclamation that had declared their freedom in september 1862 the order was issued during the civil war and effective january 1 1863 granger read general order no 3 after his arrival the people of texas are informed that in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the united states all slaves are free this involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired laborer why it took so long to get the news to texas remains unclear according to juneteenth com one belief is that a messenger sent to give word of the newly declared freedoms was murdered another is that the news was deliberately withheld by slave owners and there was the fact that there were few union soldiers in texas to deliver the news according to historian henry louis gates jr the order did not mean immediate freedom for many of texas 250 000 slaves it was the owners who were tasked with delivering the news on plantations masters had to decide when and how to announce the news or wait for a government agent to arrive and it was not uncommon for them to delay until after the harvest gates said in a blog published by the root and pbs in some cases slaves who tried to exercise their newly proclaimed freedoms were killed gates wrote in 1980 texas was the first state to make juneteenth a holiday others followed suit in the four decades since a handful have made it a paid holiday while most others give the day an official observance or recognition hawaii and south dakota remain the only states that do not recognize juneteenth according to the congressional research service there is a flag for juneteenth it features a 12 pointed star with a white 5 pointed star inside it they appear on top of a blue and red background l j graf one of the banner s designers wrote that the juneteenth flag represents the history and freedom of enslaved people and their descendants graf says the design of the juneteenth flag depicts a bursting new star on the horizon the star represents a new freedom a new people a new star the red white and blue colors communicate that the american slaves and their descendants were all americans

the battles waged by the government and its health authorities against the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic continues unabated with the government once again extending travel restrictions as the number of infections and the number of deaths from the disease continued to rise the travel restrictions were due to have been lifted on monday june 14 but have now been extended until the following monday june 21 it is however not confirmed that they will be relaxed on this date as that would depend on the state of the pandemic at that time and current trends are not promising health experts have also continued to express similarly cautious views regarding the easing of travel restrictions president of the sri lanka medical association dr padma guneratne said that although travel restrictions were seemingly enforced there was much public movement that was visible if the existing restrictions are not properly enforced they may have to be extended further dr guneratne said noting that with over 2 000 new infections being reported daily it cannot be said that the country is out of danger a sudden lifting of restrictions could see a further rise she warned the deputy director general of health services dr hemantha herath expressed similar sentiments dr herath observed that while the number of new infections may have declined slightly on some days recently it was not sufficient to indicate that the pandemic was definitely showing signs of slowing travel restrictions the travel restrictions have helped to reduce the number of daily infections from over 3 000 to the 2 000 range it may be necessary to continue these restrictions for longer or tighten them further to gain better control of the number of infections before relaxing the restrictions dr herath said political decision makers are also of the same opinion the state minister for primary health care epidemics and covid disease control dr sudarshani fernandopulle noted that it would take some time for the country to benefit from the sacrifices it had made by imposing travel restrictions though the number of covid 19 infections has decreased slightly it will take another two or three weeks to witness a significant decrease in the number of deaths dr fernandopulle noted accordingly the government will have to consider further extending the travel restrictions the state minister said the restriction will only be lifted gradually dr fernandopulle explained even when travel restrictions are lifted at a particular time public gatherings will not be allowed until there is a considerable decrease in the number of covid 19 infections in the country she said most worryingly for the government deaths from the virus continue to increase this week 63 deaths were recorded in a day the highest number in a single day to date this brought the total number of lives claimed by the pandemic in sri lanka to 2 260 in about fifteen months most of them this year the pandemic also spares no one among its latest casualties is leader of the opposition and the leader of the samagi jana balavegaya sajith premadasa and his wife jalani premadasa having developed the infection premadasa and his spouse made a full recovery and left hospital this week premadasa has not been vaccinated against the virus we refused the vaccine because we wanted to prioritise the public as a result we were infected with the virus premadasa said speaking to the media from the gangaramaya temple in colombo upon his recovery and release from hospital i will not take the vaccine until the population of the country is vaccinated this is a time we must put others before ourselves premadasa said but health experts have questioned this stance when a leading public figure refuses to be vaccinated it can send a negative message to the public they say having controlled the first wave of the pandemic in an exemplary manner and being hailed by health experts as a model for other nations to follow sri lanka even managed to rein in a second wave of the pandemic through timely precautions without allowing the number of infections to escalate the demographic of the pandemic in sri lanka changed only around april this year this was the result of a sense of complacency among the public during the holiday season having withstood the virus for more than a year and the lack of adequate stocks of the coronavirus vaccine in addition there was also what is described as vaccine hesitancy in the population a lack of urgency in accepting vaccines because there was no rampaging infection in the community this is not a phenomenon seen in sri lanka alone and was seen in countries such as taiwan and australia vaccination programmes in such countries the lack of significant numbers of infections and deaths in the community led to delays in securing adequate vaccine stocks and delays in establishing rapid vaccination programmes this then led to second and third waves of the pandemic occurring in these nations conversely countries which experienced massive infections and deaths in the initial phases of the pandemic were quick to purchase the limited numbers of vaccines that were being produced and rush them through to the public at a rapid pace allowing them to return to relative normality sooner britain and the united states are examples of this sri lanka and other countries in similar circumstances are learning from this experience and are trying to follow suit however the stumbling block is the lack of ready availability of vaccines from their manufacturers even at market prices until now sri lanka has been heavily reliant on vaccines gifted by the world health organisation who which supplied the astrazeneca vaccine and china sinopharm russia sputnik v and india covishield the country will now also receive a donation of pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines from the united states sri lanka is also actively considering the possibility of giving combination vaccines to those who had received the first dose of the astrazeneca vaccine but could not access a second dose due to a shortage in supply it is estimated there is a shortfall of about 600 000 such vaccine doses in the country the government this week sought the advice of the advisory committee on communicable diseases on the possibility of administering pfizer vaccines to those who were deprived of the second dose of the astrazeneca vaccine this was after research indicated this strategy also led to strong immunity while dealing with these issues the government also had to contend with alleged irregularities in the distribution of the vaccine as well in one instance police have filed charges against officials who are alleged to have distributed the vaccines destined for the galle region to persons from colombo many persons are alleged to have travelled from colombo to galle on the southern expressway earlier this month to receive the second dose of the astrazeneca vaccine police investigations are now continuing to ascertain the scale and nature of this alleged incident previously there was also public dissatisfaction over attempts by members of the doctors trade union the government medical officers association gmoa to vaccinate their family members on a priority basis after lists of such family members were leaked and appeared on social media frontline health workers members of the gmoa and its leadership came in for heavy criticism from the public after it was pointed out that other frontline health workers were exposed to similar risks as doctors and possibly even more and their family members also deserved to be vaccinated on a high priority basis the government is very mindful of the impact of the current travel restrictions on daily life the economy and other everyday activities however in the current circumstances with infections and deaths continuing it sees the restrictions as an absolute necessity to contain the pandemic among the sectors that have been seriously affected is the education system with schools and universities being shut and competitive national examinations such as the ordinary level and the advanced level examinations being postponed numerous times disrupting normal schedules at a meeting presided over by prime minister mahinda rajapaksa it was agreed that any plan to re open schools would have to necessarily include a programme to vaccinate teachers and other school staff it is estimated that this would amount to about 300 000 persons requiring vaccines prime minister rajapaksa had instructed that the re opening of schools be undertaken only after consulting with paediatricians regarding its feasibility from a medical perspective it would be done in stages and students in grades 11 to 13 would be given top priority education officials said the bitter reality is that the covid 19 pandemic is currently at a stage of moderate containment in sri lanka the on going travel restrictions have helped curb its escalation to some extent but not to a point where these measures can be relaxed at this time when infection numbers are still significant despite several other issues such as the price hike on fuel which the government also had to grapple with this week it is certain that it is the coronavirus pandemic which will be top priority for health authority and policy makers alike at least in the coming weeks and months

recent quarter we acquired shares of gds holdings limited the leading data center developer and operator in china serving the premier chinese cloud service e commerce social media gaming and internet

center operator that has been a profitable long term investment for the fund in addition our real estate research team has met extensively with gds management over the course of the last few years and has built increased confidence in the team s growth aspirations and its ability to successfully execute them we believe that the chinese data center industry remains in the earlier stages of its growth curve and we believe it will experience one of the fastest multi year growth rates globally as the chinese government continues to support the rapid rollout of 5g connectivity gds s current and future data centers support the critical it infrastructure that empowers cloud adoption and enables numerous consumer and business applications in addition to experiencing robust organic growth gds has accelerated its growth runway through select m a these acquisitions have allowed the company to obtain additional capacity in supply constrained markets at attractive prices in addition gds has supplemented its dense urban strategy with a campus strategy whereby it secures additional supplies of land and power on the outskirts of cities with minimal capital committed to provide some perspective on gds s growth rate it signs more bookings in a single quarter than many global data center companies sign over the course of a year lastly after two well received capital raises in 2019 gds remains well funded with ample cash on its balance sheet to support multiple years of accelerated growth gds also has several deep pocketed backers including the singaporean government s investment fund that have remained supportive of gds s growth plans and have participated in several of gds s capital raises we believe there are many similarities to our other data center investments gds is earlier on its growth curve but growing at a much faster clip we see a path for gds to nearly triple its cash flow over the next few years and we see a path to double our investment over that

the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it may act sooner than previously planned to start dialing back the low interest rate policies that have helped fuel a swift rebound from the pandemic recession but have also coincided with rising inflation the fed s policymakers forecast that they would raise their benchmark short term rate which influences many consumer and business loans twice by late 2023 they had previously estimated that no rate hike would occur before 2024 in a statement after its latest policy meeting the fed also said it expects the pandemic to have a diminishing effect on the economy as vaccinations increase thereby allowing for more growth progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states it said amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened related us housing market booms as buyers enter bidding wars amid low supply taken as a whole the fed s latest policy statement reflected its recognition that the economy and inflation pressures have gained momentum in the wake of the recession much faster than expected thanks in part to the pace of vaccinations accordingly the central bank raised its forecast for inflation to 3 4 by the end of this year from 2 4 in its previous projection in march yet the officials foresee price increases remaining tame in the following two years that outlook reflects chair jerome powell s view that the current inflation spikes stem mainly from supply shortages and other temporary effects of the economy s swift reopening from the pandemic fed officials expect the economy to grow 7 this year which would be the fastest calendar year expansion since 1984 it projects though that growth will slow after that to 3 3 in 2022 and 2 4 in 2023 soon after the fed issued its statement wednesday u s stocks fell further from their record highs and bond yields rose the yield on the 10 year treasury note rose from 1 48 to 1 54 in addition to having pegged its key rate near zero since march of last year the fed has been buying 120 billion a month in treasury and mortgage bonds to try to hold down longer term rates to encourage borrowing and spending related mortgage interest rates fall below 3 for first time in 2 weeks the fed officials are widely believed to have begun discussing a reduction in those monthly bond purchases at the policy meeting that ended wednesday a first step in pulling back on its efforts to stimulate the economy there was no mention of paring those bond purchases in the written statement the fed issued after the meeting the fed is grappling with a dilemma inflation is rising much faster than it had projected earlier this year and america s increasingly vaccinated consumers are now comfortable venturing away from home to travel go to restaurants and movie theaters and attend sporting events solid consumer spending is accelerating economic growth and manufacturing and housing have significantly strengthened yet hiring hasn t picked up as much as expected monthly job growth has remained below the 1 million a month level that powell had said in april he would like to see though employers are clearly interested in hiring more having posted a record number of available jobs since december the fed has said it wants to see substantial further progress toward its goals of full employment and inflation modestly above 2 before it would begin tapering its bond purchases with inflation having spiked in the past two months the fed is under rising pressure to consider slowing those bond purchases but with the unemployment rate at a relatively high 5 8 and the economy still 7 6 million jobs short of its pre pandemic level powell and many other fed policymakers have suggested in recent weeks that the economy is still far from achieving that progress economists generally expect the fed to continue discussing tapering its bond purchases and then by late august or september to outline specifically how and when it would begin that would set the stage for a reduction in bond purchases to actually begin near the end of this year or in early 2022 last week the government reported that inflation jumped to 5 in may compared with a year earlier the largest 12 month spike since 2008 the increase was driven partly by a huge rise in used car prices which have soared as shortages of semiconductors have slowed vehicle production sharply higher prices for car rentals airline tickets and hotel rooms were also major factors reflecting pent up demand as consumers shift away from the large goods purchases many of them had made while stuck at home to spending on services prices for such services which had tumbled at the outset of the covid 19 outbreak are now regaining pre pandemic levels with more people gradually returning to work in person the reopening of the economy has also forced up prices for clothing yet such price increases may not last another key consideration for the fed is whether inflation persists long enough to affect the public s behavior if americans begin to expect price increases those expectations can trigger a self fulfilling cycle as workers demand higher wages which in turn can lead their employers to keep raising prices to offset their higher labor costs so far bond yields and consumer surveys suggest that while higher inflation is expected in the short term investors and most of the public expect only modest price gains in the long run powell has long maintained that the public s perceptions of future inflation evolve only slowly
stock sectors categorize the economy into easy to grasp groups not only do these help bystanders understand the general trajectories of parts of the economy but they re also invaluable in broadly diversifying your investments by choosing stocks and funds from different industries you curb your investment risk and set the stage for solid growth what are stock sectors stock sectors group together public companies that have a lot in common like when they share similar business models and are active in related industries stock sectors may be further subdivided into smaller categories and may cover several industries global industry classification standard gics is the primary classification system for stock market sectors and divides market industries into 11 sectors with 24 industry groups 69 industries and 158 sub industries these 11 sectors aren t static they can and do change for example the real estate sector was added to the list in 2016 signifying the rising profile of the residential and commercial property industry sectors are a more diversified way for an investor to target opportunities where they broadly want exposure says kyle hart founder at

themselves for growth in a broader industry the 11 gics stock market sectors the energy sector the energy sector comprises stocks that are involved in extracting refining and transporting fossil fuels

own investment portfolio opportunities experts advise using as many of the gics sectors as possible and spreading assets around to diversify their holdings and help protect their investing dollars from risk a diversified portfolio must first have the appropriate dispersion among asset classes i e stocks bonds and cash as a foundation hart says sectors become extremely important to ensure diversified exposure within the stock asset class for example two investors may both have 60 stocks 40 bonds as their allocation yet investor a may have all of their stock exposure in technology or real estate while investor b has exposure across all 11 stock sectors in that scenario investor a would have an extremely different outcome in major market crisis moments like the dotcom crash of 1999 2000 or the housing bubble of 2007 2008 diversified sector exposure ensures that directly correlated events like the technology stock crash or the real estate bubble don t derail a portfolio hart

the u s federal reserve signaled wednesday a sooner than expected increase in interest rates as the covid 19 pandemic continues to recede and inflation continues to rise in a statement the fed said it would likely raise the short term interest rate twice by late 2023 it had previously said there would be no hike before 2024 the fed has kept interest rates near zero during the pandemic but now it sees the threat of the pandemic dissipating as the economy heats up progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened the fed said in a statement another reason for the change in position is inflation which in may jumped 5 compared with a year ago according to the government it was the largest 12 month increase in prices since 2008 the associated press reported the fed raised its inflation outlook to 3 4 by year s end up from the 2 4 projected in march despite the economic growth job growth has been lacking there are still 7 5 million fewer jobs than in february 2020 when the pandemic hit the fed s statement sent stocks lower and bond yields higher
new york new york the u s federal reserve following its two day monetary policy meeting which concluded on wednesday has left interest rates unchanged in a bid to broadly position inflation at around 2 percent growth this could mean an interest rate hike by about 2023 u s stocks fell sharply despite the widely anticipated announcement which followed the meeting the likelihood of interest rates rising soon than expected however unsettled markets the u s dollar conversely jumped sharply the federal reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the u s economy in this challenging time thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals the board s statement said progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to u s households and businesses the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remain the fed statement said the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run with inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent the committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1 4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time in addition the federal reserve will continue to increase its holdings of treasury securities by at least 80 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least 40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the committee s maximum employment and price stability goals these asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses the federal reserve said it would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that it is prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals at the close of trading wednesday the dow jones industrials were down 265 66 points or 0 77 percent at 34 033 67 the standard and poor s 500 dropped 33 17 points or 0 17 percent to 4 033 67 the tech laden nasdaq composite let go 33 17 points or 0 24 percent to 14 039 68 the other main action on wednesday was on foreign exchange markets where the u s dollar steam rolled all other currencies the euro tumbled to 1 2007 the british pound plummeted to 1 3997 the japanese yen declined to 110 64 the swiss franc fell to 0 9039 the canadian dollar weakened sharply to 1 2264 the australian dollar fell three quarters of a cent to 0 7613 the new zealand dollar was friendless at 0 7055 overseas the ftse 100 in london rose 0 17 percent the german dax declined 0 12 percent while the paris based cac 40 added 0 17 percent on asian markets the australian all ordinaries finished flat with a gain of just 0 40 of a single point or 0 01 percent to 7 633 40 in japan the nikkei 225 shed 150 29 points or 0 51 percent to 29 291 01 china s shanghai composite dropped 38 23 points or 1 07 percent to 3 518 33 the hang seng in hong kong dived 201 69 points or 0 70 percent to 28 436 84
the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it may act sooner than previously planned to start dialing back the low interest rate policies that have helped fuel a swift rebound from the pandemic recession but have also coincided with rising inflation the fed s policymakers forecast that they would raise their benchmark short term rate which influences many consumer and business loans twice by late 2023 they had previously estimated that no rate hike would occur before 2024 in a statement after its latest policy meeting the fed also said it expects the pandemic to have a diminishing effect on the economy as vaccinations increase thereby allowing for more growth progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states it said amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened related us housing market booms as buyers enter bidding wars amid low supply taken as a whole the fed s latest policy statement reflected its recognition that the economy and inflation pressures have gained momentum in the wake of the recession much faster than expected thanks in part to the pace of vaccinations accordingly the central bank raised its forecast for inflation to 3 4 by the end of this year from 2 4 in its previous projection in march yet the officials foresee price increases remaining tame in the following two years that outlook reflects chair jerome powell s view that the current inflation spikes stem mainly from supply shortages and other temporary effects of the economy s swift reopening from the pandemic fed officials expect the economy to grow 7 this year which would be the fastest calendar year expansion since 1984 it projects though that growth will slow after that to 3 3 in 2022 and 2 4 in 2023 soon after the fed issued its statement wednesday u s stocks fell further from their record highs and bond yields rose the yield on the 10 year treasury note rose from 1 48 to 1 54 in addition to having pegged its key rate near zero since march of last year the fed has been buying 120 billion a month in treasury and mortgage bonds to try to hold down longer term rates to encourage borrowing and spending related mortgage interest rates fall below 3 for first time in 2 weeks the fed officials are widely believed to have begun discussing a reduction in those monthly bond purchases at the policy meeting that ended wednesday a first step in pulling back on its efforts to stimulate the economy there was no mention of paring those bond purchases in the written statement the fed issued after the meeting the fed is grappling with a dilemma inflation is rising much faster than it had projected earlier this year and america s increasingly vaccinated consumers are now comfortable venturing away from home to travel go to restaurants and movie theaters and attend sporting events solid consumer spending is accelerating economic growth and manufacturing and housing have significantly strengthened yet hiring hasn t picked up as much as expected monthly job growth has remained below the 1 million a month level that powell had said in april he would like to see though employers are clearly interested in hiring more having posted a record number of available jobs since december the fed has said it wants to see substantial further progress toward its goals of full employment and inflation modestly above 2 before it would begin tapering its bond purchases with inflation having spiked in the past two months the fed is under rising pressure to consider slowing those bond purchases but with the unemployment rate at a relatively high 5 8 and the economy still 7 6 million jobs short of its pre pandemic level powell and many other fed policymakers have suggested in recent weeks that the economy is still far from achieving that progress economists generally expect the fed to continue discussing tapering its bond purchases and then by late august or september to outline specifically how and when it would begin that would set the stage for a reduction in bond purchases to actually begin near the end of this year or in early 2022 last week the government reported that inflation jumped to 5 in may compared with a year earlier the largest 12 month spike since 2008 the increase was driven partly by a huge rise in used car prices which have soared as shortages of semiconductors have slowed vehicle production sharply higher prices for car rentals airline tickets and hotel rooms were also major factors reflecting pent up demand as consumers shift away from the large goods purchases many of them had made while stuck at home to spending on services prices for such services which had tumbled at the outset of the covid 19 outbreak are now regaining pre pandemic levels with more people gradually returning to work in person the reopening of the economy has also forced up prices for clothing yet such price increases may not last another key consideration for the fed is whether inflation persists long enough to affect the public s behavior if americans begin to expect price increases those expectations can trigger a self fulfilling cycle as workers demand higher wages which in turn can lead their employers to keep raising prices to offset their higher labor costs so far bond yields and consumer surveys suggest that while higher inflation is expected in the short term investors and most of the public expect only modest price gains in the long run powell has long maintained that the public s perceptions of future inflation evolve only slowly

unsurprising but it was not to be from the open the index made another assault on the 7400 level at midday the index was up 25 points and just a tad over 7400 but then in came the sellers with some no doubt deciding the impending fed meeting was sufficient reason to take profits in the wash up the final score was materials versus the rest big falls in copper nickel and gold had materials down 1 6

of commodities china s assets supervision and administration commission has ordered state enterprises to control risks and limit their exposure to overseas commodities markets companies have been

australian fair work commission yesterday announced a 2 5 rise in the minimum wage which has been met with angry backlash from business bodies pandemic hit industries will be granted a delay but elsewhere it s a kick us when we re down issue not to mention the impact on wage inflation the trade off will be the cost to businesses against the surge in consumer spending that extra 18 80 per week

the charts with a mere 3 2 on the downside we see austal asb taking another dive 5 7 following cuts in earnings forecasts from brokers post the company s profit warning albeit three of four covering fnarena database brokers retain buy ratings this morning s fed statement and press conference has led to a dip on wall street but most notably a surge in the us dollar and a big wash out for gold the gold price has dropped from us 1900 oz to near us 1800 oz this week bitcoin has rallied from us 35 000 to us 38 500 just saying despite gold s crunch and some weakness on wall street our futures are up 6 points this morning mixed messages you can think of this meeting that we had as the talking about talking about meeting if you d like said the fed chair at last night s press conference i now suggest that we retire that term which has served its purpose when the fed statement was released prior to the conference wall street immediately homed in on the infamous dot plot which indicates the individual rate expectations of the 18 fomc members what leapt out was seven members expecting the first rate hike in 2022 up from four previously when to date jerome powell has targeted 2024 the dow fell 380 points the us ten year bond yield shot up 7 basis points the fed also lifted its 2021 inflation forecast to 3 0 from a prior 2 2 but did suggest this would drop sharply in 2022 in other words it will be transitory the panic nevertheless began to subside when powell began answering questions at the press conference he warned against reading too much into the dot plot saying the projections need to be taken with a big grain of salt in turn the market curtailed its losses in short powell threw a dovish bucket of water over what had appeared to be a more hawkish statement the only real change is that yes the fed will now begin to discuss the timing of tapering but will provide plenty of warning before that happens and it won t be happening soon as for rate hikes don t even think about it what powell has not achieved however is any end to the battle between the transitories and the structurals the debate will continue to rage on perhaps the most noteworthy market response other than the us dollar surging 1 was that the 7bps jump in the ten year to 1 57 resulted in outperformance in the nasdaq 0 2 vis a vis the dow 0 8 one would expect that to be the other way around while the impact of higher rates would be felt on the second and lower tier growth stocks the big guns of amazon and apple for example are too big too established and too defensive in their earnings as to not much care both those stocks closed higher on the day it is nonetheless a truth universally acknowledged that the smart money stays well out of the one and a half hours of trading post fed

tapering could happen sooner rather than later with most policymakers open to short term rate hikes in 2023 policymakers at the federal reserve on wednesday restated their commitment to keeping a lid on long term interest rates saying they ll continue buying 80 billion in long term treasurys and 40 billion in mortgage backed securities each month until substantial further progress has been made toward the fed s employment and price stability goals but the federal open market committee s dot plot now shows a growing consensus for boosting the short term federal funds twice by the end of 2023 all but five of the committee s 18 members anticipate at least one increase last year the committee brought the federal funds rate the rate banks pay for overnight loans to 0 percent in an attempt to lessen the economic impacts of the pandemic with increases typically implemented 25 basis points at a time two rate increases would bring the federal funds rate back to 0 5 percent with inflation already exceeding the fed s 2 percent target many economists expect the fed to at least signal its intentions to tighten in the future by tapering its purchases of treasury and mortgage bonds the fed will telegraph any moves in advance to avoid a repeat of the taper tantrum of 2013 that soured investors on bonds driving up long term interest rates although the fed was not expected to act at this meeting committee members views on recent inflation data are closely watched in a statement members of the federal open market committee acknowledged worries about inflation but said that for now they re willing to let inflation rise moderately above 2 percent for some time as long as longer term expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors the committee said overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to u s households and businesses the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remain mike fratantoni chief economist for the mortgage bankers association noted that even though the committee characterized inflationary pressures as being largely due to transitory factors this recognizes that some of the price increases are likely to persist for a longer period longer term interest rates including mortgage rates jumped earlier this year as vaccinations began and the government pushed more fiscal stimulus into the economy fratantoni said in the past few months mortgage rates have moved within a very narrow range while the fed has not yet laid out specific plans with respect to tapering their treasury and purchases the changes in their forecasts for the economy and for their rate target suggests that tapering is close at hand as a result mortgage rates are likely primed to move at least somewhat higher pantheon macroeconomics chief economist ian shepherdson said the shift in the dot plot presumably means that more members now are ready to talk tapering so federal reserve chairman jerome powell is not going to be able to repeat his march april stonewalling he s not going to fold though and we expect him just to acknowledge that the discussion is underway but that a firm decision is a way off pending more information on inflation and the labor market after the summer at a press conference after wednesday s meeting powell promised the fed will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases but investors seemed to agree that tapering now looks to be closer at hand with yields on 10 year treasury notes a key indicator of where mortgage rates might be headed up by more than 10 basis points as investors shunned bonds in their latest monthly forecast economists with fannie mae s economic and strategic research group said soaring home prices and rents could drive inflation out of the federal reserve s comfort zone that could result in higher interest rates which would be another potential drag on sales fannie mae economists downgraded their forecast for second and third quarter home sales largely due to the ongoing lack of available listings and a softening pace of new construction due to supply constraints affecting homebuilders critics say that if the fed waits too long to raise rates it could fuel runaway inflation or speculation that leads to a financial crisis in a guest essay for the new york times former investment banker william cohan said the fed should begin tapering its bond purchases and keep doing it even after the markets have their tantrum anyone borrowing money in this country that s an awful lot of people prefers low interest rates cohan wrote there s the federal government which owes creditors more than 28 trillion every day according to the peterson foundation the government spends nearly 800 million on interest to service the growing federal debt corporations also love low interest rates they make borrowing money cheap and thus corporate profits plentiful the cost of a home mortgage remains historically low but at some point cohan wrote the years of excess in the financial markets will likely lead to a volcanic economic disruption capital markets will seize up and debt and equity financing will be largely unavailable years of economic pain and turmoil will follow with the worst of it as ever borne by those least able to handle its consequences just as in the aftermath of 2008 the blame will be diffuse email matt carter
the news of the end of slavery in america was delivered to slaves in texas in 1865 more than two years after lincoln declared the end to slavery washington the end of slavery in the united states is often recognized by president abraham lincoln s emancipation proclamation of 1863 but the day commemorating the freedom of african americans juneteenth june 19 was recognized only after the last slaves were told about the president s order nearly 2 1 2 years later on thursday president joe biden signed legislation establishing a new federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery saying he believes it will go down as one of the greatest honors he has as president why is it called juneteenth the word juneteenth is a combination of the month and date that the holiday is observed on june 19 on that day in 1865 union troops led by maj gen gordon granger arrived in galveston texas with news that the civil war was over and that all remaining slaves were free lincoln announced the emancipation proclamation that had declared their freedom in september 1862 the order was issued during the civil war and effective january 1 1863 granger read general order no 3 after his arrival the people of texas are informed that in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the united states all slaves are free this involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired laborer why it took so long to get the news to texas remains unclear according to juneteenth com one belief is that a messenger sent to give word of the newly declared freedoms was murdered another is that the news was deliberately withheld by slave owners and there was the fact that there were few union soldiers in texas to deliver the news according to historian henry louis gates jr the order did not mean immediate freedom for many of texas 250 000 slaves it was the owners who were tasked with delivering the news on plantations masters had to decide when and how to announce the news or wait for a government agent to arrive and it was not uncommon for them to delay until after the harvest gates said in a blog published by the root and pbs in some cases slaves who tried to exercise their newly proclaimed freedoms were killed gates wrote in 1980 texas was the first state to make juneteenth a holiday others followed suit in the four decades since a handful have made it a paid holiday while most others give the day an official observance or recognition hawaii and south dakota remain the only states that do not recognize juneteenth according to the congressional research service there is a flag for juneteenth it features a 12 pointed star with a white 5 pointed star inside it they appear on top of a blue and red background l j graf one of the banner s designers wrote that the juneteenth flag represents the history and freedom of enslaved people and their descendants graf says the design of the juneteenth flag depicts a bursting new star on the horizon the star represents a new freedom a new people a new star the red white and blue colors communicate that the american slaves and their descendants were all americans
business federal reserve now projects rate increases in 2023 the federal reserve left rates unchanged and said it would continue buying bonds as the economy continues to recover the federal reserve will have to weigh signs of economic resurgence against the reality that millions of workers have yet to return to the labor market stefani reynolds the new york times federal reserve officials signaled wednesday that they expected to raise interest rates from rock bottom sooner than they had previously forecast and that they were taking baby steps toward reducing their vast bond purchases tweaks that together demonstrated their increasing confidence that the economy would rebound robustly from the pandemic fed policymakers expect to make two interest rate increases by the end of 2023 the central bank s updated summary of economic projections showed wednesday previously more than half of officials had anticipated that rates would stay near zero where they have been since march 2020 into at least 2024 officials now see rates rising to 0 6 by the end of 2023 up from 0 1 advertisement the fed chair jerome powell played down the significance of those tentative rate forecasts during a post meeting news conference emphasizing that borrowing costs would remain low for a long time but he also spoke optimistically about the economic outlook and said the central bank was beginning to discuss when and how it should slow its other key monetary policy huge purchases of government backed debt that it carries out to stoke demand the central bank s increasingly buoyant take on the economy partly reflects that vaccines have become widespread in the united states diminishing the risk that another wave of coronavirus infections will drive the economy back to a standstill as businesses are able to reopen the labor market is healing prices are rebounding from a pandemic era slump and overall growth is surging progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states the fed said in its statement which contained several upbeat revisions progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy but risks to the economic outlook remain powell sounded more positive about the outlook than he had just a few months ago though he retained a note of caution we re going to be in a very strong labor market pretty quickly here he said while adding that the fed was in no rush to raise interest rates and that whenever liftoff comes policy will remain highly accommodative advertisement he warned later that the economy was not out of the woods at this point and it would be premature to declare victory policymakers on wednesday left interest rates near zero where they have been since march 2020 they also promised to continue buying about 120 billion per month in treasury securities and other government backed bonds low rates and bond purchases work together to allow money to flow easily through the economy fueling stronger demand that can help speed up growth and job market healing but it was the shift in tone that captured investors attention the stock market which had been relatively flat through the morning dropped after the central bank released its projections the s p 500 closed the day down 0 5 bond markets also shifted with the yield on the 10 year treasury note rising sharply to 1 56 as traders priced in the chance that the fed could raise interest rates slightly more quickly than previously expected they basically took out the downsides from the virus michelle meyer head of u s economics at bank of america said of the fed s statement economic data have offered a series of surprises since the fed met in late april and since it last released economic projections in march employers have been hiring more slowly than they were this spring as job openings abound but it takes workers time to fill them inflation data have come in faster than officials had expected with prices for used cars rising and airplane fares snapping back and consumer and market expectations for future inflation have climbed advertisement but the fed continued to call those price increases largely transitory in its new statement and powell reiterated that he and his colleagues expected price gains to moderate over time as bottlenecks were resolved bringing consumer demand back into balance with what producers could supply our expectation is that these high inflation readings that we re seeing now will start to abate powell said adding that if prices moved up in a way that was inconsistent with the fed s goal central bankers would be prepared to react by reducing monetary policy support there s a lot of uncertainty powell acknowledged if inflation or expectations jump materially above what we would see as consistent with our goals and persistently so we wouldn t hesitate to use our tools to address that officials have repeatedly pledged to continue to support the economy until the pandemic shock is well behind the united states specifically they have said that they want to achieve substantial progress toward their two economic goals maximum employment and stable inflation before slowing their bond purchases the bar for raising interest rates is even higher officials have said they want to see the job market back at full strength and inflation on track to average 2 over time before they will lift interest rates from rock bottom powell suggested wednesday that while the economy had not yet cleared the substantial progress hurdle it was getting closer while reaching the standard of substantial further progress is still a ways off participants expect that progress will continue powell said he said that the committee was now preparing to talk about a plan for tapering off its bond buying adding we will provide advance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases advertisement rate increases he said remain far in the future though perhaps not quite as distant as before if the forecasts are right based on central bankers fresh projections released wednesday the median fed official expected to achieve the central bank s goals and lift rates by late 2023 the fed s interest rate projections showed that more than half of its 18 officials expected rate increases by the end of that year more but not quite half expected an increase or two in 2022 that markup came as fed officials offered headier economic forecasts they now see growth coming in stronger in 2021 and expect inflation to average 3 4 in the final three months of the year they expect that headline inflation gauge to retreat quickly however falling to 2 1 next year and 2 2 in 2023 washington is paying close attention to the fed s views on inflation as president joe biden tries to rally congressional support for his 4 trillion economic agenda a senior white house official seized on the fed s revised economic forecasts saying that they showed biden s policies so far were working to heal the economy and supported the idea that inflation would be short lived persistently higher inflation could make it more difficult for democrats to make a case for additional spending on priorities like infrastructure even though the suggested outlays would trickle out over time republicans have blasted the spike in prices as a sign of economic mismanagement while the white house maintains that higher prices are likely to fade the current burst of inflation we ve seen reflects the difficulties of reopening an economy that s been shut down janet yellen the treasury secretary said in response to lawmaker questions during testimony before the senate finance committee earlier wednesday advertisement some republican politicians have questioned whether emergency monetary policy settings remain necessary as the economy reopens and growth rebounds the fed has been clear that while it may be starting to lay the early groundwork it is in no rush to withdraw its support quickly that patience owes in part to its new policy strategy the economy experienced years of plodding growth after the 2007 09 recession and inflation drifted lower threatening a downward spiral in light of that the fed adopted a new approach to monetary policy last summer that shoots for periods of slightly higher inflation while aiming for full employment as an broad based and inclusive goal given its new framework the fed is willing to tolerate periods of inflation above 2 that is relevant now given that its preferred inflation gauge came in at 3 6 in april compared with the previous year and is likely to jump even higher in may the more up to date consumer price index was up 5 in the year through last month partly as the figures were compared with very low readings last year if inflation were to take off in a lasting way contrary to the fed s expectations and the central bank were forced to lift interest rates to slow the economy and tame price pressures that could be bad news rapid rate adjustments have a track record of causing recessions which throw vulnerable workers out of jobs but the fed tries to balance risks when setting policy and so far it has seen the risk of pulling back support early as the one to avoid millions of jobs are still missing since the start of the pandemic and monetary policy could help to keep the economy recovering briskly so that displaced employees have a better chance of finding new work advertisement there s still a long way to go david beckworth a senior research fellow at the mercatus center at george mason university said of the path ahead for the fed this is the next phase and it s a lighter touch phase but it s not the beginning of a tightening cycle

of service sometimes to their attorneys sometimes with different people and really explain the differences that they might be accustomed to having he added while mentioning differences in contracts and how contingencies are handled while the second home market will undoubtedly continue to include and be driven by well to do homebuyers like umansky s pacaso co founder austin allison said co ownership models are opening the door for everyday professionals to get their piece of the second home pie we re on a mission to make second homeownership possible and enjoyable for more people and we do that through this concept of co ownership which basically means that a small group of vetted families are able to own a home together and our company provides a service that manages all the details from designing the home to paying the bills to coordinating repairs and maintenance allison said what makes the concept really timely in this environment is that there s a lot of people who are now rethinking how and where they live and work post pandemic and second homes are more top of mind than ever before he added the number one thing that prevents people from realizing their dream of second homeownership is cost and the number two thing is hassle allison said co ownership models are an additional path to sustainability for the second home market and provide an avenue for homebuyers to snap up luxury homes that have been languishing on the market due to price is taking people who would have otherwise been buying at the median price and it s moving them into the luxury price tier he explained so if you re a family in san francisco and have 750 000 to spend in napa tahoe or truckee you re buying at the median price there what pacaso does is make better use of the existing housing stock because a lot of these second homes sit vacant and in markets like napa and many other parts of the country you actually are not allowed to rent these homes out on a short term basis he added these homes sit vacant for 10 to 11 months per year and the only thing better than building new homes to keep up with the demand is to make better use of the existing housing stock although the co ownership model lowers the financial barrier to second homeownership umansky said the model also lowers the future financial return of owning a second home outright i think it s fun for people to be able to own homes they generally wouldn t be able to own because of the affordability concept but keep in mind if you re buying a vacation home it doesn t generally sit empty unless you can afford to let it sit empty he said one of the advantages of having a secondary or tertiary homeownership is that you can lease it out and in many cases you can actually have a positive cash flow the positive cash flow is actually paying off the mortgage and at the end of 15 to 20 years you ll own a whole bunch of property that you ve been able to enjoy and have an amazing retirement fund that hopefully has appreciated as well he added allison said he agreed with the perceived downside to co ownership models but said homeowners who use pacaso aren t necessarily concerned with real estate investing and are more focused on the personal benefit of owning a getaway spot one of the things that we found in our survey and just in lots of conversations with our owners is many people don t really like the idea of having renters in their home he said they actually prefer the peace of mind of knowing that it s just a small group of other like minded owners that are using the home with them both agreed that co ownership and traditional homeownership models have their merits and are both crucial to keeping the second home market humming as americans figure out what late stage pandemic life looks like there are different flavors of ice cream in an ice cream shop right umansky said just like that i think there s room for both and they give a different opportunity email marian mcpherson
washington jun 16 efe the united states federal reserve on wednesday left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a target range of between zero and 0 25 percent at the conclusion of a two day meeting which took place amid growing concerns about inflation new us growth projections also were released in conjunction with the meeting of the federal open market committee the bank s policy making body with the median 2021 forecast by participants climbing to 7 percent up from 6 5 percent in march that level of economic expansion would be the highest since the 1980s progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of covid 19 in the united states amid this progress and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened the fomc said in a press release with respect to inflation a major concern in financial markets after the us consumer price index moved up 5 percent in may from a year earlier the meeting participants acknowledged the growing price pressure by raising their median 2021 inflation forecast to 3 4 percent up from 2 4 percent in march fed chair jerome powell however sought to dampen those concerns on wednesday saying in a press conference that the recent price hikes are due to specific temporary factors and noting that he and his central bank colleagues expect that inflation will move back down next year and remain around the fed s target level of 2 percent in 2023 even so he acknowledged that price volatility is certainly possible as the country recovers from the coronavirus crisis as the reopening continues shifts in demand can be large and rapid and bottlenecks hiring difficulties and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect powell said the central bank reiterated that it will continue to buy around 120 billion in bonds each month to provide additional support for the us recovery participants however expect continued progress ahead toward the objective of substantial further progress powell said and assuming that is the case it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting with respect to the federal funds rate which is the rate banks charge each other for short term borrowing the fed s new so called dot plot indicated that central bank officials are leaning toward two hikes of that benchmark rate by the end of 2023 powell however said in his press conference that those projected hikes which would be the first since 2018 should be taken with a big big grain of salt these are of course individual projections they re not a committee forecast they re not a plan and we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year because discussing liftoff now would be highly premature it wouldn t make any sense the fed chairman said in terms of unemployment the central bank s projected 2021 jobless rate of 4 5 percent was unchanged from its march forecast although the us unemployment rate fell by three tenths of a percentage point in may to 5 8 percent marking the first time it has fallen below 6 percent since the start of the pandemic the rate of job creation has been lower than expected the recovery is incomplete and risks to the economic outlook remain as with overall economic activity conditions in the labor market have continued to improve although the pace of improvement has been uneven powell said the next meeting of the fomc is scheduled for july 27 28 efe afs mc
the news of the end of slavery in america was delivered to slaves in texas in 1865 more than two years after lincoln declared the end to slavery washington the end of slavery in the united states is often recognized by president abraham lincoln s emancipation proclamation of 1863 but the day commemorating the freedom of african americans juneteenth june 19 was recognized only after the last slaves were told about the president s order nearly 2 1 2 years later on thursday president joe biden signed legislation establishing a new federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery saying he believes it will go down as one of the greatest honors he has as president why is it called juneteenth the word juneteenth is a combination of the month and date that the holiday is observed on june 19 on that day in 1865 union troops led by maj gen gordon granger arrived in galveston texas with news that the civil war was over and that all remaining slaves were free lincoln announced the emancipation proclamation that had declared their freedom in september 1862 the order was issued during the civil war and effective january 1 1863 granger read general order no 3 after his arrival the people of texas are informed that in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the united states all slaves are free this involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired laborer why it took so long to get the news to texas remains unclear according to juneteenth com one belief is that a messenger sent to give word of the newly declared freedoms was murdered another is that the news was deliberately withheld by slave owners and there was the fact that there were few union soldiers in texas to deliver the news according to historian henry louis gates jr the order did not mean immediate freedom for many of texas 250 000 slaves it was the owners who were tasked with delivering the news on plantations masters had to decide when and how to announce the news or wait for a government agent to arrive and it was not uncommon for them to delay until after the harvest gates said in a blog published by the root and pbs in some cases slaves who tried to exercise their newly proclaimed freedoms were killed gates wrote in 1980 texas was the first state to make juneteenth a holiday others followed suit in the four decades since a handful have made it a paid holiday while most others give the day an official observance or recognition hawaii and south dakota remain the only states that do not recognize juneteenth according to the congressional research service there is a flag for juneteenth it features a 12 pointed star with a white 5 pointed star inside it they appear on top of a blue and red background l j graf one of the banner s designers wrote that the juneteenth flag represents the history and freedom of enslaved people and their descendants graf says the design of the juneteenth flag depicts a bursting new star on the horizon the star represents a new freedom a new people a new star the red white and blue colors communicate that the american slaves and their descendants were all americans
president joe biden and russian president vladimir putin meeting in person june 16 the white house announcing the meeting saying the two leaders quote will discuss the full range of pressing issues as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the us russia relationship unquote it will take place in geneva at the end of biden s first trip abroad to europe in march biden called putin a killer moscow then recalled its ambassador to washington the kremlin said in its own statement quote we intend to discuss the state and prospects of further development of russian american relations problems of strategic stability as well as topical issues on the international agenda including interaction in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the settlement of regional conflicts unquote advertisement biden and putin are to meet on wednesday the two leaders have divergent goals for the summit share copy link copy an american president won t side with moscow over his own intelligence agencies there will be no talk of a reset in russian relations and it is highly doubtful that anyone will gaze into vladimir putin s eyes and discuss his soul but beyond that it s not clear what will happen wednesday in geneva when president joe biden meets putin for the first time since taking office both sides acknowledge that the relationship between the two nations is dismal and neither holds out much hope for meaningful areas of agreement still each man brings his own goals to the summit table a look at what each president is hoping to achieve in switzerland what biden wantsbiden and his aides have made clear that he will not follow in the footsteps of his recent predecessors by aiming to radically alter the united states ties to russia instead the white house is looking for a more modest though still vitally important goal to move toward a more predictable relationship and attempt to rein in russia s disruptive behavior biden s first overseas trip was deliberately sequenced so that he will meet with putin only after spending days meeting with european allies and powerful democracies including a gathering at nato the decades old alliance formed to serve as a bulwark to russian aggression he hoped to project a sense of unity and renewed cooperation after four years of tumult under former president donald trump who often tried to cozy up to the russian president biden will push putin to stop meddling in democratic elections to ease tensions with ukraine and to stop giving safe harbor to hackers carrying out cyber and ransomware attacks aides believe that lowering the temperature with russia will also reinforce the united states ties to democracies existing in moscow s shadow national security adviser jake sullivan said biden will look for areas where in our common interest we can work together to produce outcomes that are that work for the united states and for the american people sullivan who briefed reporters on air force one heading to brussels for the nato summit said that biden s other message would be more stick than carrot how do we send a clear message about those harmful activities that we will not tolerate and to which we will respond there have been brief moments of common ground moscow and washington have shown a shared interest in restarting talks on strategic stability to work out a follow up deal to the new start the last remaining u s russian arms control pact that was extended for five years in january biden will exhort putin on human rights including the poisoning and imprisonment of dissident alexei navalny to not support the regime in belarus that carried out a recent skyjacking and to stop interfering with other nations elections cyber will also be a focal point with the geneva summit coming just days after nato expanded its article 5 mutual defense pact to include cyberattacks but the president acknowledged that there may be no way to keep putin in check there s no guarantee you can change a person s behavior or the behavior of his country autocrats have enormous power and they don t have to answer to a public said biden during a news conference sunday after the group of seven summit in england and the fact is that it may very well be if i respond in kind which i will that it doesn t dissuade him and he wants to keep going biden had not minced words when it comes to assessing putin he said in an interview earlier this year that he agreed with an assessment that putin was a killer and he once declared that putin didn t have a soul that was far colder rhetoric that his immediate predecessors trump spoke warmly of putin and was deferential to him during their one summit held in helsinki in 2018 in which he turned his back on his own intelligence agencies president barack obama s administration though wary of putin expressed hope in a reset and improvement of relations with moscow and george w bush said that he looked the man in the eye and found him very straightforward and trustworthy i was able to get a sense of his soul bush said biden won t what putin wantsputin also won t be expecting to warm up ties his main goal would be to draw his red lines to the new u s administration and negotiate a tense status quo that would protect moscow s vital interests the russian leader doesn t hope for a new détente to mend the rift caused by russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula nor does he count on a rollback of the crippling u s and eu sanctions that have restricted moscow s access to global financial markets and top western technologies putin s task now is more modest to spell out russia s top security concerns and try to restore basic channels of communication that would prevent an even more dangerous destabilization the main red line for moscow is ukraine s aspirations to join nato fearing its bid for the alliance membership putin responded to the 2014 ouster of ukraine s russia friendly president by annexing crimea and throwing moscow s weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country s eastern industrial heartland where the seven year conflict has killed more than 14 000 when tensions along the line of contact in ukraine s east rose earlier this year russia quickly beefed up its troops near ukraine and warned kiev s leaders that it would intervene militarily if they try to reclaim the rebel controlled regions by force moscow has since pulled back some of its forces from the border areas but the ukrainian leadership has said the bulk of them have remained close to the border in an interview with state tv last week putin described ukraine s bid to join nato as an existential challenge to russia that would allow the alliance s missiles to hit moscow and other targets in western russia in just seven minutes he compared it to russia deploying its missiles in canada or mexico near the u s border isn t it a red line he said while taking a tough stance on ukraine the russian leader could show a degree of flexibility on other global hotspots even though moscow has been critical of the u s led military campaign in afghanistan it s interested in a settlement that would prevent the country from plunging into chaos following the u s troops withdrawal later this year fearing that instability could spill into ex soviet central asia russia also has been involved in painstaking international talks to help repair a nuclear deal with iran that was spiked by trump and it has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the u s in efforts to restart the stalled mideast peace talks and the kremlin would be interested in working out a deal on syria where moscow s military campaign helped president bashar assad s government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war and the u s has maintained a limited military presence russia has said it s ready to include its prospective doomsday weapons such as the poseidon atomic powered nuclear armed underwater drone and the burevestnik nuclear powered cruise missile to the talks agenda on condition the u s brings its missile defense and possible space based weapons into the equation putin also has emphasized russia s readiness to make joint efforts to address climate change and cope with the coronavirus pandemic he called for establishing a dialogue on cybercrime noting that moscow could agree to extradite cybercrime suspects to the u s if washington takes the same obligation the white house has strongly downplayed the idea of a cybercriminal prisoner exchange

eight democrats vying to be new york city s next mayor sparred over the most pressing issues facing the nation s largest city on wednesday in the final debate of the democratic primary the two hour showdown presented the candidates with one last chance to make an impression on new yorkers before voters head to the polls next week brooklyn borough president eric adams is widely regarded as the front runner but the nomination is still considered up for grabs especially given the city s newly implemented ranked choice voting system here are five takeaways from the debate yang comes out swinging former 2020 presidential contender andrew yang didn t hesitate to go on the attack against adams chiding the brooklyn borough president early on in the debate over police union endorsements and claiming that adams had been passed up for their support over his call last summer for people to confront their neighbors directly over the use of fireworks once the front runner in the race yang is in need of a boost ahead of next week s primary recent polls have shown adams at or near the front of the pack and yang is hoping to supplant him in that position adams tried to rebut yang s claims saying that he never sought the endorsement of the new york police department s captains union which represented him during his days as a police captain and that union leaders knew that he had criticized police tactics that set off a stern response from yang who accused adams of being dishonest about not seeking the union s backing you can ask the head of the captains union eric yang said he ll say yes you did call him later in the debate when a moderator asked the candidates to name their opponents worst ideas yang again went after adams recalling how in 2018 adams had said he would bring a gun to church following a deadly mass shooting at a pittsburgh synagogue the progressive moderate divide was on full display despite new york city s national reputation as liberal hub the city isn t uniformly progressive and on wednesday the divide between progressives and moderates was hard to miss the divide became clear early on as the candidates debated crime and policing in the nation s most populous city when moderators asked the candidates at one point to raise their hands if they believe that more police officers should be put on the city s subways only three former civil rights lawyer maya wiley city comptroller scott stringer and former nonprofit executive dianne morales kept their hands down in a particularly heated moment former wall street executive raymond mcguire said that calls to defund the police will end up in disaster for new yorkers prompting an impassioned response from morales how dare you assume to speak for black and brown communities as a monolith morales said you cannot do that yes i can i just did mcguire who is black responded you know what else i m going to do i m going to do it again candidates don t hold their fire the eight person debate was punctuated by attack lines flung all over the debate stage with virtually no candidate emerging unscathed from digs from their democratic competitors much of the criticism was leveled at adams wiley and yang three contenders who have been polling well though lower polling candidates also drew barbs adams was rebuked over his plans to combat a rise in crime including instituting a plainclothes unit to combat gun violence yang specifically went after adams over past remarks calling on off duty cops to bring guns to church saying it was a reason he won an endorsement from the union that represents police captains despite adams belonging to that union when he was a cop they think i m a better pick than eric to keep us and our families safe yang said other remarks over law enforcement also produced sparks with centrist ray mcguire blasting plans to divert funds from law enforcement as efforts to defund the police and former new york city sanitation commissioner kathryn garcia adding that candidates advocating such policies need to sit down and think progressives returned fire with morales berating mcguire for saying he was speaking on behalf of communities of color let s exclude you mcguire responded let s not exclude me morales shot back crime racial justice emerge as flashpoints a rise in violent crime continued to be a driving force in the race with much of the debate centered around the candidates law enforcement plans adams garcia and yang cast themselves as allies of police with the trio of centrists saying law enforcement would be critical in combating the rise in crime while also facing reforms garcia said her plan would involve implementing a community policing model while adams tied reducing crime to the city s recovery from the pandemic the proliferation of guns in our city is destroying us said adams if we don t get gun violence under control it s going to stop our economic recovery meanwhile wiley and morales touted their plans to divert funds away from law enforcement and toward alternative community programs both progressives said their plans would be effective at both reducing crime and ameliorating sour relations between cops and communities of color what we have the opportunity to do right now is to be smart about growing public safety said wiley we are hiring police officers to do the job of social workers we are hiring police officers to do the job of psychologists we have the largest budget for our police force in the country if not in the world morales later added we have got to move away from these systems that oppress our communities no game changing moment wednesday s debate marked one of the last chances for the candidates to have a game changing moment before tuesday s primary that didn t happen while candidates threw punches throughout the two hour debate no contender landed a knockout blow and nobody suffered a serious gaffe that means that barring an unforeseen development in the final few days before voting ends the top tier of the field will continue to consist of adams wiley garcia and yang polls have shown adams consistently in the lead followed in some order by the remaining three candidates however surveys have shown wiley s stock rise as progressives coalesce around her campaign and garcia continues to enjoy increased support following endorsements from the new york times and the new york daily news meanwhile yang who started the race as a front runner has ceded ground to adams in the polls after the former police captain began to gain traction in recent months
in the final democratic primary debate for mayor the eight top contenders took to the stage at nbc in midtown manhattan and squared off over public safety and how to tackle poverty and homelessness wednesday night delivering some of the sharpest attacks of the campaign yet violent crime which has been on the rise for a year now remained a front and center issue and the race s frontrunner brooklyn borough president eric adams a former nypd captain continued to hammer away at it as the frontrunner adams has consistently taken heat from his opponents on his views though and wednesday was no exception he and entrepreneur andrew yang came out swinging early on over what set them apart on policing brooklyn borough president eric adams participates in the new york city democratic primary mayoral debate on wnbc on june 16 2021 yang mocked adams after winning an endorsement from the police union that represents him earlier this week and contested adams claim that he had not sought endorsements from law enforcement unions asked why voters concerned with an uptick in crime should pick him over the former cop yang pointed to the nod he received from the captains endowment association the people you should ask about this are eric s former colleagues in the police captains union yang said they think i m a better choice than eric to keep us and our families safe and the reason for this is they want someone honest as a partner who will actually follow through andrew yang participates in the new york city democratic primary mayoral debate on wnbc on june 16 2021 adams shot back that the cea didn t pick him because he didn t ask for their endorsement to which yang responded you met with the lieutenants and you called the captains eric when asked by the moderator if that was true adams responded no it s not yes it is eric yang responded no it s not adams said the debate which nbc broadcast from its saturday night live studio in rockefeller center is the third in a series of three showdowns sanctioned by the city s campaign finance board and served as the final forum for the candidates to make their case to voters before june 22 the final day for voting l r ray mcguire new york city comptroller scott stringer kathryn garcia brooklyn borough president eric adams andrew yang diana morales shaun donovan and maya wiley participate in the new york city democratic primary mayoral debate on wnbc tv on june 16 2021 maya wiley mayor de blasio s legal counsel who has surged in recent polls also went after adams for supporting stop and frisk and his plan to reconstitute the nypd s anti crime unit to tackle gun crime policies she described as racist adams jabbed back citing the fact that a private security patrol protects her block in brooklyn and reiterating his position that he would use stop and frisk but prohibit its abuse i don t and never will allow stop and frisk to be returned and abuse people he said wiley came under attack too for her positions on policing one of which is to strip the nypd of 1 billion and apply that money to social services programs i have been black all my life she said repeating a line she s used several times during the campaign what we have the opportunity to do right now is to be smart about growing public safety maya wiley participates in the new york city democratic primary mayoral debate on wnbc tv on june 16 2021 wiley went on to say that the city is now hiring cops to do the job of social workers to do the job of psychologists but ray mcguire the former citi executive who polls show has trailed in the single digits didn t appear to view wiley s plans as very smart he attacked both she and adams for their public safety proposals asking wiley pointedly how she would pay for her plan ray mcguire participates in the new york city democratic primary mayoral debate on wnbc tv on june 16 2021 it s neither stop and frisk nor is it defund he said referring to adam s support of stop and frisk and wiley s calls to strip the police of funding former sanitation commissioner kathryn garcia also criticized plans to defund the police though she did not call wiley out by name several of my opponents are using hashtags hashtag defund the police i just don t think that s the right approach she said you need to sit down and really think through these things recent polls have consistently shown adams leading the field with garcia wiley and yang all within striking distance a marist poll conducted last week showed adams ahead with 28 support from those surveyed garcia garnering 19 wiley with 17 and yang with 15 the other four candidates on the debate stage wednesday night city comptroller scott stringer former hud secretary shaun donovan former non profit exec dianne morales and mcguire all trailed with numbers in the single digits according to that poll when factoring in ranked choice voting the poll projected adams as the winner with 56 and garcia coming in second with 44 but a separate poll released wednesday predicted a shift that poll conducted by change research from june 11 14 projected garcia would come out on top 51 to 49 once ranked choice is accounted for the candidates relative proximity in the polls is likely one reason why their rhetoric became so heated wednesday night but it wasn t just the top four candidates trading barbs the candidates toward the back of the pack also tried to make up ground with attacks of their own stringer who dipped in polls after two women accused him of sexual harassment charges he s denied went after yang for his basic income plan which would provide a stipend to poor new yorkers as well as his plan to tackle street homelessness yang described a woman in hell s kitchen who was punched in the face by a homeless man and said the issues the street homeless pose are driving new yorkers from the city families are leaving yang said i m going to rebuild the stock of psych beds in our city because the number has gone down 14 percent it should be going up 100 percent stringer then chimed in that is the greatest non answer i ve ever heard in all of our debates not one specific idea not one specific plan he said how much is this going to cost garcia said she would focus on building 50 000 units of affordable housing and 10 000 units of supportive housing to address the problem we also need to increase the voucher that the city gives to people to something close to the market she said all the candidates agreed on one thing though when asked if they would offer mayor de blasio a job in their administration if elected each candidate said no check out our special section for the latest news on the critical 2021 elections in nyc and to have the essential news and analysis sent to your inbox sign up for our
