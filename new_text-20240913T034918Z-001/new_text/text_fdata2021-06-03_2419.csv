it was not long ago when exxon mobil corp stylized as exxonmobil was the most valuable company in the world as recently as 2013 exxon s market value topped that of every single other company on the planet of course it was also around that time when crude oil was last trading above 100 per barrel exxon s star has fallen in recent years the fossil fuel giant imprudently bet big on natural gas at the market peak compared to competitors exxon was late to the american shale oil boom exxonmobil s stock was booted from the dow jones industrial average a benchmark index it had been a part of for 92

announced plans to take on the exxonmobil board and force the oil and gas giant to reform its approach to climate change in advance of the exxonmobil annual meeting of shareholders engine no 1 and exxon exchanged a series of increasingly barbed communications regarding carbon emissions and the broader direction of the company surrounding environmental issues engine no 1 claimed to be addressing the concern among investors for companies to actively tackle the long term business risks of climate change the hedge fund sought to have exxon gradually but purposefully reposition their businesses for the energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward more sustainable forms of energy production for its part exxonmobil claimed to be reducing its own emissions consistent with the goals of the paris agreement and claimed to have made attempts to reach a resolution with engine no 1 the exchange of messages culminated with engine no 1 making four nominations to exxon s 12 person board of directors following a vote on may 26 eight of exxon s nominees to its board of directors including ceo darren woods were re elected but two of engine no 1 s nominees were also elected to the board

reading time 5 minutes global equities markets firmed on wednesday ahead of key us economic data due later in the week as investors weighed inflation concerns and a fresh surge in so called meme stocks oil prices hit the highest level in more than a year on lift from a decision by opec and allies to stick to the plan to gradually restore supply along with the slow pace of nuclear talks between iran and the united states wall street s main indexes ended the session mixed after erasing earlier gains near midday trading led by a jump in shares of amc entertainment holdings which nearly doubled in price on wednesday this breathtaking rally saw the theater chain operator s shares closed up 95 2 at 62 55 a fresh record which affected a group of stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as reddit s wall street bets this comes despite wary investors remaining unconvinced by central bank assurances that the current inflation upsurge is transitory the pan european stoxx 600 index rose 0 28 and msci s gauge of stocks which tracks shares in 50 countries gained 0 09 markets are being driven less by fundamentals than at anytime in recent memory said howard fischer a partner with law firm moses singer as the meme stock frenzy continues the apparent disconnect between asset values and asset prices continues to widen predictions that prices and inherent value will eventually converge have so far proven baseless the us federal reserve will begin to unwind the corporate bond holdings it acquired last year through an emergency lending facility launched to calm credit markets at the height of the pandemic the central bank announced on wednesday central bank officials said in its beige book report released earlier on wednesday that the us recovery accelerated in recent weeks even as a long list of supply chain troubles hiring difficulties and rising prices cascaded through the country this comes after a strong expansion in european and us factory activity in may had lifted world shares to record highs on tuesday a weekly unemployment report and may private payrolls data on thursday will be followed by monthly jobs numbers on friday with investors looking for signs of an economic rebound and rising inflation yet ahead of friday s crucial us jobs data traders eagerly aim to assess what the increasing evidence of a faster than expected economic recovery would mean for central bank policy in europe and the united states the dow jones industrial average rose 25 07 points or 0 07 to 34 600 38 the s p 500 gained 6 08 points or 0 14 to 4 208 12

priced in said chris zaccarelli chief investment officer at independent advisor alliance in charlotte north carolina inflation and job growth will continue to be debated he said with the fed and many bond market investors confident that price increases will remain temporary others will cast a more skeptical eye on the conversation brent rose 1 1 or 1 6 to settle at 71 35 a barrel it reached 71 48

inventories fell last week while fuel stockpiles rose according to two market sources citing american petroleum institute figures on wednesday while broader stock markets remain close to record highs the momentum of earlier in the year has ebbed as investors begin to worry a stronger than expected rebound from covid 19 means higher inflation and sooner than expected monetary policy tightening economies are recovering much faster than anticipated data on wednesday showed australia s economy racing ahead last quarter as consumers and businesses spent with abandon lifting output back above where it was last year before the pandemic shrugging off inflation data while investors have built sizable short positions against the us dollar more broadly they are worried over a potential hawkish

have largely shrugged off tuesday s data showing euro zone inflation rose to 2 in may a sign that markets were confident the european central bank would not decide to slow the pace of its bond buys when it meets on june 10 keep a close eye on the us 10 year treasury note as long as rates stay safely below 2 percent then relative calm should reign in the stock markets but a sharp rise in rates could cause a more violent rotation out of tech and communication services and into financials and materials added independent advisor alliance s zaccarelli but patrick leary who serves as the chief market strategist and senior trader at in capital in minneapolis said he sees a great deal of uncertainty about inflation the fed keeps saying that inflation will be transitory and for now markets are comfortable with that narrative said leary adding that he sees the central bank as intentionally trying to overheat the economy to drive employment lower unfortunately this is also going to lead to inflation

part 1 of our interview monash investors co founder and director simon shields showed us 2 quality asx stocks with still low pe ratios now in part 2 he reveals the fintech share that he s proud to have bought at 5 then exited at 153 overrated and underrated shares the motley fool what s your most underrated stock at the moment simon shields people infrastructure ltd asx ppe is the most underrated stock mf what do you think is the most overrated stock at the moment ss now the most overrated stock is sadly i m going to say flight centre travel group ltd asx flt because everybody loves flight centre as a business it s been around for a long time in fact it was a store rollout story in its day it s a great australian business it s a global company but that drag it s got from having those bricks and mortar stores it s just been a huge loser from covid it s already had to do a couple of capital risings with the lag that we re seeing in the recovery i dare say it s probably going to have to do another one capable people are giving it the benefit of doubt because of course when travel starts back there ll be a huge boom in travel no question about that but it keeps receding and that s the problem mf did you once hold it then exited or have you never held it ss we ve long and shorted the stock and we re currently short mf if the market closed tomorrow for 5 years which stock would you want to hold ss electro optic systems holdings ltd asx eos it s australia s probably major defence stock and fantastic technology in laser targeting for use in space communications tracking satellites space junk and by the military and it s just got a very long pipeline of contracts that it s going to be bidding on and almost certainly likely to win a very large percentage of those given its leadership in those areas mf it s been around for a while hasn t it ss it has and so if you think why might the market be closed for five years well i think a defence stock in that circumstance would go pretty well looking back mf which stock are you most proud of from a past purchase ss afterpay ltd asx apt we didn t buy afterpay in the ipo because we were concerned about this new product and the bad debts it could have so we didn t get into it until it got to 5 of course it listed at 1 so at 5 you d think we ve missed it but our valuation was much much higher and what was driving our valuation was first of all how we could see it was such an easy sell for the company they had the metrics because it was all about online sales they could increase the s online sales by 10 or 15 and so it was such an easy thing for a merchant to adopt it the second thing we could see the behaviour by the customers that they would maybe use it once every 3 months in the first year but in the second year they d be using twice every 3 months and by the time it got to the fourth year they were using it over 20 times a year although we d been buying and selling all the way through we actually sold out our last shares at 153 what was really pleasing about that we were very clear in what we thought each geographic region was worth so australia we thought was worth 7 the united states we thought was worth 70 for example it was putting all those geographic regions together got us to our price target and when our price target was met then we sold out just on the reason for that it s the great thing about doing that assessed valuation when we sold at 150 we were getting paid for everything we thought afterpay was going to do for the next 8 or 9 years so there s no point hanging around waiting for the next 8 or 9 years to see if it was going to do it because we re getting paid for it and that s why we sold that s the whole theory behind the assessed valuation mf is there a move that you regret from the past for example a missed opportunity or buying a stock at the wrong timing or price ss i regret not making a lot of money from altium limited asx alu altium was a stock that i first came across in the tech boom in the late 1990s and knew the business really really well then it sort of drifted actually after the tech wreck and didn t do all that well they remembered me too i did a company visit with them and they were asking me what i thought of their business strategy and i said well i think you should go to subscription rather than just sell upfront and unbeknownst to me they did that and then the next thing i know the stock s taken off and i felt like i d missed it and of course i hadn t missed it and it kept going so that was my big regret mf how do you feel about altium at the moment it s discounted from the highs of the past couple of years ss yeah so i mean look it was interesting during covid they found that the sales fell back and i just wondered to what extent the issues around china and australia might be hampering their sales at the moment it s hard to tell also they ve had to do a fair bit of discounting to try and meet their targets and that s always a real red flag so we re wary of it at the moment mf last thoughts ss look as investors we re dealing with uncertainty and all we can try and do is secure the odds in our favour as much as possible even then sometimes we won t have good periods because it s a question of are the opportunities there generally there s always going to be some opportunities out there the other thing is can we find them sometimes they re easier to find but other times there are less opportunities and they re harder to find all i d say is that nobody i don t think is consistently just finding them all the time but generally over time you can see if somebody does a good job or not

recorded on may 24 2021 jason moser it s monday may 24th i m your host jason moser on this week s financial show we re going to dig a little bit deeper into the prospects of inflation how that relates to all of the volatility we ve seen in the crypto markets recently sofi is getting ready to go public we re going to talk a little bit more about that and what investors can expect as well as some recent earnings from sofi also square is raising some money we ll talk a little bit about what they might do with the 2 billion that they are going to be raising as always we ll have one to watch for you to wrap up the show and as always i ve got my partner in crime here with me this week it s certified financial planner mr matt frankel matt how is everything going matt frankel just great it s a brutally hot day in south carolina moser it was brutally hot here in virginia yesterday but it cooled down a little bit today we got a nice little break from things i guess for guys like you we were talking before taping they re in the middle of installing the pool at your house and the heat i m sure has just got you very impatient frankel yes very much so my kids more than me don t understand why they can t just go jump in it right now moser isn t that always the way well matt this has been an interesting week here there has been a lot of volatility and a lot of news a lot of headlines devoted to cryptocurrencies recently we ll talk a little bit about that coupled with that though the results we saw an interesting article here recently in the wall street journal that talked a little bit more about inflation and exactly how that may be presenting itself in the economy today let s talk a little bit first about inflation where we think things could be headed and what that could mean for investors because generally speaking when you talk about inflation that s not something that is clearly detrimental to stocks but it s absolutely something that can play into growth expectations and performance investors need to take this stuff they need to keep this stuff in mind as we see the potential here for inflation to start i m going to possibly accelerate a little bit here in the coming months and even quarters frankel right now we just saw the april inflation data showed that consumer prices rose a little over 4 year over year 4 2 that s definitely above the fed s 2 inflation target the question is are we going to see a short term bump in inflation due to the reopening just a one time demand rushes into the market we see a little inflation all of a sudden worse it can be more of a prolonged trend as they ve thrown trillions of dollars of stimulus into the economy they ve been printing money for a couple of years now is that going to cause a lot of inflationary pressure on the back end we ve recently seen wage growth is at the highest it s been in a long time which could also help play into inflation it s not necessarily a good or bad thing for your stock portfolio it depends what you re investing in the traditional hedge against inflation is always thought to be gold or silver precious metals things like that which to be fair does a pretty good job of keeping up with inflation overtime not much more but they do hedge against inflation we ll get into the cryptocurrencies in a minute and i m sure jason has an opinion on it as i do but as far as the stock market goes if you re worried about inflation the best advice i can give is stick with companies that have a lot of pricing power for example if consumer prices rise by 10 apple has the ability to raise the price of their iphone by 10 and people are still going to buy it there are industries that are a lot more competitive and don t have quite as much pricing power so that s one thing to ask yourself if inflation really picks up what companies will be able to take advantage of the increases in prices being that this is the financial show banks are somewhat inflation protected because inflation generally comes with rising interest rates which if you are a business that lends money that s a good thing it s a fine balance between supply and demand if inflation stays at 4 like it is now which is a pretty elevated rate that could be a good thing for banks if rates tend to tick up if inflation jumps to 10 and interest rates really skyrocket out of control that will hurt consumer demand and it s bad for banks banks are what i call a moderate inflation hedge they tend to do well in periods of decent but controlled inflation then there are the big box stores and the dollar stores and things like that that tend to do pretty well during inflationary times because if you re going to go grocery shopping for example you re not going to get much cheaper than walmart or costco those tend to get people spending money no matter what the economy is doing it s not necessarily that you need to be out of stocks and into gold silver or cryptocurrencies if you believe inflation is really going to stay elevated for a while it s just to make sure you focus on the right companies that won t get crushed in an inflationary environment moser yeah i think you re right there and inflation it s an interesting thing to observe because one of the things that stands out to me just recently or at least looking at last week through the earnings releases and the calls for home depot and lowe s in the theme over the past couple of quarters if you ve been anywhere near the housing market then you probably know this but lumber prices have really taken off lumber prices have really taken off and what you see in the language in these calls is that while home depot and lowe s are able to continue selling that lumber because they typically have to that s that s a unique market they do start to recognize some gross margin pressure from that lumber they can only price it so much they can only realize so much pricing power on something like lumber before it starts to cap out and you see a little bit of gross margin pressure there to me that was one thing that stood out but also i wonder in regard to inflation it seems like right now we ve got a lot of interesting things going on we ve got the economy reopening we ve got a lot of stimulus out there we ve got folks who should have in theory some money to spend it sounds like but we ve also seen a supply chain crunch i m not talking about just semiconductors either this really does seem to be extending across all areas of the economy there are just some supply chain issues that are playing out when you start to have a limited supply of things and you ve got a surplus of the hot dollar surplus of money out there for people to be spending those are the conditions that inflation just loves frankel for sure we re definitely seeing a supply chain crunch that s why the lumber market is going so crazy a lot of that is supply chain so yeah that also can create inflationary pressures like you said there are certain things where there isn t that much pricing power you can only raise prices on lumber so much before people are going to stop building decks on their house and pump the brakes on unnecessary spending but at the same time i think like milk the price of milk can double and people are still going to buy the price of gas could double which it almost has from the past year the price of gas could double and people are still going to fill their tanks up there are a lot of industries that do have a lot of pricing power you ll see demand bend a little bit but demand is a lot more flexible in some industries than others moser yeah relatively elastic i d say it s just it s not going to really change much the gas is a perfect example there there was an interesting data point i was reading when i was reading through this piece and it just struck me that this is why we talk about it this data right here from early 1973 through last december shows that stocks deliver positive inflation adjusted returns in 90 of rolling 12 month periods that occurred when inflation was below 3 and rising now that number 90 falls to 48 during periods of time when inflation was above 3 and rising for those who asked why we are talking about this that s why we re talking about it because there is data out there that shows it does matter you have to be maybe a little bit more picky when it comes to your stock purchases now the flip side it s not just stocks that do this dance when inflation starts becoming more part of the conversation you mentioned gold and silver as being traditional hedges i think a lot of people are familiar with those recently clearly we ve been talking more and more about cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin being the standard i guess but then all of these other coins that come with the conversation crypto i think there s just a million different opinions out there you either buy into it or you don t i think it s probably safe to say that you and i are both a bit more on the skeptical side of things but generally speaking why would crypto be seen as a hedge to inflation frankel well first of all in the words of ringo starr i say this with peace and love i think the last week or so the price action in crypto currencies has shown that it is not a store of value yet whatever side of the argument you re on whether cryptocurrency is the future of finance or not a store value doesn t lose 20 of its value in a week that s not a story value that s literally the opposite of the store value that s evaporating value ethereum is the other one which i actually think has more potential than bitcoin in a lot of ways it s down 36 in the past week in one week i don t know if that s ever happened with the u s dollar where it s lost 20 of its value against any other major world currency in the span of a week it s not there yet the big argument why bitcoin is a hedge if you ask certain people is because there s a finite amount of it same reason that gold is a hedge the government can t just print more gold the government can t just print more bitcoin i buy that to a certain extent if we had reached the point where bitcoin was widespread adoption it was a readily usable currency it was an accepted store value by more than just 10 20 of the population which it is right now we re just not at the point where you can call bitcoin a store of value and you have to have it be a store of value before you can really call it a hedge against inflation the recent price action really in my mind invalidates the hedge argument moser yeah i think that makes perfect sense it really all boils down to the finite supply that makes perfect sense let s fast forward 10 years are we there in 10 years where bitcoin can be seen by most as a reasonable store of value i would assume that the way things are going we re probably going to continue to grow at least folks who see the merits of cryptocurrencies in whatever shape or form there s going to be i think continued adoption albeit probably somewhat slowly for the masses but at some point or another maybe we ll get there it s not to say we would never get there frankel there you go trying to bait me again i think it s a mistake for anybody to think of it as a given that we are eventually going to get to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies that s still very up in the air at this point during some of our bitcoin data reviews one of our experts that i interviewed i m not sure which one off the top of my head but one of them referred to what s going on right now as an inflection point where we re either going to see bitcoin accelerate into mass adoption or not it s not going to keep going at its current pace where you re going to have 10 20 adoption that subset of the population just believes in bitcoin forever you re either going to see it really start gaining traction or go the other way i really think it s a very binary outcome i personally don t think it s going to get there i m very skeptical of the long term use case of bitcoin when you hear about all these projects being done on the blockchain and things like that like mastercard and visa and all these other fintechs have their own blockchain divisions that are developing blockchain finance programs and things like that generally that s on the ethereum blockchain i could see that having more staying power than bitcoin but i really don t think you re going to see bitcoin become a mainstream currency i just don t i like the concept i like the technology i mine bitcoin i ve used bitcoin i lived off bitcoin for a day in las vegas just to see if i can do it so like i said i say this with peace and love i just don t see it getting there moser yeah i tend to agree with you but by the same token as an investor one of the things i ve just learned is you just always keep an open mind i m going to keep an open mind to it it doesn t mean i m interested in it i don t care about it i still don t see the use case for it i agree with what you re saying i also wouldn t be surprised at all if 10 years from now maybe we did see some change in the mentality or some material used cases for it and other cryptos it s going to be an interesting story to follow there s no question about it frankel sure if you and i are wrong and it does gain mass adoption in 10 years bitcoin could be 1 million moser yes finite supply absolutely could be frankel my prediction is that in 10 years bitcoin will either be over 500 000 or under 1 000 nowhere in the middle i m either going to be really right or really wrong say what you will over the past 10 years of bitcoin s existence it hasn t done a lot of just buttering along it s either gone up or down or straight up or straight down so if the past 10 years continues bitcoin s 1 million in 10 years but interest can really evaporate quickly if it doesn t pan out so i think it s going to be really high or really low moser yeah i think that interest is going to be key if something like 20 of the population right now has dabbled a toe in the crypto space we re going to need to obviously have a lot more than that to create the ongoing interest otherwise you re right i will have a hard time so yeah it s going to be an interesting one to follow up for sure matt a company that you and i like to talk about a lot on this show is getting ready to start trading on the public markets here it looks like sofi social finance technology is going to begin trading on tuesday june 1st a week from tomorrow we re going to see sofi out there on the public markets you recently have just gone through some earnings results for the business and you were impressed with what you saw frankel yeah assuming everything goes according to plan where they re meeting and the shareholder vote and all that they ll be trading on the 1st which is the first trading day after the memorial day weekend it will be on the nasdaq the current symbol ipoe the spac is on the new york stock exchange so it s moving exchanges at that time the shares and the warrants which everyone s you own will automatically convert over to the new ticker symbol there s nothing you need to do if you still own the original units if it was the ipoe units those will automatically break apart into shares and warrants of sofi upon closing just so you know what to expect there is nothing you need to do looking at the results they pretty much knocked it out of the park first quarter net revenue was 216 million they had been guiding for 190 195 so they came in above the high end of their own guidance range moser nice frankel their earnings were a little over 4 million they ve been guiding for a loss of 5 million to a gain of 1 million so they blew that expectation out of the water too on the top and the bottom lines they really just smashed their own expectations their member count is 2 28 million that s 110 higher than it was a year ago moser wow frankel this is the 7th consecutive quarter where their growth rate has accelerated and it s pretty impressive if you remember a year or so ago they acquired galileo it s the back end fintech infrastructure platform they provide third party infrastructure services they now have 70 million client accounts up from 59 million a year ago the galileo platform is one of the big biggest parts of my thesis on the company they originated 2 5 billion of loans in the quarter a little less than half of that was personal loans and they had some student loans that was what sofi was originally founded to do they expect just under 1 billion of revenue this year which is pretty impressive that would be 58 growth over 2020 they re just starting to launch some new verticals auto loans they are really just ramping up their brokerage business they re just getting their banking charter if you remember sofi just acquired a small bank for the purpose of accelerating that process it s putting a lot of its own capital behind it so the numbers look pretty impressive and the shares are up significantly since that was announced i think it s pretty plain to see why these numbers were just impressive all around moser yeah it sounds like anthony noto has got the business really headed in the right direction i remember at the time when he left twitter to go to sofi it was a little curious but now it makes a whole heck of a lot more sense he really did seem to get in with the business there at the right time to help them start building up what i think is something pretty special here it seems like they re on to something big including all of the numbers that you ve just gone over the initiatives are leading to a business and the investors really had to have this one on their radar frankel i was thrilled when they announced that this was going to be their merger target for ipoe and i m not planning on selling my shares i ve added to my position since they announced it i m a big sofi fan i think they re a very disruptive financial company and i think they could be the next square in my portfolio moser wow well there s some conviction for you folks listen up because mr frankel has got a track record and it s a pretty darn good one so keep that in mind matt thanks frankel i got it on square three days after its ipo moser that s not bad timing frankel technically i got into sofi three months before its ipo since it was a spac deal moser wow oh my goodness frankel we ll see i haven t won the sofi bet yet that s early stage moser but it looks like at least things are headed the right direction speaking of square we ve got some interesting news here recently square is going to be raising some money here it looks like they are issuing some debt to the tune of 2 billion matt taking advantage of what is still a very low interest rate environment i think if i see this correctly senior notes 2 75 stretched out to 2026 that s one tranche then in the other tranche a 3 5 stretched out to 230 at 2031 2 billion to me they offer up just the standard we can use for general corporate purposes which may include potential acquisitions transactions this is something i feel they are going to be investing a lot here into the square capital side of the business i mean this is the next act for this business don t you think frankel in a way this move left me with more questions than answers i will tell you why square already had 4 3 billion unrestricted cash just sitting on its balance sheet why do they need another 2 billion i feel like if you already have over 4 billion in cash and you decide to raise another 2 billion in cash you need to give me something more than we re going to use for general corporate purposes you re right it s a very low cost of capital that s never really been a problem for square i think their last offering correct me if i m wrong was convertible notes at 0 interest that could just be converted to stock sometime in the future they ve never had a problem accessing low cost capital and this was a private placement to institutional investors i know they are going to be building up the square capital i mentioned so far as a bank they are putting i think 700 million of their own capital behind to build out their bank square will conceivably be bigger as a bank just because they re bigger business right now they didn t need more capital for the first square capital i would like some more guidance apparently investors agree by the way the stock was down 5 right after they announced that so the market reacted negatively to this and normally if someone s raising low cost if square was raising capital with those interest rates you said so an average of about 3 and we knew they were going to turn that into something that was going to be at 10 return or something to that effect of course the market will be cheering that when real estate stocks raise low cost capital it s often cheered by the market so i think it was the question of why are you raising this if berkshire hathaway which is what we talked about has 140 billion or whatever on the balance sheet if they came out tomorrow and say we re going to raise 20 billion of fresh debt wouldn t your reaction be why moser well i mean normally i d like to know at least what they are trying to do with it and i mean it s a good point there frankel i feel like general corporate purposes just don t cut it when you already have that much you want more moser no it s a cop out and it s obviously just the cut and paste statement but now you made me think about it a little bit more i wonder if i mean you can t help but wonder if maybe they ve got a target or two in across areas for potential acquisition here frankel that s thought and maybe the latest can t say moser maybe frankel i wouldn t be surprised to see square go after like and so fire or something like that moser yeah well i mean after everything you just said about being so fay it actually wouldn t shock maybe they seem to be very in line with with leadership i mean clearly jack and anthony have a history i mean they know each other i mean they had a good relationship so yes that will be interesting to see frankel there are a lot of i mean square recently acquired titles which i didn t see that coming honestly but there are a lot of them that i could see going out even like robinhood i could see square doing that because it would bring tens of millions of new customers into their ecosystem moser yes yes it would frankel i could see that i mean just the customer acquisition alone would be worth that acquisition moser i would imagine matt imagine they d be like hey listen guys we just want your customers we really don t want your business or any of your policies you can keep all that stuff we just want customers frankel or maybe one of the smaller crypto exchanges to help better compete with coin base or something to that like a gemini i could definitely see them going after a company like that i mean i hope they are building a war chest to really build out our ecosystem it s my hope but the market was not happy with the general corporate purposes type thing because what do you need that for come on moser well matt let s take a stronger stance than for our listeners here as we wrap up before we take off let s take a strong stance for our listeners here with our ones to watch what is the stock that you are watching this week frankel we re such a strong stance i ll give you a q4 i m watching two of my favorite spacs this week and for good reason the first one is an ipo that is social capital hedosophia holdings vi that s why we just call it ipof did not have to say that name this is chamath s big spac they raised 1 billion in 2020 latest rumors they are going to be taking equinox public the fitness company that competes with peloton a lot of investors are in which is why ipof really hasn t moved since that rumor started trickling out if anything the stock is down a little bit but we haven t seen the terms of the deal or anything and chamath has been really good about getting a good deal if i m investing in a pre deal stock i like anything that is at the right price so i m curious to see what it does with it i think that could be a good competitor for peloton and i m interested then pershing square psth tarantin holdings bill ackman s spac ackman said a couple of weeks ago that he hopes to have been talking to iconic company he hopes to have a deal finalized within weeks this is his words ackman s words so we could hear very soon a lot of people think it s stripe i don t know i don t know if i d call stripe an iconic company i think that might be bloomberg which was the other big rumor play the bloomberg media empire taking that public so i m watching those two spacs because i have a feeling the next couple of weeks will be very interesting for both of them moser yes that is really cool that ll be well worth watching i m veering away a little bit from the financial markets here but a business i think we really all investors should at least take note of autodesk ticker there as adsk autodesk earnings will be coming out this week thursday after the market closes i believe they will be releasing their earnings report and autodesk is in 3d design engineering entertainment software that autocad product with computer aided design that they provide very strong reputable business it has been at it for a while subscription style subscription revenue accounted for 91 of total revenue now net revenue retention rate stays in that 100 and 110 range so they get their customers they keep their customers they continue to roll out new services for their customers it was interesting the management sees things coming back so there s a whole reopening i mean people getting back to work businesses opening their doors they expect the back half of this year to be strong as such they re actually considering introducing a potentially consumption based dynamic to their business model just to be able to accommodate the customers that would need it honestly to me that seems a bit like a cloudflare type of thing to do for those who know cloudflare they have everything from the usage base to the subscription model and offering what your clients what your customers need i think is a very customer centric thing to do but they are calling for earnings of 4 93 at the midpoint for the year that puts shares around 60 times earnings today which are 60 times full year estimates which is clearly not cheap but you are also getting a very strong business that generates a lot of money a lot of cash lot of earnings so i d be very interested to hear what they have to say just generally speaking about the business environment and how they see the rest of this year playing out because there s been a lot of good news that s come out since they reported last so a company i own a company i recommend and that will be what i m keeping my eye on this week but matt i think that is going to do it for us this week as always thanks so much for jumping on and sharing all of your knowledge frankel of course it s always fun to be here hopefully next time i will have a pool that i can actually use and not just look at moser well we ll record from the pool we could hear ashes and just the sound of joy we ll be waiting for that i m excited for you man that will be fun frankel me too moser remember you can always reach out to us on twitter nfpindustryfocus or you could drop us an email at as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear thanks as always to tim sparks for putting the show together for us for matt frankel i m jason moser thanks for listening and we ll see you next week

the hesitancy is justified inflation is a long way from settling in the rba s target range of 2 to 3 and such a dramatic break with policies of the past year would likely cause the australian dollar to strengthen too much officials also fret about the vitality of the labor market by the reserve bank s own admission the rebound has been aided by fiscal and monetary caffeine prime minister scott morrison isn t about to snuff out the spending contained in his government s budget released last month morrison s conservative bloc once fixated on surpluses will run deficits at least until 2025 the prospect of a national election within a year makes it doubly unlikely to be dismantled australia now has a largely domestic economy fortified by government support but looking inward borders are effectively closed morrison won t rush to alter that the recent budget props up tourism and aviation the underlying narrative seems to be based on fear mongering that opening up to outsiders will spark another outbreak this is a particularly acute problem because vaccination lags behind many other developed countries australia s policy of eradication rather than containment means that even small outbreaks are swiftly followed by city or state lockdowns putting an inevitable brake on growth rba governor philip lowe alluded to this in his statement after tuesday s board meeting an important ongoing source of uncertainty is the possibility of significant outbreaks of the virus although this should diminish as more of the population is vaccinated the lockdown of melbourne the second biggest city will be extended beyond the initial seven days a senior provincial leader said wednesday its population of 5 million people is now experiencing a fourth shutdown this stop start pace means the journey to economic normalcy will be slow going
governor mark gordon president and ceo of rocky mountain power gary hoogeveen and senator john barrasso discuss the new nuclear power plant to be built and operated in wyoming wyoming pbs photo cheyenne wyoming governor mark gordon announced wednesday that wyoming will be home to an advanced nuclear power plant terrapower rocky mountain power with pacificorp announced today efforts to advance a natrium reactor demonstration project at a retiring coal plant in wyoming the nuclear power plant is on a seven year schedule the nuclear plant will replace one of the coal fired plants in the wyoming pacificorp system according to governor gordon he said he set a goal to be a carbon negative state while still continuing the use of fossil fuels advertisement story continues below i am not going to abandon any of our fossil fuel industries it is absolutely essential to our state gordon said gordon said he believes this plant will help wyoming meet both his goal of being carbon negative while also meeting the biden administration s direction of the united states having net zero emissions by 2050 gary hoogeveen president and ceo of rocky mountain power acknowledged that everyone must be wondering which of the the four coal plants will be retired and replaced with this nuclear plant however he said that has not been figured out yet rocky mountain power will work with terrapower to figure out which site is the best hoogeveen said and we have a target to do that by the end of the year hoogeveen said this may leave cities like kemmerer rock springs and glenrock with concerns over what will happen if and when these retire however he said the solutions are already put into place i couldn t be more excited for you those cities those employees there is a solution and it s coming and terrapower i believe is it and we re going to work as hard as we possibly can to make it happen he said according to gordon the development of a nuclear energy facility will bring welcomed tax revenue to wyoming s state budget which has seen a significant decline in recent years this project creates opportunities for both pacificorp and local communities to provide well paying and long term jobs for workers in wyoming communities that have decades of energy expertise governor gordon also announced that wyoming s own uranium will be used to run the plant it makes sense to use wyoming uranium to furnish the feed stock for this plant governor mark gordon he added that along with reaching those emission goals it will be hugely beneficial to the state by creating hundreds of well paying jobs through construction and through the operation of the nuclear power plant he said salaries and benefits will be comparable to the existing jobs within the current coal plants additionally he said wyoming s students and workforce can be trained for the changing energy industry through the wyoming innovation network win win calls for closer collaboration between the university of wyoming and the state s community colleges and an emphasis on developing innovative solutions that will support and enhance wyoming s economy and workforce wyoming to lead the us into clean energy future us energy secretary jennifer granholm said this power plant will help wyoming lead the country into the future of clean energy this reactor is going to boost the flexibility with gridscale energy storage and it s going to allow for improved integration with renewable power to drive clean energy forward across the country she said granholm said the bills that went into creating this reactor program was supported by members of congress on both sides of the aisle we should all want our neighbors and our communities to have access to clean energy that leaves our children healthier and our planet safer and our wallets fuller and our homes more reliably powered and this reactor and this program is one step in that direction and i have no doubt it will be a boom to the wyoming residents who draw power from it granholm said bill gates founder of terrapower praised governor gordon and senator john barrasso for their dedication to encouraging nuclear energy in wyoming governor gordon understands the potential of nuclear and congress with senator barrasso s leadership created the program responsible for this project the advanced reactor demonstration program without that program we wouldn t be here today gates said via video chris levesque president and ceo of terrapower said this program is crucial to helping the united states lead nuclear and clean energy development the advanced reactor demonstration program is essential in establishing the united states as a leader in nuclear and clean energy technology development chris levesque president and ceo of terrapower said hoogeveen said the energy industry has been changing and it has been particularly hard on wyoming he said everyone in the energy industry knows that it is not realistic to move to 100 percent renewable and battery power and still be able to serve all hours of the day that s what s so exciting about today because this technology can allow us to provide carbon free electricity 24 7 365 and that is amazing hoogeveen said senator barrasso said wyoming has provided energy for the country for decades and decades and that with this nuclear power plant the state can continue to do so using all of wyoming s resources we have all the energy sources here everything oil gas coal the renewables and of course uranium for nuclear power barrasso said so this country is going to continue to depend on wyoming energy for decades and decades to come more about the project wyoming s governor gordon committed in early 2021 to lead the state in becoming carbon net negative while continuing to use fossil fuels through the advancement and utilization of next generation technologies that can provide baseload power to the grid including nuclear and carbon capture solutions wyoming is the largest net energy exporter in the united states and finding carbon solutions will ensure the state continues to provide energy to consumers across the nation while decreasing co2 emissions in october 2020 the u s department of energy doe through its advanced reactor demonstration program ardp awarded terrapower 80 million in initial funding to demonstrate the natrium technology terrapower signed the cooperative agreement with doe in may 2021 next steps include further project evaluation education and outreach as well as state and federal regulatory approvals prior to the acquisition of a natrium facility learn more about this project and the natrium technology at wyadvancedenergy com

marijuana legalization just won a powerful ally what happened marijuana stocks were on fire wednesday with shares of hexo hexo closing the day up 4 4 canopy growth cgc 0 44 rising 5 4 and aurora cannabis acb 6 37 beating them both with a 7 8 gain and just one word explains why all these stocks are doing so well amazon amzn 0 15 so what yesterday in a surprise announcement amazon declared its support for proposed marijuana legalization in the united states buried deep within a post on the company s aboutamazon blog that primarily discussed workplace efficiency initiatives amazon worldwide consumer ceo dave clark said the company s public policy team will be actively supporting the marijuana opportunity reinvestment and expungement act of 2021 more act with the goal of legalizing marijuana at the federal level and expunging records of criminal marijuana offenses as well furthermore reuters reports that amazon has advised it will no longer screen its job applicants for marijuana use for any positions not regulated by the department of transportation now what these two developments leniency on amazon s part in regard to employee marijuana use and a push to officially legalize marijuana at the national level would probably have sufficed in and of themselves to give marijuana stocks a boost today but on top of all the above clark further expressed the hope that other employers will join us in this effort and that policymakers will act swiftly to pass this law it seems amazon is trying to start a movement in the corporate world but why well here s one theory in an aside that investors in marijuana stocks and in amazon stock alike might want to take note of reuters observed that amazon does not allow marijuana sales on its platform yet
an industry leader is getting increasingly bullish on the oil and gas sector what happened leading oilfield service company schlumberger slb 0 06 sees better days ahead for the oil industry the company not only provided strong financial guidance for the year but the company s ceo also gave a very optimistic forecast at an industry conference that fueled a rally in schlumberger s stock which surged more than 7 by 2 45 p m edt on wednesday it also drove up shares of several other oilfield service companies including core laboratories clb oceaneering international oii 0 41 liberty oilfield services lbrt 1 30 technipfmc fti 2 90 and nextier oilfield solutions nex which were all up by more than 10 at one point on the day so what schlumberger provided investors with updated financial guidance the company expects its full year revenue for 2021 will exceed 22 5 billion which is well ahead of the current analysts consensus estimate moreover the oilfield service giant sees its full year adjusted ebitdamargin between 20 8 and 21 3 and its free cash flow margin above 10 that s an improvement in its adjusted ebitda margin which for example was 20 1 in 2020 s fourth quarter and 19 4 in the third ceo olivier le peuch also said at an industry conference that with oil demand projected to reach pre 2019 levels by the end of 2022 and supply tightening our oil and gas business is on the verge of an exceptional growth cycle given our unique position and strategy we are positioned to deliver outstanding returns in the short and medium term while schlumberger s global scale and large size put it in a prime position to benefit from the growth cycle it sees ahead other service companies will also benefit from the improving market conditions for example an increase in onshore drilling activities in north america will directly impact companies focused on providing those services like liberty oilfield solutions and nextier oilfield solutions meanwhile an improvement in offshore drilling positively affects companies such as core labs oceaneering international and technipfmc given their focus on that market these oilfield service companies will benefit from improving market conditions in two ways first they ll benefit from providing a higher volume of services to customers as they drill more wells on top of that they should be able to raise prices that s why schlumberger sees strong revenue and margins in the coming year its peers should also see an increase in revenue and margins as they benefit from higher service volumes and improved pricing as competitive pressures fade that should enable oilfield service companies to generate more free cash flow which they can use to repay debt expand their operations or return money to shareholders via dividends and buybacks now what oilfield service companies are coming off a brutal 2020 oil prices crashed because of the pandemic which caused oil producers to pull back on spending that hurt service volumes and pricing however with vaccines rolling out oil demand is improving pushing prices higher that s starting to give oil companies the confidence to increase their spending plans which will provide more work for oil service companies boosting their revenue and earnings if the cycle schlumberger envisions comes to pass oilfield service stocks could have much further to run as they grow their revenue margins and profits in the coming years
pressure has been building on the use of overdraft fees because they tend to largely impact financially vulnerable customers the digital banking division of ally financial ally 3 22 said today it is abandoning overdraft fees on all accounts for good every customer is eligible and there are no requirements or restrictions the company said in a statement nationwide more than 80 of overdraft fees are paid by consumers living paycheck to paycheck or with consistently low balances precisely the people who need help stabilizing their finances said ally financial ceo jeffrey brown eliminating these fees helps keep people from falling further behind and feeling penalized as they catch up in 2020 americans paid 12 4 billion in overdraft fees according to the 2021 finhealth spend report which said that 95 of the customers who paid those fees were financially vulnerable and were disproportionately black and latino the finhealth report also found that 43 of the customer accounts paying the fees averaged 9 6 overdrafts last year resulting in hundreds of dollars per household in 2020 ally made 12 million in deposit account and other banking fees which includes various fees for outgoing wires excessive transactions overdrafts stop payments and returned deposits that means overdraft fees made up a very small fraction of the bank s revenue also last year the bank waived fees for overdrafts and excessive transactions through july 31 and refunded roughly 7 million of fees on excess transactions and overdrafts through dec 31 the move by ally comes as pressure is building on banks to greatly reduce and eliminate overdraft fees especially after a testy exchange between sen elizabeth warren the massachusetts democrat and large bank ceos at a recent congressional hearing
the biotech could play an important role in the battle against cancer and autoimmune diseases what happened shares of sorrento therapeutics srne q 83 33 jumped 10 5 on wednesday as investors cheered two positive announcements from the biopharmaceutical company so what sorrento said it completed its acquisition of acea therapeutics for roughly 38 million as well as up to 450 million in additional payments if certain regulatory approvals and sales goals are met sorrento praised the drugmaker s pipeline which includes abivertinib which has generated promising clinical trial results in lymphoma and non small cell lung cancer abivertinib is also being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards associated with covid 19 sorrento said it expects to share the results from this trial by late september separately sorrento announced that the mexican government added covi stix to its official list of rapid antigen tests approved for emergency use in the country sorrento s approximately 15 minute diagnostic test outperformed other covid 19 tests for both sensitivity and specificity in studies conducted by mexican health officials the designation will now allow sorrento to begin marketing covi stix in mexico it could also help the biotech gain additional emergency use authorizations in other latin american countries according to management now what sorrento intends to begin new clinical trials for abivertinib for the treatment of other cancers and autoimmune diseases including prostate cancer leukemia multiple sclerosis and lupus the company is also seeking a larger partner to help co develop and market abivertinib globally
markets were quiet once again overall the stock market was fairly calm on wednesday although excitement over meme stocks once again dominated investors attention by the end of the trading day neither the dow jones industrial average the s p 500 nor the nasdaq composite had made big moves from yesterday s closing levels index percentage change point change dow jones industrial average dji 1 09 0 07 25 s p 500 gspc 0 95 0 14 6 nasdaq composite ixic 0 84 0 14 20 however energy stocks were once again in the spotlight as prices for crude oil and other energy products continue to climb wednesday was a good day for oil services specialist schlumberger slb 0 06 and refinery operator hollyfrontier hfc below we ll go into more detail about why these two companies are standing out in a hot sector looking to add value in energy shares of schlumberger were higher by nearly 8 on wednesday the provider of oilfield services has seen its stock more than double since late october riding stronger market conditions across the industry part of the gains for schlumberger reflected enthusiasm for the energy sector generally crude oil prices in the u s once again picked up ground gaining about 1 to approach 69 per barrel and international crude benchmarks remained at even higher levels as the global economy starts to regain momentum commodities traders see rising demand for energy starting to turn the tide of what s been a difficult period of supply gluts and overproduction schlumberger stands to benefit in several ways from the reopening trade with extensive operations both in the u s and internationally schlumberger will benefit from the materials and services it provides whenever an exploration and production company decides to drill a well or conduct testing to find promising new plays many investors focus solely on companies that actually take oil out of the ground but pick and shovel stocks like schlumberger could see even bigger gains if prices move up and stay up a refined choice meanwhile hollyfrontier shares picked up 5 just like oil services companies refinery specialists haven t gotten as much attention as exploration and production companies but in many ways the conditions are even closer to ideal for hollyfrontier and its peers oil prices have picked up steam but gasoline has risen at an even faster rate with prices at or near 3 per gallon in many states gasoline is now fetching the most from drivers at the pump in several years that s helped hollyfrontier score a double over the past seven months or so but the stock trades at just half where it was in 2018 hollyfrontier has had to deal with its share of challenges high costs during the pandemic and impacts from the winter storms in texas hurt earnings however if high gas prices can widen refining spreads in the second quarter and beyond then the future could look a lot brighter for hollyfrontier 70 is the next hurdle energy stocks are watching the oil market very closely to see if west texas intermediate crude can climb above the 70 per barrel level if that happens it could signal another leg up for stocks in the sector and that would include not only producers but also companies like schlumberger hollyfrontier and the other ancillary energy companies that are essential in the process of delivering the energy products that people around the world take for granted
first came the hulk followed by bruce banner then johnny blaze ghost rider and mephisto no these were not the members of a new marvel movie although that would be a fairly amazing lineup but instead additions to viaje s largest series namely skull and bones while the original members in the series that debuted more than 10 years ago bore names inspired by nicknames of nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction the most recent additions have been named after various marvel superheroes and their alter egos last month viaje announced the newest releases in its skull and bones series which now numbers 46 cigars by our count named skull and bones frank castle and skull and bones the punisher both cigars share the same 6 1 4 x 54 vitola and are made up of a proprietary blend of nicaraguan tobaccos the company also confirmed that the cigars were rolled in a factory located in nicaragua but declined to provide specifics about which factory how many cigars were released or any blend details for those of you not familiar with the marvel universe frank castle is the name of the person that turns into punisher a vigilante anti hero although he appeared for the first time in marvel s the amazing spider man 129 comic book published in early 1974 as a vigilante who had no problems killing criminals a rarity in marvel comics subsequent versions of frank castle s character have added quite a bit of nuance to the character including a history as a marine war veteran and as the husband of a wife and two children who were murdered by the mob for witnessing a killing in new york city the latter of which is the impetus for the creation of frank s punisher alter ego and his never ending campaign against crime each cigar frank castle and punisher has an msrp of 13 and was packaged in bundles of 25 that started shipping to retailers on april 19 cigar reviewed viaje skull and bones the punisher viaje skull and bones the punisher country of origin nicaragua nicaragua factory undisclosed undisclosed wrapper nicaragua nicaragua binder nicaragua nicaragua filler nicaragua nicaragua length 6 1 4 inches 6 1 4 inches ring gauge 54 54 vitola toro extra toro extra msrp 13 bundle of 25 325 13 bundle of 25 325 release date april 19 2021 april 19 2021 number of cigars released undisclosed undisclosed number of cigars smoked for review 3 covered in a milk chocolate brown wrapper that is fairly smooth to the touch the punisher the cigar is nicely firm when squeezed and has a touch of oil visible in addition there are a few visible veins running up and down its length aroma from the wrapper is a combination of cedar earth and toasted bread while the foot brings scents of leather hay and graham cracker sweetness finally the cold draw brings flavors of granola dark chocolate brewed coffee earth lemongrass and slight vanilla sweetness as first third of the punisher starts out there is some slight spice on my tongue along with main flavors of popcorn and earth followed by secondary notes of generic citrus creamy peanuts cedar cinnamon and hay in addition there is some vanilla bean sweetness on the retrohale that combines nicely with some black pepper that is also present construction wise the burn is very close to razor sharp and the draw is giving me no issues so far with just the right amount of resistance after a simple straight cut body is medium and while the strength is fairly light so far it definitely seems to be increasing as the first third burns down there are a number of changes in the profile of the punisher during the second third starting with the main flavors in the profile they have morphed into a combination of charred meat and leather additional notes of coffee beans cedar cinnamon lemongrass and sourdough bread flit in and out in various amounts while the spice from the first third has receded quite a bit the vanilla bean sweetness and black pepper on the retrohale have not changed all that much in terms of construction both the burn and draw continue along their excellent path and the smoke production has increased noticeably pouring off of the foot like a house on fire the amount of strength easily has jumped quite a bit and easily breaks through the medium mark by the time the second third ends although the final third of the viaje the punisher is a virtual carbon copy of the second third including the top flavors of charred meat and leather the major changes are the strength and the amount of black pepper the latter of which continues to increase as the final third burns down and ending up at a point just north of the full mark early on in the third the profile features secondary flavors of cedar bread earth dark chocolate hay and cinnamon that are all on display at various points but near the end the combination of increased strength and black pepper becomes so overwhelming that most of those flavors are all but drowned out that also includes the vanilla bean sweetness on the retrohale which while still noticeable has receded to the point that it is unable to have any impact on the profile while the draw continues to impress the smoke production has fallen off a bit from its high and the draw becomes problematic enough that it needs a quick touchup with my lighter just before i put the nub down with a little more than an inch remaining final notes to be honest i am unsure how i feel about these recent comic book themed releases from viaje on one hand it is kinda cool to have cigars named after some of the comic characters i read and collected while growing up however from the lack of any actual marvel logos or art it seems like these are just cigars using the names of the characters that are part of the marvel ip and nothing more which i find to be more than a little lazy along with the above i would not be surprised if viaje gets a cease and desist from disney for copyright infringement at some point sometimes companies will send these letters out as a threat to get a cigar company to stop using it without any real plans of funding a legal battle other times cigar companies have found themselves spending money to defend something that seems pretty inconsequential long before the netflix punisher show debuted phil joanou created and released a punisher bootleg short named dirty laundry starring thomas jane as punisher along with a bit of a part for ron pearlman it is everything you might expect from a punisher creation that is trying to stay true to its roots so if you have not seen it be warned there is quite a bit of violence when i went to cut my second review cigar i noticed what looked like a strip of green tobacco that was used on the cap this cigar shipped to retailers at the same time as viaje s white label project banner the hulk which incorporates candela tobacco into its barber pole wrapper so that may have something to do with it editor s note i think an equally like explanation is that there was a water spot that turned the wrapper green in some places cm the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time for all three samples averaged one hour and 37 minutes if you would like to purchase any of the viaje the punisher cigars site sponsor atlantic cigar co has them in stock update june 9 2021 the original review stated that the frank castle cigar has a blank white band which is not the case as the band does feature art on it 84 overall score although it starts out surprisingly tame it turns out that the cigar inspired by one of the most brutal comic book anti heros in marvel s history as well as being a member of one of viaje s most powerful lines easily lives up to its namesake by the time it comes to an end while the more restrained strength in the first two thirds allows for more nuanced flavors of popcorn charred meat and vanilla beans sweetness to take center stage those are all but overwhelmed by an increase in both strength and black pepper in the final third which also has the effect of throwing off the overall balance

recorded on may 24 2021 jason moser it s monday may 24th i m your host jason moser on this week s financial show we re going to dig a little bit deeper into the prospects of inflation how that relates to all of the volatility we ve seen in the crypto markets recently sofi is getting ready to go public we re going to talk a little bit more about that and what investors can expect as well as some recent earnings from sofi also square is raising some money we ll talk a little bit about what they might do with the 2 billion that they are going to be raising as always we ll have one to watch for you to wrap up the show and as always i ve got my partner in crime here with me this week it s certified financial planner mr matt frankel matt how is everything going matt frankel just great it s a brutally hot day in south carolina moser it was brutally hot here in virginia yesterday but it cooled down a little bit today we got a nice little break from things i guess for guys like you we were talking before taping they re in the middle of installing the pool at your house and the heat i m sure has just got you very impatient frankel yes very much so my kids more than me don t understand why they can t just go jump in it right now moser isn t that always the way well matt this has been an interesting week here there has been a lot of volatility and a lot of news a lot of headlines devoted to cryptocurrencies recently we ll talk a little bit about that coupled with that though the results we saw an interesting article here recently in the wall street journal that talked a little bit more about inflation and exactly how that may be presenting itself in the economy today let s talk a little bit first about inflation where we think things could be headed and what that could mean for investors because generally speaking when you talk about inflation that s not something that is clearly detrimental to stocks but it s absolutely something that can play into growth expectations and performance investors need to take this stuff they need to keep this stuff in mind as we see the potential here for inflation to start i m going to possibly accelerate a little bit here in the coming months and even quarters frankel right now we just saw the april inflation data showed that consumer prices rose a little over 4 year over year 4 2 that s definitely above the fed s 2 inflation target the question is are we going to see a short term bump in inflation due to the reopening just a one time demand rushes into the market we see a little inflation all of a sudden worse it can be more of a prolonged trend as they ve thrown trillions of dollars of stimulus into the economy they ve been printing money for a couple of years now is that going to cause a lot of inflationary pressure on the back end we ve recently seen wage growth is at the highest it s been in a long time which could also help play into inflation it s not necessarily a good or bad thing for your stock portfolio it depends what you re investing in the traditional hedge against inflation is always thought to be gold or silver precious metals things like that which to be fair does a pretty good job of keeping up with inflation overtime not much more but they do hedge against inflation we ll get into the cryptocurrencies in a minute and i m sure jason has an opinion on it as i do but as far as the stock market goes if you re worried about inflation the best advice i can give is stick with companies that have a lot of pricing power for example if consumer prices rise by 10 apple has the ability to raise the price of their iphone by 10 and people are still going to buy it there are industries that are a lot more competitive and don t have quite as much pricing power so that s one thing to ask yourself if inflation really picks up what companies will be able to take advantage of the increases in prices being that this is the financial show banks are somewhat inflation protected because inflation generally comes with rising interest rates which if you are a business that lends money that s a good thing it s a fine balance between supply and demand if inflation stays at 4 like it is now which is a pretty elevated rate that could be a good thing for banks if rates tend to tick up if inflation jumps to 10 and interest rates really skyrocket out of control that will hurt consumer demand and it s bad for banks banks are what i call a moderate inflation hedge they tend to do well in periods of decent but controlled inflation then there are the big box stores and the dollar stores and things like that that tend to do pretty well during inflationary times because if you re going to go grocery shopping for example you re not going to get much cheaper than walmart or costco those tend to get people spending money no matter what the economy is doing it s not necessarily that you need to be out of stocks and into gold silver or cryptocurrencies if you believe inflation is really going to stay elevated for a while it s just to make sure you focus on the right companies that won t get crushed in an inflationary environment moser yeah i think you re right there and inflation it s an interesting thing to observe because one of the things that stands out to me just recently or at least looking at last week through the earnings releases and the calls for home depot and lowe s in the theme over the past couple of quarters if you ve been anywhere near the housing market then you probably know this but lumber prices have really taken off lumber prices have really taken off and what you see in the language in these calls is that while home depot and lowe s are able to continue selling that lumber because they typically have to that s that s a unique market they do start to recognize some gross margin pressure from that lumber they can only price it so much they can only realize so much pricing power on something like lumber before it starts to cap out and you see a little bit of gross margin pressure there to me that was one thing that stood out but also i wonder in regard to inflation it seems like right now we ve got a lot of interesting things going on we ve got the economy reopening we ve got a lot of stimulus out there we ve got folks who should have in theory some money to spend it sounds like but we ve also seen a supply chain crunch i m not talking about just semiconductors either this really does seem to be extending across all areas of the economy there are just some supply chain issues that are playing out when you start to have a limited supply of things and you ve got a surplus of the hot dollar surplus of money out there for people to be spending those are the conditions that inflation just loves frankel for sure we re definitely seeing a supply chain crunch that s why the lumber market is going so crazy a lot of that is supply chain so yeah that also can create inflationary pressures like you said there are certain things where there isn t that much pricing power you can only raise prices on lumber so much before people are going to stop building decks on their house and pump the brakes on unnecessary spending but at the same time i think like milk the price of milk can double and people are still going to buy the price of gas could double which it almost has from the past year the price of gas could double and people are still going to fill their tanks up there are a lot of industries that do have a lot of pricing power you ll see demand bend a little bit but demand is a lot more flexible in some industries than others moser yeah relatively elastic i d say it s just it s not going to really change much the gas is a perfect example there there was an interesting data point i was reading when i was reading through this piece and it just struck me that this is why we talk about it this data right here from early 1973 through last december shows that stocks deliver positive inflation adjusted returns in 90 of rolling 12 month periods that occurred when inflation was below 3 and rising now that number 90 falls to 48 during periods of time when inflation was above 3 and rising for those who asked why we are talking about this that s why we re talking about it because there is data out there that shows it does matter you have to be maybe a little bit more picky when it comes to your stock purchases now the flip side it s not just stocks that do this dance when inflation starts becoming more part of the conversation you mentioned gold and silver as being traditional hedges i think a lot of people are familiar with those recently clearly we ve been talking more and more about cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin being the standard i guess but then all of these other coins that come with the conversation crypto i think there s just a million different opinions out there you either buy into it or you don t i think it s probably safe to say that you and i are both a bit more on the skeptical side of things but generally speaking why would crypto be seen as a hedge to inflation frankel well first of all in the words of ringo starr i say this with peace and love i think the last week or so the price action in crypto currencies has shown that it is not a store of value yet whatever side of the argument you re on whether cryptocurrency is the future of finance or not a store value doesn t lose 20 of its value in a week that s not a story value that s literally the opposite of the store value that s evaporating value ethereum is the other one which i actually think has more potential than bitcoin in a lot of ways it s down 36 in the past week in one week i don t know if that s ever happened with the u s dollar where it s lost 20 of its value against any other major world currency in the span of a week it s not there yet the big argument why bitcoin is a hedge if you ask certain people is because there s a finite amount of it same reason that gold is a hedge the government can t just print more gold the government can t just print more bitcoin i buy that to a certain extent if we had reached the point where bitcoin was widespread adoption it was a readily usable currency it was an accepted store value by more than just 10 20 of the population which it is right now we re just not at the point where you can call bitcoin a store of value and you have to have it be a store of value before you can really call it a hedge against inflation the recent price action really in my mind invalidates the hedge argument moser yeah i think that makes perfect sense it really all boils down to the finite supply that makes perfect sense let s fast forward 10 years are we there in 10 years where bitcoin can be seen by most as a reasonable store of value i would assume that the way things are going we re probably going to continue to grow at least folks who see the merits of cryptocurrencies in whatever shape or form there s going to be i think continued adoption albeit probably somewhat slowly for the masses but at some point or another maybe we ll get there it s not to say we would never get there frankel there you go trying to bait me again i think it s a mistake for anybody to think of it as a given that we are eventually going to get to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies that s still very up in the air at this point during some of our bitcoin data reviews one of our experts that i interviewed i m not sure which one off the top of my head but one of them referred to what s going on right now as an inflection point where we re either going to see bitcoin accelerate into mass adoption or not it s not going to keep going at its current pace where you re going to have 10 20 adoption that subset of the population just believes in bitcoin forever you re either going to see it really start gaining traction or go the other way i really think it s a very binary outcome i personally don t think it s going to get there i m very skeptical of the long term use case of bitcoin when you hear about all these projects being done on the blockchain and things like that like mastercard and visa and all these other fintechs have their own blockchain divisions that are developing blockchain finance programs and things like that generally that s on the ethereum blockchain i could see that having more staying power than bitcoin but i really don t think you re going to see bitcoin become a mainstream currency i just don t i like the concept i like the technology i mine bitcoin i ve used bitcoin i lived off bitcoin for a day in las vegas just to see if i can do it so like i said i say this with peace and love i just don t see it getting there moser yeah i tend to agree with you but by the same token as an investor one of the things i ve just learned is you just always keep an open mind i m going to keep an open mind to it it doesn t mean i m interested in it i don t care about it i still don t see the use case for it i agree with what you re saying i also wouldn t be surprised at all if 10 years from now maybe we did see some change in the mentality or some material used cases for it and other cryptos it s going to be an interesting story to follow there s no question about it frankel sure if you and i are wrong and it does gain mass adoption in 10 years bitcoin could be 1 million moser yes finite supply absolutely could be frankel my prediction is that in 10 years bitcoin will either be over 500 000 or under 1 000 nowhere in the middle i m either going to be really right or really wrong say what you will over the past 10 years of bitcoin s existence it hasn t done a lot of just buttering along it s either gone up or down or straight up or straight down so if the past 10 years continues bitcoin s 1 million in 10 years but interest can really evaporate quickly if it doesn t pan out so i think it s going to be really high or really low moser yeah i think that interest is going to be key if something like 20 of the population right now has dabbled a toe in the crypto space we re going to need to obviously have a lot more than that to create the ongoing interest otherwise you re right i will have a hard time so yeah it s going to be an interesting one to follow up for sure matt a company that you and i like to talk about a lot on this show is getting ready to start trading on the public markets here it looks like sofi social finance technology is going to begin trading on tuesday june 1st a week from tomorrow we re going to see sofi out there on the public markets you recently have just gone through some earnings results for the business and you were impressed with what you saw frankel yeah assuming everything goes according to plan where they re meeting and the shareholder vote and all that they ll be trading on the 1st which is the first trading day after the memorial day weekend it will be on the nasdaq the current symbol ipoe the spac is on the new york stock exchange so it s moving exchanges at that time the shares and the warrants which everyone s you own will automatically convert over to the new ticker symbol there s nothing you need to do if you still own the original units if it was the ipoe units those will automatically break apart into shares and warrants of sofi upon closing just so you know what to expect there is nothing you need to do looking at the results they pretty much knocked it out of the park first quarter net revenue was 216 million they had been guiding for 190 195 so they came in above the high end of their own guidance range moser nice frankel their earnings were a little over 4 million they ve been guiding for a loss of 5 million to a gain of 1 million so they blew that expectation out of the water too on the top and the bottom lines they really just smashed their own expectations their member count is 2 28 million that s 110 higher than it was a year ago moser wow frankel this is the 7th consecutive quarter where their growth rate has accelerated and it s pretty impressive if you remember a year or so ago they acquired galileo it s the back end fintech infrastructure platform they provide third party infrastructure services they now have 70 million client accounts up from 59 million a year ago the galileo platform is one of the big biggest parts of my thesis on the company they originated 2 5 billion of loans in the quarter a little less than half of that was personal loans and they had some student loans that was what sofi was originally founded to do they expect just under 1 billion of revenue this year which is pretty impressive that would be 58 growth over 2020 they re just starting to launch some new verticals auto loans they are really just ramping up their brokerage business they re just getting their banking charter if you remember sofi just acquired a small bank for the purpose of accelerating that process it s putting a lot of its own capital behind it so the numbers look pretty impressive and the shares are up significantly since that was announced i think it s pretty plain to see why these numbers were just impressive all around moser yeah it sounds like anthony noto has got the business really headed in the right direction i remember at the time when he left twitter to go to sofi it was a little curious but now it makes a whole heck of a lot more sense he really did seem to get in with the business there at the right time to help them start building up what i think is something pretty special here it seems like they re on to something big including all of the numbers that you ve just gone over the initiatives are leading to a business and the investors really had to have this one on their radar frankel i was thrilled when they announced that this was going to be their merger target for ipoe and i m not planning on selling my shares i ve added to my position since they announced it i m a big sofi fan i think they re a very disruptive financial company and i think they could be the next square in my portfolio moser wow well there s some conviction for you folks listen up because mr frankel has got a track record and it s a pretty darn good one so keep that in mind matt thanks frankel i got it on square three days after its ipo moser that s not bad timing frankel technically i got into sofi three months before its ipo since it was a spac deal moser wow oh my goodness frankel we ll see i haven t won the sofi bet yet that s early stage moser but it looks like at least things are headed the right direction speaking of square we ve got some interesting news here recently square is going to be raising some money here it looks like they are issuing some debt to the tune of 2 billion matt taking advantage of what is still a very low interest rate environment i think if i see this correctly senior notes 2 75 stretched out to 2026 that s one tranche then in the other tranche a 3 5 stretched out to 230 at 2031 2 billion to me they offer up just the standard we can use for general corporate purposes which may include potential acquisitions transactions this is something i feel they are going to be investing a lot here into the square capital side of the business i mean this is the next act for this business don t you think frankel in a way this move left me with more questions than answers i will tell you why square already had 4 3 billion unrestricted cash just sitting on its balance sheet why do they need another 2 billion i feel like if you already have over 4 billion in cash and you decide to raise another 2 billion in cash you need to give me something more than we re going to use for general corporate purposes you re right it s a very low cost of capital that s never really been a problem for square i think their last offering correct me if i m wrong was convertible notes at 0 interest that could just be converted to stock sometime in the future they ve never had a problem accessing low cost capital and this was a private placement to institutional investors i know they are going to be building up the square capital i mentioned so far as a bank they are putting i think 700 million of their own capital behind to build out their bank square will conceivably be bigger as a bank just because they re bigger business right now they didn t need more capital for the first square capital i would like some more guidance apparently investors agree by the way the stock was down 5 right after they announced that so the market reacted negatively to this and normally if someone s raising low cost if square was raising capital with those interest rates you said so an average of about 3 and we knew they were going to turn that into something that was going to be at 10 return or something to that effect of course the market will be cheering that when real estate stocks raise low cost capital it s often cheered by the market so i think it was the question of why are you raising this if berkshire hathaway which is what we talked about has 140 billion or whatever on the balance sheet if they came out tomorrow and say we re going to raise 20 billion of fresh debt wouldn t your reaction be why moser well i mean normally i d like to know at least what they are trying to do with it and i mean it s a good point there frankel i feel like general corporate purposes just don t cut it when you already have that much you want more moser no it s a cop out and it s obviously just the cut and paste statement but now you made me think about it a little bit more i wonder if i mean you can t help but wonder if maybe they ve got a target or two in across areas for potential acquisition here frankel that s thought and maybe the latest can t say moser maybe frankel i wouldn t be surprised to see square go after like and so fire or something like that moser yeah well i mean after everything you just said about being so fay it actually wouldn t shock maybe they seem to be very in line with with leadership i mean clearly jack and anthony have a history i mean they know each other i mean they had a good relationship so yes that will be interesting to see frankel there are a lot of i mean square recently acquired titles which i didn t see that coming honestly but there are a lot of them that i could see going out even like robinhood i could see square doing that because it would bring tens of millions of new customers into their ecosystem moser yes yes it would frankel i could see that i mean just the customer acquisition alone would be worth that acquisition moser i would imagine matt imagine they d be like hey listen guys we just want your customers we really don t want your business or any of your policies you can keep all that stuff we just want customers frankel or maybe one of the smaller crypto exchanges to help better compete with coin base or something to that like a gemini i could definitely see them going after a company like that i mean i hope they are building a war chest to really build out our ecosystem it s my hope but the market was not happy with the general corporate purposes type thing because what do you need that for come on moser well matt let s take a stronger stance than for our listeners here as we wrap up before we take off let s take a strong stance for our listeners here with our ones to watch what is the stock that you are watching this week frankel we re such a strong stance i ll give you a q4 i m watching two of my favorite spacs this week and for good reason the first one is an ipo that is social capital hedosophia holdings vi that s why we just call it ipof did not have to say that name this is chamath s big spac they raised 1 billion in 2020 latest rumors they are going to be taking equinox public the fitness company that competes with peloton a lot of investors are in which is why ipof really hasn t moved since that rumor started trickling out if anything the stock is down a little bit but we haven t seen the terms of the deal or anything and chamath has been really good about getting a good deal if i m investing in a pre deal stock i like anything that is at the right price so i m curious to see what it does with it i think that could be a good competitor for peloton and i m interested then pershing square psth tarantin holdings bill ackman s spac ackman said a couple of weeks ago that he hopes to have been talking to iconic company he hopes to have a deal finalized within weeks this is his words ackman s words so we could hear very soon a lot of people think it s stripe i don t know i don t know if i d call stripe an iconic company i think that might be bloomberg which was the other big rumor play the bloomberg media empire taking that public so i m watching those two spacs because i have a feeling the next couple of weeks will be very interesting for both of them moser yes that is really cool that ll be well worth watching i m veering away a little bit from the financial markets here but a business i think we really all investors should at least take note of autodesk ticker there as adsk autodesk earnings will be coming out this week thursday after the market closes i believe they will be releasing their earnings report and autodesk is in 3d design engineering entertainment software that autocad product with computer aided design that they provide very strong reputable business it has been at it for a while subscription style subscription revenue accounted for 91 of total revenue now net revenue retention rate stays in that 100 and 110 range so they get their customers they keep their customers they continue to roll out new services for their customers it was interesting the management sees things coming back so there s a whole reopening i mean people getting back to work businesses opening their doors they expect the back half of this year to be strong as such they re actually considering introducing a potentially consumption based dynamic to their business model just to be able to accommodate the customers that would need it honestly to me that seems a bit like a cloudflare type of thing to do for those who know cloudflare they have everything from the usage base to the subscription model and offering what your clients what your customers need i think is a very customer centric thing to do but they are calling for earnings of 4 93 at the midpoint for the year that puts shares around 60 times earnings today which are 60 times full year estimates which is clearly not cheap but you are also getting a very strong business that generates a lot of money a lot of cash lot of earnings so i d be very interested to hear what they have to say just generally speaking about the business environment and how they see the rest of this year playing out because there s been a lot of good news that s come out since they reported last so a company i own a company i recommend and that will be what i m keeping my eye on this week but matt i think that is going to do it for us this week as always thanks so much for jumping on and sharing all of your knowledge frankel of course it s always fun to be here hopefully next time i will have a pool that i can actually use and not just look at moser well we ll record from the pool we could hear ashes and just the sound of joy we ll be waiting for that i m excited for you man that will be fun frankel me too moser remember you can always reach out to us on twitter nfpindustryfocus or you could drop us an email at as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear thanks as always to tim sparks for putting the show together for us for matt frankel i m jason moser thanks for listening and we ll see you next week

it will determine whether the drug becomes a blockbuster a crucial decision is days or maybe even hours away for biogen biib 2 41 by june 7 the food and drug administration will decide whether to approve the biotech company s controversial alzheimer s drug candidate a positive decision seems crucial for biogen because the company predicts declining sales of its big multiple sclerosis blockbuster and is in need of a new growth driver if the fda gives the nod to the alzheimer s candidate aducanumab it s very likely biogen shares will soar more than 6 million americans suffer from the disease and treatment options are extremely limited but biogen might not get the major revenue boost it s hoping for even if aducanumab wins approval let s look at the biggest challenge the company could face it s greatly anticipated patient groups and families eagerly await the aducanumab regulatory decision if approved it would be the only treatment known to reduce declines in daily function and cognition but biogen s challenge may be convincing doctors to prescribe aducanumab to their patients why would doctors refuse to prescribe such a treatment many are hesitant due to the drug candidate s clinical trial path i ll explain biogen halted clinical trials of aducanumab in early 2019 this came after a futility study saying the treatment was unlikely to work the company surprised investors later in the year when it revived the program and said it soon would file for regulatory approval the reason for such a turnaround biogen conducted a post study analysis of its two phase 3 trials initially the trial named emerge met its primary endpoint it showed a reduction in clinical decline researchers measure that by looking at cognition and daily function the trial named engage didn t meet this endpoint but in the post study analysis biogen looked at a group of some engage participants who received higher doses of the drug candidate and those participants showed a reduction in clinical decline the company said are the data enough since biogen reinstated the aducanumab program analysts and doctors have argued about whether data from a post study analysis are strong enough to support regulatory approval in fact an fda advisory committee that was convened late last year even voted against approving the drug candidate the fda considers the opinion of this panel of experts but isn t obliged to follow it if we look at market potential without the idea of whether doctors will or won t prescribe the drug it s big aducanumab could generate about 4 9 billion in annual sales by 2026 according to the news site evaluatepharma and some news reports cite analyst estimates of at least 10 billion in annual sales now let s get back to the subject of what doctors will decide to do right now it s fair to say that aducanumab is controversial and some healthcare professionals aren t convinced of its efficacy the fda advisory committee vote is an example of that a report co authored by dr david s knopman a site investigator in the aducanumab trials calls for another phase 3 trial of aducanumab to support the idea of a higher dose so what does this mean for biogen if the fda approves aducanumab biogen investors surely will cheer it does offer the company another revenue opportunity but i would have preferred that biogen took its time with this one and conducted another phase 3 trial as dr knopman and his fellow authors recommend right now if aducanumab is approved biogen may face an uphill battle winning over the majority of doctors another phase 3 trial with strong results would have made it much easier to convince doctors of the drug s merit this doesn t mean a potential aducanumab approval would be bad news but it does mean the drug s success isn t guaranteed and if success does happen it will take time meanwhile if revenue disappoints in the first couple of quarters shares of this biotech giant might suffer so if you re a biogen shareholder or want to become one it s important to keep an eye on these first quarters they would offer us clues about whether doctors are willing to give the product a chance and whether biogen may indeed have a major new revenue driver

but to quit as he accused the prime minister of taking a half hearted approach that risks failing hundreds of thousands of children sir kevan collins claimed mr johnson rejected his proposals for a 15billion package to provide pupils with extra time and teaching to catch up on lost education due to successive lockdowns over the next three years writing in the times he said the government s approach risked failing children and damaging britain s long term economy after ministers revealed they would only guarantee a tenth of the funding he recommended the support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why i have no option but to resign he wrote it is too narrow too small and will be delivered too slowly a half hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils labour said sir kevan s resignation was a damning indictment of the government s plan while robert halfon tory chair of the education select committee said it was a blow to lose someone of sir kevan s stature sir kevan had demanded ministers approve a 15billion package to help thousands of children whose learning has been interrupted by the pandemic get back on track but education secretary gavin williamson yesterday announced that only an initial 1 4billion would be pumped into the system his call for the school day to be extended by half an hour also looks to have been kicked into the long grass with moved a next stage review due to report only by the end of the year in his resignation letter first revealed by tes sir kevan said the government scheme was too narrow too small and will be delivered too slowly he also pointed out that the average primary school will directly receive just 6 000 per year equivalent to 22 per child a

catch up boris johnson faced pressure to pump more money into the schools covid catch up today as experts said other countries were being much more ambitious than the uk luke sibieta a research fellow at the institute for fiscal studies said the government s total package so far was worth around 3 1 billion a lot of that now is focused on the national tutoring programme which sir kevan collins talked about as being quite an important part of education recovery but it is clearly a lot less than the 10 15billion that kevan collins was proposing for a full scale education recovery which would incorporate much bigger elements the education researcher said there was value in staggering funding for schools and that the prospect of clawing back lost learning in the space of two years was a bit fanciful but he said education recovery commissioner sir kevan s idea of longer school days had been pushed into the long grass as the government had failed to pilot the idea comparing the uk government s outlay on school catch up programmes internationally he added the biden administration in the us has proposed about 122 billion about 1 600 per pupil over five times more than we re spending in the uk the netherlands is going even further and has allocated over eight billion euros which amounts to over 2 500 per pupil so there are countries around the world going much further and being much more ambitious advertisement the prime minister was forced to pledge that more money would be coming through as he tried to fend off anger at the pitiful funding mr johnson held out the prospect of a cash boost at a later stage saying there was no doubt many kids are incredibly resilient but a lot of them also need help to catch up he said the funding announcement should also give parents the confidence that their child is going to get particular attention as well as find potential in kids that may be missed in the back of the classroom but he suggested that there will need to be more investment in future shadow education secretary kate green said kevan collins resignation is a damning indictment of the conservatives education catch up plan he was brought in by boris johnson because of his experience and expertise in education but the government have thrown out his ideas as soon as it came to stumping up the money needed to deliver them labour has set out a plan to deliver the bold policies that will boost children s recovery from the pandemic recognising that learning and wellbeing go hand in hand together our children and their future ambitions and life chances depend on us getting this right the conservatives failure to deliver for children now could cost our country dearly long term the tory chair of the education select committee robert halfon said on twitter to lose someone of the stature of sir kevan collins is a real blow whilst today s catch up money is hugely welcome to repair damage of school closures to improve attainment outcomes for disadvantaged pupils we need a properly resourced radical long term plan funding children will be offered 100million hours of tutoring over the next three years to help them bounce back from the pandemic but plans for a longer school day appear to have stalled teachers will also receive extra training and support worth 400million bringing government spending to date on education recovery to more than 3billion the government has also announced that schools or colleges will be given funding to let year 13 students repeat the year if they have been badly affected by the pandemic however a longer school day and a huge 15billion funding package were notably absent a no 10 spokeswoman said the prime minister is hugely grateful to sir kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic the government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning with over 3 billion committed for catch up so far earlier education secretary gavin williams squirmed during interviews as he insisted he absolutely trusts catch up envoy sir kevan in his resignation letter first revealed by tes sir kevan said the government scheme was too narrow too small and will be delivered too slowly education secretary gavin williamson announced that only an initial 1 4billion would be pumped into the system sir kevan s resignation statement in full advising the government on the education recovery plan has been the most important task of my professional life the recovery approach we take will reveal our commitment to a generation of children after the hardest of years a comprehensive recovery plan adequately funded and sustained over multiple years would rebuild a stronger and fairer system a half hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils the support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why i have no option but to resign from my post one conservative estimate puts the long term economic cost of lost learning in england due to the pandemic at 100bn with the average pupil having missed 115 days in school in parts of the country where schools were closed for longer such as the north the impact of low skills on productivity is likely to be particularly severe the pandemic has affected all pupils but hit disadvantaged children hardest a decade s progress to narrow the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers is estimated to have been reversed as part of the plan i proposed to government i recommended a landmark investment in our teachers whose dedication throughout the pandemic has been inspiring it is also right to extend access to tutoring in particular to support disadvantaged children tutoring can provide valuable support that complements classroom teaching but it is not a panacea and must be high quality to make a difference this is one reason why i recommended schools and colleges be funded to extend school time for a fixed three year period and providing significant funding for a flexible extension to school time equivalent to 30 minutes extra every day from the perspective of teachers extra time would have been optional and paid with schools also able to use the time to offer enrichment activities that children have missed out on the package of support announced yesterday falls far short of what is needed it is too narrow too small and will be delivered too slowly the average primary school will directly receive just 6 000 per year equivalent to 22 per child not enough is being done to help vulnerable pupils children in the early years or 16 to 19 year olds above all i am concerned that the package announced yesterday betrays an undervaluation of the importance of education for individuals and as a driver of a more prosperous and healthy society advertisement in a bruising round of interviews yesterday mr williamson tried to put a brave face on the situation saying that as a yorkshireman he always thought that 1 4billion was a pretty hefty amount but he refused to say how much that worked out for each child pushed repeatedly on whether he believed in what sir kevan was proposing mr williamson told sky news we have been working very closely with sir kevan collins and actually the interventions around tutoring driving up teaching quality these are very much built on the work we ve been doing together recognising how incredibly important it is that we take on these interventions in order to help children he insisted a longer school day is still on the agenda amid reports that the treasury had baulked at the huge figure mr williamson confirmed a further instalment of just 1 4billion meanwhile the question of whether the school day should be extended remains under review and will be set out later in the year the department for education said mr williamson said it is a lot of money and it builds on 1 7billion that we ve already committed in terms of actually delivering for children it is an extra 100million hours of tutoring it is making sure that children who need that help who need that support that we re delivering that tutoring revolution to help them get it but we recognise it is part of a process over the past 12 months we have already announced a previous 1 7billion worth of additional funding and we are looking at a whole raft of additional ideas for how we can continue to support our children making sure none of them are left behind hailing the extra funding boris johnson said it would make sure that no child is left behind this next step in our long term catch up plan should give parents confidence that we will do everything we can to support children who have fallen behind and that every child will have the skills and knowledge they need to fulfil their potential he said sir kevan added the investments in teaching quality and tutoring announced today offer evidence based support to a significant number of our children and teachers however he pointedly warned that more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge unions reacted angrily to the announcement saying the package did not go far enough paul whiteman general secretary of school leaders union the naht said it s a damp squib some focus in a couple of the right areas is simply not enough the funding announced to back these plans is paltry education recovery cannot be done on the cheap geoff barton general secretary of the association of school and college leaders ascl told sky news it s pretty dispiriting here i am as somebody who is leading a trade union and for all my colleagues it feels this morning as if we have got higher ambitions for the nation s children and young people than the education secretary it s pretty pitiful only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it at least there was a sense of let s do something radical let s do something different today s announcement essentially equates to 50 per head you compare that with the usa which is putting 1 600 per head per young person or the netherlands 2 500 per head so what is it about those children in the netherlands or the usa that makes them worth more than our government seems to say it s time to stop the rhetoric i think and start the action on behalf of children and young people mr williamson suggested that further funding will be forthcoming in future however a longer school day and a huge 15billion funding package which were key demands made in a document penned by the education recovery tsar sir kevan collins were notably absent stock picture labour education spokesman kate green accused the tories of showing no ambition for children s futures as she unveiled alternative measures which would cost 14 7billion as well as expanding extracurricular activities and breakfast clubs mental health support should be available in every school as well as small group tutoring and teacher development she said sir peter lampl of education charity sutton trust said the funding is only a fraction of what is required low income students who have already been most heavily impacted will be disadvantaged even more and overall standards which have fallen dramatically will be very slow to recover

is it the wallstreetbets effect what happened shares of eastman kodak kodk 4 19 blackberry bb express expr and especially bed bath beyond bbby took off like rockets wednesday as of 12 10 p m edt kodak was up 10 5 blackberry shares were up 15 8 express was 16 6 higher and bed bath beyond stock had shot up 46 5 so what are there catalysts behind these price movements in a few cases yes to an extent blackberry announced this morning that it will participate virtually in investment bank r w baird s global consumer technology services conference next wednesday but blackberry didn t discuss what new information if any it will present there bed bath beyond announced today that it will launch three new private label brands part of 10 such brands the store plans to offer generally speaking private label brands provide superior profit margins to the retailers who sell them and as such this is a positive development for the company but is it positive enough to make the stock worth nearly half again what it was worth just yesterday i rather doubt it at the same time as these two stocks are rising on rather insignificant news express stock is up on no news at all and eastman kodak is rising despite actual bad news as it prepares to fight an insider trading lawsuit brought by the new york attorney general s office now what i suspect something else might be going on here the wallstreetbets phenomenon that s been disrupting markets by sending shares of inferior businesses higher on hopes traders can profit from a short squeeze blackberry and express have been losing money for six straight quarters according to data from s p global market intelligence bed bath beyond did have one profitable quarter recently but only due to tax loss carryforwards and kodak earned only 6 million on its 650 million market cap and from that perspective the suddenly rising prices of blackberry kodak express and especially bed bath beyond do make some sense of these four companies the last one has by far the greatest short interest 31 of all shares outstanding and 64 of the stock s float short interest in blackberry kodak and express is less extreme but still elevated express 7 of shares outstanding and shares floated blackberry 9 of shares outstanding and 10 of the float kodak 12 of shares outstanding and 22 of the float of the four though bed bath beyond is clearly the most attractive target for wallstreetbets traders seeking to create a short squeeze and for today at least the strategy seems to be working
a security breach at a major food company appears to be boosting food stocks like b g foods today what happened shares of b g foods bgs 3 31 jumped on wednesday even though there wasn t any company specific news however many food stocks were trending higher today in the wake of the cyberattack on the world s largest meat processor jbs as of 3 p m edt b g foods stock was up 11 so what for reference it s likely other stocks like beyond meat are also up today because of the jbs situation according to the associated press several of jbs s facilities in north america and australia went down because of hackers jbs is already recovering and expects to have some operations back today however even slight blips in the food supply chain can cause disruptions that lead to price fluctuations at the grocery store now what companies that are still operating at full strength like beyond meat and b g foods could be short term beneficiaries of this situation that said it s hard to imagine any enduring gains for food stocks resulting from the cyberattack on jbs therefore b g foods shareholders would be better off to ignore today s pop and instead focus on the long term business fundamentals b g foods management is guiding for up to a 6 7 year over year increase to full year 2021 sales however this might not include much organic growth its recent acquisition of the crisco brand will contribute to sales growth this year that said there s still good reason to be optimistic about the company s outlook its business was good in 2020 because the covid 19 pandemic had more people eating at home but guidance implies the company will retain a lot of those pandemic sales that s good news going forward

and hyundai posting record months and honda and toyota reporting big increases thanks to brisk sales in the long dormant passenger car segments the 2022 honda civic sedan is the 11th generation of the company s compact sedan in the u s passenger car sales showed new signs of life in april but in may hyundai s passenger car sales increased by 105 while suv sales increased 34 noted hyundai s randy parker in a telephone interview with thedetroitbureau com we never got out of passenger cars and we have two very strong entries in the elantra and sonata added parker hyundai senior vice president national sales hyundai s strong passenger car line up played a big role in boosting sales but parker also acknowledged thin inventories of utility vehicles were contributing factor inventories were so low that many dealerships were literally selling vehicles as soon as they were delivered by the carhaulers he said alternative energy vehicle sales get a boost sales of alternative energy vehicles such as plug in hybrids accounted for more than 10 of hyundai sales in may he added overall hyundai sales were up 56 compared with a year ago as the south korean brand sold more than 90 000 vehicles toyota is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its game changing prius with a special edition model honda which saw its sales increased 52 in may cited strong sales of honda civic and accord even the

of total tmna sales compared 12 1 in may 2020 toyota s bob carter said he believes car sales would continue to track what was seen in march an 18 5 million annualized sales rate if not for the chip shortage and production problems he told thedetroitbureau com he s never seen the market this hot toyota is struggling with a 13 day supply of vehicles down from their normal already low 30 to 45 day target kia s replacement for the sedona the 2022 carnival enjoyed impressive results in may cars come in on the truck and go right back out again he said kia america reported its third successive best ever monthly sales result totaling 80 298 units surpassing the previous mark set in april 2021 four kia nameplates forte k5 sportage and carnival mpv enjoyed their strongest months ever through may kia sales are up 43 9 over 2020 kia s continued run of success has hit an important milestone our very own triple crown performance said sean yoon president and ceo of kia north america and kia america kia continues to grow market share due to increased dealer engagement strong marketing campaigns and award winning products the latest example of which is the all new carnival mpv which has doubled its market share over the outgoing sedona mazda north american operations reported total may sales of 42 187 vehicles an increase of 69 2 compared to may 2020 year to date sales totaled 156 562 vehicles an increase of 58 4 compared to the same time last year the 2021 subaru crosstrek sport offers rugged capability at an affordable price inventories growing thin subaru also reported an 8 increase in sales as dealers scrambled to fill orders in may based on their total inventory available for sale our retailers were tremendously efficient in their sales activities in order to achieve these impressive results said thomas j doll president and ceo of subaru of america inc in addition our retailers did a sensational job of showcasing why subaru products are the preferred selection for those customers looking for the complete package an adventure ready and fun vehicle combined with award winning safety technology general motors co does not report monthly sales totals but duncan aldred head of buick gmc said during a briefing for reporters buick sales were at record levels during may and buick gmc dealers were left with on average a 30 day supply of vehicles which is far less than the 90 day supply they normally have in stock and some dealers have run out of stock completely kia retailers observed significantly accelerating showroom traffic over the memorial day weekend due in part to the increasing opening up of the country kia officials noted the thinning inventories appear to have slowed sales in may according to ihs markit which projects a saar of 16 6 million to 17 million units for the month compared to an 18 million unit reading in march and a 18 5 million unit mark in april as sales data comes in we are seeing consumer demand remain higher than supply with the supply chain remaining fragile this tension is expected to continue and to contribute to volatility amongst automaker performances added stephanie brinley principal automotive analyst for ihs markit

image naftali bennett left and yair lapid in parliament on wednesday the two would split a term as prime minister if their negotiations succeed credit ronen zvulun reuters jerusalem israeli opposition parties on wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust benjamin netanyahu the longest serving prime minister in israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation s politics to the right the announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left israel without a stable government or a state budget if parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days it will also bring down the curtain if only for an intermission on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary israel more than any other the new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies from the left to the far right it includes the membership of a small arab party called raam which would become the first arab group to join a right leaning coalition in israeli history while some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last and consider it the embodiment of israel s political dysfunction the alliance would be led until 2023 by naftali bennett a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a palestinian state and wants israel to annex the majority of the occupied west bank he is a former ally of mr netanyahu often described as more right wing than the prime minister if the government lasts a whole term it would then be led between 2023 and 2025 by yair lapid a centrist former television host considered a standard bearer for secular israelis the son of american immigrants mr bennett 49 is a former software entrepreneur army commando chief of staff to mr netanyahu and defense minister his home is in central israel but he was once chief executive of an umbrella group the yesha council that represents jewish settlements in the occupied west bank until the most recent election cycle mr bennett was part of a political alliance with bezalel smotrich a far right leader though mr bennett s party yamina won just seven of the 120 seats in parliament the anti netanyahu forces could not form a government without his support allowing him to set the terms of his involvement in the coalition mr lapid 57 is a former news anchor and journalist who became a politician nine years ago and later served as finance minister in a netanyahu led coalition his party placed second in the general election in march winning 17 seats but mr lapid considered the ouster of mr netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister

by john t ikyaave worldwide mortgages take the lead as the preferred means for owning a home in countries such as the united kingdom usa france and other oecd organisation for economic co operation and development countries it is rare to see people paying outright for homes using savings loans from friends family members or cooperative societies in nigeria the widescale adoption of mortgages as a popular path to owning homes is still extremely low this situation needs to change it explains in part the country s high housing deficit that is estimated by experts to hover between 17 to 22 million housing units with trillions needed to make any significant dent on it fact is that housing is a capital intensive venture a combination of low wages and high cost of living give millions of nigerians little room to save towards purchasing or building their homes for nigeria to properly house its citizens greater efforts need to be made to bolster access to affordable housing finance to enable them to own their homes to tackle the problem of access to affordable housing finance many countries across the world have promoted the adoption of mortgages as the preferred path to homeownership the mortgage process entails the granting of monies to obtain a home with good faith that the debtor will repay the loan with interest attached to life of it both the debtor and lender benefit if nothing goes wrong over many years the borrower repays the loan plus interest until she or he owns the property free and clear mortgages have helped millions of people all over the world buy homes even if you do not have n5 000 000 cash you can buy a n5 000 000 home using a mortgage and pay gradually over time till you defray the loan so essentially a mortgage is a loan that a lender which could be a commercial or mortgage bank gives to a potential homeowner to purchase a house or other real estate before mortgage lenders give loans they check to see if you meet certain requirements such as your income level your financial ability to pay back the loan the lender can take ownership of or foreclose on the property you have mortgaged if you do not repay the money borrowed plus interest high mortgage adoption leads to high homeownership levels in the united states for instance the proportion of households that are occupied by the owners is over 65 1 percent in the united kingdom homeownership rate is above 67 69 per cent and 90 per cent and 84 per cent in singapore and indonesia respectively as expected the situation is different and worrisome in nigeria we have a homeownership rate of about 25 percent which is much lower than even kenya 73 per cent benin republic 63 per cent and south africa 56 per cent longer term single digit interest mortgages it is against this backdrop that the role of the federal mortgage bank of nigeria fmbn in boosting access to affordable housing finance is so significant established as a wholesale mortgage finance institution the fmbn provides primary mortgage banks with low cost funds to provide affordable mortgages to nigerian workers notable features of fmbn mortgage loans include zero equity requirements for loans of up n5million and 10 per cent equity down payment for loans above n5 million to n15 million others include single digit interest rates ranging from six to nine per cent per annum and long payment tenors of up to 30 years fmbn s housing products are available to contributors to the national housing fund nhf scheme a social savings scheme designed to mobilize long term funds from nigerian workers banks insurance companies and the government to boost access to affordable housing finance the bank also has a rich and impressive portfolio of social housing products that target a key and dominant segment of the nigerian population low to medium income earners consider the fmbn national housing fund nhf mortgage loan and its unique structuring to serve the ordinary nigerian worker fmbn leverages funds from the nhf scheme to grant concessionary loans to its accredited primary mortgage banks pmbs at a four per cent interest rate the mortgage banks in turn use these funds to give loans to qualified workers that contribute to the nhf scheme at six per cent interest per annum with payment tenors of up to 30 years loans of up to n5 million attract zero equity down payment while those above n5 million to n15 million require 10 per cent equity subscribers are qualified to apply after only six months of continuous contributions to the scheme the terms and features of the nhf mortgage loan are affordable and reduce the financial pressure on the meagre incomes of low income earners for comparison interest rates on housing loans in the open market range from 18 per cent to 25 per cent per annum while maximum loan repayment tenors hover between 10 20 years most commercial banks and mortgage lenders also require that applicants provide between 30 per cent to 50 per cent equity contribution before loans are processed and possibly approved for disbursement balancing housing products and worker s financial capacity besides the nhf mortgage loan fmbn has been innovating to ensure a proper match between its housing products and the financial capacity of an average nigerian worker looking to own a home in the past four years under the leadership of ahmed dangiwa the bank developed and introduced two creative housing products the first is the individual home construction loan the loan enables nhf contributors with unencumbered land appropriate land titles and approved building plans to undertake self construction the loan provides up to n15 million to contributors to the nhf scheme at seven per cent interest rate beneficiaries can pay back over a period of up to 30 years depending on their age and number of years left in service the second product is the fmbn rent to own housing scheme the scheme offers an easy and convenient payment arrangement towards homeownership for nigerian workers it makes it possible for a nigerian worker to instantly move into an fmbn owned housing property as a tenant and conveniently pay towards ownership of the property in monthly or annual instalments over as long as 30 years at an interest rate of seven per cent another equally interesting and worker centric affordable home ownership product that fmbn has upscaled significantly within the past three years is the home renovation loan the loan provides up to n1million to enable beneficiaries who already own their homes to carry out improvements in the past four years home renovation loans totalling n49 265 billion were granted to 60 500 beneficiaries fmbn has also revamped its legacy cooperative housing development loan chdl in line with the initiative of the minister of housing babatunde raji fashola san to adopt cooperative societies as the channel for the aggregation and delivery of houses to members of cooperative societies the fmbn cooperative housing development loan chdl enables a cooperative society that has acquired a plot of land to develop houses for allocation to its members key features include tenors of up to 24 months with a moratorium of 12 months and interest rate of 10 per cent up to n500 million is accessible by qualified cooperative societies under the facility over the past four years the bank deployed over n10 985 billion towards the financing of several cooperative housing schemes across the country to strengthen collaboration and confidence of workers who are the main contributors to the nhf scheme the bank approved and is currently executing a national affordable workers housing scheme in partnership with the nigeria labour congress nlc trade union congress tuc and the nigeria employers consultative association neca to deliver affordable houses for nigerian workers the first phase of the scheme was launched in october 2018 aimed at delivering about 1 400 units about 1 400 housing units are ready for commissioning in 12 sites across the six geopolitical zones of the country in addition to lagos and abuja in batches of a minimum of 200 units per zone the second phase has also commenced and is planned to deliver about 2 160 houses in another 14 locations house types include finished semi detached bungalows as well as 1 2 and 3 bedrooms in blocks of flats bold policy actions required to reverse trend to reverse the housing deficit in the country bolder and more aggressive policy actions are required by governmental authorities to strengthen both the demand side of housing in the country as well as the supply side this entails supporting and boosting the capacity of existing institutions such as the fmbn to scale their operations for greater impact it is encouraging to note that the fmbn has been given a key role in the implementation of the government s economic sustainability plan alongside the family homes fund fhf this is a right step in the right direction for one the bank has the largest registry of potential homeowners in the country with over five million contributors to the national housing fund nhf scheme which the bank manages on behalf of the government the list of subscribers includes civil servants workers in the private sector self employed persons traders etc with comprehensive information about their income levels and financial capacity to pay back mortgage loans secondly the fmbn has over the past four years demonstrated through remarkable results that the national housing fund nhf established in 1992 to pool long term funds for the delivery of affordable housing to low and medium income workers can be made to deliver practical results between april 2017 when the current executive management team took charge of the bank to february 2021 fmbn leveraged funds accruing to the national housing fund nhf scheme to record n130 460billion in various loan disbursements the figure comprises nhf mortgage loans totalling n43 141 billion granted to 4 985 beneficiaries and home renovation loans totalling n49 265 billion granted to 60 500 beneficiaries the bank also deployed over n38billion towards the development of 9 540 affordable housing units across the country through different construction product windows this includes estate development loans totalling n20 195billion cooperative housing development loans totalling n10 985 billion and ministerial pilot housing scheme loans totalling n6 873 billion the size of mortgage loans disbursed within the four year period is remarkable at many salient levels first it accounts for over 46 percent of the cumulative n282 914 billion that fmbn has disbursed since the nhf scheme commenced operations 29 years ago in 1992 secondly the amount translates to an 85 per cent increase in the cumulative value of mortgage loans totalling n152 453 billion in april 2017 when the management team came on board to n282 914 billion as of february 2021 the speed of processing size of the loan approvals and disbursements are all unprecedented in the history of the bank the performance proves that further empowering fmbn to scale promotion of affordable housing stock targeting the over five million of current nhf subscribers would accelerate nigeria s efforts to tackle the housing deficit overall to achieve high mortgage penetration levels in the country and increase homeownership rates especially within the low medium income segments of the economy there is of course the need to think outside the box giving the perennial stagnation of growth in the sector but re inventing the wheel is not an attractive option a low hanging fruit is to empower strong institutions and systems that have shown capacity to deliver affordable housing to do more fmbn presents one such platform the current board and management should therefore be encouraged and its finances bolstered to enable it to create greater impact as the foremost government tool for social housing delivery ikyaave is a public policy analyst based in abuja

in the early months of covid 19 there was an expectation that the pandemic might actually lessen inequality as some low income frontline workers received hefty pay rises hannon 2020 evidence from previous centuries such as from the 14th century black death show big increases in the labour share as labour became more scarce relative to capital in the outbreak s wake scheidel 2017 jorda et al 2020 as alfani 2020 notes however the historical evidence is not uniform 17th century plagues did not lead to more egalitarian outcomes as the rich took steps to protect their wealth recurrent plagues in the 19th century caused by the spread of cholera had devastating effects on the poor as they lived in unhealthy and crowded conditions dosi et al 2020 conjectured that covid 19 would amplify existing inequalities through channels ranging from inequities in risk of infection to access to hospitalisation ability to work remotely and the threat of longer term job loss twenty first century pandemics inequality and austerity in our recent work furceri et al 2021a 2021b we provide evidence about the likely distributional effects of covid 19 by analysing the impacts of five major epidemics since 2000 sars 2003 h1n1 2009 mers 2012 ebola 2014 and zika 2016 for convenience we refer to these major epidemics as pandemics h1n1 swine flu influenza was the most widespread with over 6½ million cases across 148 countries the other four events affected fewer countries and were largely confined to specific regions sars and mers in asia ebola in africa and zika in the americas as in ma et al 2020 we construct a 0 1 dummy variable the pandemic event which takes the value one for countries declared by the who to be affected by a particular pandemic this gives us a total of 225 pandemic events our results are similar if we measure the intensity of pandemics based on cases per population we use the net gini coefficient gini net of taxes and transfers as our measure of inequality results are similar for the market gini we trace the impact of pandemic events on the gini by estimating impulse response functions directly from local projections jordà 2005 the left hand panel of figure 1 shows that the gini measure increases by about 0 35 points after five years the response is both statistically and economically significant given that gini coefficients change slowly over

response and one standard deviation confidence bands the y axis shows the change in the net gini the x axis shows years after pandemic events t 0 is the year of the pandemic event the fiscal response varies considerably across pandemic events we measure the stance of fiscal policy by shocks to the general government balance not correlated with changes in economic activity see fatas and mihov 2003 results are similar using health expenditures or the extent of redistribution to reflect the fiscal stance we exploit the variation across countries in fiscal balances after the onset of pandemics to see whether the impact on inequality is different in episodes characterised by high austerity fiscal surpluses greater than 4 of gdp compared with episodes of highly supportive fiscal policy fiscal deficits greater than 4 of gdp the results from conditioning on the fiscal response are shown in the middle and right hand panels of figure 1 the key finding is that austerity intensifies the extent of the rise in inequality in the aftermath of pandemics as shown in the middle panel episodes of high austerity lead to an increase in the gini by about 0 55 points considerably larger than the average impact shown in the left hand panel by contrast expansionary fiscal policy considerably dampens the rise in inequality as shown in the right hand panel the increase in the gini is under 0 2 points and is not statistically significant distributional effects of covid 19 early evidence points to adverse distributional impacts from covid 19 blundell et al 2020 hacioglu et al 2020 imf 2021 occurring through a number of channels the poor have been more prone to getting infected in part because they are less likely to have the option of working from home and to die if infected due to lack of access to quality healthcare for instance brown and ravallion 2020 found that infection rates were higher in us counties with a higher share of african americans and hispanics there are also indirect and longer lasting effects from job loss and other shocks to income particularly for workers in informal employment with limited access to health services and social protection however our results suggest that a long lasting increase in inequality need not be a foregone conclusion and is contingent on the fiscal policies adopted by governments the covid 19 pandemic has led to a worldwide fiscal response estimated at nearly 12 trillion or about 12 of global gdp though the fiscal response in low income developing countries has been restricted by tighter financing constraints a number of observers have cautioned against premature withdrawal of fiscal support despite the resulting build up in debt levels imf 2020 stiglitz 2020 sandbu 2020 while country circumstances of course differ considerably a case can be made that there is still room for fiscal support in many economies the likelihood that low long term interest rates will persist can moderate debt service burdens and allow governments to continue extending the maturity of government bonds though caution is warranted where fiscal buffers have been eroded chamon and ostry 2021 in low income developing countries these policy options are much less readily available and the alleviation of financing constraints could require greater assistance from private sector creditors and additional concessional financing from the official sector the experience following the global crisis offers a cautionary tale of the dangers of premature fiscal consolidation in 2010 buoyed by what turned out to be mistaken signs of a strong recovery many advanced economies signalled a u turn in their fiscal stance a policy choice that many regard as partly responsible for the tepid recovery that followed and the consequent failure to bring about reductions in debt to gdp ratios stiglitz 2012 ieo 2014 the turn to austerity also led to cutbacks in governments health expenditures in the run up to the covid 19 pandemic oecd 2016 soener 2020 instead of a premature return to austerity countries would do better by anchoring their fiscal plans in a credible medium term framework and orienting public expenditures over the coming years toward productive investments in digital and green infrastructure gaspar 2020 estefania flores et al 2021 by building market confidence in fiscal sustainability and boosting growth

cambridge exxonmobil recently announced a five year plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is pumping out ads proclaiming its commitment to a green future tobacco giant philip morris is touting its plans to help smokers quit facebook is calling for new internet regulations and these moves come less than two years after the business roundtable representing the ceos of america s largest corporations issued a statement calling for business to serve all stakeholders are today s corporate executives ushering in a new era of corporate responsibility or are they merely protecting their own power for decades business leaders and prominent academics believed that corporations sole commitment was to their shareholders previously a fringe view the publication of a new york times op ed by milton friedman in 1970 the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits moved this perspective towards the mainstream it gained further momentum within academia following a number of articles by harvard business school s michael jensen who offered theoretical and empirical support for friedman s doctrine for example in one influential paper jensen and kevin murphy of the university of southern california estimated that the average ceo s pay increased by only 3 25 for every 1 000 of value he created pointing to the need for an even tighter link between executive compensation and shareholder value but this academic research was following more than leading the trend by the 1980s ceos like general electric s jack welch and scores of management consulting companies had already normalised the preoccupation with shareholder value corporations started downsizing their workforces limiting wage growth and offshoring tasks all in the name of delivering better value to shareholders although proponents of shareholder primacy would not have approved of the type of fraud that became associated with enron worldcom and others it was easy to see how an obsession with increasing the stock price might lead some executives to go too far there is now growing agreement that maximising shareholder value should not be a corporation s sole aim less obvious however is what model should be adopted instead should we draw up a new charter for executives so that they feel empowered to consider a broader set of interests the business roundtable seems to think so but i would caution against any solution that gives even more discretion to management the problem with shareholder primacy wasn t only that it created an obsession with stock prices and pitted workers against shareholders it was that it handed a massive amount of power to top managers many ceos now run their companies according to their own personal vision there is very little social oversight and executive compensation has soared despite the unprecedented hardship caused by the pandemic ceos of hard hit companies took home tens of millions of dollars last year when inordinately empowered ceos receive a vague mandate to pursue stakeholder interests as they see fit abuses are sure to follow some companies might funnel millions of dollars to their ceos pet project or to philanthropic causes that are really just veiled forms of influence peddling under the current incentives structure there is little stopping corporations from collecting huge amounts of consumer data disempowering workers and citizens and establishing tyrannical new forms of surveillance even as they are advertising their philanthropy and virtue there is certainly nothing that prevents them from pursuing excessive automation to reduce labour costs destroying jobs just to eke out a few more bucks for shareholders the way to reverse these anti social trends is through a two pronged approach that is very different from what the business roundtable would prefer first the legal and institutional constraints on top executives need to be strengthened for too long managers have avoided criminal prosecution for criminal behaviour even the colossal abuses leading to the 2008 financial crisis went almost entirely unpunished as journalist jesse eisinger points out today s executive friendly legal landscape owes much to ambitious selfish prosecutors tendency to eschew criminal charges against businesses and managers in order to further their own careers more importantly legislation is needed to set clearer red lines it should not be left to ceos to decide whether to engage in aggressive tax avoidance and then pay themselves with the proceeds it should not be optional for companies to reduce their carbon footprint and we urgently need to redirect technological change by pushing corporations away from incessant automation these issues all bear on our prospects for maintaining a functioning society they must not be left to the goodwill of self interested ceos the second prong is complementary to the first exxonmobil philip morris and facebook are virtue signaling because they are under increasing pressure from civil society not because their ceos suddenly have become more public spirited that kind of pressure is needed now to block any reforms that would give executives even more discretion but civic activism works better when laws specify what counts as unacceptable corporate behaviour be it tax evasion excessive automation pollution or accounting tricks to enrich shareholders and greedy managers there is no reason to believe that exxonmobil philip morris and facebook are committed to overhauling their socially destructive business models their public relations efforts reflect the pressure they are feeling civic activism is starting to work and it could become even more effective but that will take better organising and stronger demands on corporations not whitewashing campaigns designed to defuse criticism and demobilise the critics corporate responsibility is too important to be left to corporate leaders daron acemoglu

open circuit or scuba self contained breathing apparatus was one thing the draeger german built was an entirely different style of diving a hundred percent oxygen and no bubbles to give away your position jj s worst fear was getting out in the open harbor channel and finding that a big tanker was overhead they d have to suck bottom to avoid being chopped up like fruit in a blender and the bottom of san diego bay was pretty nasty it was like being in a dirty loud washing machine with no lights sound travels much faster in water than it does in air and they could hear the loud whine of a speed boat and the occasional whuga whug from the larger vessels with propellers the size of cars jj and olga were a dive pair this was their first closed circuit combat night training mission and they couldn t see more than a few inches in front of their faces the draeger unit was surprisingly simple it consisted of a small oxygen bottle a canister filled with a chemical that absorbed co2 and a double hosed breathing tube that had a one way check valve all housed within a simple black chest mounted container inhale from the one way hose and exhale out the other valve which scrubbed co2 and put clean oxygen back into the closed circuit rig however breathing pure o2 came with its own hazards dive too deep and you get o2 toxicity anything deeper than 20 feet was a no go but stay above that depth and you could dive for over four hours long enough to swim into a harbor plant a listening device or explosive and get out undetected tonight s mock mission was to plant a magnetic mine on the target vessel and return to the pick up point undetected the mines were numbered by dive pair so the instructors could grade who made it and how well the explosives were placed two weeks before jj and olga had both nearly drowned completing the famous pool competency exam in fact everyone who passes almost drowns it s part of what makes it such a challenging test the warm up is to tread water with twin scuba tanks on your back and no fins for five minutes hands out of the water after that you line up in one of four stations to begin your test as soon as you enter the water in full dive gear you are hit by two instructors mask and fins are gone immediately next your primary air source is ripped from your mouth jj remembered reading about the terrifying test in brandon webb s the red circle it actually helped her better prepare mentally don t be cocky that s what the book had taught her and she took that lesson to heart when she got her own surf hit it was no joke the instructors were extra hard on her and olga because they were the first two women ever to make it past hell week so the spotlight was especially on them she remembered master chief jackson pulling her and olga aside to explain that the instructor staff would play no favorites to either of them if anything they would have it harder than the rest of the class because no instructor wanted to send them forward to the seal teams without being 100 percent sure they had what it took to make it professionally the staff had their own reputations to think about nobody wanted to send forward a polished turd to be dealt with by the teams jackson pounded that into their heads they had to finish every day to their best ability like the sign on the concrete grinder where they worked out with little white frog feet on the deck said the only easy day was yesterday so here she was down over 30 feet near the bottom of the training tank trying to stay alive the first hit was hard the second felt like a truck hit her two instructors had smashed her one in the head and one in the gut she was seeing stars the gut punch knocked the wind out of her and she spit out her regulator mouth piece which was her main source of air that fucking sucked she thought to herself she couldn t find the hose anywhere so she took off her tank and traced the hose with her hands she still could barely see from the knock to her head but she found her mouthpiece sucked water first then finally took in air much to her relief a few more hits like this and it was over she got the signal to the surface she made every attempt to fight back the panic of not having enough air but wanted to come up slowly to show the instructors she was in control she broke the surface with the hot california sun blinding her eyes wiped her face and took a slow deep inhale she found the second phase head instructor petty officer 1st class john percy staring straight at her good work jj we just may make a frogman out of you yet he smiled rinse your gear and take a seat in the winners circle team gear your buddies gear your gear and then you could take care of yourself those were the rules and it made perfect sense to jj hooyah instructor percy percy had this quiet confidence that came with being good at his job nobody knew much about him because unlike most of the other seal cadre who talked trash among themselves from which the students could pick up bits and pieces of gossip percy was all professional all the time and none of the staff messed with him there must be a reason for that she thought to herself all she knew was that percy was from oregon and an avid triathlete who rode his bike to bud s every day he had won his age category in the last ironman race in hawaii she only knew this because she and the class had overhead the second phase staff bragging about percy s win he also had three bullet hole scars in his chest and stomach most likely from heavy combat in iraq with seal team seven his last assignment she d heard the rumors about the team s deployment to ramadi jj likes him because he was no talk just action she and olga had a crush on him finally real man for olga she d say to jj knowing she liked him also for now she was glad pool comp was over jj and olga s combat dive san diego bay 0015 she and olga had been underwater for over three hours and six minutes during dive planning one of the instructors had put up a powerpoint slide with an old cbs news article from 2016 one dead four nearly drown during navy seal training it had the desired effect on the class nobody talked above a whisper while planning their dives the instructors loved to dial up the heat and put the class under constant pressure to see who would crack and many did at this point in training there were plenty of green and blue helmets under the infamous brass bell each phase of training came with its own colored helmet green for phase one blue for dive phase and lastly red for the land warfare phase don t worry olga we got this jj had agreed to be the lead navigator with the attack board the board had a glow in the dark compass stopwatch and small whiteboard and pencil to take and take notes they had to memorize their kick count like a runner s mile pace in order to know when to change course underwater olga would back her up on time and carry the mine on her back they planned out their dive on the nautical chart with the incoming tide an hour later they suited up slipped into the cool pacific ocean and submerged into darkness one hour 45 minutes up the side of the harbor entrance right side of the channel turn left 45 degrees for 28 minutes to cross the main channel to the other side back 45 degrees for another 36 minutes then a small course adjustment 10 degrees to the left another 15 degrees to the left and they should hit their target a large mega yacht mid hull like oligarch boat in hvar said olga during the brief jj had no idea where the hell hvar was and she didn t want to ask while they were planning their dive olga would have carried on about it for too long she thought smiling to herself she loved olga but that woman loved to tell a story especially if it was about one of her comic book heroes after the last course adjustment they were getting a bit nervous because they hadn t hit the ship and were almost a minute past the time when they should have hit the boat then with a thud jj hit the boat olga piled right into her and they were both temporarily entangled up in the small black nylon buddy line that kept them clipped in together olga took her mouthpiece out stuck her tongue out and smiled at jj jj flipped her the bird and they both laughed underwater they could hear the onboard pump systems and knew they should be careful to avoid any saltwater intakes the last class lost two divers who had swum into an intake and couldn t free themselves from the strong suction another nonverbal drop sucks to be you two thought jj they traced their way to the right mid hull and started slowly surfacing just enough to start seeing the lights from the marina dock jj signaled that she would take a shallow water peek she made her way up about five feet from the surface and saw the name of their target ship last dance target confirmed she sank down slowly to olga s depth as the light from the surface gave way to darkness and passed olga the ok and ready signal they two swam slowly under the boat to the two main propeller shafts they could see the first dive pair s mine faintly glowing green from the broken chem light on the right propeller shaft pair one was wedge and ty two of the best navigators in the class at least she and olga were the second pair out of 15 to hit the target ship not bad i ll take it thought jj she gave olga an underwater high five and then started to remove the mine from her back she handed the mine to olga for her to place on the metal prop shaft once olga made sure it was secure she signaled ok and took up position behind and to the right of jj for the 50 minutes to the extraction point the extract was shorter in order to compress the exercise for the class thank god no fucking dolphins after us thought olga she had read of dolphins coming after candidates in the red circle just as they were departing they both faintly saw randy and his dive buddy making their way to the props she shot him a thumbs up as they swam past each other like two sailboats passing in the night randy gave her a thumbs up back and she and olga vanished into the dark water fifty minutes later and they swam into the large concrete pilings of the navy base pier it was like swimming into an abandoned city of skyscrapers they could make out the faint eery light of bioluminescence from a school of jellyfish they were in another world as they swam to the midpoint of the pier they could see the orange chem lights that signaled their extraction point when they surfaced they were greeted by ty and wedge s smiling faces they helped her and olga get out of their gear and onto the support boat and offload up the ladder and to the big white navy truck that would carry their dive gear back to the dive phase compound how was it guys asked wedge easy day olga said they all laughed of course olga everything is easy for you wedge said as he hoisted up their gear into the back of the truck jj expert navigator my job easy olga said as she flicked jj s left ear ouch you bitch jj said smiling back well ty snuck some hot coffee for us in his thermos you guys want some hell yes jj said they all passed around sips of the strong hot navy coffee and whispered to each other about their dives they all knew soon they d be out at the island for the final phase of training and then surely off to war the only easy day was yesterday to be continued click here to read all the installments of the reservation the reservation is a new experiment a novel in progress shared with sofrep readers weekly and created by

quarter last year the tail end catching the beginning of covid australia s gdp rose 1 8 quarter on quarter this march quarter to be up 1 1 year on year in other words the economy is now bigger than it was pre pandemic the interesting number will come this quarter given last year gdp shrunk 7 0 in the true covid quarter i suggested yesterday we could likely dismiss trading on monday and tuesday the last and first days of may and june as portfolio reshuffling would mask underlying market sentiment and so it was with wall street flat overnight market sentiment reinstated itself to the positive yesterday the asx200 was already up around 50 points late morning when the gdp result was released there was a slight stumble probably an attempt at sell the fact but it lasted but a blink momentum then carried the index onward again to close on its highs it was a new all time record the 7200 has been breached and it s all blue sky from here with wall street posting another flat session our futures are up 16 points this morning suggesting yesterday was no flash in the pan the 1 gain for the index did not nevertheless represent market wide buying the standout sector was energy up 4 1 as opec kept current production levels steady this spilt into utilities 2 6 with agl energy agl jumping 4 0 having been down 33 year to date materials rose 1 9 as iron ore leapt back over us 200 t if you want to talk inflation talk materials and if you want to talk inflation hedge talk reits not cbd offices they re in for a rough time ahead as the working day office home split becomes entrenched but elsewhere landlords can counter inflation by raising rents and thus yields once we actually do get past covid the property sector rose 2 0 discretionary staples and industrials all gained over 1 and a 0 7 bounce back from tuesday for the banks was influential while telcos 0 2 played defensive more defensive on a day for the cyclicals was healthcare one of only two sectors to close in the red 0 5 the other was technology 1 1 looks like the air is gradually being let out of that overvaluation balloon on actual results and guidance updates four of the top five index losers on the day were tech stocks three of the top five winners were oil gas producers or servicers whitehaven coal whc came in fifth with another 5 4 gain to spot went again to inghams group ing which so far this week has been up 3 5 down 3 8 and now up 6 6 last word on the gdp goes to anz bank s economists while policy support is still very high the economy has weathered the withdrawal of emergency fiscal stimulus unexpectedly well business conditions point to ongoing solid expansion high levels of capacity utilisation will support investment and consumers still have a very large savings buffer the labour market recovery is poised for further gains with job ads running nearly 30 above pre pandemic levels happy days as melbourne extends its lockdown box office bargain the sequel once again wall street traded higher in the morning and once again it eased back to be flat at the close with no sign of rotation or preference once again it was all about the meme stocks having risen 23 on tuesday night after placing a chunk of new capital with a hedge fund amc entertainment last night rose 95 the hedge fund made us 30m on flipping the stock on the day bet the champagne went flat last night amc is now up 3000 year to date it is valued at multiple times more than it was pre pandemic has heavily increased its share count and those cinemas that are actually open in the us are still mostly running at limited capacity amc is not heavily shorted any more nor is gamestop which rose 13 last night but struggling homewares retailer bed bath beyond is around 30 shorted and it jumped 62 blast from the past blackberry is similarly shorted and it rose 32 the short squeeze is on again not only that amc is revelling in the attention now offering free popcorn to shareholders a small cost for the company a huge saving for film buffs wall street continues to watch nervously when the meme craze all kicked off in january driven by a bored social media demographic the shorters were burned and had to dump other holdings to cover losses which led to a general market correction as the snowball grew so far wall street is more circumspect this time but unprepared to pile into the market we know from experience that at some point this will again all end in tears both for the shorters on one side or the late to the game buyers on the other another fun fact given the extent of volatility in amc s share price on the day the stock was twice halted by automatic exchange mechanisms we recall that back in january the retail broker behind the meme stock craze robinhood was forced to itself halt trading due to liquidity constraints last night following a barrage of incensed tweets robinhood was forced to tweet back it wasn t us back in the real world energy was again the leading sector on wall street last night followed by property otherwise if we look only at the day s index movements on close it was another dull session the s p500 remains anchored at the 4200 level which it first

crude oil trades at the highest level since october 2018 this is driven by tightening market conditions as opec keeps production tight alongside a continued recovery in global demand as vaccine rollouts support increased mobility according to ole hansen the head of commodity strategy at saxo bank while the recovery in global fuel demand remains far from synchronized due to concerns over

technical committee jtc yesterday 31 may presented its outlook for the supply demand balance for the rest of the year and depicted continued reviving demand and a tightening balance with an expected inventory draw of 2 2 5m bl day from august to december 2021 it shows there is plenty of room for a further increase of supply from the group beyond the planned increase of 2 1m bl day from may to july 2021 and it also makes it much easier for the group to accommodate the return of iranian supplies to the market said bjarne schieldrop chief commodities analyst at seb the nordic investment bank there are still very few signs of internal strife within the group so it is likely to keep on going with a steady course the bull recipe for the oil market is still intact reviving demand muted us shale oil response together with controlled and restrictive supply from opec resulting in further declines in inventories and yet higher oil prices the group signalled yesterday 31 may that the return of iranian supplies will be gradual and managed and won t create any supply shock into the market between 1 1 5m bl day of iranian oil exports are probably already in the market so a return of iranian supplies probably adds 1 1 5m bl day of crude and condensates schieldrop added brent is above 70 dollars the us iran nuclear talks need more time so do you think it s time for opec plus to ease the

manufacturing pmi surged to an unprecedented high of 65 6 in may record growth of new orders and employment supported one of the steepest increases in production volumes in the survey s near 30 year history ukmfg jefferson jefferson_mfg june 1 2021 on the subject of uk manufacturing the markit cips manufacturing pmi may have risen to a record level of 65 6 in may but it undershot the consensus and the flash estimate 66 1 manufacturing output probably surpassed its pre covid level in may at least six months before the services sector likely will fully recover markit s new orders index leapt to 68 1 the highest level since the survey began in 1992 from 61 9 in april manufacturers and their suppliers are struggling to keep up with higher demand work backlogs also rose at an unprecedented pace and suppliers delivery times lengthened at the second faster ever rate reported samuel tombs at pantheon macroeconomics the upswing however likely will run out of steam soon it is typical for manufacturing output to recover quickly immediately after a recession as businesses rebuild stocks that they ran down during the crisis orders also might be particularly high now because businesses have learned of supply shortages and are panic buying in response by the end of this year manufacturing output likely will be falling back note too that markit s surveys continue to bring signs of brexit damage with the export orders balance for the uk 59 7 undershooting the eurozone s 62 0 for the fifth consecutive month albeit less so than in previous months he added 10 20am manufacturing pmi

sterling was down by about a quarter of a cent at us 1 4187 the ihs markit cips uk manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi for may clocked in at a record level of 65 6 up from 60 9 in april a reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity new export orders also rose at a survey record pace in may amid reports of stronger demand from the eu the us and china although ihs cautioned that there were continued signs that while large companies were seeing record gains in new export work the rate of increase at small firms was comparatively mild the uk pmi surged to an unprecedented high in may as record growth of new orders and employment supported one of the steepest increases in production volumes in the near 30 year survey history growth is being boosted by the unlocking of economies from covid restrictions and ongoing vaccination programs this is being felt across the globe as highlighted by a record rise in new export business during the latest survey month said rob dobson a director at ihs markit duncan brock the group director at the chartered institute of procurement cips said the march of the makers has turned into a sprint as the blocks of lockdowns have been removed supply chain managers anticipate a continuing squeeze on deliveries and are forward buying and building stocks so we may not have seen price peak yet this means bigger inflationary pressures for the wider economy and the country s place in international trade as prices charged also rose at record rates brock said 9 25am flaming june off to flaming good start welcome to flaming june and just as the uk weather outlook seems to be brightening so is the outlook for equities the ftse 100 was up 30 points 0 4 at 7 052 after the long weekend and ahead of the release of us jobs

performing housebuilder stocks up 2 0 and 1 9 respectively after the nationwide building society reported that the housing market remains artificially buoyant with house prices rising 1 8 in may after advancing 2 3 in april the year on year increase in the average house price rose to 10 9 in may from 7 1 in april and 5 7 in may as sellers rush to sell their houses to take advantage of the government s largesse on stamp duty prior to the increases in may and april house prices had been relatively soft over the first quarter of 2021 they dipped 0 3 month on month in march rose 0 8 in february and dipped 0 1 in january this had been the first monthly fall in house prices since last june reported howard archer the chief economic advisor to the ey item club the recent strength in house prices has occurred after a strong pick up in housing market activity through the second half of 2020 this followed the easing of the initial 23 march 2020 lockdown restrictions and the release of pent up activity this lift was then reinforced by the raising of the stamp duty threshold from 125 000 to 500 000 from mid july until 31 march 2021 archer noted additionally nationwide has observed that behavioural shifts may also be boosting activity as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of lockdown in particular it appears that an increasing number of people want a garden and also space to work at home this is leading to some polarisation in demand for residential properties however while still being relatively elevated housing market activity had come off its highs before supportive measures were included in the budget on 3 march archer noted following the introduction of more supportive measures in the budget the ey item club expects the housing market to show vigour in the near term and a further firming of prices archer said samuel tombs the chief uk economist at pantheon macroeconomics said house prices are still soaring but the medium term outlook remains overcast the approaching reduction of the threshold for stamp duty land tax to 250k at the end of june from 500k is catalysing the housing market may s hefty month to month increase in nationwide s measure of house prices pushed up the year over year growth rate to its highest level in nearly seven years the upward pressure on prices looks set to remain strong over the coming months given that google trends data indicate that visits to one of the three main property websites in may were 22 above their average for the time of the year similarly the seasonally adjusted number of registered house hunters per estate agents branch in april was 30 above its 2012 to 19 average according to the national association of estate agents tombs reported demand was a bit stronger than in march when house hunter numbers were 24 above normal albeit below the peak seen in november further ahead however we continue to expect house prices to dip in q4 by which time the sdlt threshold will have returned to 125k housing transactions already have come off the boil in the us where unlike the uk the market has not been juiced by tax cuts indicative of weak post covid demand an increase in new housing supply also likely will undermine prices later this year tombs said proactive news headlines powerhouse energy group plc lon phe said a second site using its waste plastic to hydrogen

half a million in mexico more than 220 000 in the uk and italy more than 125 000 as workers throughout the world consider the experiences of the pandemic the initial shock is giving way to anger outrage and demands for accountability how did this happen who is responsible how can the ongoing carnage be stopped in the united states the ruling class is currently engaged in a furious campaign to blame china for the spread of the disease discredited and unfounded theories first promoted last year by the trump administration and the extreme right that the virus originated in a laboratory in china and perhaps was even the product of biological engineering are being legitimized and promoted by the media and the entire political establishment there are transparent political motivations behind this campaign the leaders of all the major capitalist governments are swimming in buckets of blood millions of people have died unnecessarily as a result of deliberate decisions taken at the highest levels of the state to reject public health measures that would save lives the same indifference the same criminality of the modi government in india is expressed in the response to the pandemic of every major capitalist country it is a fact of enormous significance that the united states the center of world capitalism and the home of wall street has seen the largest number of deaths from the pandemic despite its vast wealth and its control of the most advanced technologies the pandemic has exposed a social and political system that is incapable of meeting the needs of the vast majority of the population one principle has governed the response of the ruling class to the pandemic from the beginning that no action could be taken that undermined the interests of the corporations or threatened the share values on wall street government policy first under trump and now under biden has been directed not at saving lives and eradicating the pandemic but at perpetuating the stock market boom and furthering the geostrategic interests of american imperialism in late march of last year more than a year ago the us congress passed the so called cares act which financed the multi trillion dollar bailout of the banks and wall street speculators once the interests of the oligarchy were secured the campaign began to insist that the cure can t be worse than the disease that is that lives had to be sacrificed for profit the trump administration spearheaded the campaign to remove the limited restraints that had been put in place but it had the support of both capitalist parties in the us the republicans and the democrats along with the media and critically the trade unions the consequences were both predictable and predicted a massive surge in new cases and deaths similar policies were implemented in all the major capitalist countries in the uk this past week a former advisor of boris johnson further confirmed that the uk government implemented a policy that it had calculated would lead to the deaths of as many as 800 000 people in brazil the government of jair bolsonaro deliberately pursued a policy of allowing the virus to spread without restraint anticipating that the death toll could reach as high as 1 4 million amidst mass death and social misery the fortunes of the oligarchy have soared to new heights the collective wealth of all us billionaires or just 660 people rose more than 1 1 trillion since mid march of 2020 the british financial times reported yesterday that the market in superyachts is surging as the wealthy seek luxury and seclusion to escape crowds and the threat of covid 19 one could hardly have a more clear and damning indictment of the entire social and economic order the international committee of the fourth international has defined the pandemic as a trigger event by this we mean an event that accelerates and intensifies the underlying contradictions and tendencies of the capitalist system we have seen over the past 15 months the ruling class response to the pandemic the policy of mass death has coincided with a turn ever more openly to dictatorial forms of rule at the beginning of this year a fascistic insurrection was organized by the trump administration on january 6 with the collaboration of the entire republican party that had as its aim the overthrow of an election and the establishment of a dictatorship this was not an isolated incident it expressed something deeply diseased in the social and political system biden and the democrats are now in power but the same basic ruling class policy is being pursued even though 500 people are dying every day from the coronavirus biden has essentially declared the pandemic over the centers for disease control and prevention has under the administration s direction even removed regulations on the wearing of masks in public places meanwhile the democrats are now spearheading the militarist campaign against china on friday the biden administration released its budget proposal for the coming year that is centered on a record military budget of 753 billion including 24 7 billion for nuclear weapons modernization it is estimated that a vaccination program to cover all indians would cost about 6 4 billion american imperialism is spending four times this amount to modernize its weapons of mass destruction and as israel carried out its criminal assault on gaza this month it found its most steadfast ally in the us under the leadership of biden the other side of this process is the growth of opposition in the working class the experience of the past year has not been in vain it has had a profoundly radicalizing impact on the consciousness of masses of workers and youth throughout the world for workers throughout the world critical questions of program and perspective are raised auto workers in india this past week took courageous action to stop production which is part of a broader movement of workers in india as the pandemic spreads without restraint in chennai the auto companies have received authorization from the tamil nadu state government to continue production placing the lives of auto workers their families and the public at large at grave risk as is the case throughout this global catastrophe the lives of workers have been subordinated to the profits of the banks workers in india should study the experience in the united states in march of 2020 autoworkers in the us along with workers in canada and in europe stopped work on the line and demanded that non essential production be halted at this early stage in the pandemic the spontaneous response of workers forced governments to implement partial lockdowns and other measures that scientists insisted were necessary to stop the spread of the disease while workers acted courageously they lacked the necessary organizational forms and political perspective to transform this outburst of opposition into a movement that could put an end to the source of the problem the capitalist system the ruling class regrouped it passed its bailout and then proceeded with its campaign to force workers back on the job the trade unions have played an absolutely critical role in assisting the ruling class in implementing its homicidal policies far from organizing opposition among workers the trade unions have collaborated in keeping businesses and schools open more than six hundred thousand people have died in the us and the trade unions have not organized a single struggle of workers aimed at stopping the carnage a section of the ruling class led by biden sees in the existing trade unions critical instruments for suppressing working class opposition moreover the development of a government sponsored and state controlled labor movement is a strategic imperative for american imperialism as it prepares an ever more direct confrontation with china last month biden announced a task force to promote the unions that includes as prominent members both defense secretary lloyd austin and the treasury secretary and former fed chairman janet yellen that is two chief representatives of american imperialism and finance capital there is however a growing movement in the working class to break free from the stranglehold of the unions which is ignored by the media in this country and throughout the world in virginia workers at swedish owned volvo trucks have established a rank and file committee to oppose the efforts of the united auto workers to sabotage their strike last month and then to impose a contract dictated by the company workers are currently mobilizing to defeat a new contract and beginning to reach out to fellow workers throughout the country to coordinate their struggles in the southern state of alabama 1 100 miners have been on strike since april and overwhelmingly rejected a contract brought back by the united mine workers of america umwa over the past week the leading officials of the umwa have resorted to violence and thuggery specifically targeting the world socialist web site but directed at intimidating opposition among workers to the sellout of their strike in the northern us 1 300 steelworkers have been on strike for two months against allegheny technologies they too have been isolated by the unions in this case the united steelworkers but have repeatedly resisted and rejected ultimatums from the company these are only a few of the initial expressions of working class anger and opposition which have included health care workers educators logistics workers and other sections of the working class the united states is not just american imperialism which is threatening war against china and which acts as a bulwark of support for reaction in every country including the critical support from both the trump and biden administrations for the right wing government of narendra modi there is also the american working class the natural allies of workers throughout the world the experiences of the past year will have a lasting impact the policy of the ruling class in response to the pandemic has produced not only mass death and social misery it is also the breeding ground for revolution it is on the basis of this perspective that the international committee of the fourth international has launched the initiative for the international workers alliance of rank and file committees in our statement announcing the formation of the iwa rfc the ic explained that its aim is to create new mechanisms through which the working class can coordinate its struggles in different factories industries and countries in opposition to the ruling class and the corporatist unions the iwa rfc will be a means through which workers throughout the world can share information and organize a united struggle to demand protection for workers the shutdown of unsafe facilities and nonessential production and other emergency measures that are necessary to stop the spread of the virus the development of this alliance must be on a global scale as it is only through a united movement of all workers throughout the world that the pandemic and all the problems produced by capitalism can be fought a counter offensive of the working class requires above all the construction of a revolutionary leadership and there is no movement outside of the world trotskyist movement the international committee of the fourth international that is building this leadership the icfi bases itself on an immense historical tradition it is a tradition that extends back to the founding of scientific socialism by marx and engels through the russian revolution of 1917 through the struggle led by trotsky against stalinism it is a tradition that has fought implacably for the perspective of international socialist revolution i urge all of you participating in this meeting to make the decision to help build the socialist equality party in sri lanka and develop a section of the icfi in india as an absolutely critical component of the building of the icfi as the world party of socialist revolution

a team of students working with jonathan boreyko associate professor in mechanical engineering at virginia tech has discovered the method ducks use to suspend water in their feathers while diving allowing them to shake it out when surfacing the discovery opens the door for applications in marine technology findings were published in acs applied materials interfaces boreyko has a well established body of work in the area of fluid mechanics including the invention of a fog harp and the use of contained recirculated steam as a cooling device as his research has progressed throughout the past decade the mechanics of duck de wetting has been one of his longest running projects i got this idea when i was at duke university said boreyko i had a really bad parking spot but my walk took me right through the scenic duke gardens i passed by ponds with lots of ducks and i noticed that when a duck comes out of the water they d shake their feathers and water would fly off i realized that what they were doing was a de wetting transition releasing water that was partially inside of their feathers that was the germ of the idea in my research purely by coincidence i was studying the same kind of thing i realized that these transitions work only if the water isn t allowed to get all the way to the bottom of the porous feather structure boreyko remained intrigued with how the balance was struck curious about the mechanisms that allow a duck to hold water in its feathers without sinking completely he brought farzad ahmadi into his lab in 2014 as a graduate student sharing that intrigue in one of their early meetings ahmadi picked up the project and dove into the finer details their first approach was simple they attempted to force a single drop of water through a natural duck feather it didn t work said ahmadi then we had the idea to build a pressure chamber to force a pool of water through several layers of feathers the team first needed to ensure the water could only penetrate directly through the feathers as opposed to simply leaking around their outer edges to achieve this they sealed one feather at a time leaving only a small area exposed the researchers sealed each layer leaving an area exposed in the same place on each surface this allowed them to create a column of exposed feather surfaces upward through the stack a thin pool of water was poured over the top exposed surface the stack was placed in a pressure chamber and gas pressure was employed to push the water downward through the feathers a camera was placed at the bottom to observe the water as it passed through the layers feathers have micro sized openings in them tiny slots that allow pressurized water to pass through a duck sitting on the surface of a pond isn t encountering any water pressure so the water penetration is negligible a duck diving downward however encounters a steady increase in hydrostatic pressure something familiar to anyone taking a dive into the deep end of a pool ahmadi discovered that as the number of feather layers increases the pressure required to push water through all the layers must also increase this establishes a kind of baseline a maximum pressure up to which feathers hold the water entering them but do not allow the water to reach a duck s skin our hypothesis was to use multiple layers of feathers so that the water only comes in part way but there are air pockets under that boreyko explained as long as those air pockets are present it prevents something called irreversible wetting as long as the wetting is only partial they can shake it out when they surface ahmadi also discovered that species of ducks tend to have the exact number of feather layers needed to avoid irreversible wetting during their dives a mallard for instance has four layers of feathers the maximum depth to which a typical mallard dives corresponds to a hydrostatic pressure that invaded a three feather stack but not four in this way at least one layer of feathers remains dry after a dive allowing the duck to shake out the water when it emerges having established the foundational mechanics of duck de wetting boreyko s team set out to create a synthetic material that works in a similar way the team made bio inspired feathers from a thin sheet of aluminum foil laser cutting an array of slots one tenth of a millimeter wide to mimic the barbules of a duck feather they also re created the hairy nanostructure of feathers by adding an aluminum nanostructure to the aluminum barbules the synthetic feathers produced nearly identical results during testing a credit to the strength of nature s design application and scaling of this technology is a logical next step for boreyko and he has a few ideas this layer effect may be helpful for trapping air pockets in desalination membranes mechanisms that remove salt from seawater boreyko also thinks there is potential for applying layered synthetic feathers to the exterior of a boat to make the boat travel more easily through the water and reduce the amount of barnacle like organisms that cling to the hull if we think of a ship moving over the water as an engineered bird right now it s swimming naked boreyko says we wonder if clothing the ship in feathers could impart the same enhancements that waterfowl benefit from

house lawmakers call on pentagon to give israel more military aid dave decamp a bipartisan group of house lawmakers sent a letter to the pentagon on wednesday urging secretary of defense lloyd austin to give the israelis more military aid after israel s gaza bombing campaign the effort was led by rep josh gottheimer d nj who was joined by 54 other members of the house the letter comes as israeli defense minister benny gantz is traveling to washington where he is expected to ask the us for an additional 1 billion in emergency military aid on top of the 3 8 billion israel receives annually the letter reads we write to express our strong support for the biden administration s ironclad commitment to israel s safety and security including replenishing israel s stock of interceptors for the iron dome missile defense system and other important matters we ask that you continue urgently engaging with israel on this request and that you please report to congress regarding israel s needs as soon as possible replenishing the iron dome missile defense system is likely the excuse the us will use to give israel more money in reality israel could easily spend the additional aid on more bombs to drop on gaza in the letter the lawmakers pointed out that after the 2014 gaza war when israel killed over 2 000 palestinians the us gave israel 225 million in emergency aid they said the agreement that gives israel 3 8 billion each year known as the memorandum of understanding says the us could hand over more money following a major armed conflict involving israel the lawmakers sounded eager to help the pentagon fulfill israel s request for more aid if israel requests additional assistance as contemplated in the mou please work closely with congress to expeditiously fulfill this request
maurice mitchell opinion contributor president joe biden s pledge to close america s racial wealth gap made in tulsa oklahoma on tuesday represents an important step in the direction of justice the city is where a white supremacist mob destroyed the prosperous black neighborhood of greenwood killing nearly 300 and biden as he stated during his speech is the first president to call out the horrors of those two days 100 years ago while visiting the city in which they happened his plan includes new measures to combat racial discrimination in housing which remains one of the key drivers of wealth disparities homes were demolished by the hundreds during many massacres in u s history through redlining and other racist housing practices governments and businesses denied black people a major path toward homeownership and wealth biden s plan also includes substantial commitments to increase the share of federal contracting that goes to small disadvantaged business owners however most of what the president outlined are details of his 2 trillion american jobs plan and while the plan does contain major commitments to racial justice and equity they aren t enough more must be done repairing america exploring fight for reparations racial justice across the country among its most promising provisions are federal support for eliminating exclusionary zoning which is used to prop up the home values of the already wealthy and have the effect of preventing black brown poor and working class americans from accessing high quality affordable housing the plan also features commitments to subsidize the renovation and rebuilding of old housing stock which is disproportionately owned by black people and which carry low property values and are located in communities that have suffered historically from disinvestment but there are powerful measures the federal government could adopt that the president has not embraced such as more direct forms of reparations if the president really wants to close the racial wealth gap he should embrace massachusetts sen elizabeth warren s ultra millionaire tax because much of the racial wealth gap is caused by the extraordinary increase in the fortunes of the richest americans who are overwhelmingly white he could commit to erasing student debt because this type of debt is disproportionately held by black students and as he provides support for h r 40 which would study reparations he can support providing land and money to the survivors of the tulsa massacre and their descendants as well as other black victims of institutional racism and government sanctioned white mob violence and while the president is correct that investment in infrastructure and job creation is crucial to combat the living legacies of jim crow the irony is that he seems bent on engaging in unnecessary negotiations with senate republicans over his proposals republicans have made clear that they are only willing to agree to a package of public investments focused on the narrowest definition of infrastructure namely roads and bridges they have specifically criticized the president for including investments focused on racial justice and climate change claiming that these have nothing to do with infrastructure it is hard to believe that republicans will support the racial justice measures that biden outlined in any bipartisan legislation meanwhile biden has rightly criticized the same republican party for ramming through restrictions on voting rights at the state level likening their actions to the jim crow laws that oppressed black people in the era of the tulsa massacre and this same republican party just used the filibuster itself the favorite tool of white supremacist southern senators for blocking civil rights legislation in the jim crow era to prevent the formation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the storming of the u s capitol on jan 6 policing the usa a look at race justice media biden has not shied away from identifying the connections between today s gop and the long and ugly history of white supremacist ideas and white supremacist violence in this country why then is he effectively giving the republican party a veto over his signature measures for addressing some of the most persistent legacies of that ugly history as more than 100 leading scholars said in an open letter this week the republican party is an anti democratic party so long as it remains one biden and democrats in congress should have no reservations about using the congressional majorities that the voters gave them to deliver on their commitments very much including their commitments to racial justice maurice mitchell is the national director of the working families party

which may include up to 25 in real estate investment trusts reits and real estate industry operating companies up to 35 of the fund s total assets may be invested in nonconvertible debt securities consisting primarily of high yield high risk corporate bonds in addition the fund utilizes leveraging techniques in an attempt to obtain a higher return for the fund there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives the fund has implemented a managed distribution policy under the policy the fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net investment income and short term capital gains the balance of the distribution will then come from long term capital gains to the extent permitted and if necessary a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income even though the fund may realize current year capital gains such gains may be offset in whole or in part by the fund s capital loss carryovers from prior years under the fund s managed distribution policy the fund makes monthly distributions to common shareholders at a targeted annual distribution rate of 7 5 of the fund s average net asset value nav per share the fund will calculate the average nav per share from the previous three full months immediately prior to the distribution based on the number of business days in those three months on which the nav is calculated the distribution will be calculated as 7 5 of the prior three month s average nav per share divided by 12 the fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the fund s managed distribution policy and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and subchapter m of the internal revenue code this distribution methodology is intended to provide shareholders with a consistent but not guaranteed income stream and a targeted annual distribution rate and is intended to narrow any discount between the market price and the nav
