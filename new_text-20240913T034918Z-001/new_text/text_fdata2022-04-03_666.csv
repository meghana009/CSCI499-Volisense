april 2012 issue fill in the fiber gaps â dietitians offer practical strategies to get clients to meet the daily requirements by sharon palmer rd todayâ s dietitian vol 14 no 4 p 40 you know how important fiber is to your clientsâ health it can help them maintain proper digestion and elimination lower blood cholesterol levels stabilize blood glucose and even lose weight yet only 5 of americans are meeting the daily recommendations in this article todayâ s dietitian will give you the tools to help your clients fill in their fiber gaps americans just donâ t get enough itâ s a simple fact that people arenâ t eating enough whole grains legumes fruits or vegetablesâ the main sources of dietary fiber so it shouldnâ t be surprising that the average intake of dietary fiber is pitifully lowâ only 15 g per day on average in fact dietary fiber is listed as a â nutrient of concernâ in the 2010 dietary guidelines for americansâ along with potassium calcium and vitamin dâ because intake is low enough to be a public health concern the adequate intake for fiber is 14 g 1 000 kcalâ 25 g per day for women and 38 g per day for men according to the 2010 dietary guidelines â todayâ s rapid pace and lifestyle hinders people from getting enough fiber they eat quick pantry food items when theyâ re hungry such as chips and crackers instead of carrots â says jessica crandall rd cde a national spokesperson for the academy of nutrition and dietetics the academy and a dietitian at sodexo wellness and nutrition â people donâ t pick high fiber foods the highest sources of fiber are first whole grains second legumes third vegetables and fourth fruits people may think â i ate an apple or some lettuce so i got my fiber â but that doesnâ t get the job done â explains joanne slavin phd rd a professor in the department of food science and nutrition at the university of minnesota who served on the dietary guidelines advisory committee fiberâ s goodness fiber a nondigestible form of carbohydrates that occurs naturally in plant foods may protect health in many important ways the 2010 dietary guidelines highlight the significance of meeting dietary fiber goals because the scientific evidence shows health protective benefits include promoting a feeling of fullness and healthful laxation in addition dietary fiber that occurs naturally in foods also may help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease obesity and type 2 diabetes according to the 2010 dietary guidelines yet the public doesnâ t fully comprehend all they have to gain by boosting their fiber intake â the biggest impact fiber can have on peopleâ s health is preventing constipation and promoting gut health this is important for kids i frequently hear people say that their children have constipation digestion and absorption are really important and itâ s much easier to prevent constipation than it is to treat it â slavin says itâ s important to remind people that fiber benefits extend beyond healthful digestion â most people think of fiber as helping to promote digestion and bowel regularity people arenâ t getting enough information on other fiber benefits such as satiety and obesity prevention as well as keeping cholesterol levels in check and stabilizing blood sugar these three areas are undereducated and underemphasized â crandall says considering the health fallout of the obesity epidemic itâ s important to stress fiberâ s role in satiety and weight loss â the data on fiber and obesity is pretty good people who eat more high fiber foods tend to weigh less â slavin says all types of fibers count there are many kinds of fiber associated with health benefits soluble fiber which is linked to lowering cholesterol levels is found in foods such as legumes oats barley nuts and some fruits and vegetables insoluble fiber found in whole grains wheat bran nuts seeds and some fruits and vegetables acts like a sponge passing through the intestines mostly unchanged thus helping promote good bowel motility nondigestible oligosaccharides found in some fruits vegetables seeds and grains resist digestion and act as a prebiotic to promote gut health resistant starches found in unripe bananas and potatoes also may help increase energy expenditure and lower glucose levels inulin which is often added to foods as a functional ingredient isnâ t digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract and stimulates the growth of friendly gut bacteria so which fibers should you promote to your patients â having fibers from a variety of sources is ideal â slavin stresses thatâ s where the beauty of a diet rich in a variety of plant foods comes in the health advantages of consuming food products filled with added isolated fibers such as inulin or bran are under debate the national institutes of health reported in august 2010 that the health benefits of added isolated fibers are still unclear research suggests they may not have the same effects as the intact fibers found in whole foods there s little evidence that isolated fibers help lower blood cholesterol and they have differing effects on regularity though studies suggest that inulin might boost the growth of good bacteria in the colon â there are more benefits with foods that have naturally occurring sources of fiber vs foods with fibers added to them iâ m not recommending that people should get most of their fiber from fiber enriched foods â crandall says â i always encourage my patients to eat clean and natural but that can be a challenge to do my motto is that you need to meet people where they are at ideally they should eat fresh fruit vegetables whole grains and legumes but in the modern situation theyâ re struggling to meet the guidelines for appropriate foods fiber fortified foods can be helpful for some people iâ d rather them meet the fiber guidelines with the help of fiber fortified foods than fail â â we need to be flexible with our recommendations on fiber â slavin adds â so many people fall short on fiber ideally i want people to get fiber from food but i want people to get fiber even if itâ s the type added to food products â helping patients meet their fiber potential to assist patients in getting the fiber they need we asked our experts to offer their best strategies to help fill the fiber gap here are their top eight 1 break down the barriers â beans make me gassy fiber makes me bloated â such are the common objections youâ ll encounter among people when youâ re trying to boost their fiber intake crandall says â people may be hesitant to increase fiber because of concerns so you need to break down the education to help people take the next step â it may be important to discuss the basics on how fiber works in the digestive tract in order to get through to your patients 2 cut through the confusion fiber can be a puzzling concept rds tell clients to eat more plant foods to increase fiber but when it comes to fiber all plant foods arenâ t created equal clients may think theyâ re doing fine in the fiber department but if theyâ re not choosing high fiber plant foods such as whole grains and legumes they could be getting minimal intake â people are confused â crandall says â they think that a salad every night gives them a lot of fiber but it may only provide 2 or 3 g and they need to get more â telling clients specifically which whole grains and legumes to eat will help clear up any confusion 3 donâ t underestimate challenges as dietitians itâ s easy to say that meeting fiber goals is a breeze but when was the last time we as rds took our own 24 hour food recall and analyzed it for fiber intake getting 25 g to 38 g of fiber a day can be tough for anyone dietary restrictions such as weight loss diets with lower carbohydrate recommendations can make getting enough fiber even more difficult â meeting fiber needs isnâ t as simple as we think it is we need to help people by offering them lots of solutions â says slavin who suggests that fiber enriched foods may be one way to add needed grams to their diet 4 demystify whole grains whole grains are one of the best sources of fiber but â the whole grain message is confusing â slavin says â there are many new whole grain food products that are really low in fiber foods such as cookies and breakfast cereals may say they have whole grains in them but they can be low in fiber â so educate your patients on methods for identifying whole grains such as looking for the whole grains councilâ s whole grain stamp on food labels that indicates theyâ re a good source of whole grains 5 make it practical move beyond a lecture on how good fiber is for the body tell patients how they can incorporate fiber into their diets â people need practical tips on how to eat more high fiber foods such as pulling out a vegetable tray from the refrigerator how to look for whole grains examples of using beans on salads and which fruits such as berries are high in fiber â crandall says 6 keep it simple as much as rds want clients to eat a minimally processed whole foods diet thatâ s naturally rich in fiber itâ s just not going to happen for many of them itâ s an rdâ s job to meet clients where they are and give them simple methods that will work whether itâ s finding the perfect breakfast cereal the whole family will like or suggesting portable high fiber snacks such as snap peas or bananas crandall says 7 be specific instead of general recommendations crandall suggests rds give patients specific suggestionsâ down to the actual brand of foods or type of whole grain or fruitâ they should eat every day â for example tell them to have oatmeal for breakfast add bell peppers and mushrooms to scrambled eggs or have berries with yogurt â crandall says 8 suggest fiber extras offer tips for regularly increasing fiber every day through the addition of â extras â such as 1 oz of flaxseed sprinkled on foods for an extra 8 g of fiber or a high fiber granola bar providing 5 g of fiber as a routine snack pushing fiber one meal at a time another practical way to encourage clients to eat more fiber is to break down their fiber goals one meal or snack at a time â micromanage your patientsâ fiber intake help them plan how theyâ ll get sources through the day â crandall suggests â break it up into 7 to 10 g of fiber per meal focus on fiber rich foods at breakfast lunch and dinner â these daily menu tips will help boost your clientsâ fiber intake one meal at a time high fiber breakfast foods â whole grain hot cereals such as oats 2 g fiber per 1 2 cup â whole grain and or high fiber cold cereal such as kelloggâ s all bran 10 g fiber per 1 2 cup fiber one 14 g fiber per 1 2 cup and kashi go lean crunch cereal 6 g fiber per 3 4 cup â whole grain

skills they need to boost their intake starting with basic education on digestion and moving up to identifying fiber sources in food products â sharon palmer rd is a contributing editor at todayâ s dietitian a freelance food and nutrition writer in southern california and author of the forthcoming book the plant powered diet a place for fiber supplements consider suggesting fiber supplements to clients to help them meet their daily fiber goals as well as to control bowel irregularity reduce appetite and lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels â fiber supplements have their place for helping certain people meet their requirements some patients may find vegetables unpalatable because of texture aversions or you may encounter bariatric or diabetic patients with limited carbohydrate intake who may have a difficult time meeting their fiber goals â says jessica crandall rd cde who provided information for the following table fiber supplements available in powder tablet capsule or water contain differing amounts of soluble fiber per dose the general recommendation is a maximum of 10 g of fiber per day from a fiber supplement crandall says dosages should be evenly dispersed throughout the day with no more than 3 to 5 g taken per serving patients should start fiber supplements in small doses at first with plenty of water and work their way up to the recommended dose type of fiber

june 2012 issue deciphering whole grain food labels â separating fact from fiction by lindsey getz todayâ s dietitian vol 14 no 6 p 44 dietitians discuss the deceptive marketing messages found on whole grain food labels and how to teach clients to read them and make the best food choices for optimal health a trip down the bread and cereal aisles nowadays is nothing short of confusing for many clients most grocery stores have an entire aisle dedicated to these products which boast jazzy marketing terms splashed across their packaging often making it difficult for consumers to know if theyâ re choosing wisely terms such as â whole grain â â multigrain â and â fiberâ are on countless boxes and packages but as you know this doesnâ t always mean these products constitute a healthful and nutritious choice the most recent dietary guidelines for americans state that at least one half of all grains consumed in a day should be whole grains unfortunately many americans fall short of this goal on average americans consume 6 4 oz equivalents of grains per dayâ with only 0 6 oz equivalents of whole grains per day part of the problem may be what food industry experts are calling the deception behind whole grain packaging consumers may think theyâ re making a good food choice based on buzzwords they see on the productâ s package when in fact the food contains little to no whole grain the term â whole grainâ is used on a great deal of packaging and what clients may not know is that the term means the product contains all three portions of the kernel germ bran and endosperm as well as a minimum of 51 whole grain ingredients by weight per serving what consumers need to seekâ which youâ re well aware ofâ are products that contain 100 whole grain finding these products may take a bit of investigative hunting on the part of clients at the grocery store but the task is worth it to improve overall health confusion abounds â when you walk into a grocery store and an entire row is dedicated to just bread it becomes overwhelming for the consumer â says bethany thayer ms rd a spokesperson for the academy of nutrition and dietetics the academy â there are so many choices and oftentimes the front of the package has so much information on it that it adds to the confusion you canâ t rely on the front of the package to tell you if itâ s a good choice you have to look at the list of ingredients â the deception associated with bread labeling has received plenty of press lately as the frustration among consumers increases many who reluctantly made the switch from white bread to seemingly whole grain breadâ and are paying extra money for what they think is a healthier choiceâ arenâ t happy when they realize their whole grain bread is essentially white bread in disguise â where it gets most confusing is when terms like â cracked wheat bread â â stoneground wheat â â enriched â or even â wheat flourâ are used on the packaging â says becky hand rd of sparkpeople com a free adult weight management internet site and a dietitian at margaret mary community hospital in baitesville indiana â these terms essentially mean nothing the bread could very likely be an enriched white flour bread with some brown coloring and a few crunchy seeds sprinkled in to get the visual look of wheat bread in reality itâ s just white bread with some makeup on â even more bewildering for many shoppers is the cereal aisle where even the sugary coated varieties have the words â whole grainâ written on the box dietitians say consumers are being misled more than ever as to what constitutes a healthful choice and thayer says that with cereal even the ingredient list can be misleading at first glance â manufacturers are able to list a whole grain as their first ingredient because theyâ re using multiple kinds of sugar â she explains â if you look at a traditional sweetened cereal and the first ingredient is a whole grain itâ s quite likely the next three are different kinds of sugar when if added up would certainly be more than the whole grain itâ s very tricky thatâ s when you also have to look at the nutrient label to be clear on exactly how much added sugar a product contains â simplifying the process the whole grains council has attempted to simplify the process of searching for whole grain foods with the introduction of a whole grain stamp the idea behind its development was to make it easy for shoppers to spot whole grain foods there are two varieties of the stamp the basic stamp and the 100 stamp if a product has received the 100 stamp all its grain ingredients are whole grains and it contains a minimum of 16 g a full serving of whole grain if a product has the basic stamp it has at least 8 g of whole grain but it also may contain some refined grain judy caplan ms rd a spokesperson for the academy says she encourages her clients to look for products with the 100 stamp she likes the idea of using the stamp to narrow down the playing field but she says you canâ t rely on it alone in making nutritious choices â the whole grain stamp is definitely a good idea â caplan says â it does help consumers to look for that 100 stamp when there are so many products to go through but it doesnâ t take the place of reading the ingredient label even if it has whole grains it can still be full of sugar or have hydrogenated fat there are other ingredients to consider if you were only concerned about whole grains the stamp might be enough but itâ s certainly not the whole picture consumers still need to take the time to look at the ingredient list â todayâ s breads often include quite a few added ingredients that may detract from the breadâ s nutrient profile a bread may be whole grain but it could still include sweeteners such as sugar or even high fructose corn syrup to make it taste better or prolong its shelf life therefore as caplan suggests consumers must look at the bigger picture vandana sheth rd cde a spokesperson for the academy agrees that clients should start by looking for the stamp but also pay attention to the grams per serving she says clients must realize that the 8 g serving stamp means theyâ re only getting one half of a serving as it stands americans arenâ t even getting a full single serving so itâ s important to tell them that the minimum goal is to get three servings of whole grains per day choosing products with the 100 stamp will help fill in the gaps numerous health benefits â â â â â â â there are many reasons americans should start paying closer attention to their whole grain intake â studies have shown that when we eat whole grains weâ re lowering our risk for many chronic conditions â sheth says â some studies show a benefit by including even just one whole grain serving per day but those benefits are significantly enhanced when we eat at least three servings a day the bottom line is to increase the intake as much as possible â â one of the obvious benefits is to get more fiber which will help prevent heart disease and stroke â caplan adds â but there are also a lot of trace minerals in whole grains some of which you might not be getting elsewhere â the trace minerals available from whole grain products include magnesium molybdenum iron and selenium among others whole grains also have been shown to decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes in a 2007 study of more than 160 000 women those who averaged two to three servings of whole grains per day were 30 less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate whole grains when the researchers of this study published in plos combined these results with those of several other large studies they found that eating an extra two servings of whole grains per day decreased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 21 helpful tips rds can help clients incorporate more whole grains with some simple tips the first begins at the grocery store educate your clients about label reading since manufacturers must list their ingredients in descending order those first few ingredients are key itâ s important that the word â wholeâ appears on the ingredient list the first ingredient should be something like â whole wheat flourâ or â whole grain rye flour â depending on the product hand says that when looking at cereal labels in addition to making sure the word whole appears in front of a specific grain she also advises clients to consider the â rule of five â â try to find something that has 5 g of fiber or more 5 g of protein or more and 5 g of sugar or less â hand explains â thatâ s a tall order and can be hard to find but you should try to shoot for it â also give clients meal ideas with some whole grain options found outside the bread and cereal aisles when clients realize there are numerous ways they can get a serving of whole grains the task of getting at least three per day doesnâ t seem so daunting â a half cup of cooked oatmeal is one serving and easy to do at breakfast â caplan suggests â for lunch you can have two slices of 100 whole grain bread and thatâ s another two servings two thirds cup of buckwheat pasta with dinner is another two servings and you could have five whole grain crackers as a snack thatâ s six servings of whole grain and it wasnâ t that hard to fit in â sheth recommends the following options brown rice quinoa millet and popcorn many consumers are surprised to learn that popcorn makes the list of whole grains suggest air popped popcorn as a healthful snack â itâ s really not that complicated to incorporate more whole grains it just comes down to simple switches â sheth continues â any change can feel overwhelming especially with so many misleading options but hereâ s a simple day filled with healthful whole grains a whole grain cereal or oatmeal for breakfast a sandwich with a whole grain tortilla or bread and a side of brown rice corn or quinoa with dinner â even desserts can offer some whole grain benefits sheth suggests switching to whole wheat flour for baking â that way youâ re getting some benefit while still enjoying something flavorful and tasty â she says â and getting kids to eat more whole grains can be easy as well kids love wraps tortillas and pita bread just switch to a whole grain option for these itâ s an easy switch that kids wonâ t mind and youâ re really enhancing the nutritional benefits â whole wheat or other whole grain pastas also are getting easier to find at the grocery store as more manufacturers have introduced more options the ingredient list is also much easier to navigate â pasta is made from wheat so youâ re basically only looking at one main ingredient â hand says â you just want to make sure it says whole wheat flour or whole wheat semolina flour and youâ re good to go itâ s much easier than the bread aisle â however thayer says itâ s most important to make sure clients have these products in their homes so they can start making healthful substitutions â if you want to make better choices the first step is making sure these healthier products are actually available in your house â she says â that obviously starts at the grocery store encourage clients to stock their pantries and shelves with whole grain noodles switch out all your traditional foods with a whole grain option regular pasta for whole grain pasta brown rice instead of white and plenty of whole grain breads and cereals to choose from then when you reach for a healthful whole grain to cook with the healthier choice is available â â lindsey getz is a freelance writer based in royersford pennsylvania deceptive buzzwords tell clients to watch out for these words that appear on product labels manufacturers use them to make their products sound healthier than they really are but these words arenâ t a definite indication the product is 100 whole grain â fiber â stoneground â cracked wheat â wheat or wheat flour â multigrain â whole grain the following words never describe whole grains â enriched flour â bran â wheat germ â lg what about white whole wheat do you have clients who love enriched flour white bread suggest they buy white whole wheat which offers the nutritional benefits of traditional whole wheat with a milder taste softer texture and lighter color white whole wheat flour is being used to make bread crackers and baking mixes and many consumers seem to prefer the taste unlike refined white flour white whole wheat flour contains all three components of the wheatâ the bran germ and endospermâ making it a true whole grain product but unlike traditional red wheat that has a darker color white whole wheat is a sort of â albino wheatâ thatâ s light in color and more closely resembles the refined white flour most consumers like the milder flavor results because white whole wheat doesnâ t contain the strong in flavor phenolic compounds found in red wheat for many who are accustomed to the taste of refined flour white whole wheat can be an easier switch says becky hand rd of sparkpeople com and a dietitian at margaret mary community hospital in baitesville indiana â for picky eaters including kids who donâ t like the taste of regular whole wheat bread whole wheat white bread could be a good option â she says â just be sure to read the ingredients label and nutrition facts to make sure youâ re really getting 100 whole wheat flourâ not white flour with some whole grains added â to ensure clients get the healthful white whole wheat urge them to look for the word â wholeâ on the ingredient list remind them if the product says only â white wheat â itâ s not the same as white whole wheat â lg know your grains as a dietitian youâ re well aware that there are several whole grain varieties available but your clients may think they have to eat more wheat or brown rice to get their daily whole grain intake the truth is the more variety they get the better todayâ s dietitian created the following list highlighting some examples of whole grains clients can eat any of these grains when consumed in a form that includes the bran germ and endosperm are considered whole grain foods and flours barley barley has more uses than in a bowl of soup it can be served as a side dish baked in bread or used in flour form to make cakes and cookies barley is also the highest in fiber of all the whole grains buckwheat often known for its use in pancake mixes buckwheat which isnâ t actually part of the cereal family has a nutty flavor and is the only grain known to have high levels of the antioxidant rutin it also provides a high level of protein second only to oats corn most people donâ t realizeâ or may forgetâ that corn is a whole grain whether itâ s corn on the cob popcorn corn cakes tortillas or polenta corn is a whole grain known for its sweet flavor oats most of the oats in this country are steamed and flattened to produce â old fashionedâ or quick and instant oats one thing unique to oats is the fact they almost never have their bran and germ removed in processing if clients see oats or oat flour on the ingredient list theyâ ll know itâ s almost always a whole grain quinoa this small and round grain is getting increased attention among consumers itâ s packed with protein and can be added to soups salads and baked goods or served as a side dish rice many clients already know they should make the switch from refined white rice to whole grain brown rice but many donâ t realize that whole grain rice also can be black purple or red rice happens to be one of the most easily digested grains ideal for those on a restricted diet or who are gluten intolerant sorghum also called milo sorghum isnâ t well known among consumers thatâ s largely because itâ s primarily used for livestock feed in this country however

bruce ndlovu sunday life reporter on monday morning more than a handful of twitter users including a few prominent ones were clamouring for munya chawawa at that time the world was still in shock after american superstar will smith had walked on the haloed oscars stage and slapped comedian chris rock after he made a few unsavoury comments about his wife jada pinkett smith across the globe people were reacting to the infamous slap tweets were being typed out at breakneck speed memes were being manufactured in record and eye catching headlines were being composed it was a slap that stopped the world and yet munya chawawa was the name on some people s lips what did a zimbabwean resident in britain have to do with a violent altercation between two hollywood stars halfway across the world in los angeles the frantic calls for people to wake up chawawa who was holidaying in spain at the time of the incident at the dolby theatre brought into sharp focus the fact that for many people across the globe his satiric videos have become the go to source for those looking for comedic interpretation of major global events or occurrences since the start of the covid 19 induced lockdowns around the world two years ago chawawa stocks have risen remarkably with his videos making it somewhat easier to digest events that viewed without the biting humour he sprinkles on them would be too hard to swallow for some he has become a handy filter of weighty issues distilling news that would otherwise leave people despondent into bite sized chucks of incisive topical humour i make content because i need to express how i m feeling about the world he said of his comedy in an interview you have to have some form of catharsis when the world throws stuff at you otherwise you ll just go crazy while he deals in humour peddling clever comedy that elicits easy laughs chiwawa has also had the bravery some comedians do not possess tackling topics some would fear to touch for example in one of his latest skits he went after the british crown making a mockery of the recent royal visit to jamaica while royal visits with their over the top pomp make for good comedy fodder there was no denying that this particular visit was sensitive during the visit jamaican prime minister andrew holness told britain s prince william and his wife kate that his country wanted to be independent and address unresolved issues a day after protesters called on the united kingdom to pay reparations for slavery in a minute long video that has since been viewed 2 4 million times on instagram alone chawawa makes a very effective parody of the whole trip and somehow manages to dissect british imperialism and colonial abuse without belittling the centuries old pain of the jamaican people chawawa would go to jokingly remark that as he was outside the uk at the time he did know if they would let him back in the country but this would not be the first time that chawawa a zimbabwean immigrant has made viral fun of his hosts when the uk s adulterous health secretary matt hancock was caught red handed in june 2021 enthusiastically breaking social distancing rules with a married aide chawawa s video a playful parody of reggae artiste shaggy s it wasn t me introduced a whole new perspective on an incident of how the elite had disregarded their own rules when the world was struggling under the strain of covid 19 the 62 second it was me video has been viewed 2 5 million times on twitter alone however despite the liberties that he takes as he clowns the elite chawawa has never lost sight of his status as a zimbabwe on his instagram bio the comedian proclaims that he has a zimbabwean passport or british depends on who s asking in that sense he joins thousands of other zimbabweans with that dual identity born in derby in the uk chawawa spent his childhood in harare before his family once again moved to framingham pigot a village in norfolk given all this he has never discarded his zimbabwean roots and believes it had a bearing on his craft my dad always used to say to me when you were in zimbabwe you were so bold he told the new york times in an interview last year being a satirist now he added is a resurgence of the guy i used to be of his native country he said people are very warm everyone wants you to do well in contrast life was often lonely in norfolk a lot of time in your own head thinking to yourself am i ever going to have friends who are like me what s the world like out there there must be more to life than this as his stocks have risen over the last two years so has chawawa s fame and success last month chawawa was voted best breakthrough performer at the first british national comedy awards for stand up to cancer while only this week the royal television society programme awards gave a thumbs up to his show race around britain giving him an award in the presenter category while for the public chawawa s success might seem sudden coinciding with the start of the lockdowns the 29 year old university of sheffield alumni insists that the success has been a long time coming anyone who says to me oh you really blew up during lockdown i think to myself i ve been doing this for years he told the guardian in an interview besides his razor sharp humour chawawa has earned a reputation for being one of the hardest and fastest working comedians barely letting events simmer for a day before he unpacks and dishes them out to the world all that hard work however has come at a cost as there is barely any balance between business and pleasure for him anymore i ve discovered being a workaholic isn t the greatest thing in the world in terms of prioritising the people who matter last year i was in norwich seeing my niece for the first time and then my phone goes and i see they ve announced tier three and i got a train back to london and stayed up all night writing a satirical song about the covid 19 restrictions you think i can just let this slide people will forget after a few days but then i think this video can change my life and that s how i approach it as he searches for the next joke the next jab to throw at the high and mighty chawawa believes that his destiny is to leave a legacy in the world with each skit each viral video or tv programme he gets to presents it seems like the sky is indeed the limit for a man who proudly counts both zimbabwean and british passports as some of his proudest possessions i love the idea of being indelible of leaving a mark on the world i can t process the idea of leaving it without having left something you know he said
reuters the federal aviation administration will investigate what went wrong when the cockpit windshield of a delta plane shattered mid air during a flight on thursday to washington d c from salt lake city utah a spokesperson said on saturday the boeing nyse 757 made a safe emergency landing in denver at around 11 35 a m on thursday after the crew declared an emergency due to a cracked windshield the federal aviation administration spokesperson said in a statement a delta spokesperson said in a statement that there had been a maintenance issue mid flight but did not elaborate out of an abundance of caution the flight crew diverted into denver and the plane landed routinely our team worked quickly to accommodate customers on a new plane and we sincerely apologize for the delay and inconvenience to their travel plans the delta spokesperson said a person who said he was a passenger on the flight posted a photo of the windshield to twitter nyse which showed the glass shattered into tiny fragments but still held in place there were 198 people on the plane according to kutv which said the passengers changed planes in denver and resumed their journey to ronald reagan national airport in washington passenger rachel wright told the tv station that someone came on the loudspeaker about 90 minutes into the flight to say the windshield had shattered and they would be landing in denver in 10 minutes i was sure i had misheard them but i hadn t wright said
you would think that a rising share price could only be good news for a company and its shareholders but not always in some cases shares can get so costly that it is difficult for new investors to buy in if you wanted to buy a single share in investing guru warren buffett s company berkshire hathaway for example you would have to fork out 500 000 380 000 more than the average cost of a house if you bought one of the original a class shares even its cheaper b class shares cost more than 350 each to counter the problem of rocketing prices companies sometimes carry out a share split which means slicing each share into smaller bite size pieces divided california based giants google and amazon are doing a share split in a five for one share split for example every shareholder would receive five shares for every one they already hold the value of their total holding would not change so for example if an original share was worth 100 each of the five new shares would be worth 20 amazon is planning a 20 for 1 share split in june the cost of one share is currently 3 260 at this price the new shares would cost 163 google s parent company alphabet is carrying out a similar share split in july the cost of one share is currently 2 781 at this price the new shares would cost 139 in the uk investment trust temple bar is planning a five for one share split next month shares are currently trading at 11 60 so at this rate the new shares would cost around 2 32 what does it mean for existing investors a share split cannot take place until it has been approved by shareholders even then it can take some weeks or even months to get the go ahead investors who hold shares on an online platform will not notice any difference as the value of their holdings should not change however anyone who holds shares directly may wonder what is going on jason hollands managing director at wealth manager bestinvest says investors who hold paper share certificates will receive new ones in the post and might wonder what is going on if they haven t followed the news annabel brodie smith communications director at the association of investment companies aic says that there may be a small disruption in the availability of information while the split takes place it can take data providers up to 24 hours or so to process a share split she says there is a lot of data to get right and it can take some time how do shareholders benefit from the split new investors may find that a lower price makes buying shares more affordable but a share split can also be good news for existing shareholders many investors like to grow their wealth by reinvesting dividends they receive from their holdings to buy new shares however this is out of the question when the share price is particularly high joe bauernfreund is manager of investment trust avi global trust which carried out a share split in january 2 he says when investors choose to reinvest their dividends if the unit price is high then a portion may be left not reinvested as it is not enough to buy a whole share james carthew head of investment companies at financial information group quoteddata adds that one of the trusts he holds in his own investment portfolio personal assets has a high share price just below 504 it means he does not reinvest his dividends he adds investors might reasonably want to tick a box to say please reinvest my dividends but with the share price that high it just doesn t work i take my dividend as cash and invest it in other shares personal assets loses out as a result does a split mean it s a good time to buy opinion is divided on whether a company splitting shares is a signal to buy or sell some believe that a share split can push up the value of a company because it broadens its appeal to a greater number of investors who were previously priced out investment trust pantheon international split its shares in november last year when they reached 30 helen steers senior manager says investors should think of it as a mechanism through which the directors were able to try to broaden the appeal of the trust pantheon shares are now trading at 3 21 after a ten for one stock split however other investment experts warn that investors should proceed with caution as a decision to split shares tends to come once they have already risen sharply in value the danger is that share prices tend to get bloated after long upward runs so stock splits can sometimes be a signal of a stock market top says russ mould investment director at wealth manager aj bell as always your decision to buy should be based on your happiness with the company s strategy and financial strength or underlying investments and expertise if it is an investment trust the unit price of an individual share should not be a signal to buy or sell a high share price doesn t equal quality as mould infers a high share price can be a sign that a company has become successful however quoteddata s carthew believes it should be taken with a pinch of salt prices especially in the us can become a bit ridiculous especially when a company has been popular for a long time he says some see a high share price as a badge of honour berkshire hathaway has created an overly complex share structure that penalises small investors just to maintain the vanity of having a high share price carthew adds that share prices in the uk tend to be more restrained usually in the range of about 50p to 20 when share prices get too big companies tend to subdivide their shares and when they get too small they often consolidate them he says other ways to buy expensive shares buying into a fund or investment trust allows you to own a small holding in companies with high share prices without forking out for a whole share your money is pooled with thousands of other investors to buy a portfolio of tens hundreds or even thousands of holdings some share dealing platforms now allow you to buy fractions of shares they are more popular in the us where high share prices are more common however a few such as freetrade and trading 212 have entered the uk market if you buy fractional shares you should be able to sell them again on the same platform you will also be entitled to a corresponding share of dividends not all providers that allow trading in fractional shares let you hold them in a full range of tax efficient wrappers for example trading 212 does not offer a self invested personal pension

austin texas ap tesla delivered 310 000 vehicles in the first quarter up roughly 68 from the same period in 2021 the company said saturday however the company s sales were slightly below expectations which were looking for tesla to produce 312 000 cars according to wedbush securities but the sales increase came even as tesla battled a global shortage of computer chips and other parts the austin texas maker of electric vehicles and solar panels announced its production and delivery results on saturday the old quarterly delivery record of 308 600 vehicles was set just one quarter ago from october through december of 2021 tesla delivered 185 000 vehicles in the first quarter of last year the global computer chip shortage has bedeviled nearly all automakers but tesla seems to have dealt with the shortages better than the rest of the industry wedbush analysts said they believe 20 000 to 25 000 sales that would have happened in the first quarter have now been pushed into the second quarter due to supply and logistics issues we remain steadfastly bullish on the tesla story and believe when factoring in all the manufacturing headwind dynamics this was a modestly bullish print wedbush analysts said in a note last year the company delivered a record 936 000 vehicles an 87 increase over 2020 numbers the company said in february that it expects 50 annual growth in sales meaning it expects about 1 4 million vehicles to be delivered this year but on a conference call with analysts ceo elon musk said the chip shortage would stop the company from rolling out any new models this year earlier this week morgan stanley analyst adam jonas wrote in an investor note that he expected 320 000 to 325 000 deliveries from january through march more than most analysts given extraordinary supply chain pressures and tesla s continued significant price increases we believe a path to full year deliveries of over 1 4 million units would be impressive but in our minds difficult in isolation to move the stock from here jonas wrote tesla shares closed friday at 1 084 59 the company opened its new factory in germany late in the first quarter and last year it started building the model y small suv at a new factory near austin texas

conversation with my billionaire friend session 9 wealth capsule 9 illiteracy both in words and numbers is the foundation of financial struggle if people are having difficulties financially there is something they cannot read either in numbers or in words something is misunderstood the rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas than people who struggle financially so if you want to be rich and maintain your wealth it s is important to be financially literate in words as well as in numbers robert kiyosaki my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because you have rejected knowledge i also will reject you from being priest for me because you have forgotten the law of your god i also will forget your children hosea 4 6 like all learning financial education is a process that should begin at an early age and continue throughout life this cumulative process builds the skills necessary for making critical financial decisions that affect one s ability to attain the assets such as education property and savings that improve economic well being alan greenspan during a telephone conversation with my billionaire friend we agreed on the need to meet to review how far we have gone with the conversation series especially as he had said that the articles that had been published so far dealt only with the foundation for building wealth he said we needed to move to the next phase of the seven pillars for building enduring wealth we agreed on the time and at the appointed time i was in his house we met in a little open shed with another individual already seated my friend was in short knickers with a bowler s hat and i could sense he was generally happy he later introduced the young man as one of his protégés who had done extremely well for himself and had just visited on a courtesy call in a few minutes the guy was gone and we started our review talk in earnest we reviewed the reactions from readers and we agreed that the series was making a necessary impact on the overview he said what he was sharing with me would cover what he described as the seven pillars of wealth this according to him would enable us to move methodically and in sequence here are the seven pillars as explained by my billionaire friend pillar 1 understanding the essence of wealth building here we deal with explaining why it is important to understand the essence of wealth building endeavours as it has been explained in some of the articles published so far the reason god would give an individual the power to be wealthy is for him to be god s treasurer and trustee intelligently distributing the wealth he has accumulated to worthy causes if a wealth builder fails to understand this essence his wealth building endeavours would have no meaning so understanding the real purpose for building wealth is critical for those who want to be part of the series we have started pillar 2 identifying and eliminating limiting beliefs and mindsets that could hinder wealth building endeavours this involves identifying and dealing with some limiting beliefs and mindsets that need to be identified and eliminated before real wealth building can start we have treated this under some of the articles we have published so far pillar 3 creating wealth making money under this we shall be focusing on the pathways to creating wealth which could take different approaches routes creating wealth by working for others investing and partnering with employers the message here is that there is no single route to building wealth you can build wealth as an employee as a self employed person as a business owner with wealth creating systems firmly in place or as an investor who can operate from any prism once he understands the dynamics of what it takes to be an investor pillar 4 managing wealth money under this we shall be dealing with all aspects of wealth building that focus on the intelligent deployment of the wealth we have already created with the understanding that if this is done properly more wealth can be created pillar 5 multiplying wealth money under this we shall be looking at how to increase the velocity of wealth creation by creating assignments and messages for wealth that enable it to produce income that is beyond direct personal efforts here we shall be discussing how to send your money on profitable assignments with the ultimate aim of getting it to produce passive incomes we shall be dealing with strategies for making this happen pillar 6 making wealth money to last under this we shall be looking at all aspects of wealth creation that make it self perpetuating real wealth is created when it is perpetuated beyond the generation that created the wealth up to the fourth generation or even more pillar 7 making wealth money to count here we shall be dealing with understanding the real reason for god allowing us the power to build wealth we are blessed essentially to be a blessing when we are sufficiently detached from the outcome of the wealth we are creating we have succeeded in partnering with the higher power to ensure the proper distribution of wealth under this we shall be dealing with personal and corporate philanthropies and the strategies for creating impactful ones we both agreed that we had covered sufficient topics under both pillars 1 and 2 and we needed to move to the next pillar creating wealth by the time we finished the overview it was already getting late so my billionaire friend suggested i should send my proposed topic to him on whatsapp with the signpost questions as usual and he would make a voice note on the subject of the week without wasting time once i got home i sent this suggested topic he who desires to build lasting wealth must first seek to acquire financial intelligence i also included 10 signpost questions to guide his treatment of the subject a few minutes after he replied thus ayo please can i shorten our week s topic to successful wealth building requires precedent acquisition of basic financial knowledge we agreed it was good to go and he promised to send his voice note on the subject to me the following day and he did but what followed after the voice notes were transcribed took our conversation to a very sensitive area from my experience as a financial journalist i have observed that many people tune off completely when you are sharing anything technical they would want you to break things down or come to their level as some would put it so i sent this note to my billionaire friend along with the draft of the transcribed voice notes greetings sir please find above the transcription of your voice notes to carry the readers along i suggest you use examples and where possible definitions and or explanations of some of the technical expressions used it may also be a good idea to take one or two per session and expand the ones in focus with practical examples to illustrate we can also use stories my observation over the years is that a lot of people are scared of financial information my thoughts sir otherwise a very powerful educational series in less than 10 minutes my billionaire friend fired back with this ayo this chosen topic is very technical ooo i have used as simple a language as possible i will try to satisfy you as much as possible sulphuric acid is h2so4 and hydrochloric acid is hcl potassium sulphate is pso4 do you have a way to make these chemical equations as simple as you desire we spoke extensively over the phone discussing this particular subject i just sat down where i was to ponder on the essence of what he was saying he argued that wealth building has its register and those who desire to play there must acquire the language of the trade just as you cannot fly a plane if you do not go to the aviation school to learn the craft eventually i sent this note back to him don t worry sir just do your best that is why this is a partnership project i will employ my journalism skills to put sweets around the whole concept god will help us hydrochloric acid remains hcl interestingly after sending that note to him i could not but continue to ponder on the validity of the point he was trying to pass across as i sat there still pondering in a flash i just recollected how i started a career in journalism and the training process that i had to undergo i obtained my first degree in political science and later my master s in the same discipline my aspiration was to obtain a phd so that i could end up as a graduate assistant but while in my final year at the university of ife preparing for my last semester exams a mysterious event happened that made it impossible for me to graduate i was the best part four student in the department but for that mysterious event i had to repeat the final class i could not graduate with my classmates i have shared this in my book the millionaires capsules to put it mildly i was devastated while i was alone on campus i had to meditate and pray to god for i did not know what to do before that experience i had developed a consuming passion for newswatch magazine especially their in depth style of writing reports while i was on campus waiting to do my reseat exam i decided to write a few articles which were published by the sketch and national concord newspapers i was very excited i wrote in my diary that i would like to be a journalist eventually for my national youth service nysc i was posted to serve at a secondary school in ijebu ode ogun state while at the school i set up a press club and one of the activities was reading the news at the assembly every wednesday morning it was so popular that people around the school would sometimes be gathered to listen to the news an idea occurred to me to launch the press club i did and i was able to draw to the place journalists i had always admired yanju adegbite of broadcasting corporation of oyo state bcos and soji akinrinade of newswatch were both there in a way i could not explain i found myself dropping my academic ambition and switching to starting a career as a journalist eventually i was given a job at national concord as a proofreader i chose that to enable me to acquire the necessary training in journalism it was while at national concord that i enrolled at the nigerian institute of journalism ogba ikeja lagos state for a postgraduate diploma in journalism where i got the director s prize for the overall all round best student at the end of the programme by divine intervention when i moved to african concord magazine the then editor mr bayo onanuga now managing director and editor in chief of the news persuaded me to join the business desk i protested suggesting he should post me to their political desk he made me understand that the only place he could place me was the business desk especially since the guy covering the business desk was on leave i had to accept his offer but with a lot of trepidation i was truly scared to compound the matter the first assignment he gave me was to cover the stock market at the nigerian stock exchange when i got to the floor of the exchange the following day i was completely lost as the stockbrokers were shouting at the top of their voices offering and bidding a language that was completely strange to me it was a monday and i needed to file my report on wednesday i figured a disaster was lurking since i did not understand what took place on the exchange talkless of filling a story eventually i devised an agenda i walked up to a stockbroker by the name of dele lateef he was working with marriot securities at that time i explained my dilemma to him and good enough he responded positively and he asked me to follow him to his office where he explained everything in the daily official list to me we became friends and i became a regular visitor to his office eventually i filled in a story even though it was not used my editor saw potential in me and asked me to repeat my visits to the exchange i decided to give it all it would take my first story was eventually published after about four months of amateur reporting at that point there was no going back i started to buy and read financial newspapers i also subscribed to a journal called arbitrage stock guide published by dr olasenni akintola bello a former commissioner for finance in ogun state one day while in the office a lady with the united states information service who had just been posted to nigeria to find out how to enhance capacity for financial reporting in the country invited me for a breakfast discussion i guess she was impressed because not long after our meeting she facilitated my trip to the united states of america on the international visitors programme where i joined 12 other journalists from 12 other countries where we were taken around seven states on a tour of different media establishments in the us three years later i won a reuters award which took me to their office in london where for three weeks we were exposed to deep training on how to simplify financial reporting on my return i joined financial standard as the founding ceo i needed to implement the skill i had just been exposed to i deliberately recruited a few journalists who had no financial background while joseph ode an economist was the editor i got simon kolawole publisher of the cable who was a graduate of mass communication to be his deputy another reporter we recruited was samuel ibiyemi now publisher of news direct who was a recruit in the army with no journalism background before we started we organised a one week training on how to interpret financial information publishing financial stories in an easily digestible format was one of the features that made financial standard popular recalling this story it occurred to me that my billionaire friend was right there was no way i could have gone far in financial reporting without those training programmes i went through i put a call through to my billionaire friend and i shared my experience with him his response why should a person acquire financial knowledge that s what i was trying to put across those who desire to build wealth in the way we are presenting it must do what is required to acquire the language of the trade as wealth builders we are guided by the simple english adage that says do not go near water unless you have learned to swim in wealth building we must be guided by basic knowledge of finance and seek to commence our wealth building process with some good financial literacy to develop the ability to understand and effectively use financial skills for wealth building knowledge of financial skills considerably helps to build and sustain wealth this includes understanding the basic elements of budgeting credit management financial management insurance credit interest management the intricate issues of risk and return trade offs with investments understanding the time value of money and the analysis of return and opportunity costs it involves a good understanding of how to handle cash better and be able to manoeuvre in between the currencies of different nations while engaged in the process of possible international transactions during wealth building it also includes preparing and better positioning for wealth builders banking interactions and as of prime importance avoiding making poor financial judgements and decisions during the process of building and sustaining wealth by wealth builders generally good basic financial knowledge therefore is a very necessary prerequisite for successfully building and sustaining wealth interestingly it does not require too much classroom schooling but involves continuous commitment and dedication to acquiring needed financial knowledge as far as possible there are examples of people even in nigeria who have greatly built wealth and are successfully competing against major world brands examples of such people in nigeria are chief samuel adedoyin and the group chairman of bigi mineral waters production at ososa near ijebu ode who have successfully built solid wealth in this wise and are making nigeria proud these two exemplary wealth builders have also managed banks as chairmen of nigerian banks another that comes to mind with such little schooling background but great and successful wealth builders is the late chief odutola who built vast wealth producing tyres and many other successful brands they successfully used their acquired classroom schooling basic financial knowledge to build and effectively manage their vast wealth to make sound financial decisions acquiring financial knowledge generally helps wealth builders to spend less than they earn make money work for them and prepare them for some unexpected in future my billionaire friend and i agreed that while we would try to simplify things we must alert our readers that those who truly want to build wealth must be willing to invest in training on basic financial literacy how then should wealth builders acquire financial literacy my billionaire friend offered a few suggestions how do wealth builders acquire financial knowledge one is tempted at this stage to ask about how wealth builders acquire the basic financial knowledge that is being discussed here since not all wealth builders must necessarily have studied finance investment and economics in school a medical doctor fashion designer etc who are without solid education in financial management but who can still acquire the basic financial knowledge discussed here as follows enroll on short courses many of us have read the cv of peter obi the former governor of anambra state and current nigerian presidential aspirant his cv contains a long list of short term courses that he has taken at harvard oxford cambridge etc for systematically and continuously acquiring knowledge in short term courses for building his wealth and solid reputation the same goes for many successful wealth builders like aig imoukhuede as earlier discussed in this series for building his access bank group along with his partner herbert wigwe the same goes for olusegun osunkeye prince yemisi shyllon tony elumelu seun adetu etc in the process of building their manageable wealth they are all known to have enrolled in short term courses at many institutions of repute to acquire knowledge and build wealth get a mentor or expert to advise you another way wealth builders gain the financial knowledge already exposed here is to learn from experts asking them critical questions which develops them wealth builders should not be shy from identifying mentors who can assist them in acquiring basic financial knowledge to help them build and sustain wealth read financial journals seminars newspapers and magazines another method for obtaining basic financial knowledge is generally via newspapers journals seminars and magazines there are many seminars available for acquiring basic knowledge of financial and investment management this can be sought out on instagram the internet etc etc wealth builders must also get familiar with financial tools and apps that are available via information technology platforms this is an all time tool that wealth builders can acquire towards enhancing and sustaining their wealth in general financial knowledge is very necessary for not only building but also sustaining wealth to improve the financial situations of their investments and contribute to the development and growth of their families society nation and the world we have to stop this week tighten your belt as we shall start a conversation around where aspiring wealth builders need to acquire financial literacy i can t wait to catch up with you next week yours moneywisely ayo arowolo thisdaylive com tel 08086447494 quote 1 in general financial knowledge is very necessary for not only building but also sustaining the wealth built by wealth builders with a view to improving the financial situations of their investments and contributing to the development and growth of their families society nation and the world quote 2 we both agreed that while we would try to simplify things we must alert our

new york city new york according to a new pew research survey some 72 percent of americans have considerable confidence in ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky higher than any other international leader ever recorded after leading his country in the face of the latest unprovoked attack by russia zelensky has become a very vocal leader from 21st to 27th march pew asked 3 581 u s adults about their confidence level in world leaders zelensky is trailed by french president emmanuel macron 55 percent german chancellor olaf scholz 53 percent president biden 48 percent and chinese president xi jinping 15 percent russian president vladimir putin received dismal ratings with only 6 percent of adults expressing confidence in him in light of russia s invasion of ukraine pew said putin not only has the lowest recorded rating on the survey he has an all time low in surveys going back nearly two decades and 77 percent of those surveyed said they had no confidence in him at all in the month since the start of a bloody defensive war with russia zelensky has mobilized ukrainian forces to repel the invasion and urged western powers the u s in particular to provide his country with more arms and aid pew said
from david brady at sprott money news the two primary drivers of the markets in general from my perspective were and are the following the ongoing situation in ukraine and the escalation of tensions between the east and west inflation and monetary policy tightening in response by the fed boc and boe to name a few starting with the ukraine situation in response to escalating sanctions from the u s in particular on russia and now china too putin declared last wednesday that unfriendly countries namely the u s and all eu countries must pay for their natural gas in rubles this is a huge development a potential game changer especially given that saudi arabia is considering selling oil to china in yuan instead of dollars that creates tremendous concern about the remaining lifespan of the petrodollar taken together the fate of the dollar s role as the global reserve currency is increasingly under threat one can only imagine what would happen if china attacked taiwan and the u s responded either financially or militarily what if china said they would only accept payment for their exports in yuan or stop exporting some key items altogether then there s the nuclear option of china declaring just how much gold they really have the dollar is on an increasingly fragile ground here with the prospect of two commodity backed currencies the ruble and the yuan challenging its reserve status now people look at the dxy and say the dollar is doing just fine but the dxy is rising because the dollar is rising against the euro and the yen all that means is that the dollar is devaluing at a slower pace than the euro and the yen all fiat currencies are being devalued to some extent or another due to soaring inflation everywhere but especially in the west all you have to do is look at what has happened to all commodity prices recently it also explains why gold and silver remained resilient despite a rising dollar and soaring nominal and real yields recently the dollar s days as the global reserve currency appear to be a few geopolitical headlines away if this continues or more likely gets worse what happens to gold and silver switching to central bank tightening and focusing on the fed they re committing a policy error on steroids because the trap has been sprung on them it s called stagflation the fed s worst fear sure it makes sense to hike rates to stem the rise in inflation or better reduce it but they are doing so into an already slowing economy ask the atlanta fed or the 2 10y yield curve which is close to inverting that seems to be the intent to create a recession in order to bring down inflation reduce demand for goods and services and thereby force prices to slow their ascent but how far are they willing to go housing markets are already decelerating as mortgage rates soar and mortgage applications are evaporating i believe it all depends on stocks when the s p falls hard again perhaps to a lower low the fed will be forced to revert to zero rates and qe to avoid a systemic collapse when the fed opens the floodgates of liquidity again inflation will resume its upward trajectory bearing on hyperinflation if 2020 and 2008 are anything to go by gold and silver will go vertical at that point when does this fed 180 occur when it comes to timing i prefer to stand on the shoulder of giants like michael hartnett of bank of america who is expecting the depth of the recession and the associated stock market crash in the sep oct timeframe this year which is typically bad for equities to make matters a little more complicated gold could rise in anticipation of this inevitable outcome much like it did in october 2008 six months ahead of the bottom in stocks and the inception of qe1 in march 2009 there are several potential catalysts for this to happen again this time around last month the canadian government took the unprecedented step of freezing individual accounts for donations as little as 20 to the truckers movement that set a precedent that scared a lot of well heeled people to move a large chunk of their cash out of canadian bank accounts and much of it went into precious metals imagine what could happen if the wef s warnings of potential cyberattacks on the west occur including attacks on the financial system in summary while the short term remains uncertain for gold silver and the miners especially given the record short position of the bullion banks i believe they will all begin to soar to new record highs this year perhaps sooner rather than later unfortunately following the ensuing melt up in everything once the fed and other central banks go zimbabwe on currency printing i expect the greatest depression to begin in earnest sometime in 2023 latest 2024 that s a conversation for another day but if that does play out gold and silver will likely outperform every other asset that s the beauty of precious metals they outperform almost everything else in the extreme situations of inflation stagflation hyper stagflation and deflation i struggle to find any other assets that can provide such insurance and performance under those circumstances this brings me to a final point preparing for the worst case scenario now means getting out of the cities loading up on food stores being able to grow your own food buy seeds fruit and nut trees your own water supply diverse energy sources solar wind natural gas diesel wood shelter security and a community of like minded people the downside risk is that everything turns out to be just peachy and we all go back to normal in that case you may be out a few pennies at most the upside is that you re far better prepared to survive the coming depression and the collapse of everything the risk reward of preparing now is skewed dramatically to the upside there isn t much time left unfortunately imho gold given the two trips below 1900 but failure to close below there we clearly have our support level better the recent lower low on both an intraday and closing basis was positively divergent above 1967 and another test of the record high of 2089 is likely below 1900 and 1780 or possibly even 1675 again are back on the table

sanctions to increase the economic pressure on vladimir putin s war machine so long as russian troops remain on ukrainian territory they committed to remain in close contact and speak again in the coming days defence secretary ben wallace said last week that more lethal aid will be sent to ukraine including longer range artillery while boris johnson has repeatedly insisted the uk will provide further defensive support to ukraine including a new package of 6 000 more missiles and after the emergence of the video kelin hit back telling kremlin news agency tass all arms supplies are destabilising particularly those mentioned by wallace they exacerbate the situation making it even bloodier apparently those are new high precision weapons naturally our armed forces will view them as a legitimate target if those supplies get through the ukrainian border he also accused the uk of forming overly positive reports of ukraine s military and leadership in the article by a russian state

whether he ordered an attack on the russian fuel depot in an interview with fox news he said he does not discuss any orders he issues as commander in chief on thursday explosions were reported at an ammunition depot in the surrounding area of the city the department added the probable loss of fuel and ammunition supplies from these depots will likely add additional short term strain to russia s already stretched logistic chains supplies to russian forces encircling kharkiv 60km from belgorod may be particularly affected the update follows zelensky s forces driving russia out of dozens of towns around kyiv and the north in one of the most extraordinary days since the start of the invasion today s developments come as russia s top space official says it will no longer work with its

rescuers evacuate a man in the town of irpin the kyiv region on april 1 uk defence sources revealed last night that kremlin forces have run out of vital weapons and cannot now replenish their stocks what are starstreak missiles the starstreak high velocity surface to air missile is designed to defend against conventional air threats like fixed wing fighter planes and helicopters it is made in belfast by the company thales air defence the missile has a range of more than 7km and carries a three dart payload the starstreak system is a shoulder mounted missile that travels at more than three times the speed of sound to take down low flying enemy aircraft it uses a laser beam guidance system which the manufacturer says is immune to all known countermeasures the weapon can be launched from lightweight land sea or air platforms and can be unleashed as soon as a target is detected there is no wait for lock on it accelerates to a speed of more than mach 3 approximately 2 300mph in a fraction of a second once hitting full speed it releases its three hittiles which are then guided to the target it is a man portable air defence system known by the manpads acronym the missiles are similar to the us made stinger which is already being used by ukrainian forces advertisement defence secretary ben wallace previously said the starstreak system a shoulder mounted missile that travels at more than three times the speed of sound to take down low flying enemy jets was ready to be used imminently mr wallace said the first ukrainian troops had been trained and were now deployed with starstreak adding that the uk was doing more than pretty much anyone else to help the war torn country one of the biggest challenges is that the more you go up in sophistication of weapons systems the more training you require to use them which is why the real focus of effort has to be helping the ukrainians either refurbish or locate russian or soviet equipment that is already in their inventory he told the mail on sunday just providing british tanks wouldn t really work the video released on friday shows the starstreak missile in action during its first week of use in the war a source at the mod told the times the weapon is by short range missiles company thales it can be shot from a shoulder or stand and has a range of more than four miles the missile detaches into three darts mid air which are guided to the target by a laser operator on the ground the use of lasers rather than being attracted to infrared energy means flares cannot counteract the three pronged missile britain has already sent thousands of anti tank weapons to ukraine although nato nations have continued to rebuff pleas from zelensky for tanks and fighter aircraft mr wallace told sky news earlier this week there will be more lethal aid going into ukraine as a result of today ukraine needs longer range artillery and that s because of what the russian army has been doing which is now digging in and starting to pound these cities with artillery the best counter to that is other long range artillery so be looking for and getting more long range artillery ammunition predominantly they are also looking for armoured vehicles of some types not tanks necessarily but certainly protective vehicles and more anti air all of this will be forthcoming as a result of this conference more than 30 settlements have been reclaimed with vladimir putin s forces retreating up to 25 miles in places but officials urged caution saying the movement is part of russia s tactics to encircle ukrainian troops in donbas and split the country in two nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning among the towns back under ukrainian control last night were hostomel where moscow had hoped to gain the airport to ease taking control of kyiv chernihiv in the north and chernobyl where putin s forces were heading across the border to belarus dbritain is

ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky alleged russian troops were retreating from ukraine s northern region he said the occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country the withdrawal is slow but noticeable the weapon seen in the video shared on friday is by short range missiles company thales it can be shot from a shoulder or stand and has a range of more than four miles the missile system is pictured above starstreak surface to air missiles are designed to defend against conventional air threats like fixed wing fighter planes and helicopters since the conflict began in late february russia has lost an estimated 143 planes 131 helicopters 625 tanks and 316 artillery pieces russia has also fired at least 1 100 missiles raising questions about how long it can maintain such an expenditure rate early on saturday zelensky warned his people that retreating russian forces were creating a complete disaster outside the capital as they leave mines across the whole territory including around homes and corpses he issued the warning as the humanitarian crisis in the encircled city of mariupol deepened with russian forces blocking evacuation operations for the second day in a row meanwhile the kremlin accused the ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on russian soil ukraine denied responsibility for the fiery blast but if moscow s claim is confirmed it would be the war s first known attack in which ukrainian aircraft penetrated russian airspace certainly this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said five weeks after moscow began sending upwards of 150 000 of its own troops across ukraine s border russia continued withdrawing some of its ground forces from areas around kyiv after saying earlier this week it would reduce military activity near the ukrainian capital and the northern city of chernihiv they are mining the whole territory they are mining homes mining equipment even the bodies of people who were killed zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation there are a lot of trip wires a lot of other dangers the weapon can be launched from lightweight land sea or air platforms and can be unleashed as soon as a target is detected there is no wait for lock on britain has been supplying ukraine with light anti tank weapons known as nlaws the uk has now donated 3 615 of the weapons a ukrainian territorial defence forces member is pictured today holding an nlaw in the outskirts of kyiv the government had initially supplied ukraine with 2 000 nlaws but that number has continued to grow an nlaw anti tank missile is pictured being fired during a training exercise involving uk forces defence secretary ben wallace previously said the starstreak system a shoulder mounted missile that travels at more than three times the speed of sound to take down low flying enemy jets was ready to be used imminently europe has just a month of gas supplies left before putin s threat to turn off gas bites europe has just a month of gas supplies left before vladimir putin s threat to turn off the pipelines if foreign buyers refuse to pay in roubles will start to bite european leaders can continue paying in euros or dollars for another month because payments for gas delivered to europe in april is not due until the end of the month on some contracts and on others not until early may the rouble soared back to its pre war level last night trading at 82 75 to the dollar as it continues to recover after falling to historic lows when the west applied sanctions after president putin sent his army into ukraine on february 24 the revelation comes as the rouble soared back to its pre war level last night trading at 82 75 roubles to the dollar following the russian president s latest attempt to blackmail states reliant on moscow s energy in what has been seen as a bid to shore up the currency russia has been hit by sweeping sanctions on its economy and trade since the start of putin s war in ukraine pushing the rouble to historic lows but measures by eu governments have not targeted oil and gas contracts with moscow because many member states are heavily reliant on the kremlin s supplies europe is heavily reliant on russia for its energy needs with around 40 of its gas coming from the country if moscow decides to turn off the taps it could trigger supply shortages factory closures and crippling energy costs across the region europe s continued purchase of oil and gas which costs the eu around 266million a day severely undermines western sanctions on russia as the purchases hand moscow a wodge of foreign money with which the kremlin can bolster the economy and currency as well as fund the faltering war next door but putin s latest demands of gas payments in roubles are an attempt to force the west to evade their own sanctions on the russian economy as buyers have to convert foreign currency into roubles which are only available through the sanctioned central bank european companies and governments yesterday remained adamant they would continue to settle their contracts in euros or dollars and rejected the demands as a breach of existing agreements advertisement ukraine s military said it had retaken 29 settlements in the kyiv and chernihiv regions still ukraine and its allies warned that the kremlin is not de escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table as it claimed but instead resupplying and shifting its troops to the country s east those movements appear to be preparation for an intensified assault on the mostly russian speaking donbas region in the country s east which includes mariupol zelensky warned of difficult battles ahead as russia redeploys troops we are preparing for an even more active defense he said he did not say anything about the latest round of talks which took place friday by video at a round of talks earlier in the week ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join nato and declare itself neutral moscow s chief demand in return for security guarantees from several other countries the invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million refugees from ukraine mariupol the shattered and besieged southern port city has seen some of the worst suffering of the war its

their crippled convoys because they re all made in ukraine by mark nicol and andy jehring for the daily mail russia s war effort is grinding to a halt because much of the military hardware they need is made in ukraine it emerged last night kremlin forces have run out of vital weapons and cannot now replenish their stocks uk defence sources revealed the revelations came as president volodymyr zelensky s forces drove russia out of dozens of towns around kyiv and the north in one of the most extraordinary days since the start of the invasion more than 30 settlements were reclaimed with vladimir putin s forces retreating up to 25 miles in places but officials urged caution saying the movement is part of russia s tactics to encircle ukrainian troops in donbas and split the country in two russia s war effort is grinding to a halt because much of the military hardware they need is made in ukraine it emerged as defence sources said the kremlin could not replenish its stocks the daily mail can reveal that ukraine had previously supplied russia with cruise missiles helicopter engine parts and fighter jet components it also produced the fire control systems used by russian tanks one seen here at the bottom of a river nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning among the towns back under ukrainian control last night were hostomel where moscow had hoped to gain the airport to ease taking control of kyiv chernihiv in the north and chernobyl where putin s forces were heading across the border to belarus the daily mail can reveal that ukraine had previously supplied russia with cruise missiles helicopter engine parts and fighter jet components it also produced the fire control systems used by russian tanks now when these systems fail they cannot be replaced russia is unable to source these items or alternatives from other countries due to international sanctions the revelations came as president volodymyr zelensky s forces drove russia out of dozens of towns around kyiv and the north in one of the most extraordinary days since the start of the invasion pictured ukrainian servicemen ride on an armoured transporter driving through a russian position overran by ukrainian forces outside kyiv starving soldiers reduced to eating stray dogs starving russian soldiers have been eating stray dogs abandoned by their fleeing ukrainian owners it has been reported the grim claim allegedly from a telephone call intercepted by ukraine s security services is a sign of how stretched and harried the invaders supply lines are according to a transcript released by the ukrainian agents a russian soldier was asked are you eating ok at least he is said to have replied not too bad we had alabai yesterday we wanted some meat armies should be provided with long life ration packs which do not need to be chilled and typically contain boil in the bag ready meals but the ukrainians attacks on convoys into the country appear to be cutting off supplies reducing the russian army to desperate measures as they live off the land other reportedly intercepted calls from putin s soldiers have revealed not only shortages of food but also of ammunition and fuel russian troops are said to have been raiding supermarkets for food and alcohol as well as looting homes for supplies hotelier tetiana schevchenko 47 told the times that russian and chechen fighters in trostyanets in eastern ukraine had been taking whatever they wanted from properties and killing civilians who get in their way in odessa on the black sea coast two vets are said to be still in the city and working relentlessly to help the pets left behind some of the strays across the country have even supposedly been keeping alive by feeding on the corpses of dead russians advertisement since the conflict began in late february russia has lost an estimated 143 planes 131 helicopters 625 tanks and 316 artillery pieces russia has also fired at least 1 100 missiles raising questions about how long it can maintain such an expenditure rate given russia s reliance on ukraine for military components uk defence sources say russia s war effort is in serious trouble last night a source said serious amounts of components for russian weapons systems were made there that won t be happening any more russia cannot manufacture this equipment itself or import it so it won t be getting any of these materials any time soon the hardware expended in ukraine came from historic stockpiles developed when there was greater cooperation between russia and ukraine the integration of their industrial complexes meant a severing of relations would jeopardise russia s ability to sustain military operations now they re running out in the soviet union era ukraine produced 30 per cent of the union s weaponry and military equipment weapons sales continued after the cold war in 2012 ukraine was the world s fourth largest arms exporter and the commonwealth of independent states as the soviet union became was among its biggest customers but after russia invaded crimea in 2014 and began the conflict in the donbas region aided with ukrainian equipment kyiv drastically reduced supplies to its neighbour ukraine s revenues from arms exports plummeted from 1billion in 2012 to 100million in 2020 according to uk sources russia faces drastic shortages of helicopter ship fighter jet and cruise missile parts its cruise missiles were manufactured in ukraine s second biggest city kharkiv which has been bombarded by russian artillery and aircraft the state run instrument making plant at izyum also made essential components for russia s t 72 range of tanks the war is also expected to curtail russia s nuclear programme as half of the components for its ground based intercontinental ballistic missiles were sourced in ukraine uk intelligence reports have also indicated russia s generals have pushed back against kremlin attempts to deploy thousands more troops to ukraine rejecting them as not fit for purpose on the ground a ukrainian solider in hostomel said of the russians they left like cowardly rabbits almost without a fight i think soon we will totally kick them out beyond the border the nearby town of bucha was also reportedly liberated leaving russia s plans to encircle kyiv in tatters following ukraine s victory at irpin earlier in the week a ukrainian official said the enemy has exhausted its offensive potential and needs to replenish itself and regroup and the nuclear plant at chernobyl was back in the hands of ukrainians for the first time since the start of the invasion last night russian troops reportedly started to fall ill after digging trenches in the highly toxic zones forcing them to evacuate around 700 armoured vehicles around kyiv have also headed towards belarus but ukrainian officials warned there are still significant forces around kyiv which could still cause some damage they added that there is a high probability that the retreating forces will be redeployed to the eastern donbas region advertisement a us defence official said we continue to believe that this is a repositioning we certainly haven t seen any indications that any of these troops are going back home or that they re being taken away from the fight forever

complicating things in such dynamic days investments become even more exciting however there can be increased risks for disruptions to practices that have been historically considered safe again diversification and staying up to date with technology may remedy such disruptive risks to a certain degree for example to counteract regional disruptions an australian investor may choose to invest in canadian etfs based on north american company shares and lower some of those regional risks similar strategies can be considered to counteract the devaluation risk of the australian dollar by

find a broker or fund manager which accepts australian dollars aud all three brokers we examine below offer good reputations for user friendliness and regulation all three accept aud 1 etoro overall best broker to invest in index funds australia with 20 million investors spread over 120 countries etoro has established itself as a reputable brokers ideal for beginners since its foundation in 2006 etoro has put its back into making investments as easy and safe as possible regulated by no less than 4 sovereign bodies including the australian securities investment commission asic etoro offers commission free investing in a secure friendly environment etoro boasts an interface that really is easy to use as well as a wide global selection of stocks indices etfs commodities and crypto etoro index etfs etoro provides over 250 etfs and most of them are index etfs a classic index etf is the spdr s p 500 etf spy this index etf is classic in the purest sense spy was the very first etf of all time founded in 1993 now there are 7500 etfs find this index etf by entering the etf s ticker name spy into etoro s top toolbar spy tracks the us s p 500 index this index tracks the top biggest 500 firms listed at us stock exchanges spy has a staggering 386 billion usd under management since 1993 it has delivered an annual return of 10 on average spy has close to 1 4 million followers on etoro over 4 of etoro investors have spy in their portfolios you can buy into spy commission free with etoro but as with all brokers a spread fee applies the spread is the difference between the buying and selling prices you will be offered because spy is heavily traded the spread fee is very small the spread is the difference between the sell s price and the buy b price the spread for spy at the time the above screenshot was taken is therefore 459 69 minus 458 75 0 94 the spread percentage fee is the spread divided by the buy b price multiplied by 100 the spread percentage for spy is therefore 0 94 459 69 100 0 20 you will not be charged the spread percentage fee as a separate fee rather it will come into play when you buy into the etf and sell out of it it is important to understand that investing in traditional index funds as opposed to etfs does not incur a spread fee of any kind rather you can make regular investments and withdrawals into a traditional index fund without incurring any cost however where traditional index funds incur costs is in the expense ratio index funds tend to have much higher expense ratios than etfs with index funds the expense ratio is sometimes called the ongoing cost fee ocf expense ratios and ocfs are expressed as a percentage they shows you how expensive a fund is to run spy for example has an expense ratio of 0 0945 this means effectively that for every 100 increase in assets under management the etf s management will only pass on 100 minus 0 0945 100 99 91 to investors with etfs the expense ratio is deducted at the source of every transaction and used to run the etf with etfs you do not need to worry about being hit with an expense ratio bill out of the blue by comparison the expense ratio for vanguard s us equity index fund which tracks the entire us s p index is 0 10 trading indices as cfds with etoro with etoro you can also look into trading indices using cfds contracts for difference with index funds and index etfs

offers dedicated support to australian investors via its australian website investment legend john c bogle founded vanguard in 1975 with the very first index fund this was the vanguard 500 fund which tracks the s p 500 index bogle s new idea was to rule out the risk of investing in individual stocks and invest in the whole market at once instead as bogle put it don t look for the needle in the haystack just buy the haystack this principle of diversification applies nowadays to both index funds and the more flexible etfs which developed from them vanguard is a fund specialist with 209 us

0 0 na inactivity fees apply to your total broker account rather than your holding in a single index fund or etf why invest in index funds australia index funds and index etfs often cover exactly the same investment ground for example the same index is invested in via both the vanguard australian shares index etf and the vanguard australian shares index fund index funds and index etfs offer different advantages the advantage that index funds have over etfs is that you can generally deposit and withdraw money without incurring fees this suits a steady long term approach to investing but watch out for management and account fees the advantage that etfs have over index funds is that expense ratios tend to be a lot lower and you can enter and exit your etf position easily etfs are listed on stock markets giving them great liquidity whereas index funds are not buying into an etf is a modern way to benefit from the low cost diversification offered by old style index funds but without costly account and management fees that is why etfs have swelled in number from 1 in 1993 to over 7 600 today is investing in index funds a good investment if you are looking to invest for the long haul index funds are a great investment historical data shows beyond doubt that stock market indices rise over time even if they suffer the odd bad year the idea with index funds is to buy in for the long term and benefit from the entire market growing naturally but you do have to be patient investing in index funds and etfs what are the risks with both index funds and index etfs the investor is exposed to far less risk than those involved in backing individual stocks that is because index funds and etfs track entire sector indices of hundreds of companies the risk with index funds is that account and management fees are too high etfs developed from index funds precisely because this was a problem historically but nowadays index fund fees tend to be lower than they were how to invest in indices and etfs with etoro here s your four step strategy to invest in indices with etoro from australia step 1 open an account with etoro head to etoro com supply a username your email and a

conclusion classic index fund providers like vanguard have modernised their offerings over recent years but the future belongs to brokers that offer index etfs rather than index funds although index funds do offer some advantages over etfs in supporting the methodical investor it is very important to check any account fees that apply modern brokers tend not to charge investors for the service of simply having an account etfs are considered to be the low cost answer to the problems that index funds faced investors with with 250 etfs to browse we recommend etoro as an excellent port of call for

profitability ratios above the 45 level ebitda margin and 30 level net margin moreover its return on equity roe has also landed above the 20 level for multiple years and has even hovered above the 30 threshold recently facebook has recently made interesting announcements about its plans to set a footprint in the up and coming metaverse market and the company s successful deployments of multiple solutions such as messenger and whatsapp business increase the odds that it might become a dominant force in this promising yet to be developed space the company s valuation has been recently impacted by regulatory pressures in multiple corners of the world concerning the firm s data privacy practices and monopolistic behavior as a result facebook is trading at an attractive forward p e multiple of 26 while its ltm ev ebitda multiple is standing at 18 6 despite both its adjusted earnings per share and ebitda have been growing at a cagr of around 27 in the past four years the combination of this

financial results covering the second quarter of its 2021 fiscal year as the company has managed to reverse a former downtrend in its top line results on the back of eye popping covid 19 vaccine sales in its latest quarterly report the company said it expects to see its revenues rising to around 80 billion this year more than twice what the company sold the previous year of which 33 5 billion are expected to come from the sale of its bnt162b2 covid vaccine developed alongside the german biotech company biontech moreover pfizer s adjusted diluted eps is expected to land at around 4 05 by the end of 2021 resulting in a 234 jump compared to the figure reported in 2021 while this number should probably allow the company to declare either a special dividend or significantly increase its upcoming quarterly dividend at its current price of 46 6 per share the stock offers an appealing 3 4 dividend that was already fairly sustainable based on its past cash flow generation capacity while it may be deemed as rock solid now as cash inflows will likely surge this year amid these higher top line volumes moreover the company is being valued at only 11 times its forecasted earnings for the next twelve months possibly as analysts are expecting a significant deceleration in the company s growth once the pandemic is over however with billions of people around the world still in dire need of a vaccine chances are that these covid related revenues will likely keep pfizer s top line results above their pre pandemic levels for longer than the market seems to be expecting additionally improved financial conditions may give the firm a much needed boost to further ramp up its dividend distributions this situation could lead to a sustained appreciation in its share price moving forward all things considered pfizer appears to be both a great value and dividend stock pick and that is why it made its way to this list of best stocks to buy in q3 2021 67 of all retail investor

every single of those years during that same period bottom line profit margins have improved dramatically moving from around 10 in 2016 to nearly 29 last year while its return on equity roe has progressively climbed above the 20 threshold during that period as well meanwhile gaap diluted earnings per share have been advancing at a positive pace after the company swung to positive eps in 2017 at 0 12 last year ttd reported 0 50 resulting in a 60 9 3 year cagr even though analysts are expecting a slowdown in its growth rates moving forward as the demand for digital advertising continues to grow a business such as the trade desk will likely be benefitted from an accelerated digital adoption therefore these forecasted eps may not fully reflect the business s future prospects and might be undervaluing its upside potential at the moment ttd stock is trading at 118 times its forecasted earnings per share for the next twelve months considering the rate at which the firm has been growing its bottom line results this multiple doesn t seem as stretched as it looks at first glance moreover ttd has nearly no debt so far this year the stock has gone up less than 2 after a solid 208 3 gain it delivered last year moving forward investors may either wait for a temporary pullback to enter a position at more reasonable multiples or may progressively purchase the stock through dollar cost averaging dca to smooth the short term fluctuations that ttd stock could experience over the coming months even though the current valuation seems relatively fair considering the firm s past performance and future prospects a lower entry price may increase the odds of generating gains in a shorter period 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider

currency for most australian investors that means australian dollars aud the world s fifth most traded fiat currency many brokers are limited in the geographical scope they can serve but the following three brokers etoro avatrade and capital com are fully set up for australian clients 1 etoro best overall reits broker australia founded in 2006 and boasting 20 million users etoro has a reputation as a broker where newbies can learn the ropes of investing safely the etoro user interface is super simple to use there s a massive amount of help provided with articles and faqs best of all any fees are spelled out clearly etoro has clients in 120 countries including australia as well as regulation amongst others by the australian securities investment commission asic reits investment with etoro with etoro you can invest in reits in two ways you can buy reit stock directly without commission you can buy into reit etfs that invest in a basket of different reits buy reit stock with etoro you can search for individual reit stocks by pressing discover markets and searching by industry under financial or if you know the name of a reit stock you can enter it into the top search bar and click to review your buying options here is realty income corp o a popular reit listed on the new york stock exchange with almost 6 000 commercial properties in the us and puerto rico and tenants such as 7 eleven fedex and la fitness realty income corp is unusual because its stock ticker is a single letter o what s more it pays out dividends on a monthly rather than quarterly basis you can invest in shares in this reit without commission or you can go short on it going short means setting up the transaction so you will benefit if the price falls rather than rises etoro provides this shorting facility as a contract for difference cfd this means you will not get to own actual stock but rather expose yourself to the change in the stock price shorting is not available for all stocks also provided by etoro as a cfd is the ability to leverage your sale purchase up to 5x this is risky thankfully etoro allows you to set a stop loss which will terminate the trade in the event of the price falling or rising past a point which you determine beforehand etoro allows you to buy shares in australia 500 from global markets some are reits examples are vonovia se vna de deutsche wohnen dwni de new york mortgage trust nymt invesco mortgage capital ivr and newriver reit plc nrr l do your research check out what dividends a reit pays the higher tenant occupancy rates a reit boast the more likely they are to be producing high dividends by passing on a fat rental income for long term security choose reits with high net asset values navs the net asset value is the value of the property held minus any debt compare the navs of different reits arranging debt to finance property acquisition is a standard part of the reit business model but debt always comes with risk bear that in mind a reit with big plans to grow fast might take on too much debt and then find it expensive to pay it off if interest rates rise buy into reit etfs etoro has a selection of 250 etfs exchange traded funds many are reit etfs the ishares core us reit etf usrt takes a broad approach usrt invests in a basket of reits across sectors retail residential office and specialised reits the majority of reit etfs tend to track an existing real estate index specifically the ishares global reit etf reet for example tracks the seminal ftse epra nareit global reit index this index is the definitive index of the global commercial reit market it covers 490 real estate companies based in 39 countries amounting to a market capitalisation of around 1 7 trillion usd the vaneck vectors mortgage reit income etf mort tracks the performance of the mvis us mortgage reits index etfs allow you to spread risk by investing in many reits at once the idea is that if one reit runs into trouble it should not dent the performance of the etf too badly etfs are particularly well suited to reit investment because they are designed for long term holds so are reits the longer you hold an etf reit the more dividends you will accrue and the more chance the reit s owned commercial property will have to rise in value that is not to say that the value of reits cannot drop and dividend yields diminish but to allow property investment to work for your portfolio you must give it time so etfs make sense features etoro offers two innovative ways for beginners to inject their portfolio with investing expertise copytrader and copyportfolios copytrader allows you to allocate some funds which will be used to copy the trades of more experienced investors free of charge copyportfolios are a way of buying into an etoro dynamic portfolio based around a particular theme you will need 1000 usd to invest currently etoro does not offer a real estate copyportfolio but the portfolios are well worth checking out for

spread you can check out the spread for any etoro stock by comparing the buy price b and the sell price s in the screenshot below you can see the spread for popular uk reit newriver reit plc nrr which owns uk pubs shopping centres and warehouses worth 1 4 billion the buying price is 73 97 the selling price is 73 43 at any point in time the spread buying price selling price buying price the spread

much money you initially stake of course the drawback is that you can lose too and even drain your entire allocated funds in one fell swoop if the markets go against you that s leveraged trading for you on the plus side the reit sector is nowhere near as volatile as others and even in the event of a stock market crash the price of reits offer some chance of acting in a contrarian fashion because

invest in copper there are a few different ways you can invest in copper each strategy has its own pros and cons but all will benefit from increases in copper prices which have been happening consistently over the past two years here are the three most common ways to invest in the copper industry buying stock in copper mining companies arguably the easiest way to invest in copper is to buy stock in copper mining companies there are hundreds of copper mining companies around the world many of which are publicly traded most of these companies also mine for other metals but some focus entirely on copper stocks are very easy to purchase through any brokerage when you buy a share of a stock you re essentially owning a part of the company many copper mining stocks are penny stocks which means their shares are currently priced under 10 each this isn t necessarily a bad thing but it does mean that these stocks can have lower trading volumes and therefore be more volatile than more expensive stocks when looking at copper mining stocks you ll want to keep a close eye on any news that the company puts out and use that to time your investments strategically you ll also want to take a look at the company s business model a mining company with established copper projects and consistent streams of revenue is typically going to be a more stable investment than a new mining company that is still in the exploration stage finally you ll want to consider whether or not the company pays dividends to their investors many companies will make these small payments to their investors either quarterly or annually this means that dividends can serve as a source of passive income for investors buying shares of etfs with copper exposure another great option for beginner investors interested in copper is to buy shares of etfs that have exposure to the copper industry like stocks etfs are very easy to buy and sell using any brokerage account etf stands for exchange traded fund these funds are created by brokerages hedge funds or other institutional investors they work the same way that stocks do you can buy and sell shares but instead of owing a part of one specific company you ll own a part of the etf these funds can track individual commodities like copper or they can track a variety of different stocks in the latter case the stocks will usually all be in the same industry like mining there are many etfs with exposure to copper if you want to invest entirely in copper and not in other metals you can invest in the united states copper index which tracks the price of copper futures directly however there are many other etfs that track mining companies in general which includes copper mining these etfs have the added benefit of portfolio diversity because they also have exposure to other metals they are less likely to lose value even if the price of copper were to drop dramatically in the future the advantage of investing in etfs is that they tend to be more stable than investing in individual stocks because these funds track multiple stocks at one time they are usually less volatile than investing in the stock on its own however etfs are still very easy to buy which is why they are very popular among beginners buying copper futures if you want to invest in copper more directly you can buy copper futures the process of purchasing copper futures is much more complex than buying copper stocks or etfs as a result these contracts are usually best left to experienced investors when you invest in futures you are entering into a contract to buy or sell a certain commodity at some time in the future hence the name the investor is essentially betting on the price change of the commodity which can either increase or decrease these contracts are often very risky but they can generate huge returns when successful when investing in futures you ll need to put up a portion of the overall investment to enter into the contract called the initial margin the contract will have an expiration date at which point the brokerage usually settles the difference with cash which can result in significant gains or losses for example if one pound of copper is 3 at the time of purchase and that price goes up to 5 per pound by the time the contract expires you would have a return of 2 on each pound that you purchased in some cases the futures contract wouldn t be settled with cash but would instead be settled with the delivery of an asset companies may do this if they need to purchase a commodity for manufacturing and want to lock a deal in at a specific price in order to trade futures you ll need to make sure your brokerage account supports these kinds of deals most advanced brokerages do have this option but some tools that cater to retail investors may not it s also very important to make sure you understand the risks involved in purchasing futures and that you have a strategy moving forward best ways to invest in copper which is right for you these are the three most common ways to invest in copper in the past it was much more common to buy physical copper bullion and store it for long term growth while this is still an option storage costs and logistics can be a headache which means it isn t a realistic strategy for most investors these three strategies are much easier and can be done through a standard brokerage account let s take a look at which strategy might be best for you copper mining stocks if you re looking for a way to invest in copper quickly and easily copper mining stocks are going to be a great choice for you they are incredibly easy to buy and sell and you can benefit from copper price increases without having to buy it directly additionally many copper mining stocks pay dividends which means they can serve as a source of passive income in order to invest in copper mining stocks successfully you will need to be willing to do a bit of research to learn more about each stock and determine whether or not it is a good investment copper etfs since etfs work very similarly to stocks they are another great option for beginner investors who want to build their portfolio quickly in fact etfs are sometimes even better for beginners than stocks because they are typically very low risk because they are put together by reputable brokerages and institutional investors there is also less research involved looking to invest in etfs you ve come to the right place our beginner s guide will teach you everything you need to know about the best etfs to invest in right now so why wait start investing today with the best etfs copper futures copper futures are very high risk high reward this means they are best for institutional investors who have a deep understanding of how they work in order to invest in futures you ll need to be able to analyze price trends for commodities and make predictions based on what s been happening in the market this is something that can be quite tricky and takes a lot of practice to learn is copper a good investment copper prices have gone up by over 20 percent in 2021 delivering great returns for investors who already had it in their portfolio copper remains in high demand and still has plenty of potential for investors moving forward in the years to come it s also considered a relatively safe investment as we need it to build many important parts of our infrastructure overall now appears to be a good time to add copper to your investment portfolio future infrastructure growth we need copper in order to build many different types of infrastructure this includes houses and residential infrastructure as well as commercial infrastructure as a result there is consistent demand for copper the biden administration is currently working on an infrastructure plan that would result in a huge array of new projects throughout the country many of which would require copper notably electric vehicle charging stations require copper and we are likely to see many of them built throughout the country in the years to come electronics copper is also used in high end computer chips and other electronic devices this is another reason why copper has been in such high demand this year there has been a huge need for electronic devices as we transition to hybrid and remote work setups low supply additionally copper has had a relatively low supply rate relative to its demand which has only driven up the price even further this low supply is due to covid 19 shutdowns around the world in 2020 and early 2021 which limited production although copper mines have been open for several months now it will take time for the world to fully recover from the shutdown what are the risks of investing in copper although there are many potential benefits of investing in copper there are some risks involved as well it s very important for investors to understand these risks before investing expensive operations if you are investing in copper mining stocks it s important to note that this business model can be very expensive and difficult to set up copper mines take a long time to develop and most mining companies will take on debt in order to set up the mines as a result it can take these companies a long time to be profitable which can have an effect on their stock price social and ethical concerns there are also many social and ethical concerns that have arisen as a result of copper mining operations around the world many investors are concerned with labor practices within copper mines as well as the environmental impact of copper mining how to invest in copper with etoro starting your investment portfolio can be tricky but etoro streamlines the process to make things easier here s how to invest

currency pairs are a forex device traders use pairs to bet on the relative strength of one currency vs another the most popular conventional currency pair globally is eur usd which allows you bet on the relative strength of the euro vs the us dollar when a conventional fiat currency is paired with a crypto like litecoin the pair is called a currency pair when two crypto are paired together that is called a crypto cross on crypto exchanges crypto crosses and pairs are often used to exchange one currency for another this means that you actually have to own one of the currencies whether it is a conventional fiat currency or crypto from your crypto wallet etoro offers the powerful advantage that you can trade a crypto pair or cross without owning either of the currencies involved or having a crypto wallet you can simply a buy into the pair using your etoro funds which are always stored as usd and be exposed to the difference in price crypto pairs and crosses give you a slightly more sophisticated way of investing in litecoin ltc than simply buying or shorting stock that is because you can take into account the relative strength of other currencies with etoro you can trade litecoin ltc as a currency pair vs the euro british pound australian dollar new zealand dollar canadian dollar swiss france and japanese yen say for example that you believe litecoin ltc will rise in

aud will rise in value vs the price of litecoin you would sell into the ltcaud pair going short on cryptos requires entering into a cfd contract for difference this is permitted for australian investors to begin this process press the s button in the image above the s button is greyed out that is because the image was taken from a uk account in the uk cfd crypto trading is not allowed the

going the way of big tobacco not soon it would seem the uk stock market counts royal dutch shell and bp in its top five stocks by market value in the us exxon vies with apple for the top slot but as campaigns persuading investors to sell fossil fuel holdings land glancing if not killer blows it is worth considering their managed decline are oil and gas companies going the way of big tobacco not soon it would seem the uk stock market counts royal dutch shell and bp in its top five stocks by market value in the us exxon vies with apple for the top slot but as campaigns persuading investors to sell fossil fuel holdings land glancing if not killer blows it is worth considering their managed decline oil divestment programmes form part of the socially responsible investment sri sector which foregoes potentially profitable investment opportunities for the social good even if there are convincing arguments about the long term sustainability of business models and profits it s a tough sell simply put reducing the capital base for fossil fuel and coâ emissions by changing investment behaviour is a goal which bumps up against the financial imperative that drives investment decisions so how has socially responsible investment impacted investment markets to answer that look back over the past half century to another industry that was shunned by funds before the coâ debate in the 1960s it became clear that tobacco consumption was harmful to health and a steady barrage of medical evidence coupled with restrictions and increasingly punitive law suits forced many investors to reconsider their holdings tobacco together with alcohol and gambling were named sin stocks a malign alternative to their do gooding peers we can track the consequences of sri developments on the tobacco sector firstly the impact of declining output and lawsuits caused good performance from the 1970s to reverse the chart below shows that for 100 in tobacco red with all income re invested since 1973 a peak of almost 10 000 was achieved by the late 1990s before a late reaction to the deluge of negativity forced a correction outperformance relative to the overall market blue was eroded by 2000 recovering tobacco datastream total return indices author provided responsibility why was an industry subject to punitive legislation and massive legal bills so resilient the answer might be a clue for the fate of contemporary oil companies concerns were raised over fund managers responsibility to deliver returns for their clients tobacco giants argued that while their stocks offered high earnings fund managers had a duty to clients often small pension fund holders like you and me not to divest and to support new plans but that relies on these accursed sin stocks delivering returns strong enough to outweigh ethical arguments lighting up the index ximena salazar cc by nc nd when tobacco stocks were shunned by several large funds in 2000 research shows a 15 20 sri markdown but once that was completed we see excess performance of about 3 a year since in other words beating the market in fact had you held on to that 100 tobacco stake from 1973 and re invested all dividends it would now be worth nearly 100 000 this performance is due to high payouts and relative stability since that late 1990s blip the industry doesn t seem short of issues that might motivate more investors to withdraw but until those issues bite decisively big tobacco has found success though globalisation to keep its head above water oil well but it hasn t been all roses for the cigarette peddlars despite their apparent resilience investors are simply not funding growth and expansion they take their annual dividends and run as a result the industry s share of the stock is falling this indicates a dying sector while it is still generating and paying high earnings the tobacco corner is smaller now only growth can support a niche play but tobacco s capitalisation has declined from its peak and faces further sri exclusion in the s p 500 index of top stocks in the us three firms remain with an index share of 1 philip morris altria and reynolds believing these will become less significant managers that are focused on future growth have sold to dividend seeking income funds if this is tobacco s fate can oil be next the harms of conflict pollution and climate change certainly have the potential to increase social costs and put future returns at risk however oil and gas investments are a much bigger fish to fry than tobacco at their peak they accounted for 25 of market capitalisation this has fallen but is still 10 moreover there are currently 40 oil and gas in the s p list of america s biggest stocks rigged game murky future for oil stocks stig nygaard cc by unlike tobacco oil and gas will necessarily remain a significant part of asset allocation and index funds have no choice but to match choosing to put less tobacco stocks in a portfolio than are in the market is no longer risky but under weighting oil is since 2000 us oil and gas stocks have also outperformed green in the chart above with a dip of late but oil will take time to replace taking the hard road so let s say the managers running our money can t be convinced to sell oil giants yet it doesn t mean they are entirely without influence active ownership allows asset managers to flag concerns and ask for governance or sustainability action crucially energy companies can chose to embrace green generation technology or not and fund managers will have a say in those decisions the risk of ceos talking without acting or like vw failing to spot flaws in their business is severe reputational damage tobacco signals a likely future for oil companies that struggle to change tack even if funds don t divest high dividends won t persuade them to re invest oil assets face becoming stranded luring investors with high yield but low growth like tobacco oil will fade from the index no one wants to be the one turning the lights out no fund wants to be the last selling out financial markets are almost off cigarettes will they now kick the oil habit is republished with permission from the

american airlines stock down 4 time to buy aal stock please note that we are not authorised to provide any investment advice the content on this page is for information purposes only the price of american airlines stock declined 4 yesterday despite the recovery seen by broad market indexes after goldman sachs conducted a review of the price targets and recommendations for us airlines the american investment bank downgraded aal stock from neutral to sell while it slashed its price target from 19 to 18 per share upon highlighting that the company s elevated operating leverage and weaker mid term pricing capacity may slow down the pace at which it will swing to profitability we remain positive on the path to profitability recovery for the airlines over the medium term but we are reducing our dec q 2021 2022 outlooks due to higher fuel worse short term revenue trends heading into 2022 we are forecasting capacity growth to be elevated and for pricing to lag the recovery in traffic stated catherine o brien the analyst who covers aal stock on behalf of goldman could this downgrade plunge aal stock once again to the 18 level or will market participants ignore this report and keep pushing the price higher on the back of the progressive recovery of the industry in the following article i ll be assessing the price action and fundamentals of american airlines stock to possibly answer that question 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider american airlines stock technical analysis the price of american airlines successfully bounced off its 18 horizontal support on 13 september and had advanced more than 10 since then until this report from goldman came out however the bounce seems to have been short lived as the price rejected a climb above the 22 level possibly due to the downbeat tone of this goldman report at the moment aal stock is finding support at the 50 day moving average and there is a confluence of three simple moving averages at the current level 20 day 50 day and 200 day smas if the stock bounces off these supports chances are that another jump toward the 22 level will end up breaking that resistance as that will signal the market s confidence about the long term outlook for the stock trading volumes were particularly high yesterday but the share price closed above the session s low meanwhile the macd is pointing to a bearish outlook as positive histogram readings have been steadily declining while the oscillator seems poised to cross below the signal line typically a sell signal moreover the relative strength index rsi is standing at 50 but heading downwards moving forward the directional path is unclear until we either get a break below the 20 level bearish or a strong bounce off this support and a jump above the 22 area bullish american airlines stock fundamental analysis the situation for airlines is still worrying as the rapid spread of the delta variant is still weighing on the industry s short term outlook however most of these companies have already seen the demand for their services recover to around 60 or more of pre pandemic levels that said their future profit generation capacity is still a concern only a few days before goldman s report hit the street morgan stanley shared a positive view about the commercial aviation industry citing waning covid 19 concerns as a short term tailwind for stock prices we believe the airline stocks are now poised at a point similar to oct 2020 and feb 2021 just past peak sentiment fears when incremental positive headlines drove strong buying in the space analysts from ms stated in a note to clients on 4 october they added we believe peak covid fears for investors were probably in late august and we have already seen the stocks react positively to headlines on international reopening the covid pill and even negative pre announcements the covid pill as they called it is the molnupiravir treatment that could be soon introduced by merck mck upon obtaining positive results during phase 3 trials this treatment could be a game changer for the industry as it will be the first fda approved antiviral against the virus the combination of en masse vaccinations and an available treatment for the disease should eventually dissipate concerns about a prolonged impact of the virus in the demand for air tickets and that could have a positive effect on valuations in the near future according to american s latest quarterly report sales are expected to be 20 below pre pandemic levels for the third quarter of the year while pre tax negative adjusted profit margins should range between 3 and 7 the company s long term debt is at least 70 higher than it was before the pandemic and this means that higher interest expenditures will likely weigh on the firm s profitability in the future by the end of 2019 american s normalized diluted eps landed at 4 09 per share even in a pessimistic scenario where aal reports half of that figure in future dates the resulting forward price to earnings ratio would be 10 based on yesterday s closing price of 20 5 per share this conservative valuation the firm s large cash reserves which should eventually be used to reduce its outstanding debt commitments and other positive factors point to american airlines stock as a relatively undervalued airline

exchange or known as forex fx trading is the conversion of one currency to another the speculation that a currency will be worth more than your traded currency is what drives many traders to trade in forex traders then profit or lose from the exchange depending on the movement of the currency what makes forex different from other traded assets is that it is done on an over the counter transaction rather than on an exchange like stocks forex is open 24 hours a day from monday to friday and it is governed by a global network of banks it has four major forex trading centres across different time zones london new york sydney and tokyo at present forex trading is the largest financial market in the world where it has grown from 1 2 trillion in 1995 to almost 6 trillion in 2020 similarly forex traders in new zealand are also growing with the nzd new zealand dollar being the top 10th most traded currency in the world how does forex trading work large interbank transactions set the momentum of the price of currencies by bidding for a particular currency hence it is based on supply and demand because of the large amounts being traded daily by these banks it s difficult for retail traders to influence the market as a result traders have to trade with their brokers who sometimes re quote prices and even trade against their own customers it s also important to remember that these brokers dealers have different regulations depending on where you are located basically when it comes to trading you are betting on a pair of currencies to increase more than what you paid for or decrease if you enter a short position let s look at an example for example if your pair is nzd usd your base currency is nzd and usd is the quote currency the exchange rate is the amount of the quote currency required to purchase 1 unit of the base currency that said the base currency is always expressed as 1 unit however the quoted currency fluctuates depending on the current market and the amount required to purchase one unit of the base currency if the nzd usd exchange rate is 1 50 nzd 1 will purchase usd 1 50 and the other way around what are the benefits and risks of forex trading platforms

sells at the asking price commissions commissions also vary across different forex trading platforms but typically brokerage platforms only charge little to minimal charges for example etoro which is

on ge stock this is one of the best backdrops we ve seen for industrials over the past decade inventories are at historically low levels growth has been negative for two years stimulus is on the way and moderate inflation is generally good for cyclicals said ritchie in his note the brokerage is bullish on general electric s turnaround plan under the ceo larry culp ritchie sees ge stock rising even higher under his bullish case scenario he said we view the next chapter for ge beyond our 16 price target as being driven by double digit free cash flow margins or 1 share in free cash flow which

beyond said citi analyst andrew kaplowitz aviation turnaround to help ge stock general electric s aviation business has suffered greatly due to the covid 19 pandemic even warren buffett s berkshire hathaway booked a 10 billion impairment on the investment in precision castparts which also makes parts for aircraft the woes of the aviation industry have been visible across all the companies in the ecosystem incidentally previously berkshire hathaway also held a position in ge stock but exited last year buffett also sold the stake in all four us airlines the move turned out to be counterproductive and airline stocks have bounced back from the levels where buffett sold the stock coming back to general electric the company s aviation business should also recover which will help

months ev to ebitda multiple of 20 4x the multiples are similar to what they have averaged over the last year but higher than the 17 4x that they have averaged over the last three years while ge s current valuations are higher than the historical average they should be read in the light of the turnaround plans the company is selling off non core assets and using the proceeds to lower its debt once these actions are completed ge would be a much leaner and profitable company with a strong balance sheet also in the medium term it looks well placed to capitalize on the recovery in the aviation industry the recovery in industrial stocks will also help propel ge stock higher ge stock could outperform ge stock has underperformed the markets by a wide margin and has delivered a negative cagr of 3 2 over the last 10 years while the s p 500 has more than tripled over the period however looking at the continued turnaround and the supportive macro environment ge stock could outperform the

etoro charges no fees other than the spread between buying and selling price unlike with other brokers there are no transaction fees on top all you need to factor in are a couple of non trading fees a small currency conversion fee will apply to the deposit and withdrawal of aud into your account withdrawing funds will cost you a flat fee of 5 usd if you buy your decentraland with etoro the only fee that applies is what etoro calls the spread fee the broker is crystal clear that the percentage of the spread for buy and sell is the entire cost of the trade the minimum you need to buy decentraland or any crypto is 25 usd roughly 35 aud you do not need to use a crypto wallet to secure your decentraland as you would with an exchange etoro decentraland fees etoro charges only a spread fee on crypto transactions including decentraland the spread fee for decentraland is 4 9 does that mean you get charged 4 9 on the spread between buying and selling prices that you are offered no what etoro mean by spread fee is the spread itself 4 9 is the spread expressed as a percentage of the buying price there is no other charge so etoro expresses the size of the spread as a percentage of the buying price this percentage is then subtracted from the buying price to arrive at the selling price the difference between the two prices is the spread here s a real world example of a decentraland mana holding in an etoro portfolio look to the right of the strip above ignore everything but the two boxes one grey and one red on the right in the red box the buy b price is 0 8078 usd in the grey box the sell s price is 0 7678 usd the spread b minus s 0 04 usd the spread 4 9 of the buy price by offering a spread between the buying and selling prices available for a particular asset etoro are not doing anything new bid ask spreads have been an established part of market making for as long as stock markets have been around it is the only way a broker can cover their costs to be utterly transparent to traders etoro highlights the spread as a fee that needs to be factored in here is another way of looking at etoro s spread fee on decentraland etoro spread fee on decentraland mana example your initial investment 100 usd sample decentraland ask buy price 1 00 usd your position size 100 decentraland units etoro typical spread for decentraland 4 9 total spread fee for a round trip of decentraland buy and sell 4 9 spread fee 1 00 usd decentraland buy price 100 your position size 4 9 usd wide spreads apply to cryptos that have lower trading volumes along with crypto maker bkr decentraland mana attracts the highest etoro current crypto spread fee because of its relatively low trading volume on global markets etoro s spread percentage is very low for cryptos that have high liquidity a 0 75 etoro spread fee applies for example to market leading bitcoin btc which claims 40 of the total crypto market and boasts the highest market capitalisation a 1 9 spread fee applies to other coins with high trading volumes such as ethereum eth litecoin ltc and bitcoin cash bch etoro s spread fees generally don t change but if the liquidity of a crypto does dramatically change expect the spread fee to adjust too pros buy and sell decentraland in seconds buy and sell decentraland in seconds no crypto trading fees apart from the spread no crypto trading fees apart from the spread

first six months of 2021 from its all time low atl the price of mana rose by 3500 and hit an all time high ath of 1 60 in may then it fell and found support below 0 5 usd in june now decentraland sitting around the 0 80 usd mark is on an upwards trajectory if decentraland continues to gain support from big brands like atari in the world as well as big investors like mike novogratz and barry seibert in the real world then mana will turn out to be a great investment it all depends on which metaverse gains the most support risks of buying decentraland in australia the main risk of buying decentraland mana is that other metaverses which offer virtual land to buy like the sandbox cryptovoxels and somnium space will become more popular than it the sandbox has sand as its in world currency cryptovoxels uses eth ethereum the somnium space has cube just like in the real world interest in particular real estate markets wax and wane interest in mana might recede there is also the risk that after the initial flurry of interest in decentraland in the first six months of 2021 the price will never again hit the heights it did of course if decentraland becomes the virtual real estate market of global choice mana s ath of 1 60 will seem like a drop in the ocean decentraland price prediction analysis underpinning positive price projections for decentraland mana is the fact that the available parcels of land in decentraland are limited to 90 000 below is an overview of the decentraland virtual space available land parcels are shown as dots coloured cyan light blue why is decentraland popular as a metaverse decentraland offers limitless opportunities for virtual interactions like music art and gaming ibizan super club amnesia for example are taking part in a four day

cryptos in existence in a sector worth over 2 trillion it is unlikely that the crypto sector is going to implode this has always been the fear of those with a bearish view increasingly though we are seeing real world businesses investing in the technologies underpinning individual cryptos like the world of decentraland in which mana is the currency and we are seeing institutions like mercahnt

conclusion already 180 000 people follow decentraland on twitter decentraland mana is likely to remain a popular crypto that s because the decentraland community voted to progressively reduce the supply of mana with the aim of increasing demand for it every time a parcel of land an avatar or a wearable is sold on decentraland a 2 5 mana tax applies this fee is then burnt ie destroyed forever already 600 million mana of the original maximum supply of 2 8 billion has been burnt as a result when it comes to buying decentraland mana an online broker is a safer bet than an exchange and etoro

find the best trading platforms australia there are many trading platforms available in australia some of them are long established incumbents others are newer companies trying to get the ball rolling picking the right one for your needs can be tricky as you need to keep in mind several considerations before depositing your hard earned cash let s see what you should consider before registration regulation and security undoubtedly your security and safety are the main aspects you should consider although we ve only listed regulated trading platforms there are many other unregulated ones available online our top choices are regulated by asic the australian authority that makes sure the broker follows certain safety and security protocols for instance etoro keeps segregated accounts which means that the company does not use clients deposited money to run the business in case of liquidation it means that your capital remains safe payment methods next the variety of payment methods is important as it means that you can easily and quickly withdraw or deposit cash into your account you need to check what payment methods are supported by your chosen broker especially since you will have to fund it to start trading for instance many popular brokers like etoro provide all the main options such as bank transfer credit or debit card payments and e wallets like neteller paypal and skrill if your chosen broker provides only bank transfers either for withdrawal deposits or both this may be a significant drawback since bank transfers typically take 5 7 business days to be reflected in your account supported markets when choosing the best trading platform in australia you need to check whether it provides access to the type of assets that interests you for instance short term traders may want to have access to cryptocurrency or forex while medium term traders may also be interested in etfs stocks and other options another thing to consider is whether you can buy real assets or cfds there are trading platforms like etoro that support both while others are only cfd providers cfds come with higher risk and an overnight fee if you plan to buy and hold these small fees could easily add up and bite into your profit advanced traders planning to trade derivatives may still want to have access to both real assets and derivatives just in case they plan to add real stocks to a longer term portfolio too leverage and short selling if you re planning to become a trader or you are already an experienced one you should be familiar with two key concepts leverage and short selling leverage in short leverage means that you can place trades higher than your capital for instance if you have 500 you can use leverage to place a trade worth 1 000 this is a leverage ratio of 1 2 the remaining money is borrowed from your broker and you get to keep all the profit when you close the position the borrowed funds return to your broker because of this borrowing leverage typically comes with an extra small fee depending on your chosen broker however leverage can not only multiply your profit it can also multiply your losses if the market goes against you you can virtually lose unlimited money this is where regulation comes in and why you should always opt for a regulated broker for instance regulated brokers like etoro come with negative balance protection which means you cannot lose more than what you have in your account in australia and many other countries around the world regulating authorities impose certain leverage limits to accounts for extra protection short selling short selling is a similar concept in that it refers to borrowing shares from your broker then selling them at the market price this means you can make a profit during bear markets or when the share price decreases in general traders are either bulls profiting when the prices go up or bears hunting prices that go down short selling is typically quicker and easier via cfds rather than real assets since contracts for difference allow you to speculate on the price movement of the underlying asset i e a stock rather than going through the hurdles of short selling actual shares platform fees all trading platforms have some type of fee since this represents the revenues of a company however brokers and trading platforms have variable cost structures so you need to be informed before opening an account payment fees deposits and withdrawals are free for some brokers while others do charge hefty amounts what you should keep in mind is the base currency of your broker since you will be charged a fee when changing currency etoro for instance charges only 0 5 when depositing aud if you have a us dollar account you can deposit money for free but etoro does have a small withdrawal charge commissions some brokers charge commissions or a fee when you buy and sell assets others will charge you a spread which is a fee marked in the buying and selling price of your chosen asset the spreads are also regulated by authorities but each trading platform may have its own spreads that vary within acceptable limits overnight financing if you trade derivatives like cfds leveraged or not you will have to cover overnight financing fees this means that you cover this fee to keep the position open overnight to avoid them you can day trade or open and close positions during the same day to avoid overnight fees research and analysis researching and analysis are two key aspects when you are a trader building a strategy based on guesswork or intuition increases your risk exponentially as a result it s highly recommended to do your due diligence before investing in different assets to help you out your chosen trading platform should provide resources for research and analysis copy trading for traders with little experience or who want to automate trading copy trading features are a must etoro is the most popular platform in this regard which allows you to copy experienced traders in other words once you copy a trader the platform will copy their positions automatically so your portfolio is adjusted every time the master trader adjusts their own portfolio customer service the best trading platform in australia should provide flawless customer service ideally you should have access to online chat support for quick replies and this should be available 24 7 or 24 5 for your convenience mobile app finally your chosen trading platform should also be available on your mobile phone this provides you with maximum flexibility so you can check and manage your portfolio on the go there are many trading platforms available in australia some of them are long established incumbents others are newer companies trying to get the ball rolling picking the right one

foreign currencies in the global fx market billions of dollars are being traded on the forex marketplace each day making this trading field one of the most liquid markets globally interestingly forex can be considered a multi polar ecosystem that consists of monetary or banking systems organizations agencies brokerage providers and individuals who do trading through multiple connected platforms another aspect of this forex trading is that unlike some other stock exchanges i e nyse new york stock exchange or nasdaq no single entity such as a government or central bank oversees the forex market as a whole that being said forex activities are regulated at a local level by each country s regulatory agencies how does forex trading work to put it simply forex trading works through the purchasing and selling of foreign currencies the most significant distinction from most other assets in this regard is that forex trading is performed through sets of currencies called currency pairs such as the exchange between euro and us dollar or us dollar and british pound you trade one currency against another when you make a forex deal so relative value plays a massive role in the trades if the currency you buy rises versus the currency you sell you profit from it it is imperative to mention here that one currency is called the base currency and its value is equal to 1 while the other currency from the pair is called the quote currency so when a trader longs the eurusd that means the trader will potentially profit when the eur value rises against the usd when a trader shorts the eurusd pair that means the trader will profit when euro s value falls against the usd or usd value rises against eur in other words eurusd is the most liquid and popular trading pair historically let s look at an example in the example of aud gbp or sometimes shown as audgbp aud is the base currency and gbp is the quote currency therefore one australian dollar 1 aud is equal to 0 55 when making a currency purchase the amount you pay is referred to as the ask or the offer and when you sell the value you are selling at is referred to as the bid this value will fluctuate significantly based on many factors that affect the markets forex brokers facilitate the trading of currencies on a 24 hour basis and the market is open from sunday to friday it s important to keep in mind that bank holidays may affect the trading hours what are the benefits and risks of forex trading platforms 1 min deposit 50 mobile app yes invest in a wide range of cryptocurrencies ability to copy more

virgin galactic stock down 10 in august time to buy spce stock please note that we are not authorised to provide any investment advice the content on this page is for information purposes only the price of virgin galactic stock has gone down 10 so far in august after jumping near all time highs in july on the back of multiple positive news the company recently published its financial results covering the second quarter of 2021 and investors initially reacted positively to the report as shares advance more than 14 on the three days that followed the release but sentiment appears to have shifted as the price has dived for a third consecutive day this morning to its lowest levels since late may this year one of the reasons for this pronounced downtick was morgan stanley s decision to downgrade the stock to underweight the equivalent of a sell rating down from a previous equal weight rating while also setting a price target of 25 per share for the stock this target being nearly 20 lower than the previous session s closing price the american investment bank cited a prolonged no flight period as the primary reason for its decision to downgrade the stock as virgin galactic s mother ship eve will be grounded for eight months after completing a spaceflight scheduled to take place in september this year with the stock currently trading around 58 below its 52 week high of 62 8 per share could this be an opportunity to buy the stock of this commercial space travel pioneer at a more attractive valuation the following article takes a closer look at the latest price action seen by virgin galactic stock while also diving into its fundamentals to possibly answer that question 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider virgin galactic stock technical analysis before yesterday s downtick the price of virgin galactic stock was embarked on a stage of consolidation as trading ranges were progressively narrowing however morgan stanley s call has apparently prompted a sell off with more than 65 million shares exchanging hands in the past two sessions with daily trading volumes exceeding the 10 day average on both occasions as well as a result the symmetrical triangle shown in the chart a typical consolidation pattern has been broken and that could lead to a sizable and prolonged correction for virgin galactic shares in this regard momentum readings remain awfully negative as the macd has plunged to negative territory while it just crossed below the signal line this morning while posting its first negative reading in the past five sessions additionally the relative strength index rsi is also plunging to 37 today while not reaching oversold levels just yet the combination of these bearish readings along with the fact that the price has broken below all of its relevant short term and long term moving averages point to a bearish outlook for virgin galactic stock if the price continues to dive in the following sessions the bullish price gaps left behind by the price action in the past two months appear to be the most relevant support areas to watch if these gaps are filled nothing would prevent the stock from falling to its 52 week low of 14 per share meanwhile if a bounce off these gaps occurs chances are that the stock might be ready for a technical rebound on short notice virgin galactic stock fundamental analysis during the three months ended in june this year virgin galactic reported revenues of 571 000 and operating losses of 74 million along with a wider than expected net loss per share of 0 39 the company highlighted its accomplishments during this quarter including the completion of a third and fourth spaceflight the last of those being the first fully crewed flight operated by the company virgin also announced that it resumed ticket sales effective on 5 august now offering three different packages for single seat multi seat and full flight buyers the price of these tickets will start at 450 000 per seat the company reported a total of 81 96 million held in consumer deposits to date meanwhile as a result of the completion of its 500 million at the market stock offering the company has boosted its cash position to 551 62 million while it burned approximately 115 million during this second quarter of 2021 as a result of these recent downticks the market capitalization of virgin galactic has dived to around 8 billion the company is expected to start flying passengers to space during the first semester of 2022 and has already been granted a license to do so moving forward the consensus estimate points to virgin generating revenues of 25 5 million during its first year of operations in 2022 and 116 million in 2023 based on those forecasts the company s technology patents and other intangibles along with its future revenue and earnings generation capacity are being valued at 69 times its 2023 sales at a price per seat of 450 000 virgin would have to sell at least 2 200 tickets every year to make it to 1 billion in revenues a plausible target that could justify the current valuation each of its commercial vessels can carry up to 6 paying passengers and they are expected to perform 50 flights per year virgin would have to manufacture and successfully launch 5 more vessels at least while operating them at full capacity throughout the entire year to reach that figure this scenario is fairly optimistic based on the stage at which the business is in at the moment and therefore the current valuation seems stretched for a company that still needs to prove its capacity to scale and operate successfully for those interested in buying virgin stock a valuation of around 2 to 3 billion for the business would be perhaps more attractive considering all the risks involved and would only be justified if one assumes that the company can eventually reach the kind of results outlined above buy stocks at cedar fx the world s 1 trading
