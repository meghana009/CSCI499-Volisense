on monday june 21 2021 the u s supreme court issued its much awaited decision on the federal securities laws in goldman sachs grp v arkansas teachers retirement sys no 20 222 for the past several years the court has addressed important issues affecting the securities bar and this year was no different the court s decision addressed two important questions that often affect parties at the class certification stage 1 whether a court may consider the generic nature of an alleged misrepresentation for purposes of rebutting basic s presumption of reliance i e consider whether the statement was so generic that it did not actually affect the issuer s stock price which price impact would raise a presumption of indirect market wide reliance on the statement and 2 which party carries the burden of persuasion with respect to the presumption of reliance afforded to plaintiffs the supreme court answered the first question in the affirmative an outcome actually agreed with by both parties to the appeal with respect to the second question the supreme court found that precedent was clear defendants bear the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of evidence although the supreme court s decision addressed both issues head on it declined to address other topics such as the viability of price maintenance theory for establishing loss causation or the continuing viability of its ruling in amgen inc v connecticut retirement plans and trust funds 568 u s 455 468 2013 which held that the issue of materiality may not be considered at the class certification stage case background the underlying case at issue is a securities class action alleging claims pursuant to sections 10 b and 20 a of the securities exchange act of 1934 brought by shareholders of goldman sachs goldman against the bank and several of its executives the case stems from a collateralized debt obligation cdo transaction for which goldman served as the underwriter according to plaintiffs goldman had reason to believe many investors would lose money on the cdo shareholders alleged that goldman materially misled them by stating inter alia that the company had extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest and that its clients interests always come first although the alleged misstatements did not inflate goldman s share price at the time the statements were made plaintiffs alleged that they helped goldman s stock maintain an inflated price which dropped following a series of corrective disclosures this theory of damages has become known as price maintenance theory and is increasingly employed by the plaintiffs bar the issues before the supreme court stem from whether a class was properly certified in the case despite defendants arguments that their alleged statements had no effect on goldman s stock price notably the case made its way to the second circuit court of appeals twice before reaching the supreme court on its first trip the second circuit found the district court applied too high a burden to defendants opposing class certification and remanded the case for consideration applying a preponderance of evidence not conclusive proof standard in showing an absence of price impact presumption of reliance on its second trip to the second circuit the panel found that after remand the district court had correctly applied a preponderance of evidence standard and in doing so appropriately granted class certification because in the panel s view defendants failed to make a sufficient showing of no price impact the petition for certiorari followed the second circuit s affirmance of class certification somewhat unusually by the time the case reached oral argument this spring the parties were in agreement that a court could consider the generic nature of an alleged misstatement in evaluating whether it impacted a stock s price even though that analysis would also be relevant to the merits of the materiality element of a federal securities claim addressed at a later stage of the litigation and so by march 2021 parties were left to contest which party carries the ultimate burden of persuasion in overcoming basic s presumption of reliance relevant precedent the supreme court s decision authored by justice amy coney barrett focuses on the fraud on the market presumption of reliance a doctrine established in the seminal 1988 case basic v levinson 485 u s 224 246 47 1988 the underlying rationale for the presumption which affords plaintiffs in federal securities actions a presumption of the element of reliance is that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction erica p john fund inc v halliburton co 563 u s 804 813 2011 in a series of decisions the supreme court has clarified that defendants may rebut the fraud on the market presumption with a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff or his decision to trade at a fair market price basic 485 u s at 248 or b a showing that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the market price of the stock halliburton co v erica p john fund inc halliburton ii 573 u s 258 284 2014 the court s decision courts may consider the generic nature of an alleged misrepresentation at the class certification stage in a 8 1 decision on the first question the supreme court s majority finding was consistent with both parties understanding of the law n assessing price impact at class certification courts should be open to all probative evidence on that question qualitative as well as quantitative aided by a good dose of common sense slip op at 7 citation omitted notably the supreme court found such analysis to be appropriate even if it overlaps with materiality or any other merits issue id at 9 which many had believed the court previously deemed to be improper for consideration during class certification see amgen inc v conn ret plans tr funds 568 u s 455 466 68 2013 holding materiality should not be assessed at class certification as it does not bear on federal rule of civil procedure 23 s class certification predominance requirement during oral argument at least one of the justices suggested that it would be nearly impossible for judges to check their common sense at the door the supreme court went on to explain that he generic nature of a misrepresentation often will be important evidence of a lack of price impact particularly in cases proceeding under the maintenance theory slip op at 8 ultimately the issue was remanded for further consideration before the second circuit in her dissent on this issue justice sonia sotomayor found this particular question was improperly before the court believing not only that the second circuit had actually considered the generic nature of the statements at issue but also that the issue was not properly raised on appeal defendants carry the burden of persuasion in overcoming the fraud on the market presumption of reliance in finding that defendants bear the burden of persuasion to rebut the basic presumption of reliance slip op at 11 the 6 3 majority on this issue rejected goldman s argument that federal rule of evidence 301 applies to the basic presumption of reliance at class certification and pursuant to that rule defendants only carry a burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption but once that burden of production is satisfied the burden of persuasion goes back to plaintiffs according to the supreme court rule 301 in no way restricts the authority of a court to change the customary burdens of persuasion pursuant to a federal statute slip op at 10 quoting nlrb v transp mgmt corp 462 u s 393 404 n 7 1983 in this case the supreme court found that basic and its progeny had in fact changed the customary burdens and made clear that defendants may rebut the presumption only by show that the misrepresentation in fact did not lead to a distortion of price slip op at 10 quoting basic 485 u s at 248 emphasis in original or by showing that the particular misrepresentation at issue did not affect the stock s market price id quoting halliburton ii 573 u s at 279 emphasis in original critically in footnote 4 to the decision the majority addresses justice neil gorsuch s dissent joined by justices clarence thomas and samuel alito and recognizes that as a general rule presumptions shift only the burden of production slip op at 11 n 4 the footnote continues nonetheless that the majority read basic and haliburton ii as a clear departure from that general rule id although defense counsel may be somewhat disappointed by the supreme court s opinion ultimately the court cautioned that its holding is unlikely to make much difference on the ground slip op at 11 explaining that in most securities fraud class actions as in this one the plaintiffs and defendants submit competing expert evidence on price impact the district court s task is simply to assess all the evidence of price impact direct and indict and determine whether it is more likely than not that the alleged misrepresentations had a price impact the defendant s burden of persuasion will have bite only when the court finds the evidence in equipoise a situation that should rarely arise slip op at 12 citation omitted limitations to the supreme court s decision

a lab analysis commissioned by the new york times found no identifiable tuna dna in subway s tuna sandwich according to the newspaper in its own statement the fast food giant fired back at the report and said it was not a reliable way to test processed tuna a times reporter bought more than 60 inches of subway tuna sandwiches from three different locations in los angeles the reporter who ordered the sandwiches without vegetables cheese or dressing packed the tuna meat into ziploc bags and stuffed them in a styrofoam shipping cooler with ice packs to be tested the report said the newspaper said it paid about 500 for the lab to conduct a pcr test in order to see if subway s tuna included one of five different tuna species the food pcr test which stands for polymerase chain reaction quickly makes millions to billions of copies of a specific dna sample which scientists then amplify to a larger amount to study in detail after more than a month the lab returned the results and said it found that no amplifiable tuna dna was present in the sample and so we obtained no amplification products from the dna therefore we cannot identify the species the food testing lab which did not want to be named told the times a lab spokesperson offered further analysis to the newspaper saying there were two different conclusions from the test one it s so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out we couldn t make an identification or we got some and there s just nothing there that s tuna the lab spokesperson said experts also told the times that when tuna is cooked its dna becomes denatured which means that the tuna s characteristic properties can become destroyed and make it difficult or impossible to identify in a statement to fox television stations about the times report the company echoed this sentiment about the nature of dna testing a recent new york times report indicates that dna testing is an unreliable methodology for identifying processed tuna this report supports and reflects the position that subway has taken in relation to a meritless lawsuit filed in california and with respect to dna testing as a means to identify cooked proteins dna testing is simply not a reliable way to identify denatured proteins like subway s tuna which was cooked before it was tested a subway spokesperson said in part unfortunately various media outlets have confused the inability of dna testing to confirm a specific protein with a determination that the protein is not present the testing that the new york times report references does not show that there is not tuna in subway s tuna all it says is that the testing could not confirm tuna which is what one would expect from a dna test of denatured proteins the statement added it continued the fact is subway restaurants serve 100 wild caught cooked tuna which is mixed with mayonnaise and used in freshly made sandwiches wraps and salads that are served to and enjoyed by our guests the u s food and drug administration has a seafood list made up of acceptable market names for seafood that can be sold the times noted that the fda identifies 15 species of fish that can be labeled as tuna on its website subway says the global chain only sells skipjack and yellowfin tuna which the lab would have recognized as katsuwonus pelamis and thunnus albacares according to the times tuna is the only seafood sandwich that is on the subway restaurants menu worldwide subway says under its tuna and seafood sourcing statement we only sell skipjack and yellowfin tuna it is sourced from fisheries with non threatened stock levels furthermore we have a global ban on the sale of tuna species that come from anything less than healthy stocks for example albacore and tongol the new york times report comes as the fast food franchise which has more than 44 000 locations globally faces a class action lawsuit filed in january in california over its tuna sandwiches the plaintiffs alleged in an amended complaint on june 7 that subway misleads customers by labeling and advertising its tuna sandwich as 100 sustainably caught skipjack and or yellowfin tuna the complaint accuses subway of selling and continuing to sell some mixture that is deceptively and dishonestly being passed off as in line with their representations to purchasers but is not actually compliant in february inside edition commissioned its own subway tuna sandwich test after purchasing three sandwiches from locations in new york the outlet sent samples to a lab in florida that specializes in dna testing of fish which found that the substance was definitely tuna in response to the amended lawsuit against subway a company spokesperson also said the new claims remain untrue and have absolutely no merit subway would like to point out that after being presented with information about subway s tuna and the reliability of dna testing the plaintiffs in the california lawsuit abandoned their original claim that subway s tuna product does not contain tuna however rather than dismiss the claims altogether as they should have the plaintiffs lawyers filed an amended complaint that alleges our tuna product is now not 100 tuna and that it is not sustainably caught skipjack and yellowfin tuna just like the original claim the new claims are untrue and have absolutely no merit the subway spokesperson said in fact the amended complaint does not remedy any of the fundamental flaws in the plaintiffs case that should result in the case being dismissed the statement added subway s tuna sandwiches are also not the first product questioned by customers in 2014 subway made headlines for announcing the removal of the controversial chemical azodicarbonamide also found in yoga mats from its bread products this story was reported from cincinnati

central banks are getting itchy so stock markets are nervous but one expert reckons investors don t have much to worry about you re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fool s premium investing services become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more it looks like the free money party is nearing the end as the reserve bank of australia and other central banks consider winding down their covid 19 assistance the us federal reserve is starting to talk about talking about tapering or slowing its bond buying and fed officials are signalling the start of rate hikes in 2023 said amp capital chief economist dr shane oliver in australia the rba is also slowly heading towards the exit of easy money with 0 1 funding for banks ending this month and a speech by governor lowe dropping a reference to the conditions for a rate hike as being unlikely to be met until 2024 at the earliest but oliver writing on a amp ltd asx amp blog reckons stock investors have little to worry about the volatility seen the last few weeks may continue he said but that would be all standard cyclical behaviour shares are vulnerable to a correction they have run very hard and we are now in a seasonally weak period of the year so the rough patch could have further to go said oliver however we would see this as just normal gyrations for this stage in the cycle oliver presented 5 reasons why he thought shareholders are in the clear monetary policy is still ultra easy while money might not be quite as free as now it ll still remain pretty cheap tapering of bond purchases is not monetary tightening it s just slower easing said oliver while some emerging country central banks have raised rates rate hikes in the us and australia are still 18 months to 2 years away and the ecb and bank of japan are further behind oliver added that the current inflation spike was temporary anyway various commodity prices have rolled over eg us timber prices down nearly 50 he said us wages pressure will subside as enhanced unemployment benefits end and schools return sending workers back into the jobs market and it will be similar in australia when backpackers return good news is good news oliver reminded investors that the central banks hawkish shift simply reflected the positive recovery in economies around the world with monetary stimulus having done its job the need for emergency monetary settings is starting to recede he said the recent shift in tone from central banks is most unlikely to signal that they are backing away from their commitments to getting inflation sustainably back to target rather it reflects the reality that as recovery has been stronger than expected they will likely meet their objectives earlier than previously expected shares rose through the last taper the last prolonged period of stimulus tapering in the united states was from december 2013 to september and october 2014 according to oliver and stocks actually rose through it this is likely because tapering is a slowing in easing not actual tightening and rates were still low he said there is no reason to expect a different outcome through the next taper particularly given that the start of tapering is being well flagged maybe a short dip but shares will rise again history is on the side of share investors according to oliver even when the interest rate hikes arrive the experience of the last 30 years suggests an initial dip in share markets around the first rake hike but then the bull market resumes he presented 1994 2004 and 2015 as examples where rate rises depressed stock markets for a short while then it was back to gains again recession did not come for 7 years after the february 1994 first hike for 3 5 years after the june 2004 first hike and for 4 years after the december 2015 first hike and that was due to the pandemic said oliver this is because the first rate hike only takes monetary policy from very easy to a bit less easy and it s only when monetary policy becomes tight after numerous rate hikes that the economy gets hit this is all a long way off as even the first hike is a while away current times are consistent with the investment cycle even if you don t believe anything else that he said oliver reckons the current bumpy ride in markets perfectly fits into the narrative of the investment cycle right now we are likely in phase 2 of the investment cycle monetary support is likely starting to diminish albeit only slowly and we are now more dependent on earnings growth he said this shifting of the gears from the phase 1 valuation driven gains typically sees some slowing in average share market gains but the trend remains up and we are likely still a fair way away from the unambiguous overheating and exhaustion evident at the end of a cyclical bull market

during a recent discussion hosted virtually by mintz corporate attorney and former ceo benjamin stone invited professor christopher marquis of the cornell university sc johnson college of business to discuss his new book better business how the b corp movement is remaking capitalism and provide an overview of the emerging concepts and trends that are rapidly reshaping the social innovation landscape drawing upon professional experience and academic research stone and marquis brought clarity to the often dizzying array of new buzzwords that have surfaced in the social innovation space from b corps to impact investing to jedi marquis and stone addressed these crucial concepts from the perspective of companies investors consumers and working professionals market overview a changing world marquis and stone opened by analyzing events and trends from the past several years that have contributed to the recent sea change in the world of social innovation both marquis and stone remarked that the covid 19 pandemic has rapidly changed perceptions about the role of business in society laying bare the fragility of global supply chains that were originally designed for efficiency rather than durability stone and marquis noted as well that the brunt of physical in person labor throughout the pandemic has rested on individuals in precarious economic positions likewise the murder of george floyd in 2020 brought the business world s attention to the systemic nature of racism and discrimination causing businesses to re examine the impact of their work on broader society looking further back in history marquis and stone explained that events prior to 2020 also played a role in the movement toward great social responsibility for corporations for instance in august 2019 the business roundtable a trade group of ceos representing the 200 largest companies in america changed its definition of the purpose of a corporation acknowledging that corporations are responsible not only to their shareholders but also to other stakeholders including employees local communities and the environment the business roundtable s new definition of a corporation marks a dramatic shift from the theory promoted and popularized by economist milton friedman in the 1970s and 1980s which supposed that the sole responsibility of a corporation is to maximize shareholder profits social innovation from a company s perspective against this rapidly evolving backdrop a wide array of buzzwords and key terms has emerged to account for new understandings of a company s responsibilities to its various stakeholders stakeholder primacy according to stone this term underlies the entire social innovation movement whereas companies over the last several decades have operated under the model of shareholder primacy a model in which a company s singular goal is the maximization of shareholder profits many companies are beginning to recognize additional responsibilities to civil society employees fellow businesses and the environment christopher marquis noted that the shareholder primacy model has exacerbated climate change as well as income inequality since milton friedman s influential 1970 new york times magazine article that is credited with starting the shareholder primacy trend the average ceo to employee compensation ratio has risen dramatically from around 20 1 to around 350 1 in recent years crucially both stone and marquis advocated for the idea that stakeholder primacy is not to the detriment of shareholders rather both argued stakeholder primacy makes businesses more nimble more sustainable and ultimately more profitable notably in the last few years larry fink of blackrock one of the world s leading investors has written in his widely read annual letter to ceos that focusing on climate and placing purpose at the center of business leads to better returns social entrepreneurship and social innovation vs csr marquis noted that csr initiatives are typically projects that large companies take on in a philanthropic context that is separate from their core business functions for example employees at a bank might volunteer for a charity once a month as part of the bank s csr program on the other hand social innovation and social entrepreneurship refer to projects and initiatives at the core of a business mission that deliver social impact examples might include solar panel producers sustainable fashion companies and more public benefit corporations under delaware state law businesses can incorporate in the legal form of a public benefit corporation which is different from other legal forms such as c corporations and limited liability corporations llcs for two reasons 1 public benefit corporations maintain an avowed purpose beyond profit seeking and 2 public benefit corporations have a mechanism that ensures accountability and transparency as the company works to fulfill that purpose other jurisdictions including around 40 u s states and several other countries offer similar legal forms that are often simply called benefit corporations legally speaking the benefit corporation legal form gives a company s board of directors additional leeway to be nimble and long term focused in its thinking stone remarked that corporate forms are not mere legal documents they are also a communication device that creates alignment between interests and values and promotes fidelity to a company s mission for instance financial shareholders owning certain percentages of a company can sue the company for failing to fulfill its stated social purpose marquis referred to the period from july 2020 to june 2021 as the year of the benefit corporation in the public markets as many well known companies like coursera lemonade and veeva systems have either converted or incorporated to become benefit corporations during this time marquis and stone noted that benefit corporations have experienced remarkable levels of acceptance among investors in both private and public capital markets who hardly bat an eye as these relatively novel corporate forms grew in popularity this past year b corps unlike benefit corporations which are structured under a particular legal form b corps are companies that have received a particular certification from the non profit b lab b corp designation is analogous to organic or fair trade certifications but instead of certifying products the label b corp describes entire companies namely companies that have demonstrated through rigorous examination that they meet appropriate standards relating to workers rights corporate governance environmental impact and more critically if a company is incorporated in a state where benefit corporations exist as a legal form they must convert into a benefit corporation in order to receive b corp certification but companies incorporated in jurisdictions without such legal form may take on other legal forms esops marquis and stone listed several means for companies to grant employees a degree of ownership over their workplaces including co ops stock option plans and employee stock ownership plans esops not only do these tools help employees develop a personal stake in their companies performance but they also help to overcome many inequality issues that relate to corporate ownership structures traditionally marquis explained when a company does well the lion s share of gains go to the already rich while employees make about the same salaries as before under esops and other similar plans however employee wealth grows alongside company profits lessening inequality dei and jedi both stone and marquis agreed that diversity equity and inclusion dei programs also often called jedi programs to include the term justice play a tremendously important role in the social innovation landscape as marquis pointed out while discrimination is a key issue for policy and at the individual level it is also historically intertwined with businesses with examples including workplace discrimination and discrimination against customers of different backgrounds marquis and stone noted that esg assessments today often include sections on diversity in the workplace as it relates to gender race and other forms of identity and companies are frequently surprised by the discriminatory practices they uncover during these assessments investor side social innovation esg environmental social and governance esg typically describes investments by large publicly traded companies into causes that promote a healthy planet sound corporate management and the greater social good some companies factor esg into their investment decisions as a means to manage risk and improve management quality while other companies view esg as an end in itself marquis listed a handful of notable esg frameworks and assessments including the b impact assessment bia from b lab from the same group that certifies b corps gri global reporting initiative a 20 year old framework developed in the netherlands that is often cited in companies annual reports and sasb sustainable accounting standards board the set of metrics that blackrock ceo larry fink recommends impact investing while esg investing typically involves large publicly traded companies impact investing typically refers to private investment often by venture capital firms hedge funds and private equity firms however like esg investing impact investing similarly pays close attention to the downstream impacts that investment decisions can have on community stakeholders and the environment well known impact investing firms include bridges ventures in london triodos investment management in the netherlands and rsf social finance in san francisco consumer side impact socially conscious consumerism another trend that both stone and marquis flagged is the rise of social consciousness on the consumer side often known as socially conscious consumerism in recent years consumer surveys have found that customers particularly millennial customers express a strong interest in purchasing products that align with their values nevertheless marquis argued that other dimensions of social innovation are currently more advanced than consumption both because it can be difficult for consumers to discern whether companies are truly making products sustainably and because consumer survey results do not always translate into real life consumer behavior regardless of these roadblocks stone pointed out one promising trend is that socially conscious consumption appears not to be sector specific in other words consumers state preferences for value aligned products in all sectors ranging from consumer goods to artificial intelligence products to software and more careers in social innovation stone highlighted an article from the financial times explaining that companies have begun to view social innovation in part as a powerful tool to gain an edge in the war for talent especially as more and more young professionals seek out careers that advance their values and generate positive impacts on the world both marquis and stone advised young professionals seeking socially impactful careers to develop both their hard skills legal training financial skills and so forth and their understanding of social impact sectors as a means to round out their professional profiles and skillsets marquis and stone likewise noted that the social innovation space is rapidly expanding providing more and more opportunities for socially minded employees to feel truly proud of their work wrapping up future trends stone and marquis wrapped up the discussion by discussing their future projections for the social innovation space from a legal perspective stone is eager to observe how courts will begin to address some of the novel legal issues surrounding benefit corporations for instance how does a court determine whether a company is truly pursuing or living up to the interests of its various stakeholders marquis seconded that he will be watching how benefit corporations develop in the coming years and added that he will also be curious to track esg metrics and reporting trends the new chair of the securities and exchange commission has discussed requiring publicly traded corporations to provide more detailed disclosure of their esg impacts which will bring further transparency and public attention to corporate social innovation

washington london reuters wall street shares were mixed on wednesday with the nasdaq closing at a record high while other major u s indexes ended lower alongside european stocks as traders eyed the latest statements from federal reserve officials the market has whipsawed over the last week feeling the aftereffects of the fed s surprise projection last week for rate increases as soon as 2023 which knocked stocks boosted the dollar and led to the flattening of the u s bond yield curve the dollar ended higher reversing earlier losses on wednesday as two fed officials said that a period of high inflation in the united states could last longer than anticipated a day after fed chair jerome powell played down rising price pressures powell on tuesday reassured markets by saying the central bank will watch a broad set of job market data to assess the economic recovery from covid 19 rather than rush to raise rates on the basis of fear of inflation ten year treasury yields inched higher but remained below 1 5 in muted trading strong manufacturing data and a rally in tesla inc lifted the nasdaq which gained 0 13 percent the dow jones industrial average fell 0 21 percent and the s p

climbed to a record high in june supporting wall street shares in early trade but manufacturers are still struggling to secure raw materials and qualified workers substantially raising prices for both businesses and consumers sales of new u s single family homes fell to a one year low in may likely hindered by expensive raw materials such as lumber which are boosting the prices of newly built homes the biggest debate in the market is if inflation is transitory or permanent said jj kinahan chief market strategist with td ameritrade i would expect this pattern of trading without great conviction

that the euro zone economy is likely to recover to its pre pandemic level of gdp in q4 2021 while for britain it will be q1 2022 ubp s kazmi said that he is positioned for higher yields in europe as it overtakes the united states in terms of vaccinations lockdown easing and economic recovery from covid 19 it will be interesting to see if the german bund can follow the u s rate move with yields moving higher in europe it is something that we think could happen he said the fact that the fed has moved more hawkishly will allow the ecb to be more comfortable perhaps in moving more hawkish or less dovish over time germany s benchmark bund yield traded at 0 176 oil prices jumped to their highest in more than two years after an industry report on u s crude inventories reinforced views of a

warren buffett the legendary financier and berkshire hathaway chairman says he reached a crucial milestone he s officially given away half of his company shares to charitable causes on wednesday buffett earmarked a 4 1 billion distribution for five foundations bringing him closer to his 2006 pledge to give away all of his berkshire stock or 99 of his net worth at the time he has donated about 41 billion so far in a lengthy note published early wednesday morning he also said he was resigning from the bill melinda gates foundation noting that he has been an inactive trustee for years he did not provide a reason for his decision or mention the pending divorce of its namesake founders which has raised questions about the seattle based philanthropy s future but he said his philanthropic goals are 100 percent in sync with those of the foundation adding that his participation is in no way needed to achieve those goals for years i have been a trustee an inactive trustee at that of only one recipient of my funds the bill and melinda gates foundation bmg buffett wrote i am now resigning from that post just as i have done at all corporate boards other than berkshire s in his letter buffett said his late wife susan thompson buffett had wanted to donate more money when they were young but he that held off it was only after her death 15 years ago that he stepped on the accelerator as he put it over many decades i have accumulated an almost incomprehensible sum simply by doing what i love to do buffett wrote compound interest a long runway wonderful associates and our incredible country have simply worked their magic society has a use for my money i don t he said his remaining 238 624 class a shares are worth about 100 billion he encouraged other superwealthy people to give away the bulk of their fortunes writing the easiest deed in the world is to give away money that will never be of any real use to you or your family buffett s wealth and philanthropy play into a broader debate over wealth in america the biden administration wants to increase taxes on corporations as well as heirs to fund an expensive infrastructure plan and a 2011 obama administration proposal dubbed the buffett rule would have required millionaires and billionaires to pay the same tax rate as low income families and other working people buffett himself currently pays very little in taxes in large part because almost all of his wealth is tied up in berkshire hathaway a trove of leaked internal revenue service documents published by the investigative news organization propublica showed that buffett himself paid a true tax rate of 0 1 he addressed the issue indirectly in his letter wednesday i have relatively little income he wrote my wealth remains almost entirely deployed in tax paying businesses that i own through my berkshire stockholdings and berkshire regularly reinvests earnings to further grow its output employment and earnings buffett s philanthropic giving consists of 16 annual donations to five foundations which then distribute funds to various nonprofits according to public records reviewed by the trade publication inside philanthropy they include the bill melinda gates foundation three foundations run by his children and the susan thompson buffett foundation which was founded in 1964 and later renamed after his late wife the gates foundation is the largest recipient the eventual sources of buffett s giving is less understood with donations often made anonymously much of the susan thompson buffett s foundation s giving has gone to various efforts to protect abortion rights as well as women s health organizations such as planned parenthood according to inside philanthropy the smaller foundations run by buffett s family include the novo foundation which is focused on ending violence against women the howard g buffett foundation which contributes to environmental causes including food and water security and the education focused sherwood foundation
it is no surprise that the residential sector is high on most investors lists right now after spending much of the past 18 months inside we have never been more aware of the importance of our environment and this has made itself known in market activity the avison young uk cities recovery index shows that the strength of the national housing market recovery in the past nine months has exceeded expectations while house prices rose at their fastest pace in nearly seven years in may according to nationwide meanwhile a fund investing in flats is gearing up for a stock market float to capitalise on the housing boom the appeal of such a hot market is clear but to enter it without risking getting burned takes a more experienced pair of hands with a growing appetite for the sector both from established investors and new entrants to the market it is becoming more difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff like many we are considering opportunities in residential subsectors and cain s debt team has recently provided development loans to some interesting products in markets we had not previously explored however despite our confidence in this asset class and many of its subsectors this alone is not going to persuade us to underwrite a loan or an investment and it is crucial to get the fundamentals right through your choice of partner and location the crux of any good investment is the ability to look beyond the buzz and smoke screen of the latest trend and dial in on the fundamentals that will stand up to your requirements once the circus has left town the strength of a product in this space is in its relevance to the local demographic i am sure many will remember the initial fanfare that accompanied the acronyms of prs and btr into investors conversations a few years ago the reality is that the strength of a product in this space is not in the flashiness of its amenities but in its relevance to the local demographic to be blunt not every location has the market to support btr assets at the scale that is needed for an institutional investor this does not mean there is not an investment case for prs but that you can invest intelligently and lucratively in residential property without going down the popular headline grabbing route this is why as a then new firm we adopted a back to basics strategy a few years ago we focused on markets we knew well such as private sale residential and worked with partners we trusted in cities we believed in this approach has proved successful in the first six weeks of 2021 we completed over 74m 53 2m in sales at missoni baia and una residences two luxury towers being developed in miami with our partner oko group we always believed in miami s potential to be a leading gateway city but the pandemic fast tracked our prediction of business and wealth migration to the area ultimately we supplied the right product to the right market with the right partner equally we recently sold out the luxury penthouse and maisonette collection at islington square with most buyers coming from the local area and have had strong success in our residential investments in cee this is because we identified upcoming areas at an early stage and partnered with local operators who knew how to manage the ins and outs of that specific market my advice to anyone looking to enter the red hot residential market is clear make sure you like your asset and your partner on a rainy day as well daniel harris is head of european investments at cain international

the supreme court dealt shareholders a blow in a long standing case in which they claimed that fannie mae and freddie mac overpaid the treasury by roughly 124 billion what happened shares of two government sponsored entities got creamed today after the supreme court threw out part of a case that might have brought tens of billions of profits back to shareholders the stock of the federal national mortgage association fnma 1 91 or fannie mae fell more than 32 today while shares of the federal home loan mortgage corporation fmcc 2 72 or freddie mac fell nearly 37 preferred shares of freddie and fannie got hit even harder for no obvious reason as far as i can tell for instance shares of federal national mortgage association 7 625 noncumulative preferred shares fell 60 today so what fannie mae and freddie mac buy mortgage loans from banks and other lenders in order to provide liquidity to the mortgage market so those lenders have the money to keep making loans the two then package the mortgages they buy into securities and sell those mortgage backed securities to investors the big difference is that fannie buys its mortgages from larger commercial banks while freddie buys them from smaller banks during the great recession fannie and freddie took on too much exposure to sub prime mortgages and had very little in capital reserves to cover their exposure as the losses began to pile up the government concluded that it would have to step in to protect the liquidity of the mortgage market the treasury department agreed to provide up to 100 billion each in taxpayer funds for fannie and freddie in return for senior preferred stock the deal also meant putting the two companies under government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency fhfa which regulates the now government sponsored entities by 2012 fannie and freddie had drawn 187 billion from the treasury initially the two were supposed to make fixed interest payments back to the treasury but eventually that agreement was amended to have them simply hand over their profits above the capital reserves they needed back to the treasury and this is where the lawsuit comes in starting in 2013 the financial condition of freddie and fannie improved and the two began returning lots of money to the treasury between 2013 and 2016 fannie and freddie paid more than 200 billion back to the treasury and have paid 300 billion in total to the department shareholders claim this is 124 billion more than they would have owed under the initial fixed interest payments during those four years fannie and freddie shareholders claimed in their suit that the fhfa exceeded its statutory authority as the companies conservator by essentially agreeing to give all profits to the treasury shareholders also claimed that the structure of the fhfa is unconstitutional because it has a sole director whom the president can only remove for cause the supreme court dismissed shareholders first claim regarding statutory authority but did leave an opening for the second claim justice samuel alito wrote that the possibility that the unconstitutional restriction on the president s power to remove a director of the fhfa could have such an effect cannot be ruled out but perhaps another disappointment for shareholders is that the lawsuit now enables the white house to remove fhfa director mark calabria from his post which it did swiftly following the ruling from the supreme court calabria had been a proponent of quickly exiting fannie and freddie from conservatorship that likely would have benefited both of their stocks which haven t touched 5 per share since 2008 now what given the reaction of the market it seems like the ruling came as a bit of a shock the case is not completely finished and has been sent back to the lower courts where investors can still argue their second claim regarding the difficulty of removing the fhfa director by the president but elliot stein an analyst for bloomberg intelligence said the supreme court decision effectively means that shareholders can t recover the bulk of the overpayments they sought the removal of calabria is also likely not good for fannie and freddie shareholders either because it could make a full exit from conservatorship less likely or at least a lot slower at the beginning of the year the fhfa struck a deal with the treasury allowing the two entities to retain all their profits in order to meet new capital rules set by the fhfa but this could take awhile meanwhile fannie mae and freddie mac are still currently unable to raise private capital or issue shareholders a dividend while the treasury has preferred shares and while the two are under conservatorship two factors that are not appealing for investors
in april president biden introduced the 1 8 trillion american families plan to help grow the middle class expand benefits of economic growth and make the united states more competitive this plan includes changes that could affect some people in agriculture ruby ward is an agriculture entrepreneurship specialist with usu extension she joins me today to talk about how this plan would affect agriculture first tell us about some provisions that were proposed by this plan that affects agriculture ruby ward so this will get a little technical but it s hard to discuss this without knowing what some of the current tax provisions are in the american families plan several provisions were proposed it had stuff that would affect the estate tax currently you can transfer just over 11 million in an estate without paying any estate taxes so in the american families plan president biden proposed we decrease the estate amount to 1 million but they also changed another provision in there and treat it as if you sold it to your heirs you have to pay capital gains tax it s lowering the exemption and i won t get in too far in this but it s also increasing the tax rates that you would pass it on above that 1 million exemption they were thinking about doing a provision that allows passage of a farm estate to the heirs and they would defer the tax into the future as long as a family member continued to farm that land that s where we get into the complicated factors shalayne smith needham we ll let s talk about some of those complicated factors in having a deferment for family farms rw in the way that it was proposed we have some vague ideas so it s a family member but he didn t define what a family member was and in the irs tax code there s not any provision for a family member there is a provision for a related person and so there are unknowns as to what is a family member ssn while we re talking about complicated factors and having a deferment tell us who might be affected by these potential changes rw some of the biggest ones to be affected i think are our small business owners and our family farms if your estate holds a lot of various stocks then that s more divisible you can sell part of the stock fast and life can go on with a small business once they pass that estate on to the next generation a million dollars doesn t go very far when we start to talk about assets like a building it sounds like a lot of money but when you start to think about having intact businesses you can quickly get past that 1 million dollars ssn well this is quite a complex subject i m sure people would like to know where to find more can find information online rw educate yourself just look in american families plan estate taxes provisions and see what comes up

source the gender spectrum collection used with permission there s a quote from marie kondo s the life changing magic of tidying up that resonated with me when thinking about technology use and lgbtq teens the best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one s hand and ask does this spark joy if it does keep it if not dispose of it we live in an era with an unbalanced amount of research and media attention given to the negative online experiences of lgbtq youth last year i called this the tech dilemma and framed technology as a form of both increased risk and also supportive community building for lgbtq teens and yes cyberbullying and outing remain very real uniquely affecting mental health in horrific ways as elizabeth meyer highlighted in her 2018 post it s not getting better for lgbtq youth it s time to start focusing on how online spaces can be used to support affirmation and thriving in lgbtq young people this pride month as our country transitions out of the pandemic with collective optimism and hopefulness i am squarely focused on the promise technology holds as a medium of support for lgbtq teens many are passionately working directly with lgbtq youth on new digital innovations to spark joy so the current generation can have a more positive online experience than ever before digital spaces offer solace for many lgbtq teens research shows young people in the lgbtq community turned to online spaces while cut off from face to face contact with friends and family according to a 2021 national report from common sense media the california healthcare foundation and hopelab 52 of lgbtq youth said social media helps them feel better when they are depressed stressed or anxious in other words social media sparked joy in them a significant positive shift from 2018 when 36 of lgbtq youth said social media helped them feel better another recent study by fish and colleagues analyzed conversations from march and april 2020 on centerlink s q chat space a national online lgbtq space offering professionally facilitated text based support groups for lgbtq teens age 13 19 the study highlighted that lgbtq teens found solace in affirming online spaces during the pandemic lockdown and also pointed out some keys ways technology is sparking joy among lgbtq teens source cameron adobe stock images opportunities for connection community and representation as a clinical psychologist who focuses on adolescent mental health i ve heard first hand accounts of lgbtq youth s experiences with technology consistent with findings from fish et al their tech testimonials give me great purpose and hope finding connection and community research is mounting that lgbtq youth especially those who are transgender seek safe digital spaces to express and explore issues of sexuality and gender but have difficulty finding community within mainstream social networking platforms in addition to the text based support offered by q chat space other great spaces for young people to explore their identity before coming out to their families or school communities and get advice from others who ve been in their shoes include trevorspace

wrote in the washington post for queer youth to feel normal they need to see read and hear the voices of others who look like them and use the same identifying labels during the pandemic many teens turned to online resources for seeing others experiences that affirmed and supported their own identities luckily there are many affirming social media accounts for lgbtq teens to feel well

city council member brad lander the resounding pick of the progressive left wing democrats in new york city ended primary night well ahead of his rivals in the crowded race for new york city comptroller which received relatively little attention compared to the heated race for mayor with no rounds of ranked choice voting yet completed and as many as 207 000 absentee ballots to account for lander was 64 000 votes ahead of city council speaker corey johnson with 31 of the vote johnson trailed behind with 22 of the vote i m feeling great this morning lander told pat kiernan on ny1 wednesday morning this is a strong and significant lead but i m a big supporter of ranked choice voting and we have to see the tabulations johnson s campaign manager anthony perez said they were optimistic they would pick up additional support during ranked choice voting rounds to take place over the next few weeks it s impossible to know how this is going to play out perez said but we feel that our campaign is in a strong position we ve built a broad diverse coalition michelle caruso cabrera a financial reporter for cnbc came in third with 12 of the vote click for a larger version of the map johnson and lander were rival frontrunners vying for a position that not only has far reaching fiscal authority but also offers a visible launching pad for seeking higher office the city comptroller oversees a large staff that audits city departments and programs manages the massive public pension funds for city workers and reviews city contracts johnson repeatedly polled ahead of the pack since making a late entrance to the race in march johnson bowed out of running for mayor last fall citing mental health concerns the two council members have butted heads both in the council with lander opposing johnson s budget deal last summer citing a failure to reduce the nypd budget by 1 billion dollars and in recent debates

hey bill o reilly here welcome to the no spin news for wednesday june 23rd 2021 stand up for your country well joe biden the president of the united states kind of busy today with a major address about the rising violent crime situation in america president was about an hour late that shows no discipline it shows a bit of chaos because the biden administration cannot solve the violence problem in the united states what they re trying to do is make the voters think that joe biden understands the problem and will do something about it and both of those points are fallacious he doesn t understand the problem never really has and he s not going to do anything about it why because no president could violent crime is a local issue in your place where you live it s up to the people that you elect to control criminal behavior you can t do it from d c if you live in idaho or arizona or long island where i am you can t now i had an interesting conversation with president trump about this he was outraged about the murder rate in chicago and i said to him well why don t you do something about it and he said well i m going to send justice department people in u s attorneys in i said you know that s not going to solve the problem he didn t say anything he didn t reply to that and i said you really can t solve the problem because the governor and the mayor of chicago at the time rahm emanuel now lori lightfoot they don t want to solve the problem they don t like the police all right they think the police are racists and as long as those in charge think law enforcement is racist and law enforcement certainly knows that you re going to have a deteriorating crime problem that s the crux of this matter progressive america and joe biden is part of that cabal believe that law enforcement is racist and always has been therefore they want to destroy traditional law enforcement and build up or reimagine another way to protect the citizenry that s the problem so joe biden gets up there today well we re going to give billions of dollars from the covid fund transferred over federal aid is going to track down the gun dealers illegal gun dealers and we re going and we re going to and we re going to nothing will improve now the corrupt corporate media number one doesn t care about the problem and number two they re never going to go against biden they re never going to tell you what i just told you the essence of why the violent crime in america is ascending rapidly is that those in charge of new york city chicago san francisco baltimore los angeles st louis on and on and on and on think the police are racist and therefore that minority criminals shouldn t be punished shouldn t have to be bailed they should be allowed out without any bond on and on and on now the reaction to this from law enforcement has been blank you not blank me the american citizen or you the american citizen the blank you the progressive leadership so they ve disengaged and former police commissioner of new york ray kelly said that and he knows he says the cops in new york they re still good and they still want to protect the citizens but they re not going to take any chances there s not going to be a rapid response they know if they arrest looters people who are setting fires attacking them that nothing will happen as we saw this week the corrupt and incredibly incompetent district attorney of manhattan progressive cy vance dismissed the charges cops know that they know they re not going to be supported by mayor de blasio or governor cuomo this is just in new york and it s on steroids in san francisco and chicago lori lightfoot basically says if you re a police officer and you see a crime right you can t chase the criminal i mean come on all right so this is what the problem is joe biden is never in a million years going to address the problem because it s his crew that s doing it so he s going to go it s guns look i don t want to be supercilious word of the day here i don t want to be arrogant but joe biden has no blanking clue about how to solve any problem but one thing he did said is that he doesn t believe in defunding the police fine good i m glad you said that but if you look at the stats all right if you look and i have my notes here if you look at what s happening according to the global small arms report and they study this stuff there are 400 million approximately 400 million guns on the streets of america so no matter if you tomorrow waved a magic wand and said no more gun sales to anybody it would be unconstitutional but if you did that in a magic way there s still 400 million guns here and those guns some of them are going to be sold to criminals it s an industry and biden and all the atf and all the fbi are not going to stop it they might catch a few guys just like the dope thing they might catch a few guys it s not going to stop the dope trade they don t have the will to stop it so it s all a charade it s all a bunch of garbage nonsense it s boring to me i put forth a solution to this problem a long time ago you want to stop gun violence in america on all levels then you federalize all gun crimes that means if you are caught in the commission of a crime say you rob a 7 eleven you break into somebody s house you sell heroin you do whatever and you have a gun on you that s a mandatory five years first offense 10 years second offense in a federal penitentiary if the police find an illegal gun on you they hand you over to federal authorities like they re doing with the capitol insurrection now and the federal authorities prosecute you and if you are caught with an unlicensed firearm on your person two years max you have to serve two in a federal penitentiary now that would just destroy all the gangs all the drug gangs all the crazy people destroy them because the cops know who they are primarily take them right off the street that s how you solve the problem but in that mix would be minority people heavy minority people so that will never be done in this country so all of that stuff today with joe biden and that he s going to solve the violent crime problem is a bunch of hooey he s not going to do anything he doesn t even understand what the problem is meantime thousands of innocent people including children are being gunned down by drug gangs every single day because progressives have allowed it to happen that is the truth you are hearing it here on the no spin news you will hear it nowhere else in other news florida is going to pass already has i guess three laws about what can be taught in the classroom now this is all part of governor desantis effort to separate himself from most others in the republican party because i do believe the governor would like to be president it s a long road of course but he s way ahead on all issues that conservatives care about and one of them is the indoctrination from the left of the public school system so there are three laws here that the governor is going to or already has signed happening this week the first one is house bill 233 which would say that the state of florida would review all public school districts for quote intellectual freedom and diversity of thought which means that you couldn t have a school board principal or anybody like that punishing conservatives or liberals and that the state would review any kind of complaint that s number one number two hb5 says that all public schools would be required to include lessons on the evils of communism and totalitarian regimes i m not sure about that one the first one s good you should review any kind of complaint that comes in but to impose from tallahassee on all the schools well you got to teach about communism and the third reich i m not sure about that because i want the local school districts to come up with their own curriculums as long as they are fair and they are advancing the cause of education so i taught high school in florida as many of you know i don t think i want tallahassee telling me hey you got to spend two weeks on mao zedong i mean i knew enough to present history to my students so i m not sure i don t feel strongly about it one way or the other i understand why they re doing it because the socialists are running wild in that system and communism is terrible in my opinion the third one is sb1108 it requires high school students as well as state college and university students to take a civics literacy course as a requirement to graduate yes i like that in there now you might say hey o reilly you re being inconsistent you don t want to be told what to teach about a certain subject but you want a civics course yeah because the civics course is a general course and the others are very specific so another good job by governor desantis in florida in new jersey this is a very fascinating story so the randolph new jersey school district this is 60 miles north of the state capitol of trenton this is a rural district in new jersey so the pinheads that run the school district said we re not going to have any holiday names anymore because we re pinheads and that s what pinheads do we don t want to offend anybody so no more christmas no more thanksgiving no more anything it s just going to be called days off how stupid is this all right and that s what they did well the people 5 000 of them under one parent tom tatem launched a petition against the school board and they got it reversed because pinheads are usually cowards if you confront them with insanity as this obviously is in randolph new jersey they fold so now they re going back to naming the holidays that the kids have off as they should so this is happening now a lot of places the grass roots uprising of traditional americans now you may remember that we put a guy in the air richard salazar out of las vegas i believe who has started a speechmovement org speechmovement org and it basically fights cancel culture now richard is running to a lot of headwinds he says he got about 12 000 members but he can t get any media he was on this program we talked to him of course because we believe in freedom you know unlike the corporate media which doesn t so richard can t get booked on any place else because they re scared if they book richard then facebook will hurt them or something will happen i don t even know i can t get involved with it so i can t run richard s organization speechmovement org i can say i think it s a good thing as long as they re rational and present what they d like to do in a very clear way and i hope richard overcomes the resistance from the media and gets it out to the folks now there is another organization that advertises on billoreilly com and you may have heard about it it s parents defending education parents defending education defendinged org defendinged one word org and joining us now is the leader of that group nicole neily and she coming up from arlington virginia so nicole first of all what is the goal of your group sure so over the past year during lockdowns so many parents were so disenfranchised and demoralized about their schools not caring about them they didn t want their schools open and then suddenly when classrooms were in people s living rooms parents were horrified about what their children were actually learning what their assignments were their lectures and so parents started raising the alarm about this and i think after george floyd a lot of this kicked into overdrive we saw schools putting out statements flagellating themselves for being systemically racist and a lot of schools took that as an opportunity to really shove diversity equity and inclusion initiatives down families throats often under the cover of darkness or without a lot of buy in from the community and people are really justifiably upset so what we wanted to do with parents defending education was to let parents know first what are your rights you have different rights when you re at a private versus a public school but when you know what your rights are then you know when the lines have been crossed beyond that we want to tell people you re not alone there are people around the country who have picked up their pitchforks and torches and have said how dare you do this to my child with my tax dollars there are hundreds of parent groups across the country that have sprung up just in the past year specifically to deal with political indoctrination and then finally we want to give people tools to get engaged as dick armey used to say politics goes to he who shows up we have to get off facebook and get off twitter and get into those school board meetings run for office run for the pta send letters to the editor file lawsuits file freedom of information act request because local media has absolutely fallen down on the job of holding our schools accountable but we have to take back our schools so you have two urchins right six and seven years old they re just getting into the public school you have them in public school one of them private school we re actually homeschooling the other one this year but we re keeping an eye on schools near us all right so you obviously are going to have another 10 15 years of these kids going through a system that is under siege from the far left we don t see this on the far right do you see anything on the far right that s intruding on your kids ability to get a fair education do you see any anything there i have not seen anything coming from the right but i definitely we re seeing attacks from all over and this is coordinated and it s been laid for many many years yeah there s no doubt what s happening it s indoctrination and it s actually worked at the university level we have another story on that in a moment that s just amazing so it s defendinged org and you basically are setting yourself up as a central organization for people who are disenchanted with their local school system and you re going to direct them in how to combat this do i have that correct yes we want to give people the tools and the encouragement to get involved now just to the west of you in loudon county virginia there s a big big controversy about critical race theory which is essentially white people are bad i mean if you want to strip away all the b s that s what it is and there s a war there between traditional parents and left wing progressive parents are you following that and what s your assessment of it we are following it very closely it s absolutely fascinating to watch just the progression of how this has infiltrated their school and then to watch the school board gaslight parents say with a straight face we re not teaching critical race theory when there are actual copies of contracts that have been achieved or that have been obtained through public record requests showing critical race theory training going on and so the fact that parents have started to rise up and push back is now being painted as a right wing astroturf campaign of course now has the washington post reported on your group or done anything on you of course they have and of course were very very evil because we care about our children did they actually call you evil the washington post did they actually go after you not yet we have had the boston globe the columbus post dispatch kind of all the traditional papers and so you know it just shows they re not out there pounding the pavement doing the reporting we filed a freedom information act request in wellesley massachusetts and we found out that they have been filing they ve been separating students on the basis of race they have affinity groups where white children are not allowed to attend ahh well wellesley one of the most progressive yeah wellesley is one of the most progressive far left school districts in the country all right so this is the key to keeping american tradition intact the folks not me not biden not trump not any politician when the folks rise up and this is so wrong what s happening and i think everybody any fair minded person knows how wrong it is so i applaud you we re glad to be in business with you on billoreilly com i want you to keep me posted on any egregious school districts school districts like you just pointed out in wellsley which are lying to the folks and then doing stuff behind the scenes and people might not know about so if you do that we ll have you on as much as we can because i do believe in your cause i think this is the only way we re going to keep america safe so thank you nicole we appreciate you coming on today so here s a great story i was on hannity the radio program today and he s going down to the border with donald trump and the governor of texas abbott they re going to do a town hall next week as soon as that was announced the biden administration announced after after that announcement was made that trump is going to the border that kamala harris is now going on friday now this is unbelievable so that shows you how afraid the biden demonstration is of donald trump so trump s going to the border next week they ve got to get kamala down there before so i told hannity today on a radio and i hope you listen because all my radio appearances with glenn beck hannity bernie and sid on wabc mark simon on wor all my regular appearances we have them for you on billoreilly com and they re well worth listening to because it s a different situation rather than me driving the train they drive the train and i m answering their questions but i told hannity that this was actually a good thing because kamala harris has no problem solving ability at all she i think is even worse than biden neither of them have any problem solving ability and you know you just heard about the crime stuff they don t know how to do that as i said i don t want to be i don t want to overdo it but kamala harris going to the border going to el paso that sector what s that going to do it s going to make them look weak so that s a fascinating story the vice president on friday at the border a majority of people want tougher immigration policies this comes from the harris poll and the harvard people who run the harris poll now i guess 64 percent say president biden should issue stricter policies to reduce the flow of people across the border 36 percent say biden is doing a great job now 36 percent you know if you think joe biden is doing a great job at the border something the matter with you i m sorry i respect opposing points of view but sometimes you ve got to tell the truth if you know anyone or you yourself think that joe biden is doing a good job at the border something the matter with you i don t know what it is maybe it s ideological poisoning of the mind i don t know but 64 percent and that of course includes some democrats say hey we got to tighten up washington post i asked miss neily about the washington post because this newspaper which used to be the best newspaper in the world at one time is now totally compromised i think that s the best word so they have a podcast after the success of billoreilly com this really isn t a podcast this is more of a news program that s now syndicated worldwide by thefirst it s not really a podcast but people saw the success of this where we are far and away the most powerful independent news agency in the world i don t think there s anybody that comes close to us so now everybody s doing it so they have a podcast called the new normal cliche right away all right new normal part of that podcast they bring in radical left people all the time roll the tape i realized that i needed to go back and unpack and reorganize everything that i had learned because it was completely through a white lens most of us and doing this work have experienced this where there s a period of deep shame for being white and for acknowledging the harm that our ancestors have caused and that s a very legitimate piece of this work and we can t ask people of color to hold our hands through the shame and peace that needs to happen with other white people deep shame for being white that s a racist statement all right what if you said there s deep shame for being black or deep shame for being hispanic or native american or irish or italian or anything you re a racist then and you would be that would be correct but you can say through a lens of deep shame for being white so this woman hates herself that s her problem washington post champions this white i m sorry seattle nutville i mean which is worse seattle or portland tell me you guys living in the area which is worse portland oregon or seattle washington what is it with the northwest beautiful up there what is it with you guys so they have a pride parade but it s not just gay it s black pride it s all what they call marginal groups pride i have no problem with that but if you re white you re going to pay 50 bucks if you want to go to the parade or participate in it in any way it s called the reparations tax this is unbelievable so this is organized by trans women of color solidarity network and queer the land queer the land is i guess a group the parade or exposition takes place in jimi hendrix park in seattle and that might explain that they re all in a purple haze thank you all very much anyway this is clearly racist to charge white people money to attend an event that s free for everybody else but the seattle human rights commission says it s ok it s alright they can do it i wouldn t live in seattle i would rather live in thailand and i m not besmirching thailand but that s how extreme if somebody said to me o reilly you ve got to live in seattle i would say no and i like seattle i like ray s boathouse the restaurant i like going there ok i d go no i ll leave the country i ll live somewhere else rather than having to live in that city morgan stanley 68 000 employees huge huge financial company they say to their people hey after july 12th if you re not vaxxed and show us you re vaxxed you can t come into the office this is in new york but i think it s going to be country wide you quote lose building access but you can still work at home they re not going to fire you but believe me if you are marginalized like this your track at morgan stanley isn t going up so there you go i told you if you don t get vaccinated it s going to come back to bite you and we ll have more on that later in houston 153 workers at houston methodist hospital have either resign or been fired because they won t get the vaccine now in texas there is a law that says if you are on state property or a state run concern you can t do that but if you re private you can now here is my favorite story not only of the day but of the entire month so you got to stay with me here you re going to like this i hope brandeis university you heard of it it s in waltham massachusetts nine miles outside of boston now boston is kooksville one of the greatest cities in the country i ve lived in boston many years as you know i have a master s from boston university and a master s from harvard i worked at the abc affiliate and at the cbs affiliate all right so i have deep roots in boston my mother went to college there people think i m from southie and i m glad they

or administration he is a failed man his policies are failing americans and america i don t know that sounds a little heinous i don t respect president biden i think he is harming all of us i don t respect his stance on abortion but overall as a human being i don t think i d go that far i think he s a terrible president at least he has been for the first six months alan scott norfolk virginia as you know hunter biden had many issues with crack cocaine and other narcotics many people in our country are addicted you would think joe biden whose son is a victim would firmly oppose a massive amount of drugs coming over the southern border and take action no no he s not a proactive problem solver doesn t know what to do and i don t think he cares very much could be wrong about the latter gabriel caponera caponera sorry gabriel chicago i agree with you bill that if the economy tanks the democratic party will feel it at the midterms however if more states don t tighten up current election laws how will underachieving elected officials ever get voted out of office the massive fraud theory is not quite right so you saw the house of representatives in the last election go republican not all the way but most of the way if there was massive fraud that would not have happened so i believe that even though there are flawed places fulton county atlanta milwaukee

wyoming is more a result of demographics culture and socioeconomics rather than a result of high gun ownership levels it s all tied in i don t have time to do it now but it s all tied in culture is the big thing you nailed the culture part of it right crime in wyoming is unacceptable crime in san francisco is acceptable that s the difference allen bill the latest info i can find regarding the number of people being held without bail regarding the capitol breach is 53 does due process include bail once charges have been filed i m still waiting to hear if the capitol police officer that shot ashli babbitt is under investigation ok let me clear this up there s been about 500 indictments federal indictments against people who breached the capitol 50 of those people are being held without bail because they are considered a flight risk sounds legitimate to me as far as miss babbitt is concerned the officer who shot miss babbitt has been cleared of any wrongdoing because she was using force to break into the capitol i m sorry that the woman got shot and killed i am but the police officer did what he was supposed to do and to put his name out there would put him in severe jeopardy and his family marguerite gajewski cedar park texas i m loving killing the mob thoroughly enjoyed reading it six weeks at number one wow six weeks i m really humbled i guess is that the right word i m

was good reason to be afraid in the depression my parents were afraid they were kids during the depression and they were afraid and they carried that fear their whole life so now we are a very fearful country many of us are so afraid that we are irrational fear of covid even though it s over pretty much 40 percent of the people say they re still going to wear a mask according to a hill poll i don t believe that number but a lot of people still going to wear masks fear of vaccine people are afraid oh it s going to i m not going to get it they re afraid it s fear fear of ideology they hate people that disagree with them now i don t hate them i think they re dangerous now all right but i don t hate them and i don t fear them my arguments are stronger than theirs in every case but there s a fear of ideology finally fear of economic setback that s would plagued my father my father was almost paralyzed he never would take a chance he never would invest his money in anything other than a very safe low yield situation he was just afraid that he was going to lose all his money you know how many people have that fear so we are a nation that s afraid and i m telling you there are some ways that you should be afraid but if you re afraid to go in the ocean because a shark is going to eat you that s crazy if you re afraid to go out of the house because you think somebody is going to get you that s crazy unless you live in new york city and should be afraid so you know what i m talking about confront your fear overcome your fear you ll have a much happier life we ll see you tomorrow
posted wednesday june 23 2021 7 09 pm greenwood twp there may be no easy answers on how to get broadband internet service to greenwood township but there will be some options if the township decides to move forward the lack of decent internet service let alone high speed service is seen as a major issue facing the township in the future particularly as increasing numbers of residents and new arrivals seek to work from home the town board met with joe buttweiler from broadband provider ctc along with irrrb staffer whitney ridlon and rams director steve giorgi during a special meeting on june 15 ctc did some preliminary engineering work in the township last year and came up with some preliminary figures on the cost to bring broadband to all road access properties in the township total price tag 6 3 million you ve done the survey we ve done the preliminary engineering said buttweiler this is a common spot to hit a barrier the barrier of course is money how do we pay for it he asked buttweiler said if a private entity could have funded the project it would have already been completed these projects require either local funding or outside grant funding from state or federal sources but the awarding of rural digital opportunity funding rdof has put a monkey wrench into broadband project planning in the area with the possible awarding of a huge amount of federal money to a small internet company with no experience putting in fiber optic based systems let alone doing projects nationwide the problem is buttweiler said nobody believes they can do what they said they would do it costs too much currently the fcc is vetting the company ltd broadband but there is no timeline for the process and buttweiler said he did not expect a decision until a new fcc commissioner is installed ltd could possibly receive 312 million for projects throughout minnesota not just for this area while this is underway most other state or federal grant programs are unwilling to fund projects in the rdof area which includes huge areas of st louis county buttweiler said there are other options for bringing in broadband but they would involve a major investment from the township though that investment could be paid back by the provider over the course of several years ctc is a co op he said and doesn t have access to huge amounts of capital in other areas they have done arrangements where the local governmental unit comes up with the capital costs up front and then enters into a construction agreement with ctc who would then lease the fiber from the township including responsibility for maintenance and operational costs this agreement could include giving ctc the option to buy back the fiber network from the township once the costs are paid off by their annual lease payments we ve done this before he said another option would be to have ctc finance a smaller portion of the project up front possibly bringing in other partners and grant dollars along with funding from the township greenwood has applied for 110 000 in federal funding which isn t tied to rdof there is also funding available from the irrrb that could be accessed whitney ridlon who works on broadband issues for the irrr said they have 2 million for local matches for broadband projects but would probably only award up to 750 000 or up to 25 percent of a project s cost we want to be a partner and we want to help ridlon said steve giorgi who has been leading the regional effort through the rams group said they are also putting pressure on st louis county to use some of the federal rescue plan money for broadband grants currently giorgi said the county only seems interested in funding studies about broadband something he said has already been done and isn t needed giorgi also said there are investment groups that are looking to fund broadband projects at reasonable interest rates the township could also work with a company that sells government bonds and chairman mike ralston said he had already contacted someone from a duluth area firm that handles this type of bonding to see what options would be available for the township if they decide to move forward they would develop a plan and then reach out to financial institutions to develop a loan that could be paid back over 20 years the meeting was purely informational and no board action was taken how you can help greenwood residents are encouraged to complete a survey on the ctc website to indicate any interest in broadband internet service ctc also offers television and telephone service in bundled packages ctc is currently adding broadband service in cherry township rural hibbing and offering broadband speed service at approximately 60 month anyone with an address in greenwood township is asked to fill out the survey at the township s broadband committee is also looking for volunteers willing to go door to door in their neighborhoods to do an in person survey to volunteer or for more information contact sue drobac at sue drobac greenwoodtownshipmn com or barbara lofquist at barbara lofquist greenwoodtownshipmn com talk to your county commissioner about the importance of funding local broadband projects and to your state representative and senator about securing additional dollars for state broadband matching grant programs also talk to your state representative about changing the rules to allow utility poles to carry both electrical service and fiber optics current rules mandate a large space separation between the two meaning that new larger poles would need to be installed to use this method to bring fiber optic cable closer to homes about ctc ctc was formed in 1950 as a rural telephone cooperative today ctc continues to set the standard in telecommunications for the brainerd lakes area and beyond with new projects bringing service to many areas in northeastern minnesota including ely tower and the bois forte reservation as rural communities rely on higher speeds and more reliable internet services for communication entertainment and conducting business ctc remains committed to current and future demands as a cooperative ctc is owned by its members ctc currently serves some governmental customers in tower including the city of tower hoodoo point campground and the vermilion country school

they would like us to believe that what we can see happening right in front of our eyes is not actually real over the past year our politicians in washington have gone on the largest spending binge in u s history by a very wide margin and the federal reserve has created the most enormous financial bubble of all time by pumping trillions upon trillions of fresh dollars into the financial markets of course this was going to cause very painful inflation and prices are rising very aggressively all around us but federal reserve chair jerome powell and other leaders in washington are trying to convince us that even though they added all of this money to the system it has hardly affected the overall rate of inflation at all they are gaslighting us and it is absolutely infuriating if you are not familiar with the term gaslighting the following is how wikipedia defines it gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which a person or a group covertly sows seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or group making them question their own memory perception or judgement this is precisely what they are trying to do to all of us everyone can see that nightmarish inflation is already here but they are trying to manipulate us into thinking that it is not just look at home prices everyone needs a place to live and existing home prices have risen 23 6 percent over the past year the median existing home price rose 23 6 in may from a year earlier to 350 300 a record high nar said the annual price appreciation was the strongest in data going back to 1999 median sales prices have climbed sharply since rising above 300 000 for the first time last july at this point homes are absolutely flying off the market in fact the average time that a home stays on the market has hit a record low homes are selling quickly the typical home that sold in may spent 17 days on the market matching the record low reached in april nar said buyers with limited cash for down payments are struggling the most to compete half of existing home buyers in april who used mortgages put at least 20 down according to a nar survey but federal reserve chair jerome powell insists that everything is just fine and that the fed is perfectly capable of keeping inflation around 2 percent when congress spends trillions of dollars and the fed prints money something s got to give rep mark green r tenn said he asked mr powell whether the price increases seen in recent months are the start of something that could be as bad as the 70s when inflation reached double digits mr powell said such a scenario is very very unlikely in part because the central bank is strongly prepared to use its tools to keep us around 2 inflation what an insane thing to say how can you claim that you are going to keep us around 2 inflation when inflation is already out of control as john williams of shadowstats com has documented if honest numbers were being used the official rate of inflation would already be well into double digits of course for certain categories we are now seeing triple digit inflation for instance at one point in may the price of lumber was four times higher than it was at the same time last year the price of lumber which shot up to 1 600 per thousand board feet in may from 400 early last year is making renovations more expensive especially projects that involve kitchens cabinets hardwood floors and additions that require framing but powell just told congress that he is not troubled by any of this if you look behind the headline and look at the categories where these prices are really going up you ll see that it tends to be areas that are directly affected by the reopening mr powell said in a hearing before a house subcommittee that s something that we ll go through over a period it will then be over and it should not leave much of a mark on the ongoing inflation process these days powell is definitely starting to sound a lot like frank drebin we are supposed to believe that nothing out of the ordinary is happening but meanwhile the wholesale price of chicken wings has more than tripled the price of wings a year ago was as low as 98 cents per pound charlie morrison chairman and ceo of wingstop restaurants inc told cnn business today it s at 3 22 so it s a meaningful difference our leaders insist that this is perfectly normal nothing to see here please move along to me one of the craziest examples of inflation in our economy is what is happening to used car prices at this point some used vehicles are now selling for more than they sold for when they were brand new when it was new the window sticker price on a typical 2019 toyota tacoma sr double cab pickup was just under 29 000 two years later dealers are paying almost 1 000 more than that to buy the same vehicle even though it s used then they re selling it to consumers for more than 33 000 welcome to the wacky world of u s car and truck sales where the pandemic and a global shortage of computer chips have pushed prices to record levels i was absolutely floored when i first read that we have never seen anything happen like this before in all of u s history but fed officials are going to continue to tell you that everything is just fine in the months ahead even as economic conditions continue to go haywire all around us i warned that extremely painful inflation was coming in my last book and i will be warning about it again in the new book that i will soon be releasing our leaders consciously made the decision to flood the system with new money in a desperate attempt to save the economy and they should just be honest with us about the consequences of that decision but instead they are just going to keep trying to spin the truth for as long as they can unfortunately for them the clock is ticking and time is not on their side michael s new book entitled lost prophecies of the future of america is now available in paperback and for the kindle

gov greg abbott signed into law a bill last week that restricts how current events and america s history of racism can be taught in texas schools it s been commonly referred to as the critical race theory bill though the term critical race theory never appears in it but in signing the bill abbott said that more must be done to abolish critical race theory in texas and announced that he would ask the legislature to address the issue during a special session this summer meanwhile the debate has taken hold across the nation last year conservative activist christopher rufo began using the term critical race theory publicly to denounce anti racist education efforts since then conservative lawmakers commentators and parents have raised alarm that critical race theory is being used to teach children that they are racist and that the u s is a racist country with irredeemable roots u s sen ted cruz and others have called the theory racist itself for centering the nation s story on racial conflict in addition conservative commentator gerard baker has argued that critical race theory bans critical thought in favor of what resembles religious instruction those who study the discipline say that the attacks have nothing to do with critical race theory but instead are targeting any teachings that challenge and complicate dominant narratives about the country s history and identity they say that critical race theory itself actually shifts emphasis away from accusing individuals in history or in the classroom of being racist which tends to dominate liberal discussions of racism instead it offers tools for shifting public policy to create equity and freedom for all so what is critical race theory and why is it relevant to texans and why is there an effort against it in texas and around the nation critical race theory is a discipline analytical tool and approach that emerged in the 1970s and 80s scholars took up the ways racial inequity persisted even after a whole set of landmark civil rights laws and anti discrimination laws passed during the civil right movement daniel hosang professor of ethnicity race and migration and american studies at yale university said these scholars and writers are asking why is it that racial inequality endures and persists even decades after these laws have passed hosang said why is racism still enduring and how do we contribute to abolishing it hosang described critical race theory not as content or a set of beliefs but rather an approach that encourage us to move past the superficial explanations that are given about equality and suffering and to ask for new kinds of explanations in the introduction of critical race theory the key writings that formed the movement a seminal collection of the foundational essays of the movement edited by principal founders and scholars like kimberlé crenshaw and neil gotanda the editors write that critical race theory is about transforming social structures to create freedom for all and it s grounded in an ethical commitment to human liberation racial formation one key concept in critical race theory is racial formation developed by sociologists michael omi and howard winant the theory rejects the idea that race black white asian is a fixed category that has always meant the same thing instead it traces the way that race has been defined understood and constructed in different ways throughout history omi and winant define race as an unstable and decentered complex of social meanings constantly being transformed by political struggle for example they write that in the u s the racial category of black was created as slavery was established and evolved africans whose specific identity was ibo yoruba or fulani in africa were grouped into the category black as they were enslaved in america part of the meaning of being black in america was being less than human and therefore enslavable james baldwin wrote in on being white and other lies that europeans who moved to america became white through a process of denying the black presence and justifying the black subjugation omi and winant describe racial formation as the process by which social economic and political forces determine the content and importance of racial categories and by which they are in turn shaped by racial meanings a process that has continued throughout history monica martinez a history professor at the university of texas at austin who specializes in latinx history described how one way racial formation has played out in texas is in the racialization of mexicans and the history of anti mexican violence before this region became texas there were debates about the character of mexicans as a group of people she said figures like stephen f austin and john calhoun cast them as treacherous people thieves and murderers from 1910 to 1920 she explained hundreds of ethnic mexicans were victims of lynchings as well as violence at the hands of police and the texas rangers many of them were american citizens and they included labor organizers and journalists who were writing about race and injustice this amounted to an effort to remove mexicans from having economic or political or cultural influence she said oppression was enacted through violence and it was sanctioned by governors texas legislators and local courts she said oppression was furthered by juan crow segregation laws that racially segregated communities relegated mexican american children to poorly developed schools and intimidated mexicans from voting this system of laws and policies had lasting effects on mexican americans and how they re conceived of today rhetoric has played a role in racial formation as well continually loading the term mexican with racial meaning 100 years ago people talked about mexicans as bandits as thieves and as a threat she said today they talk about them as potential cartel members and gang members this language contributes to racial profiling and violence today in communities in south texas anybody who looks mexican or looks like an immigrant can be targeted not just with policing but also by hostility she said racism is structural the mainstream understanding is that racism is an individual prejudice and choice the default is to be free of bias and racism so racism is an exception from the norm it can be addressed by individual measures such as humiliating and punishing the person who messes up and enforcing moral codes on an individual level on the other hand critical race theory says that racism is inherent in our institutions and structures of governance it s ordinary and it s baked into all our consciousnesses in complex ways through our education government the media and our participation in systems racism must be addressed not just by punishing individuals but by shifting structures and policies hosang the yale professor explained that critical race theory isn t focused on the stock characters of a racist such as bull connor who directed police to use fire hoses on civil rights protesters in birmingham alabama hosang said that a focus on denouncing individuals is not a good use of our energy instead he said the question is even in places where civil rights and anti discrimination laws passed why do these forms of inequality persist so actually says no we shouldn t be preoccupied with trying to discern who is the racist here because that moves the attention away from the structures he said one example of this is in housing segregation how many many complex layers of policies around zoning lending and redlining around private realtors and developers have reproduced unequal access to housing which in turn furthers gaps in generational wealth and stability hosang said in his article for the austin american statesman dan zehr traces how this process has played out in austin which has one of the highest levels of income segregation in the nation in 1928 city plans created a negro district east of interstate 35 and denied public services and utilities to black people outside of it pushing black residents to the eastern part of the city when the government began offering loans to promote homeownership and help citizens rebuild wealth as part of the new deal after the great depression neighborhoods for people of color were excluded through a practice called redlining austin s negro district was the largest redlined zone in the city zehr writes as most americans gained equity in new homes or upgraded the value of their existing houses the black population saw a racial wedge driven deeper between anglo affluence and african american poverty he explains all these processes are systemic you can t explain through any one person s biases and prejudices hosang said experts and teachers put it plainly nobody in k 12 is teaching critical race theory andrew robinson an 8th grade u s history teacher at uplift luna preparatory in dallas said if i tried to walk in and teach critical race theory my kids would just have a blank stare on their face critical race theory is not being taught in schools martinez said keffrelyn brown a professor of cultural studies in education at ut austin and a teacher educator agreed a vast majority of teachers in k 12 schools don t know critical race theory she said they are not coming into the classroom and saying i m going to teach critical race theory hosang pointed out that to begin with critical race theory is not a body of content that can be taught given that abbott s calls to abolish critical race theory in texas make no sense those who study it said i don t think you can abolish a theory brown said while it has gained the ire of national republicans on fox news and elsewhere for months critical race theory was thrust in the political spotlight in texas this spring because of the progress of hb 3979 lawmakers claimed that it combats the theory the wording of the bill is vague for example it bans discussion of current events unless a teacher strive to explore those topics from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective and teacher s can t teach that with respect to their relationship to american values slavery and racism are anything other than deviations from betrayals of or failures to live up to the authentic founding principles of the united states which include liberty and equality in an early statement supporting the legislation lt gov dan patrick said that critical race theory is a woke philosoph that maintain that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex or that any individual by virtue of his or her race or sex is inherently racist sexist or oppressive the phrase critical race theory does not appear in the bill once however brown described the way the term critical race theory has been mobilized as a label that has nothing to do with critical race theory itself it has become the catch all phrase for any kind of perspective or any kind of framework or any kind of knowledge that shows the roots of racism and how deeply they are embedded in our society she said experts pointed out several key mischaracterizations of critical race theory political discourse has claimed that critical race theory unfairly assigns guilt and blame to individuals based on their race in one section that lists concepts teachers can t teach the bill prohibits teaching that an individual should feel discomfort guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual s race or sex has nothing to do with sentiment guilt or shame hosang said in fact one of its premises is that those are not actually helpful places to examine it s taking us out of racism as a psychological and emotional question and is focusing much more on the structures the policies that people create that govern our lives martinez said the worry comes out of false claims that when you teach histories of slavery or race or racism that you make some white students feel guilty or shame for being white to focus on directly instilling racial guilt would be taking a liberal individualistic approach that critical race theory actually critiques the bill also prohibits teaching that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex or that an individual by virtue of the individual s race or sex is inherently racist sexist or oppressive whether consciously or unconsciously if anything martinez said the current longstanding way of teaching texas history already teaches that one race is superior look at how it teaches the history of the texas revolution that people like stephen f austin are racially superior to the treacherous mexican like santa anna she said texas history has been taught in a way that celebrates people who were fighting for the institution of slavery that were espousing publicly that mexicans were an inferior race hosang agreed there s so much of the dominant curriculum that does just what the bills claim they re objecting to in terms of constructing a moral ideology he said one could argue the current curriculum promotes intolerance and animosity against indigenous people and that it does the same for immigrants brown the ut austin cultural studies professor described the new texas law as an effort to try to stop the momentum over the last year and a half of families and communities saying we need to know more about racism we need to understand so that we actually can get to a place where we are operating with justice with equity with fairness she said instead she said the bill may create enough confusion and possible concern that teachers or districts would just simply not talk about issues of race or racism for fear that it s going to create some conflict abbott s press office did not comment on what he additionally wants the legislature to do about critical race theory during this summer s special session but many teachers worry about the chilling effect that the new law will already have on their attempts to teach history well which includes nurturing students critical thinking skills by bringing in multiple perspectives on historical events and showing how the past has impacted present day issues what they re trying to say with this is that the actions of the past aren t affecting the present said robinson the 8th grade

article dozens of tule elk at point reyes national seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the last year because the animals couldn t get past a fence that the national park service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle according to a lawsuit filed tuesday against the federal government three california residents and the animal legal defense fund sued the park service in federal court in san francisco claiming it is being negligent and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought the national park service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals the idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn t just absurd it s undeniably inhumane said kate barnekow of harvard law school s animal law policy clinic who is representing the plaintiffs point reyes national seashore spokeswoman melanie gunn said she couldn t comment on pending litigation tule elk are a subspecies of elk native to california the 700 pound 318 kilogram animals which were hunted to near extinction in the 1800s were reintroduced to the park in 1978 according to the lawsuit 152 elk more than a third of the population have died since last year and necropsies obtained under the freedom of information act show that the emaciated elk died of starvation and or dehydration the park service announced earlier this month that it had installed three large troughs after many of the stock ponds and other water sources began drying up earlier than expected due to lack of rain but that water was only accessible to one of four herds at tomales point the lawsuit said gov gavin newsom last month declared a drought emergency for much of the state after an unusually dry winter and extraordinarily warm spring temperatures but while droughts are common in california this year s drought much hotter and drier than others evaporating water more quickly the fence was erected decades ago to prevent the elk from competing with the cattle that are permitted by the park service to graze on public land some of the biggest names in the bay area s organic meat and dairy industry lease land in point reyes including bill niman and nicolette hahn niman of bn ranch llc and david evans of marin sun farms plaintiff jack gescheidt an environmentalist and artist has been visiting tomales point in the point reyes national seashore for at least 20 years he said the park service cited him after he took troughs of water to the elk the knowledge that approximately a third of the tomales point herd of tule elk has already died from a lack of adequate water and forage is absolutely chilling he said i see these beautiful animals and want them to experience a healthy happy safe life but i know that so many of them will die through no fault of their own

life expectancy in the united states plunged by nearly two years between 2018 and 2020 with the covid 19 pandemic exacerbating a troubling trend dating back more than a decade according to new findings published june 23 in the british medical journal the study co authored by researchers at cu boulder virginia commonwealth university and the urban institute found the drop was even greater among racial minorities slipping 3 25 years among black americans and nearly four years among hispanics compared to 1 36 years among whites the overall u s decline was 8 5 times greater than that of the average decline among 16 other high income countries during the same period we were on a concerning trajectory relative to other countries for many years in terms of life expectancy but the declines were only marginal said co author ryan masters an assistant professor of sociology at cu boulder s institute for behavioral science along comes covid and the effect on the u s population has been just atrocious life expectancy by the numbers u s overall 79 75 for women 74 06 for men in 2020 81 04 for women 76 20 for men in 2010 u s non hispanic black populations 75 34 for women 67 73 for men in 2020 77 70 for women 71 51 for men in 2010 u s hispanic populations 81 38 for women 74 50 for men in 2020 84 26 for women 78 84 for men in 2010 peer countries 16 81 56 in 2020 80 54 in 2010 estimates for asian pacific islander and native american populations could not be calculated because of a lack of data masters said an obesogenic environment in which obesity heart disease and other cardiometabolic disorders are rampant was already leading the u s to lose ground with respect to health and survival inequities in access to health care and systemic racism have also played a role he said when the pandemic hit these existing factors on top of what the authors describe as a disorganized and disjointed response combined to create a perfect storm of lives lost our constitution delegates public health authority to states so we had 50 response plans said co author dr steven woolf director emeritus of vcu s center for society and health covid 19 exposed a lot of the systemic problems that have been fueling the long term decline in the health of americans shorter lives for americans the bmj study comes on the heels of a sweeping national academy of science report published in may documenting the suspected roots of a trend that began long before covid after years of increases in life expectancy in the united states those numbers flatlined in 2010 and declined slightly about 0 1 years each year from 2014 to 2017 marking the longest sustained decline since the influenza epidemic of 1918 masters one of 12 scholars tapped to contribute to the report said those declines resulted from two key trends an increase in mortality among middle aged and younger adults from drug and alcohol related deaths and suicide and more recently an increase in death in older adults from things like heart disease and diabetes people in the united states used to have an advantage over other countries when it came to surviving to old age that advantage is now gone and the gap is widening masters said to explore how the global pandemic influenced these trends the researchers used death data from the national center for health statistics to come up with age sex and race specific life expectancy in 2020 when they compared it to life expectancy from 2010 to 2018 in the united states and in 16 wealthy peer countries the results were stunning it s like nothing we have seen since world war ii said woolf noting that the u s hasn t seen such a drop in life expectancy since 1943 the declines among racial minorities particularly worry masters after years of enjoying higher life expectancy than white men hispanic men saw that advantage wiped out in 2020 life expectancy in the u s black male population in 2020 was 68 the lowest it has been since 1998 if this doesn t bring shock and alarm to how poor the u s is doing in terms of population health i don t know what will masters said younger people hit hard in addition to high rates of death among racial minorities the u s also saw an unusually high number of younger people die in 2020 with the majority of life expectancy lost among the male population due to deaths below age 65 this completely pushes back against the narrative that the pandemic is only affecting older populations he said while some other peer countries including italy and spain saw losses in life expectancy none were near the magnitude the u s saw and the bulk of deaths were among older people some countries including new zealand and norway saw life expectancy go up in 2020 masters notes the study did not look exclusively at deaths directly caused by covid a number that can be difficult to derive but rather all deaths that occurred in 2020 all cause mortality in the united states increased by 23 in 2020 to date more than 600 000 people have died of covid the most of any country in the world masters said some of the same social inequities and health vulnerabilities that have plagued the u s for years likely left the u s more vulnerable to covid for instance people with heart disease obesity or diabetes are more likely to be hospitalized or die from covid and lower income frontline workers are more likely to contract it as the virus slowly retreats in the united states mortality rates will likely decline but masters said he is not optimistic that life expectancy will rebound quickly unfortunately covid is not just a respiratory disease but also a vascular disease with potential ramifications for long term health he said he hopes the study will encourage policymakers to look big picture not only at what could have been done differently in 2020 to save lives but what must be changed long term this isn t just a covid problem he said there are broader social and economic policies that placed the united states at a disadvantage long before this pandemic the time to address them is long overdue
the inescapable need for online learning last year provided a boom for the education technology edtech sector that many expect to be long lasting globally 16 1 billion was invested in edtech startups last year up from 7 billion in 2019 according to holon iq there are now 26 edtech unicorns worldwide among them us based kajabi a business focused coaching platform which raised 550 million last year and china based zuoybang a softbank backed startup that offers schoolchildren online courses and live lessons which raised 1 6 billion in a series e round in the middle east and north africa mena region enthusiasm for edtech was correspondingly crystallising investors began to take notice with 30 million invested in mena s edtech startups in 2020 according to a report from global ventures up from 21 million in 2019 so far this year edtech startups in mena have attracted 14 7 million in venture capital across 12 startups as well as one exit that of lebanon born ostaz formerly known as synkers while this level of investment seems promising ticket sizes are still small in this sector with just three startups attracting cheques above 1 million now that schools and universities have reopened and amid surrounding fears of a market shrinkage edtech startups are aiming to personalise a pandemic led market to sustain its growth post lockdown localising software solutions developing integrable b2b models and branching out of school age academics and into adult oriented upskilling are leading the region s rising ecosystem back to school mohammed alashmawi co founder of the us headquartered learning management solution lms classera believes mena s edtech wave is just starting when you digitise you are not expecting things to go back to normal or back 10 years backwards just because schools reopen he says we will see a change in the industry schools and ministries will use digitised learning as mandatory and essential and not as a luxury feature launched in 2012 in both the us and saudi arabia classera quickly became a market leader in 2015 after its one nation initiative to virtually onboard saudi schools in the south impacted by the war in yemen the initiative created the largest fully virtual school in the middle east with around 100 000 students as alashmawi explains during the pandemic classera became the software of choice for both ministries and schools in 30 countries with its two hour onboarding tool with an emerging edtech market supported by both ministries and fund managers regional startup founders are betting on the population s accelerated tech adoption to pave the way for a growing movement but edtech startups are still confronting cultural perceptions around the credibility of online learning one of the challenges for edtech startups is changing the mindset of parents says hamdi tabbaa the co founder and ceo of jordan based edtech abwaab that raised a 5 1 million seed round last march parents want their children to learn the same way they were taught in person and with a one size fits all approach students of this age change behaviour fast yet for parents to understand the value of tech adaptive learning and ai it is a challenge and will take time to become mainstream he explains where parents do tend to feel comfortable is online tutoring a market worth billions worldwide that startups like the lebanon based peer to peer p2p platform algooru hope to capitalise on the tutoring industry in saudi is highly overpriced the average expenditure for a single household in saudi for tutoring is sar6 500 and annually it s around sar40 000 says khalid abu kassim founder and ceo of algooru which describes its platform as a one stop tutoring shop launched in 2017 algooru offers 230 subjects for lebanese and saudi users who can access more than 150 tutors it won last year s taqadam4 accelerator programme and is currently planning to expand into eight additional countries in the region backed by saudi angel investors in a pre seed round it plans to close soon the new s curve for mounira jamjoom co founder and ceo of saudi arabia based online professional development pd platform aanaab the edtech market is still taking shape as founders try to determine which business model could sustain a post pandemic world there are several approaches from freemium models to subscription or paying only for certificates the right monetisation model for the region is yet to be determined there s an era that just ended the s curve is done and we need to start a new one she says it s hard to monetise edtech and i think a lot of companies are looking at different models those who really understand what schooling and education will look like in the future will make the cut if you are able to nail that and get the right product market fit i think it s upwards from there for many startups an integration into the b2b sector a market projected to reach 20 9 trillion globally by 2027 presents a strong opportunity to situate their growth a lot are going b2c but a lot of the successful edtech companies are b2b if you look at coursera it s b2b says jamjoom referring to the us based professional development platform coursera which raised 130 million in a series f round last year bringing its total funding to 443 1 million the startup filed for an ipo in the new york stock exchange last march with a market capitalisation of 5 9 billion aanaab launched its new b2b model in january amid a plan for a pre series a round joining classera s mission to join the movement with its eight new b2b and b2c products these include an enterprise resource planning erp product to cover corporate hr and inventory services a fintech product called c pay to facilitate school tuition payments and student in school spending and a new b2b2c product called c spaces to allow schools start selling courses to students not officially enrolled with them says alashmawi who likens the product to the us based edtech udemy lifelong learning these regional startups operate within a global movement where worldwide emerging edtech unicorns are setting three defining features they provide life long upskilling platforms for adults they feature famous teachers and they are highly integrable as a b2b model the success behind the us based masterclass offering video courses by gordon ramsay alicia keys serena williams and other celebrities and athletes is an example of a potential rise of high quality celebrity taught exclusive content platforms masterclass raised 225 million in its series f last may from 18 us and global investors bringing its total funding to 461 4 million during the course of its nine years in operation with flexible and remote working gradually rising on a global scale adult focused upskilling and professional development services like those from masterclass present a reassuring market opportunity as the alternative credentials market grows life long learning and corporate training programmes are expected to make up 15 of the total education expenditure of 10 trillion in 2030 this is a segment that uae based almentor is targeting with its arabic video e learning platform the startup which raised 6 5 million from partech in may this year offers both a b2c and b2b solution for the one million registered users on its platform almentor offers courses for 20 30 with plans to introduce a subscription model to offer users access to all of its 12 000 video content for businesses almentor tailors its training videos for employees and has since 2016 worked with 78 different companies to offer these training courses while there is definitely a demand and need for more educational content in arabic for saudi arabia based test preparation app baleegh specificity to language is a challenge for edtechs in the region when we started exploring the market with baleegh we looked into the adult training and certification programmes but we knew the language would be an issue because we would be localising things like coding and computer programming to offer arabic content and it wouldn t make sense the users will eventually use english in their actual daily practice says rawan al matham co founder and ceo of saudi based test prep app and platform baleegh government particular to the edtech space is strong governmental participation that even at a global level and in thriving chinese and indian edtech markets heightens the competition for private led e learning startups government universities are also entering the space in saudi arabia as king abdullah university of science and technology kaust signs a new partnership with us based open source edtech edx to provide its first massive open online course mooc this leaves local edtechs prompted by the country s push for nationalisation in the education sector with a need to work alongside government entities for the time being as the first platform in saudi with accredited pd professional development hours the regulation for aanaab was a hurdle but if you are to innovate you need to work closely with regulatory bodies to make sure they understand your business model says jamjoom it s working in collaboration with governments that is behind our success there is however much to be done when it comes to edtech regulations as jamjoom points out everybody is learning but the sentiments among edtech founders tends to be positive the biggest challenge is already over which is to convince schools that digital education is something mandatory says alashmawi the pandemic happened to speed up digital education and now ministries educators and school owners will not risk it again and won t be cancelling their agreements with online learning platforms they know now that it is a mandatory thing to have digital learning

cautious sir ken morrison pictured in 2007 loathed debt and unnecessary expenditure sir ken morrison famously loathed debt and unnecessary expenditure so much so that he didn t bother redecorating the company headquarters for more than three decades for many years the supermarket supremo only expanded his empire on a store by store basis funded by profit as he sought to avoid borrowing money when he opened his first supermarket in 1961 a 70 000 loan taken out as a precaution was never even used so according to those who knew the yorkshireman from when he took over his father s business which had grown out of a stall on bradford s former rawson market he would have recoiled in horror at private equity s approach for the firm that bears his name and it s a bid that is likely to be fuelled by borrowing traders at the west yorkshire city s markets still remember ken as they referred to him who died in 2017 aged 85 john smith 74 who used to run a butcher s stall dating back to 1889 was in no doubt how the 5 5billion offer from private equity barons at clayton dubilier rice would be viewed if he was still alive i don t think he would agree to this he said they ll asset strip it they ll take out what they want i don t think it s a good idea smith said sir ken who took on the family grocery business in 1951 after his father retired though ill health was a familiar face around the market area historic morrisons expanded from the market place into its first store in 1958 the first supermarket opened in 1961 i remember when ken came across to us in the 1960s and said he was going to america to see how supermarkets operated when he came back that s when he started developing smith told how sir ken would take a close personal interest in his growing business which until 2016 retained a branch next to bradford s oastler market where many former rawson stalls moved to after its closure in the 1990s even turning up to stack the shelves he said he wasn t afraid of coming into his shops and stacking tins of beans and he knew everybody by name butcher david holland pictured believes sir ken would have opposed private equity s approac smith s son stuart 41 who runs the family s stall which trades under the name of its victorian founder john hutchinson said morrisons has gone from being run by a guy who owned it and cared about the business to a big board of directors and they don t have the same touch fellow butcher david holland 56 also believes sir ken would have opposed private equity s approach holland who runs his stall with his brother michael 58 said i don t think it would have been the kind of business he would have stood behind but other stallholders were more ambivalent with jon coyle 32 the fifth generation of the same family to run taplins butchers saying i think morrisons has already been taken over by corporate greed they ve grown too big and lost their relationship with communities morrisons as a business was something bradford was proud of but the wider growth of supermarkets has led to the decline of a lot of smaller traders and markets neil priestley 55 who runs his family s century old fishmongers said that while the supermarket s history was a source of pride for bradford morrisons is no longer a family business and imti mahmood 38 of solly s fruit vegetables said the takeover could be good for morrisons as long as it remembers the history of morrisons father of five sir ken who retired from running the supermarket in 2008 five years after buying safeway for 3 35billion to concentrate on his farm in the yorkshire dales was not entirely keen on decisions taken by his successors as chief executive at a 2014 board meeting he challenged then chief executive dalton philips about a plan to take on discount chains saying i have something like 1 000 bullocks but having listened to your presentation dalton you ve got a lot more bull t than me what he would have made of the 3 25billion debt the chain has built up since his departure is likely to be equally fruity members of his family did not wish to comment sir ken once declared if you don t need it don t spend it he was even known for looking in the bins behind stores to ensure too much stock wasn t being wasted saying what s the most important place i look when i go round a store the dustbin that s where all the grief ends up

washington as the biden administration grapples with soaring home prices and declining rates of minority homeownership the supreme court handed it a lifeline the ability to fire federal housing finance agency director mark calabria president biden exercised that newfound power wednesday the same day the high court ruled that the leadership structure of the agency was unconstitutional and that the president has the authority to fire the fhfa director at will shortly after 2 p m eastern calabria confirmed in an email to fhfa staff that biden had removed him calabria called his two years as director an honor of a lifetime and he praised the fhfa s response to the coronavirus pandemic saying the agency had provide some of the earliest financial support to borrowers and renters the biden administration will move forward to appoint a new fhfa director who reflects the administration s values a white house official said wednesday bloomberg the vacancy will enable the administration to install someone of its own choosing to regulate fannie mae and freddie mac calabria s successor will likely put his goals to free the government sponsored enterprises from conservatorship on ice late wednesday biden promoted sandra thompson the fhfa s deputy director of the division of housing and mission goals to acting director calabria has very distinct and different perspectives on housing policies than the people in this administration said jeffrey naimon a partner at buckley llp we have seen from the outset of the administration even back to the first week the administration was talking about housing issues as being central and in particular racial equity in housing a white house official on background confirmed on wednesday that the biden administration would move forward wednesday to replace the current director with an appointee who reflects the administration s values calabria a libertarian economist appointed by then president donald trump took the helm of the fhfa in april 2019 and made clear his goal from the start of putting the gses on a path out of conservatorship at one point predicting that fannie and freddie would be fully privatized by 2024 that milestone is likely now even further off said bose george an analyst with keefe bruyette woods fannie and freddie have been in government conservatorship since 2008 the supreme court ruling is going to have an impact both on what it means for gse reform which looks like it s now essentially on hold indefinitely and also broadly for the housing market he said although many within the mortgage industry were initially favorable of calabria s views toward conservatorship and his efforts to develop a plan to return fannie mae and freddie mac to private hands some of his initial supporters turned against him as time wore on frustrations emerged in particular over the last year said robert broeksmit president and ceo of the mortgage bankers association mba had well documented policy and procedural differences with director calabria and very much looks forward to working collaboratively underscore italics underline bold with president biden s appointee he said in particular calabria irked lenders and affordable housing advocates alike when his agency announced last august it would begin imposing an adverse market fee on most refinanced mortgages due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic that decision triggered an instant backlash so much so that the agency was forced to postpone the effective date of the fee calabria again came under fire after he and former treasury secretary steven mnuchin in the waning days of the trump administration agreed to reforms to the government s oversight of the gses that ultimately allowed the companies to retain more of their earnings but the changes to the so called preferred stock purchase agreements accompanied other restrictions on the gses which many argued would box out some borrowers and make financing more expensive particularly for families of color now with calabria out at the fhfa all of those policy changes could soon be revisted i think it opens up a lot of these issues that could get addressed again said george whomever the administration selects will likely prioritize affordable housing and access to homeownership instead of the safety and soundness of fannie and freddie said david dworkin president and ceo of the national housing conference i think part of the problem with mark calabria s leadership was that he was solving for 10 year old problems rather than the problems that we have right now and he had a singular focus on recapitalizing and getting out of conservatorship as fast as possible at the expense of everything else he said both dworkin and broeksmit said they were excited to see how a biden appointed fhfa director might approach affordability we have a lot of ideas there and a lot of initiatives on affordable housing that we look forward to working with fhfa on because fannie and freddie play a key role of course in the financing and we think that there s a lot more that we can do there said broeksmit with direct control over fhfa said naimon the biden administration can have enormous influence on housing writ large they re a very powerful policy tool that the white house can start to consider how it wants to use he said this story has been updated to include news that president biden has named an acting director at the fhfa

there aren t many canadian stocks to buy that are trading cheap today so i would be looking to buy these two top companies as soon as possible the market has been recovering exceptionally well over the last year with the tsx up roughly 30 over that time this has helped a lot of investors to see their portfolios grow rapidly unfortunately though it also means that there are not too many canadian stocks trading cheap that are worth a buy today so when you do find stocks trading undervalued as long as they are high quality i d be looking to take the deal as soon as possible the market continues to recover and although we aren t out of the woods yet we ve been making great progress on the vaccination front so with few companies left undervalued there s not much time left to find recovery stocks with significant upside with that in mind here are two of the cheapest canadian stocks to buy today a top canadian retail stock to buy today there s no question that retail companies have been impacted significantly by the pandemic although some of the best have fared well such as aritzia for example others haven t been so lucky the problem is stocks like aritzia have already recovered and are setting new highs there is one canadian stock similar to aritzia though offering a tonne of value and looking like one of the best stocks to buy now that s the iconic retailer roots tsx root the main reason roots is cheap is that it was in turnaround mode as the pandemic hit however the company is similar in many ways to aritzia in that it s a vertically integrated clothing company with tonnes of retail stores and a strong online presence for a company that was struggling before the pandemic it has fared pretty well that s not surprising given it has an extremely popular brand among canadian consumers so as retail restrictions are slowly being lifted roots looks like one of the cheapest canadian stocks there is and one i d be looking to buy soon a cheap restaurant stock for dividend investors another major industry that s been impacted in a lot of similar ways to retail is restaurants that s why i d be considering an investment in one of the top casual family restaurant chains in canada boston pizza royalties tsx bpf un the fund earns a royalty on all the sales from each restaurant across the country so as restaurants were shut down and relying on takeout and patios only sales understandably took a hit at each restaurant leading to lower royalty payments for investors however as we are now on the verge of reopening fully boston pizza could offer tremendous upside especially for dividend investors this is why it s one of the top canadian stocks to buy today currently its revenue would have to grow by 50 to reach its pre pandemic level that s a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity the fund pays a dividend that yields more than 5 4 today and it only pays out just 56 of what it did before the pandemic so if you buy the canadian stock today and sales were to recover to their pre pandemic level the stock could skyrocket and on top of the fact that your investment would be worth a whole lot more if the dividend went back to pre pandemic levels the yield on your initial investment would be more than 9 5 so if you re looking for a top canadian stock to buy boston pizza is one of the cheapest on the market
mark calabria was installed by former president trump as director of the federal housing finance agency the white house said wednesday that president biden will remove him from the position in one fell swoop the supreme court crushed fannie mae and freddie mac shareholders and gave president biden carte blanche to rewrite the rules for the nation s massive housing market left unanswered was the question that s befuddled washington for more than a decade will anyone ever figure out what to do with fannie and freddie which backstop 5 7 trillion in mortgages the high court s decision wednesday largely shot down investors claims that obama era regulators exceeded their authority when they decided to send nearly all of fannie and freddie s profits to the u s treasury a ruling that could save the federal government more than 100 billion the justices also made clear that the president can remove the head of the federal housing finance agency fannie and freddie s overseer advertisement within hours the white house said biden would oust fhfa director mark calabria a libertarian economist who was installed by former president trump and capitol hill democrats started demanding that the fhfa refocus fannie and freddie on making housing more affordable a top priority for progressives once the dust settled fannie and freddie shares had both plunged more than 32 the stocks biggest one day slide since february 2017 the bleeding was even worse for various share classes of preferred stock owned by major hedge funds triggering losses that in some cases exceeded 60 among firms probably hurt by the high court s decision were paulson co pershing square capital management and fairholme funds inc which have sought for years to get their hands on fannie and freddie s profits with a new fhfa appointee biden will in effect be able to control the standards and cost of loans backed by fannie and freddie which make up about half of the mortgage market calabria had moved to shrink fannie s and freddie s footprint but many housing analysts expect biden to use fannie and freddie to make loans cheaper and easier to get for minority groups and less well off borrowers who historically have found it more difficult to buy a home those decisions also affect lenders mortgage bond investors and issuers of privately backed mortgages that compete with fannie and freddie today s decision gives president biden the opportunity to make sure that we have an fhfa director who is committed to addressing the housing needs of renters and homeowners and to making our housing system work for everyone senate banking committee chairman sherrod brown d ohio said in a statement advertisement fannie and freddie are crucial to housing because they buy loans from lenders and package them into bonds while guaranteeing payment to investors if homeowners default the process keeps the mortgage market humming and ensures borrowing rates remain low fannie and freddie got into trouble when the housing market tanked in the run up to the great recession prompting the government to take them over and rescue them with 187 5 billion in taxpayer funds the firms have since become profitable again paying out billions of dollars in dividends to the treasury determining the future of companies including how they might function outside of u s control is the biggest policy decision remaining from the 2008 financial crisis the shareholders loss before the supreme court removes any pressure at least for now for biden to break from the status quo said jim vogel an analyst at fhn financial that means fannie and freddie could remain in federal conservatorship for the foreseeable future a situation that the trump administration tried and failed to bring to an end investors had hoped that a win at the supreme court would put pressure on biden to settle the cases and release the companies from government control the ruling appears to lay to rest many of the lingering questions and what ifs surrounding how long fannie and freddie could continue their status as a ward of the federal government vogel said the status quo can continue as long as the administration and congress would like fannie and freddie shareholders still have ongoing lawsuits in other cases proceeding under different legal theories that they plan to continue fighting the scotus decision does not address claims by shareholders for just compensation under the takings clause or for damages for breach of their shareholder contracts boies schiller flexner attorney hamish hume who represents investors in another case said in an email we continue to vigorously litigate those claims in lower courts and believe they will ultimately prevail advertisement biden hasn t nominated a replacement for calabria or named an acting successor the senate would need to confirm a permanent fhfa director but biden is expected to install a temporary appointee much sooner regardless of who takes over the regulator compass point research trading s isaac boltansky doesn t anticipate major changes to housing finance while our nation s mortgage finance system is a frankenstein s monster and it is far from perfect it continues to function well boltansky said in an email congress has neither the interest nor the capacity to fix something that is not broken
at pedestrian tv we independently choose and write about stuff we love and think you ll froth too we have affiliate partnerships so we might get a bit of money from any purchase you make based on our recs cool cool fyi prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting in news that has warmed this muggle s cold dead heart netflix has announced today that all eight harry potter movies are returning to the streaming service accio remote etc it s been an on again off again relationship between harry potter and netflix we all cheered like gryffindor did when harry caught the snitch in his mouth in harry potter and the philosopher s stone when netflix first got all eight harry potter movies in 2018 then we all sobbed like hagrid did when buckbeak lost his appeal in harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban in january 2020 when netflix rudely deleted all eight titles it s been a rollercoaster but we re on the up again people thoughts and feelings about the transphobic creator of harry potter aka she who must not be named aside you can t deny that these movies are good for the soul the sweet nostalgia of the theme music just fills me with warmth not unlike a tankard of butterbeer i ll stop with the harry potter references soon maybe advertisement whenever i m having a bad day and want to go to my happy place curling up on the couch and watching the harry potter movies is the answer the 17 glasses of wine are optional so thank you to netflix for bringing them back into my life once more as of july 15 2021 all eight of the harry potter movies will be on netflix here they all are in case you re a boob and have totally forgotten what the go is harry potter and the philosopher s stone in this movie a young kid named harry potter daniel radcliffe who is low key being neglected and abused by his uncle and aunt discovers that he s actually a wizard instead of living in an actual cupboard under the stairs he gets to go to the hogwarts school of witchcraft wizardry where he meets ron weasley rupert grint and hermione granger emma watson two people he will be third wheeling for the rest of his life oh and he also meets lord voldemort on the back of his teacher s head the bloke who killed his parents harry potter and the chamber of secrets as a teen i definitely developed a daddy issues crush on lucius malfoy jason isaacs thanks to this film he s the bad guy i know but he s daddy as fuck fight me i don t care thanks to netflix for making him very accessible to me now day or night advertisement anyway in this film things get a bit fucked up when a monster that casually lives in a school starts attacking children who aren t full blooded wizards or witches i ve always thought that the teachers weren t quite as panicked by this as they should have been but here we are read more a live action harry potter tv series is reportedly in the early stages of production harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban once again the teachers are far too chill that an escaped murderer keeps breaking into hogwarts with a knife apparently with a vendetta against harry potter this is the best book movie of the entire series once again you can fight me in a midnight duel if you disagree it has everything true crime sirius black gary oldman time travel and a fucking werewolf harry potter and the goblet of fire if you dislike robert pattinson and wish to watch him die then this is the netflix movie for you this is the point where the books and movies get really hectic and dark the only bit of fun is the triwizard tournament because everyone loves a bit of competition and also the yule ball which is the height of teen angst but everything goes very much south at the end of the tournament when lord voldemort ralph fiennes gets involved and it turns out one of the teachers has been held captive in a suitcase for the good part of a year harry potter and the order of the phoenix i absolutely hate the vibe in this movie basically even though he comes face to face with voldemort at the end of the last film barely anyone at hogwarts believes harry and all think he s a dickhead it s so unfair luckily professor dumbledore michael gambon has his back and brings back a secret society called the order of the phoenix to fight against voldemort and the death eaters but then he loses his job as headmaster and we get the worst headmistress ever dolores umbridge imelda staunton instead the kids create their own secret society called dumbledore s army which is pretty badass also there is a tragic death that occurs and i m still in therapy for it harry potter and the half blood prince the movies are getting darker and darker at this point voldemort is very much back on his bullshit here but the fun part is how hormonal the teens are getting harry starts dating his best friend s sister ginny weasley bonnie wright hermione gets a boner for ron but ron has a boner for another girl it s all so fraught meanwhile harry s nemesis draco malfoy tom felton who has been unhinged literally since he was 11 years old goes even further off the deep end as he starts working for voldemort culminating in another horrific death that i don t want to talk about thanks a lot netflix for making me live through it again advertisement harry potter and the deathly hallows part 1 so in the half blood prince harry hermione and ron were all finally like um why the fuck are we bothering with going to school when an evil overlord might just blow us all up anyway which is a really good point when you think about it so they all decide not to go back to hogwarts and instead they decide to find all the horcruxes which will help defeat voldemort however if you think that makes for exciting cinema think again this is the most boring movie of the lot and mainly features the three central characters being nervous in and around a tent for like three hours you still need to watch it because some important stuff happens but it s rather dull lucky it s netflix so you can scroll on your phone while you watch read more harry potter s katie leung said a publicist told her to deny copping racist shit from fans harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 finally the dramatic conclusion this movie raked in over 1 billion worldwide and i remember desperately needing a wee when the movie had about 30 min to go and i just held on risking certain uti so i could watch it all play out there s so many heroes in this story not just harry from severus snape alan rickman to molly weasley julie walters to of course neville longbottom matthew lewis you ll cry 1000 tears in this movie but it s so cathartic now once you ve worked your way through all the harry potter movies on netflix and re read all the books you can find a beautiful collector s set for 67 on amazon right here then i highly recommend listening to the audible audiobooks narrated by stephen fry such a treat for your earholes

yogendra yadav national president swaraj india are you sure professor saheb is our country ready for this every year i remember this story and ask myself this question on the anniversary of indira gandhi s emergency this story is not about the emergency it is about how the emergency first entered an official national textbook that too during the congress rule the year was 2007 prof krishna kumar an eminent thinker on education and then director of the national council of educational research and training ncert was leading a complete overhaul of school textbooks prof suhas palshikar and i were invited to lead the rewriting of political science textbooks for classes ix to xii those were heady days inspired by the idea of radical pedagogy we set out to change the content the format and the look and feel of the school textbooks of what used to be called civics we decided that high school students must not be treated as infants that textbooks in political science must not shy away from politics and that we must not brush inconvenient truth under the carpet we enjoyed amazing freedom thanks to the ecosystem set up by prof kumar this included the gentle scholar prof hari vasudevan who oversaw the social sciences textbooks and the broad minded national monitoring team headed by professors mrinal miri and gp deshpande all this was tested in the chapter on the emergency in the class xii textbook india since independence the inclusion of india since independence in the political science syllabi itself was no less than a coup earlier school textbooks stopped with india s independence students were supposed to understand politics in the 21st century without any idea of what happened in the second half of the 20th century everyone agreed with our suggestion that students who opt for political science in plus two must read a full course tracing the history of indian politics we invited prof ujjwal kumar singh to lead the team for this book so far so good the devil lay in the details the content of the proposed book controversy began as soon as the course was announced ncert puts gujarat riots in the textbook screamed media headlines even before a single word was written once we got down to writing the book we decided to handle political landmines with some ground rules we adopted a descriptive tone offered more than one viewpoint on every contentious matter and stuck to verifiable facts we used pictures and cartoons to say what we found impossible to say in words that s what we did in chapter 6 the crisis of democratic order the chapter that dealt with politics leading up to during and after the emergency we took extra precautions to verify everything but did not bury anything under the carpet so the chapter described everything that the then ruling congress party would not have wanted the coming generations to know and remember indira gandhi converting a personal crisis into a national crisis the cabinet being informed after the emergency was proclaimed the muzzling of media sanjay gandhi s role as an extra constitutional authority and the instances of emergency excesses the chapter had special boxes on the two notorious incidents of emergency excesses demolitions at the turkman gate in old delhi and the custodial death of p rajan in kerala some very sharp cartoons and images captured the culture of sycophancy and the spiral of silence that characterised the emergency now the challenge was to get this draft cleared through a sarkari system three eminent scholars ramachandra guha sunil khilnani and mahesh rangarajan had read an early draft of the book besides routine vetting and monitoring the ncert appointed a special committee to read the manuscript chapter 6 was read aloud word by word debated and approved everyone knew the real issue was not the truth of what the chapter said the issue was the political implications of speaking the truth about the emergency during the congress raj and that too in an official textbook at stake was not just this chapter or this textbook but the entire exercise of rewriting of textbooks not to mention prof kumar s job yet to his credit he never said a word to dissuade us when the draft was cleared by all committees he made a request do you mind if we show the draft to the minister before we send the book to the press we agreed after all the minister was to answer for what we wrote should the matter come to parliament the minister asked for a week to read the manuscript exactly a week later prof kumar asked prof yashpal and me to join him at shastri bhavan to see the minister of human resource development arjun singh i must confess i was a tad worried about his reputation as a wily politician a man of few words he came straight to the point maine padh lee mujhe kuchh khaas nahin kehena magar inhe kuchh poochhna tha i ve read it and don t have much to say but he has some questions this inhe turned out to be his private secretary an ias officer clearly his master s voice he opened the chapter on the emergency and began the interrogation sir they say the emergency was controversial instead of responding to him i turned to the minister sir in your long political career won t you rate the emergency as one of the controversial episodes i got a studied hmmm from him next question sir they cite shah commission which was boycotted by the congress party i offered a technical defence but you would agree sir that this is the only official document on the emergency that was placed in parliament and never rescinded this went on for about half an hour entirely focused on chapter 6 the minister feigning to be the referee between a bureaucrat and a professor just before my patience was to give way arjun singh waved at his ps to stop he turned to me and asked professor saheb apko lagta hai hamara desh iske liye taiyar hai i was ready with my stock response our democracy has matured reflecting back on this breakdown is an act of strengthening the system the students in 2 are about to cast their vote so they deserve to know and so on i could detect a smirk on the minister s face prof yashpal cut me short his speech as flamboyant as his hair sir ab in panchhiyon ko khule asmaan me udne dijiye let these birds fly in open sky the smirk turned into as broad a smile as you could get from a dour faced arjun singh the meeting ended the deal was clear we had done our job now the minister was to look after parliament and the party i don t know how but that is what he did not a word was changed in that chapter or the entire book the emergency made an unvarnished entry into the official school textbook and that too during the congress years cut to 2021 arjun singh is no more nor do we have in our midst professors yashpal hari vasudevan and gp deshpande the story sounds five decades old the ncert is preparing to scrap this and all other textbooks indeed rewrite the national curriculum framework as i turn the pages of the textbook i notice that its preface described the book as a tribute to the maturity of indian democracy i wince and recall arjun singh s question again my answer has faded washed away in the waves of

washington june 23 reuters u s treasury secretary janet yellen on wednesday warned congress that the united states risks a debt default and a new financial crisis as soon as the august recess if lawmakers fail to act quickly to suspend or raise the federal borrowing limit in testimony to a senate appropriations subcommittee yellen said defaulting on u s debt obligations would be unthinkable and would have absolutely catastrophic economic consequences yellen said that to avoid uncertainty for financial markets congress should pass new debt limit legislation allowing the treasury to continue borrowing before the latest suspension expires on july 31 an unprecedented default on u s government debt obligations would precipitate a financial crisis it would threaten the jobs and savings of americans at a time when we re still recovering from the covid pandemic yellen said i would plead with congress to simply protect the full faith and credit of the united states by acting to raise or suspend the debt limit as soon as possible the treasury in the past has been able to stave off potential default for several months by employing extraordinary cash flow management measures such as suspending contributions to government employee pension funds asked how long these measures could last to allow the government to continue borrowing yellen said it was difficult to estimate that because spending on covid 19 relief programs has added more uncertainty to treasury s payment flows we can t tolerate any chance of defaulting on the government debt and there is a lot of uncertainty it s possible that we could reach that point while congress is out in august and i would really urge prompt action on raising the limit or suspending it yellen said according to senate and house of representatives legislative calendars the august recess will run from aug 9 to sept 10 in the senate and july 30 to sept 19 in the house with committee work scheduled on several days in early september if the debt limit prevents treasury from new borrowing the government would have to rely only tax receipts to pay obligations eventually making it impossible to make some debt repayments seeking g20 endorsement yellen told the hearing on the treasury s fiscal 2022 budget proposal that biden administration is hoping to the g20 finance ministers endorsement for the core elements of its international corporate tax proposals at a meeting next month in venice including a global minimum corporate tax she said the treasury was working towards an agreement at the g20 meeting that is similar to the g7 wealthy democracies endorsement of the u s proposal for a 15 corporate minimum tax and a new method of local market taxation for the largest and most profitable multinational corporations her comments on the g20 meeting followed a reuters report on tuesday that a draft communique being circulated ahead of the july 9 10 gathering indicated the finance leaders would endorse a global minimum tax although it made no reference to a specific rate the biden administration is seeking a global minimum tax of at least 15 yellen also sparred with republican senators over inflation concerns sticking to her line that recent spikes in inflation data reflect transitory phenomena including supply bottlenecks in the economy she added that most measures of inflation expectations remained well anchored with those exceeding a year out are stable at around the federal reserve s 2 target reporting by david lawder and dan burns editing by marguerita choy and stephen coates

washington the u s could run out of room to keep paying the government s bills some time during congress s august recess unless lawmakers raise or suspend the federal borrowing limit before then treasury secretary janet yellen said wednesday congress in 2019 suspended the borrowing limit or debt ceiling through july 31 2021 after that the treasury department won t be able to raise additional cash through the sale of government securities and would need to deploy emergency measures to keep paying the government s obligations as it has in the past testifying before a senate panel yellen emphasized that the pandemic has created uncertainty around the size and timing of government payments making it difficult to estimate when the treasury might exhaust those measures biden will raise taxes on everybody in america sean duffy it s possible that we could reach that point while congress is out in august she said referring to lawmakers annual summer recess i would really urge prompt action on raising the limit or suspending it without congressional action to suspend or raise the limit after july 31 the government could begin to miss payments on its obligations triggering a default on government debt which yellen called unthinkable the federal government has been borrowing a lot of money to fight the pandemic but with national debt rising lawmakers disagree on how to deal with that debt and pay for priorities going forward wsj s gerald f seib explains photo illustration emma scott failing to increase the debt limit would have absolutely catastrophic economic consequences she said noting that the u s has never defaulted on its legal obligations i believe it would precipitate a financial crisis it would threaten the jobs and savings of americans at a time when we re still recovering from the covid pandemic the warning from yellen could put pressure on congress to act sooner than it has in the past to lift the borrowing limit lawmakers are scheduled to leave for their summer recess at the end of july and aren t scheduled to return to washington until september the treasury warned in may that cash conservation measures which typically last several months could be exhausted much sooner than in previous debt limit episodes yellen says inflation will be higher than biden administration estimated this year without an agreement in congress to raise or suspend the ceiling the treasury could miss payments to bondholders social security recipients or veterans such a full breach which has never occurred could have significant effects on financial markets in 2011 when republicans demanded policy changes in exchange for a higher debt limit stock prices fell amid the uncertainty and standard poor s downgraded the u s debt rating democrats had considered but ultimately chose not to include a debt ceiling increase in president biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package which was passed in march the decision means they will either have to include a debt limit increase in a second tax and spending package that is likely to pass along party lines or negotiate with republicans to have it added to another bill the treasury s ability to keep financing government operations will also depend on the pace of federal tax collection and spending which have been volatile during the pandemic rapid economic growth forecasts for this year could boost federal revenues more than expected providing the treasury with a bigger cash cushion an unforeseen shock such as a severe natural disaster could boost spending and shrink the cash buffer get fox business on the go by clicking here these are times where there is a lot of uncertainty around payment flows and the timing of payment flows said yellen who was appearing before a senate appropriations subcommittee to discuss the treasury budget we don t want to just look at what is the most likely time that we could make it to with extra measures we can t tolerate any chance of defaulting on the government s debt
