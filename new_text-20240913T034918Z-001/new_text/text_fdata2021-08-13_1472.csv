in this article we will be looking at 10 technology stocks that pay dividends to skip our detailed analysis of the technology sector and these stocks you can go directly to see the 5 technology stocks that pay dividends the year 2020 can hardly be considered to be anything like a normal year from rising climate change concerns and horrendous environmental disasters to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and the beginning of yet another economic recession in world history 2020 saw it all with such developments it is no surprise that the global economy and the stock market took major hits with stocks on wall street having fallen by about 2 in mid june 2021 oil prices falling by over 6 during the same time and the us treasury bond yields decreasing to five month lows by falling 12 2 basis points to roughly 1 2 according to reuters in the midst of all this however the technology sector and technology stocks like apple inc nasdaq aapl microsoft corporation nasdaq msft amazon com inc nasdaq amzn and intel corporation nasdaq intc among others have managed to weather the storm and retain investor confidence for instance cnbc has reported that despite the 900 point dow jones industrial average dropping this july investors with 1 million or more in brokerage accounts have been reported to be bullish on the market at large and particularly on technology stocks this claim was extrapolated from a survey conducted with wealthy stock traders as respondents it has also revealed that these investors prove to be more bullish come the third quarter of 2021 and were increasingly confident in the us economy s strength and growth providing them with the opportunity to bring in more profits through the technology sector investors with millions of dollars at their disposal began joining the bull market with their numbers rising by about 7 quarter over quarter from 58 to 65 according to the morgan stanley led survey and about 46 of these millionaire investors have forecasted a maximum gain from technology stocks of about 5 with this survey conducted by morgan stanley s e trade financial taking in the opinions of about 898 self directed investors and compiling the results from about 157 investors each with 1 million or more in the form of investable assets the outlook for investor sentiment on the technology sector continues to look overwhelmingly optimistic as for the industry on its own a deloitte report on 2021 outlook for the us technology sector has mentioned that the tech sector is headed for continued growth and recovery in 2021 while the sector will have to take into account three main issues referred to by the report as redoubling efforts for digital transformation reorienting and reskilling the workforce in the sector and reexamining the methods and locations of technology manufacturing it can be expected to live up to investor expectations for instance the report has mentioned that revenue from global public cloud service alone can be expected to hit the 308 5 billion mark in 2021 and as much as 354 6 billion in 2022 as demand for technology products and services increases and the tech sector itself goes through rapid transformations with changing trends in artificial intelligence and the growing need for cloud driven as a service offerings it is not unreasonable for more investors to be willing to bet their money on the industry while the technology sector continues to flourish the entire hedge fund industry is still feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape its reputation

north carolina s state government has a multi billion dollar surplus its enormity has multiple causes past spending discipline revenue growth from a resurgent economy and gobs of borrowed federal money its enormity also presents north carolina s conservative run legislature with a challenge how can a surplus be challenging ask anyone who s ever been a lawmaker when times are tough the decisions are tough but at least those lobbying you for budgetary goodies have realistically low expectations with billions of seemingly free money on the table those expectations soar into the stratosphere gov roy cooper and his democratic allies argue that now is the time for north carolina to invest in its people with dramatic spending increases on education health care social services and public payrolls republican lawmakers favor increases in operating spending too including raises for teachers and other public employees but they worry that a significant share of the surplus is transitory reflective not just of revenue officially labeled one time but also of economic activity goosed by massive federal borrowing republicans also tend to reject the idea that government spending is investment but private spending is not when businesses are allowed to keep more of their incomes they frequently invest in new tools locations technologies and infrastructure they hire and train employees or they pay higher dividends to shareholders who shift the proceeds into productive investments elsewhere similarly when households are allowed to keep more of their incomes they invest in new skills capital goods and the education of their children in our country the vast majority of investment is private not public it earns a big rate of return and not just for the individuals and institutions directly involved in it there is such a thing as public investment however and the north carolina general assembly is leaning heavily into it this year the just released house budgettransfers 5 8 billion of surplus revenue into the state capital and improvement fund while an earlier version from the senate put the figure at 4 3 billion both are gigantic sums adding in other construction and renovation spending including those financed with already approved federal debt the house budget would devote a staggering 9 billion to capital expenditures across all categories schools colleges universities water and sewer systems office building museums broadband and much more moreover congress and the biden administration are currently working on an infrastructure bill that would spend even more billions of capital dollars in north carolina and require even more federal borrowing of course a reality check is warranted yes some of the resulting capital projects are desperately needed and will pay economic and social returns for generations of north carolinians other projects are defensible to some extent and many are little more than pork barrel schemes to benefit special interests and politicians although this fiscal conservative has reservations about the magnitude and financial sustainability of what lawmakers in raleigh and washington are proposing i ll say this for the house budget it neither overlooks private investment nor abandons fiscal discipline it still reduces taxes on personal income corporate income and the capital stock of companies though not as much as the senate budget called for it places 2 8 billion of the surplus into state savings accounts though not the 5 billion the senate proposed and both chambers plans honor the informal cap on spending growth expected inflation plus expected population growth in general fund operations whether helpful or wasteful capital spending is at least largely nonrecurring that is while erecting new buildings or building new sewer lines will create some permanent spending obligations for operations and maintenance most of the expenditure is upfront when not if north carolina experiences another economic downturn pulling our revenues down and pushing spending up either the capital projects in question will be completed or they can be deferred without undue hardship on taxpayers and public employees public investment is a real thing but it isn t a perpetual motion machine i hope our leaders keep that in mind john hood is a carolina journal columnist and author of the new novel mountain folk a historical fantasy set during the american revolution
elizabeth warren is a democratic senator from massachusetts now that the senate has passed a budget resolution we re one step closer to realizing president biden s transformational agenda a once in a generation investment in child care and medicare combating climate change and other efforts that would actually make our government work for families the other half of the package how to pay for these investments is equally important the already huge gap between the 0 1 percent and everyone else is just getting wider billionaire wealth surged by 1 8 trillion from the early days of the pandemic through last month the 400 richest americans had more total wealth as of 2019 than all 10 million black american households plus a quarter of latino households combined yet the ultrarich pay only 3 2 percent of that wealth in taxes while 99 percent of families pay 7 2 percent and scores of giant u s corporations pay zero advertisement i ve proposed measures that would raise more than 5 trillion in revenue far more than we need to enact the biden plan though not every democrat agrees with every one of my ideas biden campaigned aggressively on a suite of progressive tax policies and voters embraced these changes at the ballot box no matter how loudly washington lobbyists bleat otherwise progressive tax policies are wildly popular americans understand that our tax system has been rigged to reward the rich and powerful at the expense of everyone else so let s fix it first it s time to start taxing wealth not just income when jeff bezos takes a joyride to space he isn t paying for it with his declared income of 80 000 bezos who owns the post and lots of other billionaires have gamed the system so they have plenty of spending money and close to zero tax obligations the best option to stop that is a two cent wealth tax that applies only to the wealthiest 100 000 u s households with a few cents more for the billionaires such a wealth tax would raise roughly 3 trillion in revenue over the next decade without raising taxes on 99 95 percent of americans it s supported by 68 percent of the country including a majority of republicans and there are lots of ways to advance this principle including a one time wealth tax that would raise over 1 trillion share this article share second let s turn to highly profitable giant corporations in the three years following the 2017 republican tax cuts 39 megacorporations including amazon and fedex reported more than 122 billion in profits to their shareholders while using loopholes deductions and exemptions to pay zero in federal income taxes advertisement these companies boosted their stock prices and increased ceo pay by telling their shareholders they raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in profits while simultaneously telling the internal revenue service that they don t owe any taxes the president supports taxing the profits that large companies report to their shareholders sen angus king i maine and i have a plan that mirrors his we would require any company that earns more than 100 million in profits to pay a 7 percent tax on every dollar earned above that amount only about 1 300 public companies would pay the tax raising nearly 700 billion over 10 years finally rules don t mean anything if nobody enforces them so let s enforce the law currently the top 1 percent of americans fail to report more than a fifth of their income the difference between taxes owed and taxes actually paid exceeds an estimated 1 trillion annually the superrich get away with not paying their taxes because decades of politically motivated budget cuts have hollowed out the irs since 2010 the agency s enforcement budget has declined by more than 20 percent and it has lost one third of its enforcers it s no surprise that audit rates for taxpayers making more than 10 million have plummeted this should enrage every american who plays by the rules that s why over 70 percent of americans support giving the irs more resources to make sure the wealthy and corporations aren t evading taxes advertisement biden has proposed giving the irs about 8 billion in additional annual funding i ve suggested a step further 31 5 billion in permanent annual funding to track down wealthy and corporate tax cheats the irs also needs better reporting from banks and other financial institutions so it can sniff out the hidden cash of the ultrarich these changes could raise as much as 1 75 trillion from tax cheats

for deborah breen creating her own underwear brand hadn t just been any old way to make money she had put her heart and soul into every element of her business wilde mode from the font used for her company logo which was a homage to her late grandfather s signature to the prints she designed to adorn her bra and pants sets so to say she was furious when she discovered a blue leopard print lingerie set she had designed on a chinese shopping website is an understatement however while fashion copycats abound in the dodgier corners of the internet this was no random knock off fashion website one might struggle to come across rather deborah found her designs in the hands of a company who are the undoubted emperors of fast fashion forget boohoo or even primark this company is shein pronounced she in whose recorded revenue in 2020 was an astronomical 7 billion sarah vaughan from lancashire who started her fabric business little legs fabrics in 2018 was stunned when she discovered one of the designs she had exclusively purchased and printed on to a high quality cotton based fabric was being sold as a child s set of dungarees on shein last year shein which ships to 220 countries has had a pandemic busting year that in june led to it toppling amazon as the most downloaded shopping app on ios and android in the u s and it s snapping at amazon s heels in the uk too how collaborations with british influencers and reality tv stars such as love island s lucie donlan and made in chelsea s georgia toffolo have turbocharged its dominance helping it rack up more than 21 million instagram followers so while you may not have heard of it any teenager or 20 something in your family certainly will have attracted by their pile it high sell it cheap philosophy want a new swimsuit shein has them priced from 2 49 and of the dozens of dresses on the first page of results on the uk store yesterday none was priced above 15 as for deborah s design it was on sale for just 6 that s quite a bit less than the 38 a top and 18 for bottoms charged for the same swimwear set designed made and sold by her i couldn t believe it when i looked says deborah a 41 year old mother of two it was the first time i d even heard of the site while fashion copycats abound in the dodgier corners of the internet this was no random knock off fashion website one might struggle to come across and as she saw the font she had modelled on her grandfather s handwriting was now declared shein curve while the material looked saggy and poor quality it is estimated that shein places anything from 500 to more than 1 000 new items on its online shopfront every day but how does the company which shot to prominence as a shock contender to buy topshop before asos struck a deal churn out stock at such an alarming rate therein lies one of many worrying questions that have been raised about the way this brand operates for as the mail discovered this week an ever growing number of independent designers and businesses have found their own designs work into which they have poured time effort and money have been copied finding their way on to shein s website it was in june 2020 that deborah breen began to receive messages from her global client base sharing images of a two piece underwear set they had seen on shein she soon realised she wasn t alone i shared what had happened on instagram and soon other people started contacting me saying they did it to me too they get away with it as often the people behind small brands don t have the knowledge or the finances to do anything about it however deborah who knew enough about intellectual property rights to know shein was in the wrong was established enough as a business to have a solicitor last month nigerian brand elexiay posted on social media accusing shein of copying its hand crocheted 237 pink and green jumper sharing an image of it left next to a remarkably similar design sold on shein for 13 right as soon as shein were approached they tried to claim they had no idea the design had been copied she says they said they employ people to find them the designs and tried to distance themselves from it but for deborah who is based in dundee the fact shein has acknowledged copyright issues speaks volumes about the scale of the issue they state on their website if you believe your work has been copied in a way that constitutes trademark or copyright infringement please submit your complaint by report to copyright shein com we will respond to the rights of owners with any concerns they may have about alleged ip disputes we found evidence of brands being copied in every corner of the globe including australian label salte designs and u s brand sincerely ria last month nigerian brand elexiay posted on social media accusing shein of copying its hand crocheted 237 pink and green jumper sharing an image of it next to a remarkably similar design sold on shein for 13 it since appears to have been taken down from shein s website in deborah s case shein did remove the item from its website but deborah who has european and uk trademarks wanted recompense they said they had only sold six sets she laughs they offered me 100 which as a small business is a punch in the eye she fought back and shein eventually settled for a four figure sum which given deborah had solicitor s fees to pay was paltry but as she says it s the principle my intellectual property my design you can t just use it they are nothing more than vultures taking designs off independent traders and selling them at a fraction of the cost as a businesswoman deborah who started sewing as a hobby to help with her depression prides herself not just on a business that promotes inclusivity but also on quality and sustainability no mass production no picking off a shelf less excess waste as she puts it she employs five people whom she pays a living wage we have an incredibly small profit margin because of how expensive it is as a small brand buying in small volumes can shein say the same one doubts it in july fashion revolution a global campaign to promote more transparent and sustainable fashion published its sixth fashion transparency index analysing and ranking 250 of the world s largest fashion brands and retailers based on their public disclosure of human rights and environmental policies practices and impacts in their operations and supply chains shein scored an average of just one per cent as for quality sarah vaughan 36 can attest to the differences between shein s product and her own sarah a mother of two from lancashire who started her fabric business little legs fabrics in 2018 was stunned when she discovered one of the designs she had exclusively purchased and printed on to a high quality cotton based fabric was being sold as a child s set of dungarees on shein last year she was alerted by a customer on social media there could be no doubt it was a copy because the dinosaur print is one of sarah s most popular and it looked identical i d heard of it happening but when it happens to you you feel violated says sarah but i felt worse for my customers my business is based on work at home mums trying to make a living by making clothing they are the ones who suffer if somebody can go on shein and buy an outfit for 5 which they are making at home for 20 sarah did two things she ordered shein s garment and emailed their copyright team when it arrived she discovered that while her clothing is a soft 95 per cent cotton 5 per cent elastane blend made at the factory of a trusted supplier in poland using carefully tested fabric dyes shein s offering was the polar opposite low quality polyester but emblazoned with the same design as for the email it was only when she shared her fury via social media it isn t even a replica it s a clear steal of the design she wrote that shein responded we sincerely apologise for what happened the product has already been removed from our site shein holds every designer s copyright should be respected said the brand ironically a section of shein s website is dedicated to product design in the early days before our designs became popular we arranged for our designers to further their study of fashion design and invited senior designers to help us build our brand it declares now over a decade later we have established a huge team of professional designers every one of our designers has his or her own unique sense of fashion independent designer jade clark certainly prides herself on her unique sense of fashion and so it seems does shein around this time last year jade 30 discovered one of her t shirts was being sold by shein a flame adorned design made distinctive by her name on the sleeve for jade who had already gone into battle with the retailer over a swimsuit she designed it wasn t surprising but still demoralising the name on the sleeve was just blatant she says it s horrible because it had happened to me before the first time was more soul destroying jade who set up her eponymous business six years ago and works alone doing her own design fabric printing production and marketing had a straightforward approach to tackling the copycatting she recruited her huge social media following to go in to bat for her the result i never contacted them directly but within six hours it was taken down a small victory but one free of penalty for shein in 2018 u s jeans brand levi strauss accused shein of copying a stitch pattern in the back pockets of trademarked levi s jeans in a suit that was later settled companies and designers including airwair international the maker of dr martens boots have taken legal action against shein for allegedly copying designs and infringing trademarks but when recompense is small or starting a fight prohibitively expensive it s unsurprising so many don t act little wonder then that copied designs keep appearing how these copies find themselves on shein s marketplace and who is responsible is unclear a juggernaut like zara on steroids as one blogger put it shein seems to be motoring its way to ultra fast fashion supremacy with little known about the company mainly based in china singapore and hong kong the company was founded in 2008 by chris xu also known as yangtian xu or sky xu who is apparently an american born graduate of washington university with no interviews on public record he remains as much of a mystery as his brand s workings back then it was called sheinside and sold only women s clothing but in 2015 he renamed the company shein and focused on overseas markets as for its supply chain that s anyone s guess but we know shein s popularity stems from its use of data analytics to turn emerging fashion trends into cheap products sometimes in a matter of days analysts and critics alike have long observed that shein s attentions have been poured not into transparency but into building influence using social media emily salter a senior analyst with globaldata says until recently it had gone unseen apart from by its gen z shoppers who are digitally savvy and bargain conscious despite this generation also being one that cares more about sustainability and ethics social media is a huge contributor to shein s success with paid partnerships with celebrities boosting brand awareness among its target shoppers fans clamour to share their hauls a feature of fast fashion in which shoppers buy a pile of bikinis or whatever the item then share it with an online audience in the hope shein might send them free merchandise to promote a quick search of the sheinhaul hashtag on the social media site tiktok shows videos made with this hashtag have 3 1 billion views however the internet is also awash with complaints about everything from quality to service including the apparent difficulty of reaching anyone at the company when the mail tried to contact shein for comment via members of their pr team and customer service we received no response and as ciara barry policy and research co ordinator for fashion revolution says the clothes may be cheap but that comes at a social and environmental cost not to mention as deborah breen and others have discovered the personal cost of finding that your unique design funded slaved over and perfected by you has been copied by a faceless fashion behemoth

2023 the new facility will house all staff in one location and has sufficient space for the company s anticipated expansion over the next 12 months second quarter 2021 financial results it should be noted that the following financial results represent the consolidation of the company with its subsidiaries duos technologies inc and truevue360 total revenue for the second quarter decreased 67 to 649 000 compared to 1 98 million in the same period last year this was the aggregate of about 100 000 for technology systems and 548 000 in recurring services revenue the decrease in total revenue was the result of a delay in receiving notices to proceed for anticipated new contracts earlier in the year due to the pandemic and other macro economic effects such as the current computer chip shortage which is extending deadlines for shipment of key components used in duos technology systems there are uncertainties that can impact the company s operations as a result certain installations may produce revenues towards the end of the year some of which may ultimately be recorded in 2022 cost of revenues increased 22 to 2 19 million compared to 1 79 million in the same period last year cost of revenues increased for services and consulting which comprises of equipment labor and overhead necessary to support the implementation of new systems and support and maintenance of existing systems cost of revenues on technology systems decreased during the period compared to the equivalent period in 2020 but by a smaller amount than the decrease in revenues there was also a significant increase in cost related to the deployment of a new undercarriage technology costs are expected to be much lower going forward as a percentage of the overall system price gross margin totaled 1 54 million compared to 187 000 in the same period last year the decrease in gross margin was driven by a decrease in recorded revenues as noted above the decrease in total revenues is due primarily to a pause in new installations in the technology systems part of the business the company is actively revamping its operations to support an anticipated increase in number of new systems going forward the resultant additional cost of revenues while somewhat offset by decreases in sg a expenses is not yet covered by a comparable increase in revenues as of the second quarter 2021 the company anticipates an improvement in the overall gross margin for the full year reporting in 2021 with the majority of those improvements coming in the second half of the year operating expenses decreased 13 to 1 41 million from 1 61 million in the same period last year the decrease in operating expenses was driven by decreases in administration and research and development expenses offset by increases in sales marketing net loss totaled 2 95 million compared to net loss of 1 47 million in the same period last year the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the decrease in total revenue noted previously cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled 4 82 million compared to 3 97 million at december 31 2020 total revenue decreased 6 to 2 80 million from 2 97 million in the same period last year the decrease in total revenue was driven by a slowdown in overall business bookings during the first six months due to delays in executing new contracts and certain travel restrictions resulting from macro economic headwinds the decrease was mostly offset by an increase in services and consulting revenues as a result of new contracts which are mostly recurring in nature as noted previously due to the pandemic and other macro economic effects such as the current computer chip shortage which is extending deadlines for shipment of key components used in duos technology systems there are uncertainties that can impact the company s operations as a result certain installations may produce revenues towards the end of the year some of which may ultimately be recorded in 2022 cost of revenues increased 43 to 4 92 million from 3 44 million in the same period last year the increase was driven by increased costs of deployment related to certain installations where new technologies were being deployed for the first time costs for services and consulting increased at a proportionate rate to the increase in revenues this trend is expected to reverse in the next six months as certain economies of scale become evident in the second half of 2021 and beyond overhead more than doubled for the period reflecting higher costs for staffing current and anticipated projects although this rate of increase is expected to flatten in the second half of 2021 gross margin decreased to 2 11 million from 468 000 in the same period last year the decrease in gross margin was mainly the result of lower revenues during the six month period and the proportion of costs allocated to projects being higher as a percentage against lower revenues the company anticipates an improvement in the overall gross margin for the full year reporting in 2021 with the majority of those improvements coming in the second half of the year operating expenses decreased 13 to 2 64 million from 3 05 million in the same period last year the decrease in operating expenses can be attributed to decreases in administration costs and research development expenses slightly offset by an increase in sales and marketing the company has taken actions to reduce certain expenditures to align its spending with the current slowdown in revenues due to delays in execution of existing projects net loss totaled 3 36 million compared to a net loss of 3 61 million in the same period last year the improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to the impact of the cares act ppp loan forgiveness and the effect of lower operating expenses during the 2021 six month period compared to the prior year financial outlook for the fiscal year ending december 31 2021 the company had previously guided total revenue to be approximately 18 0 million the company s guidance was based on contracts in backlog and near term pending orders that are already performing or were scheduled to be executed by the fourth quarter of 2021 due to certain macro economic effects including the resurgent covid 19 delta variant as well as global supply chain issues the company is experiencing much longer lead times for contracts to be awarded and the associated notices to proceed which would signal the start of the procurement and deployment processes with procurement the company is experiencing delays in receiving necessary components including advanced cameras and high powered servers which are critical components to its inspection portals the company is taking certain steps to mitigate some of these issues such as procuring long lead items in advance of formal notices to proceed in order to reduce the overall deployment time for technology systems accordingly the company is revising its revenue guidance where the previously forecasted 18m in revenues will be achieved by the end of the second quarter of 2022 for fiscal year 2021 uncertainty remains as to when due to the issues described above certain revenues can be booked in accordance with the asc 606 revenue recognition policy at this time the company expects to achieve between 8m and 9m for the current fiscal year based on the current situation as currently understood management also expects its operations to achieve breakeven for the last quarter of 2021 with an improved cash liquidity position by year end based on anticipated orders although uncertainties continue in the macro economic climate management believes that 2022 will yield a much stronger financial performance for revenue and be profitable for the fiscal year management commentary during the second quarter we continued to navigate through some short term industry and operational headwinds which impacted our financial results during the period but are not expected to affect our long term growth plans said duos chief executive officer chuck ferry our company is still in the midst of a challenging transition period as we make further investments in both infrastructure and support to reinforce our ability to meet the order flow we re anticipating within the next few quarters more specifically within our ai business we ve made comprehensive staffing changes to our internal team to meet demand for more comprehensive algorithm development which has slowed deployment times in the near term but is strongly supported by our existing customers we are actively expanding our rail pipeline and have made encouraging progress in getting key contracts closer to the finish line which we expect to materialize in the second half of the year however due to the uncertainty around exact timing when these contracts will occur we are revising our estimates for the year to account for potential timing discrepancies long term we remain confident in the path we ve laid out to become a self sustaining high growth business in the years ahead conference call the company s management will host a conference call today thursday

increase of 4 8 million or 90 8 the increase for both the three and six month periods in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven primarily by an increase in net interest income and decrease in provision for loan losses partially offset by increases in non interest expense and provision for income taxes net interest income for the three months ended june 30 2021 net interest income increased by 2 9 million or 24 2 versus the same period last year for the six months ended june 30 2021 net interest income increased by 5 2 million or 22 6 versus the same period last year total interest income

second quarter of the prior year and decreased 388 thousand for the six months ended june 30 2021 to 2 0 million from 2 4 million for the six months ended june 30 2020 the decrease resulted from a

the reduction of the fed funds rate in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the covid 19 pandemic provision for loan losses the company recognized provisions for loan losses of 809 thousand and 875 thousand for the three and six months ended june 30 2021 respectively compared to 1 3 million and 2 5 million for the three and six months ended june 30 2020 respectively the lower provisions

june 30 2021 compared to 19 5 million for the same period in 2020 an increase of 1 2 million or 6 3 the increase in non interest expense for the three and six month periods was due to the bank s

in 2020 the provision for income taxes for the six months ended june 30 2021 was 2 5 million compared to 1 3 million for the same period in 2020 the increase for both periods was due to the increase

president joe biden s deputies excluded only 45 percent of migrants who were recorded at the border in july and just 12 percent of migrants who bring children border chief alejandro mayorkas admitted august 11 the resulting july inflow is 29 times july 2020 inflow even though the title 42 anti epidemic barrier rules allow border officers to exclude all migrants during the coronavirus threat the biden welcome for migrants delivered 116 884 economic migrants into americans workplaces housing and schools even though the new inflow will further cut americans wages and raise their rents breitbart news reported august 10 adjusted for inflation hourly compensation fell 2 7 percent in the second quarter data released by the bureau of labor statistics on the nonfarm business sector showed tuesday but border chief alejandro mayorkas used his ready for tv speech in brownsville texas to deny responsibility for the mass migration and to instead blame the record breaking inflow of migrants on president donald trump and on the long standing corruption and crime in central america yet mayokos indirectly admitted that biden s pro migration policies are inviting more migrants than trump s pro american policies saying another reason is the end of the cruel policies of the past administration and the restoration of the rule of laws of this country that congress has passed including our asylum laws that provide humanitarian relief and mayorkas threatened to deliver more migrants to americans jobs and neighborhoods saying in the coming days our department will announce that we are making changes and improvements to how we process asylum claims we continue to rebuild our immigration system to ensure fairness and promote equity the reference by the cuban born mayorkas to fairness and equity refers to his support for migrants so far mayorkas has shown no concern for the many millions of americans who are worried about their jobs and wages their rents and kids schools their children s future and their increasingly threatened political status in their own country in his ready for tv speech mayorkas wrapped his admissions and threats in confident claims that the border is just way too complicated for the u s superpower to manage the situation at the border is one of the toughest challenges we face it is complicated changing and involves vulnerable people at a time of a global pandemic we have seen my surges in migration before we ve seen them in the past and migrations surges are not new mayorkas also perfumed the asylum loophole that invites many rational migrants including women who claim they were beaten by their husbands or threatened by local crooks to claim they deserve american citizenship because of victimization at home migrants he said are very quickly turned around and sent back if they are not expelled they are placed into removal proceedings which are immigration enforcement proceedings they are prosecuted for removal and are removed unless they make a successful claim for relief and establish that they are entitled to remain in the united states since roughly 2010 more than three million migrants have surged into the united states usually claiming they need asylum the migration by asylum is being cheered by progressives democrats and the business executives who know that migrants will be used in the u s economy as workers consumers and renters the asylum migration is underway even as the u s government allows one million legal immigrants into the country each year the two floods of migrants are adding one new migrant to the united states for every two children born in 2021 mayorkas staff invited selected reporters to ask a few questions after the speech however the reporters questions were about migrants concerns and disease not about mayorkas s policy of putting migrants interests ahead of americans concerns mayorkas also suggested that his deputies are cracking down on his own policy of not punishing the many migrants who make repeated efforts to cross the border until they succeed but mayorkas refused to provide any numbers even though he has complete access to the data as dhs chief our expulsion flights are now increasingly moving into the interior of mexico so return recidivism is not as easy we are prosecuting individuals who have been previously removed from the united states overall investors and business coalitions want to import more migrants even impoverished ill aging or criminal migrants because the migrants spike consumer sales boost rental rates cut wages minimize management hassles and so raise profits and stock values the migrants also serve as clients for democrat run welfare agencies and eventually as voters for democratic candidates but migration damages ordinary americans career opportunities cuts their wages raises their rents curbs their productivity contradicts their political preferences and fractures their open minded equality promoting civic culture for many years a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates this opposition is multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity americans owe to each other the voter opposition to elite backed economic migration coexists with support for legal immigrants and some sympathy for illegal migrants but only a minority of americans mostly leftists embrace the many skewed polls and articles pushing the 1950 s corporate nation of immigrants claim

text size when photographer anton corbijn first met depeche mode in 1981 while working an assignment for british music magazine nme he wasn t convinced for the intense corbijn the son of a preacher who had moved from holland to england a year prior to follow moody post punkers joy division the poppy four piece were light stuff that s just the way i was wired that if you do something it should feel like you do it with all your might your focus your energy always 100 per cent on the one thing cause i guess that s what i did in my photography at the time corbijn 66 says from a hotel room in london when i felt people fell short of that i wasn t so interested the band s sound took on a colder industrial edge with 1983 s construction time again and 1984 s some great reward when guitarist martin l gore took control of their songwriting and although music critics struggled to comprehend how the band who d recorded just can t get enough was now singing about sex and death and religion corbijn s interest was piqued anton holding onto dave during the filming of video barrel of a gun marrakech 1996 credit anton corbijn courtesy of taschen yes they dismissed them he recalls of the music press s response to the band s sudden transition but between the first time i met them to when i really started to work with them about five years later they really developed and they became a different band really they had a lot more seriousness going on so that i could see how my images and their sounds really started to match up forty years on the photographer and band have carved out one of pop music s most intriguing creative partnerships to the point that corbijn the band s de facto creative director who has taken their publicity shots shot their videos and designed their album covers logos and stage shows has often been called the band s fifth member images from across their collaboration are collated in the sumptuous new 512 page book depeche mode by anton corbijn by the time he d meshed with depeche corbijn s early rock photography had already cultivated a distinct artistic style characterised by high contrast black and white heavy grain movement and a unique interpretive streak his iconic nme cover photo of joy division in a london tube station had the band completely turned away from camera save an over the shoulder glance from ian curtis the aesthetic was tonally a fit for depeche mode lending a solemn romantic image to their new sound advertisement asked in the book how he d envisage depeche mode if corbijn had not been such a part of the band s identity frontman dave gahan quips in focus and in colour while influenced by documentary photographers such as dorothea lange and diane arbus corbijn says his aesthetic defined by working at a fast pace was borne by necessity dave gahan in randers denmark 1987 credit anton corbijn courtesy of taschen when i was coming up in holland if you wanted to photograph somebody in the music world who came through you usually had a few minutes that was it so you became very inventive in how you used those few minutes and it helped you focus he says that was a good schooling i think because i know i can take a good picture anywhere that it will somehow work asked how he d envisage depeche mode if corbijn had not been a part of the band s identity dave gahan quips in focus and in colour during those early years shooting for the nme he d arrive at jobs with a simple set up his nikkormat ft camera and a spare in case it went on the fritz plus 50mm 35mm and 80mm lenses i m not a studio photographer so location is a very big thing and you don t always have the luxury of taking people to places that would be ideal so i always improvised and made something work he recalls his first shoot with depeche mode in august 1981 saw him taking the band out in a row boat on a small lake in their hometown of basildon essex advertisement it s advantageous sometimes to be forced into that kind of focus he says because if you have all this time and all these cameras and lenses you lose what could be the strength of the simple approach i mean it s just one idea and you shoot it how many different ways can you shoot it corbijn s first shoot with depeche mode with former member vince clarke in london 1981 credit anton corbijn courtesy of taschen corbijn was a fixture with the band through the release of their most significant records 1990 s violator for which he designed the rose adorned album cover and shot the evocative video for single enjoy the silence it was on high rotation on mtv people wrote it was the david lynch of videos it was interesting the impact it had he recalls and the follow on 1993 s songs of faith and devotion he remembers it as the start of a dark period where gahan succumbed to drug abuse and emotional torture eventually overdosing on a speedball in may 1996 that left him clinically dead for two minutes a stark photo in the book from august 1993 taken in a frankfurt hotel after a gig shows gahan gaunt and lifeless his torso and arms covered in nicks and scars why did corbijn take the photo so severe in its intimacy was he trying to show gahan to himself i don t know if there was an ulterior motive i don t know if it s just a photographer being with someone in a room and thinking this makes a good picture corbijn says advertisement loading the injuries were partly self inflicted and partly because he was diving into the audience every night but there s also a very jesus like vibe to the photo the way he s lying there with his eyes closed but all this damage to him it had something a combination of heaven and hell i guess in his 2015 film life about life magazine photographer dennis stock and actor james dean corbijn explored the unique relationship between photographer and subject what s it like being with a rock band during those periods of heady excess well within the romantic facade that everyone else sees it s always different when you look back when you re in there although there was darkness and all that there was also of course the elation says corbijn the concerts were successful and each day was an incredible rush of energy so that confuses things in a way dave gahan in madrid 1992 credit anton corbijn courtesy of taschen but of course when i look back i should ve maybe talked to dave more seriously he adds because i m not a connoisseur of drug use i maybe didn t understand just how damaging or how far it went i m happy that period is behind us because it was not a healthy time since 2007 s control a biopic about the late ian curtis of joy division corbijn has worked primarily in film his next project he says will be a documentary on hipgnosis the english design group who created album cover art for artists including pink floyd led zeppelin and paul mccartney it s a documentary about the dying art of album sleeves and the resurgence of people buying vinyl he says but he remains enamoured with the possibilities of still photography advertisement i love the simplicity of just going out with my camera especially after making movies i realised the freedom you have as a photographer he says to get a movie to work there are so many elements that have to gel it takes years of your life and it can still fail in photography if it goes wrong you ve only lost a few hours depeche mode in san francisco 2008 credit anton corbijn courtesy of taschen corbijn s list of portrait subjects could rival forrest gump s encounters there s nick cave one of my favourite subjects he always looks believable miles davis we shot in 5 10 minutes he had such a strength tom waits he does his own thing never pr or anything just tom and me and nelson mandela such an aura a beautiful energy that s an experience that remains with you he s also had a similar long term collaboration with u2 famously shooting their joshua tree album cover and acting as creative director across various albums and tours they re always open with trying things but it s a bigger machine he says but his relationship with depeche mode remains personally rewarding dave gahan in frankfurt 1993 credit anton corbijn courtesy of taschen loading there s an advantage with staying with one subject for a long time you become part of the furniture so there s an ease in the relationship and what you can do says corbijn i hope people can appreciate the variety of things we ve done i think we ve made some great things together advertisement

as the delta variant surges some people who decided not to get vaccinated are reconsidering example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video portland ore with the delta variant surging some people who decided not to get vaccinated are reconsidering their decision virginia followed restrictions and mandates aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus but didn t want to get the vaccine her concern was that the process to find one seemed rushed the second that they did they just wanted everybody to get vaccinated and i didn t feel like it allowed them enough time to properly test it on a pool of people she said according to johns hopkins medicine there were a number of reasons the covid 19 vaccine was ready for a rollout and some were the covid 19 vaccines from pfizer biontech and moderna were created with a method that has been in development for years so the companies could start the vaccine development process early in the pandemic china isolated and shared genetic information about covid 19 promptly so scientists could start working on vaccines the vaccine developers didn t skip any testing steps but conducted some of the steps on an overlapping schedule to gather data faster vaccine projects had plenty of resources as governments invested in research and or paid for vaccines in advance some types of covid 19 vaccines were created using messenger rna mrna which allows a faster approach than the traditional way that vaccines are made destiny beller had similar concerns she has multiple chronic conditions with some issues still undiagnosed she worried about a serious reaction to the vaccine it wasn t worth the risk in my mind then side effects that could have made things worse said beller the main side effects of the covid 19 vaccines are short term and include things like low grade fever and pain and redness around the injection site the world health organization says on its website serious or long lasting side effects to vaccines are possible but extremely rare however with news of the delta variant making people sicker and spreading twice as fast as the original virus both beller and virginia had a change in attitude i felt like the risk of any side effects from getting covid 19 were a lot more than any risk that i would get from the vaccine explained beller it s really getting to a point that we cannot ignore the fact of how dangerous and how bad it is said virginia both received their first dose of the covid 19 vaccine in recent weeks so far about 55 of oregonians are fully vaccinated with an additional 4 6 like beller and virginia who have gotten at least their first dose that s about 2 5 million people
by ryan cragun university of tampa the hashtag taxthechurches began trending on twitter in mid july the spark was allegations about the wealth of celebrity pastor joel osteen but it wasn t the first time that tax the churches has circulated in fact it is slogan that long predates social media frank zappa was singing it back in 1981 and mark twain expressed similar sentiments many decades before that as a sociologist of religion i ve long been interested in why religious institutions are exempt from certain taxes and what that means in potential lost revenue for the u s in 2012 i examined this issue and estimated that in total churches in the u s get out of paying around us 71 billion in taxes annually auditing the house of god most religious organizations are exempt from a variety of taxes that individuals and businesses are required to pay like income and property taxes these exemptions began formally in 1913 at the federal level though there is a much longer history of exempting charitable educational scientific and religious institutions from taxation it is important to note that faith organizations can be exempt from paying taxes solely based on their religious work not for any other charitable endeavors churches and religious organizations which the irs loosely defines as entities organized for religious purposes or for advancing religion are listed separately from other tax exempt entities and charities and can be subject to different rules some religious congregations do engage in relief efforts for the poor and needy but many do not and of the ones that do many give a very small amount of their revenue for such charitable purposes additionally unlike charities churches and other places of worship are not required to report any financial information to the irs the irs encourages churches to do so but they are not required to and it can be an onerous process for the irs to gain approval to audit places of worship requiring prior evidence of abuse of tax exemptions reported by a high level treasury employee in many places in the u s income is taxed at the local state and federal levels religious institutions do not pay any income tax at any level of government additionally individuals and corporations that donate to religions can deduct those expenses once they are above a specific amount from their taxable income heavenly bank accounts religious organizations also pay no taxes on their investments whether it be interest they earn on their investments or in capital gains the increased value of stock from when the stock was purchased as such they are able to invest excess revenue in the stock market or other investment instruments but pay no taxes on the corresponding earnings one fortune 500 company thrivent originated as a financial services organizations for missouri synod lutherans in 1902 and then for all lutherans in the 1960s it was called thrivent financial for lutherans up to 2014 but it now manages the investments of members of many religious congregations as well religious endowments and investment accounts total in the hundreds of billions of dollars in the u s just how much money religious organizations have is hard to tell as churches are not required to report such information however the net worth of some well known pastors like kenneth copeland and pat robertson are estimated to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars religious organizations pay no sales tax this means that when representatives of a religious entity make a purchase office supplies cars or travel for example they are exempted from whatever the local sales tax is in that area they also pay no income taxes for businesses they own if they can show that the business furthers the objectives of the religion for example a bookstore that sells religious books would be exempt religious organizations may pay employment taxes for their employees however there are exceptions built into the tax code here as well clergy and members of religious orders are the only citizens who can opt out of paying self employed contributions act taxes which are 15 3 taxes on income for self employed individuals that pay for social security and other federal benefits if religious clergy opt out of the seca tax they cannot receive social security benefits clergy can also deduct the upkeep costs of their parsonage their home or apartment from their taxable income finally religious organizations pay no property taxes property taxes are primarily used in the u s to fund local services like firefighting emergency medical services and police departments as well as schools and other infrastructure all of which religious organizations use some municipalities make information on property taxes publicly available so it is relatively easy to work out the cost of this tax exemption to local communities i looked at manatee county in florida as an example manatee county is a midsize county in florida with just over 300 000 citizens living in a mixture of rural and urban areas recent data suggests that manatee county is close to the national average when it comes to the religious makeup of its residents finally florida property values and the cost of living rank almost exactly in the middle of all u s states making manatee county a fairly representative illustration of the nation generally manatee county s public portal indicates which properties are classified as churches and are therefore exempt from ad valorem taxes those based on the assessed value of the property and other property taxes by downloading the just market values for the 360 properties classified as having a religious exemption i was able to work out that their combined value was 406 7 million if they paid the standard property taxes required of both commercial and residential properties in manatee county they would add 8 5 million to the tax revenue of the county annually with the county s budget at 740million an additional 8 5 million works out to be about 1 1 of the total this according to the 2022 manatee county budget proposal would be enough to cover the building of all three newly proposed emergency medical services stations in the county along with upgrades of ems equipment and its 911 service taxing the infidel and the atheist projecting those numbers out to the entire u s population is tricky the number and proportion of religiously exempt properties varies by county property values and tax rates vary across the country and the value of religiously exempt properties varies as well but if one assumed that the exempt taxes are uniform across the country based on the information derived from manatee county which to be clear they re not local and state governments forgo roughly 6 9 billion in tax revenue annually by exempting religions from paying property taxes this is just an estimate it is nearly impossible to know the actual amount and it may be that the true figure is even higher if churches and other places of worship were required to file annual financial reports researchers could use that information to evaluate the financial health of religious entities in the u s it would also give a clearer understanding as to how much in twain s words the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income caused by the exemption for churches with such information more readily available the public would find it much easier to discuss the merits of a hashtag campaign like taxthechurches ryan cragun professor of

formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase recapitalization reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses we intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering our capital stock debt or a combination of cash stock and debt the issuance of additional shares in connection with a business combination to the owner of the target or other investors may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering which dilution would increase if the anti dilution provisions in the class b common stock resulted in the issuance of class a common stock on a greater than one to one basis upon conversion of the class b common stock may subordinate the rights of holders of class a common stock if shares of preferred stock are issued with rights senior to those afforded our class a common stock could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock are issued which may affect among other things our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards if any and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us and 16 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our class a common stock and or warrants similarly if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target it could result in default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest if any if the debt is payable on demand our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding our inability to pay dividends on our class a common stock using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our class a common stock if declared expenses capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation and limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt we expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination we cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful risks and uncertainties on january 30 2020 the world health organization who announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus the covid 19 outbreak in march 2020 the who classified the covid 19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally the full impact of the covid 19 outbreak continues to evolve the impact of the covid 19 outbreak on the company s financial position will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related advisories and restrictions these developments and the impact of the covid 19 outbreak on the financial markets and the overall economy are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted if the financial markets and or the overall economy are impacted for an extended period the company s financial position may be materially adversely affected additionally the company s ability to complete an initial business combination may be materially adversely affected due to significant governmental measures being implemented to contain the covid 19 outbreak or treat its impact including travel restrictions the shutdown of businesses and quarantines among others which may limit the company s ability to have meetings with potential investors or affect the ability of a potential target company s personnel vendors and service providers to negotiate and consummate an initial business combination in a timely manner the company s ability to consummate an initial business combination may also be dependent on the ability to raise additional financing which may be impacted by the covid 19 outbreak and the resulting market downturn 17 results of operations we have neither engaged in any operations other than searching for a business combination after our initial public offering nor generated any revenues to date our only activities from inception through june 30 2021 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the initial public offering and identifying a target for our business combination we do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination we generate non operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities we are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company for legal financial reporting accounting and auditing compliance as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with identifying and completing a business combination for the period from april 1 2021 through june 30 2021 we had a net loss of 4 097 125 which is a result of the change in fair value of warrant liability of 3 802 949 and operating costs of 298 657 partially offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account of 4 481 for the six months ended june 30 2021 we had net income of 11 880 546 which is a result of the change in fair value of warrant liability of 12 573 292 and operating costs of 701 659 partially offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account of 8 913 liquidity and capital resources on october 5 2020 we consummated the initial public offering of 30 000 000 units at a price of 10 00 per unit generating gross proceeds of 300 000 000 simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering we consummated the sale of 8 000 000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of 1 00 per warrant generating gross proceeds of 8 000 000 following the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants a total of 300 000 000 was placed in the trust account and we had 1 375 991 of cash held outside of the trust account after payment of all costs related to the initial public offering and available for working capital purposes we incurred 16 997 562 in initial public offering related costs including 6 000 000 of underwriting fees 10 500 000 of deferred underwriting fees and 497 562 of other costs as of june 30 2021 we had marketable securities held in the trust account of 300 014 457 consisting of u s treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less interest income on the trust account will used by us to pay franchise and income taxes we intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account less deferred underwriting commissions and interest income that is used to pay franchise and income taxes to complete our business combination to the extent that our capital stock or debt is used in whole or in part as consideration to complete our business combination the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies as of june 30 2021 we had cash of 458 723 held outside the trust account we intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses travel to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses and structure negotiate and complete a business combination for the six months ended june 30 2021 we generated net income of 11 880 546 and cash used in operating activities was 714 548 which was partially offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 8 913 change in the fair value of warrant liability of 12 573 292 and changes in operating assets and liabilities which used 12 889 of cash from operating activities 18 we do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business however if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking in depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination moreover we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination subject to compliance with applicable securities laws we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination if we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account in addition following our business combination if cash on hand is insufficient we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination the sponsor or certain of the company s officers and directors or their affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required on a non interest bearing basis if we complete a business combination we would repay the working capital loans out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise the working capital loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that a business combination does not close we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the trust account to repay the working capital loans but no proceeds held in the trust account would be used to repay the working capital loans the working capital loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a business combination without interest or at the lender s discretion up to 1 500 000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of 1 00 per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants except for the foregoing the terms of such working capital loans if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of june 30 2021 contractual obligations as of june 30 2021 we do not have any long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations or long term liabilities other than an agreement to pay our sponsor a monthly fee of 10 000 for office space utilities and secretarial and administrative support provided to us we began incurring these fees on october 1 2020 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination and our liquidation the representative of the underwriters is entitled to a deferred fee of 10 500 000 in the aggregate the deferred fee will become payable to the representative of the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that the company completes a business combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement critical accounting policies the preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the periods reported actual results could materially differ from those estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies warrant derivative liability in accordance with asc 815 40 derivatives and hedging contracts in an entities own equity entities must consider whether to classify contracts that may be settled in its own stock such as warrants as equity of the entity or as an asset or liability if an event that is not within the entity s control could require net cash settlement then the contract should be classified as an asset or a liability rather than as equity we have determined because the terms of public warrants include a provision that entitles all warrant holders to cash for their warrants in the event of a qualifying cash tender offer while only certain of the holders of the underlying shares of common stock would be entitled to cash our warrants should be classified as derivative liability measured at fair value with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings further if our sponsor warrants are held by someone other initial purchases of the sponsor warrants or their permitted transferees the sponsor warrants will be redeemable by the company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the public warrants because the terms of the sponsor warrants and public warrants are so similar we classified both types of warrants as a derivative liability measured at fair value volatility in our common stock and public warrants may result in significant changes in the value of the derivatives and resulting gains and losses on our statement of operations 19 class a common stock subject to possible redemption we account for our class a common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification topic 480 distinguishing liabilities from equity shares of class a common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value conditionally redeemable class a common stock including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control is classified as temporary equity at all other times class a common stock is classified as stockholders equity our class a common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events accordingly class a common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity outside of the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet net income per common share we apply the two class method in calculating earnings per share net income per common share basic and diluted for class a redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the trust account net of applicable franchise and income taxes by the weighted average number of class a redeemable common stock outstanding for the period net loss per common share basic and diluted for class b non redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net income less income attributable to class a redeemable common stock by the weighted average number of class b non redeemable common stock outstanding for the period recent accounting standards management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements

groups made up of realtors with various skill and experience levels said ryan hardy luxury real estate broker at gold coast realty the truth although top producing listing agents might advertise an

common seller myth is that offering a lower commission will net more money the truth nothing is further from the truth said ailion what this will do is cause agents with the most qualified buyers to

especially in the southern states the truth sometimes sellers focus solely on the fact that there are likely fewer buyers in the off season and ignore the fact that there is also a corresponding reduction in listings said kevin mack real estate broker for properties in evanston illinois there is less competition for well positioned properties statistics clearly show that the supply of

founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you jonae good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today i will begin on slide 3 of the presentation since atea founding we have remained steadfast in our mission to discover and develop antiviral drugs for the treatment cure and prophylaxis of severe viral diseases where there is a significant unmet medical need where we can make a meaningful impact for patients early last year our antiviral platform put us at the forefront in the fight against covid 19 and we believe a multipronged approach including therapeutics and vaccine will be essential solutions in this pandemic which is now becoming endemic it has become abundantly clear that most countries and regions like southeast asia south america and india where we are seeing a devastating impact from covid of low vaccination rates which have become a source for variants and create new challenges for treatment and prevention it is projected that the delta variant currently account for 93 of all new cases in the united states and we are now back to 100 000 new infections per day obviously this is a particular concern given recent publication demonstrating lower efficacy rates for vaccine against the new strain for example the delta variant has also been reported to be highly contagious almost as contagious as chickenpox and it has a more rapid replication than earlier strengths and for this we are seeing a significant number of breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated patients accounting for as much as 15 in all hospitalized patients and even 15 of the new cases now are in children which further expands the infected population in addition to the delta variant the lambda variant first identified in peru and now spreading in south america is highly infectious as well and particularly concerning and i m sure that in six months or so we will probably talk about another dominant variant in the u s and other countries turning to slide 4 given this evolving dynamics medical intervention at all therapeutics in particular will be essential in stemming the tide of this pandemic we believe that at 527 our poly administered direct acting antiviral agent derived from our purine nucleotide prodrug platform is uniquely positioned to help meet this challenge and become a solution as i m sure by now you know at 527 targets viral rna polymerase which is a highly concerned enzyme critical to viral application and transcription and with its dual mechanism affecting both functional domains so this rna polymerase inhibiting both niran and the rdrp we believe that we provide a high barrier to resistance along with broad antiviral coverage for different variants of sars cov 2 to date the predominant mutation actually in this rna polymerase is the p323l and please note a baseline in our hospitalized phase ii trials 98 of the patients have this mutation and we believe that all responded to at 527 treatment essentially we can say today that the original one viruses is basically gone and we believe that this bodes very well for antiviral activity against the variants as well and we are currently validating this hypothesis as reported in recent press releases a significant amount of comparing clinical data has been reported for our drugs demonstrating antiviral efficacy in our phase ii study in hospitalized patients and today janet will review the phase ii interim results as well as new data on bronchoalveolar lavage study demonstrating that at 527 we believe is the first investigational daa being developed for covid 19 and showing that target drug levels effectively reach the lung which as you know is the primary site of sars cov 2 infection i want to emphasize that this is the lower respiratory track in contrast where we are measuring the rna as janet will show you and share with you the data we are talking about upper respiratory track so that s why we view this data as very important for our development program as they provide further confidence not only for the treatment but also for our planned prophylaxis studies for covid 19 as we continue to advance multiple global clinical studies in parallel with our partner roche we are one step closer to achieving our goal of providing an easily administered or direct acting antiviral in the fight against this global pandemic and now i would like to turn the call to janet for a full review of this data janet janet hammond chief development officer thank you jean pierre i will begin with slide 6 as the covid 19 pandemic evolves and we generate more data from our at 527 program we are acting nimbly to optimizing the design and conduct of our clinical development program as you can see here we have six studies of at 527 currently running in parallel and we re leveraging lessons learned from each study to better serve our patients and improve our probability of success slide 7 outlines our global phase ii study of at 527 in the hospitalized setting before we review the interim results as a reminder this is a randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter study to evaluate at 527 in patients with moderate covid 19 study objectives are to assess safety tolerability clinical and antiviral efficacy we are currently amending the protocol to reflect the evolving covid environment by changing the primary endpoint of virology from its former progression to respiratory insufficiency going to the limited number of cases that now progressed due to changes in the standard of care we will also be exploring alternative doses and adding a part b cohort comprised of up to 110 patients moving to slide 8 in june we were delighted to announce positive interim results from our global phase ii study of at 527 indicating rapid and sustained antiviral activity against sars cov 2 in patients with covid 19 in the hospitalized setting the interim analysis of the phase ii study included data from 70 hospitalized high risk patients with covid 19 from which 62 patients were evaluable for virological analysis these patients were infected with a broad array of virus lineages representing over 20 variants and included the alpha and beta variance of concern they were enrolled from seven countries in north america europe africa and south america representing a diverse geographic footprint 46 of patients with sars cov 2 seropositive by igm measurement at baseline and were equally distributed across the treatment arms as expected and observed in other studies seropositive patients had lower baseline viral load continued viral load decline from the onset of respiratory tract infection is part of the natural history of these diseases and is to be expected what is important is the differential rate of decline of virus driven by the administration of a direct acting antiviral the lower of the viral load the lower the risk of transmitting infection and the greater the likelihood that the immune system is able to deal with whatever remaining virus is present and help to shorten and attenuate the disease on slide 9 in all evaluable patients at day 2 patients receiving at 527 experienced a 0 7 log10 drop in viral load which is an 8 greater mean reduction from baseline viral load in comparison with the placebo group a sustained difference in viral load reduction between the two cohorts was maintained all the way through day 8 with the state of it we are seeing a rapid and strong antiviral signal and this is critical as the value and immediate health impact of the daa is to rapidly inhibit viral replication in the early phase of infection and reduced disease progression at 527 sars cov 2 potent antiviral activity was consistent across multiple prespecified analysis and again as expected on slide 10 was more pronounced in subjects enrolling with higher viral loads on slide 11 as measured by nasopharyngeal swabs in an rt pcr test with a lower level of quantification of less than 500 copies you can see in the graph to the left as early as day two and at day 10 42 of the patients in the at 527 arm achieved viral clearance compared with 0 in the placebo arm in the graph to the right when evaluating a stricter threshold with no detectable rna virus or target non detected tnd still 33 of patients in the at 527 arm had undetectable rna at day 10 earlier pcr negativity as demonstrated in these phase ii results may lead to a faster recovery time while also minimizing the transmission of infection in this phase ii study consistent with previous studies at 527 was generally safe and well tolerated and there were no drug related serious adverse events now moving to slide 12 you ll find new results here that evaluated drug levels measured in the lung lining fluid and this is called a bronchoalveolar lavage study and measures drug levels from the surface of the lung and from cells in the lungs obtained through washings obtained from the lungs for the first time with the direct acting antiviral target drug levels were achieved in the lungs in healthy volunteers with at 527 550 milligrams administered twice daily and these levels even exceeded the target 0 5 micromolar or 150 nanograms per milliliter which corresponds to the in vitro ec90 of the drug in infected primary human airway epithelial cells this is important in confirming that at 527 reaches target drug levels at the primary site of infection and has significant implications for efficacy in both treatment and prophylaxis for covid 19 as seen on slide 13 analysis of sars cov 2 infected cells treated with at 511 which is the free base of at 527 by next generation sequencing confirmed that at 527 is not a mutagen and it does not introduce mutations into the viral genome such mutations we believe could be the catalyst for new variants especially in immunocompromised patients in addition a new drug drug interaction study in healthy volunteers indicates that at 527 is a weak inhibitor of cyp3a and that no dose adjustments should be needed for co administration of drugs that are cyp3a substrate cyp3as are the most abandoned cytochromes in the human liver and are accountable for the metabolism of more than 50 of clinical drugs so this should make prescribing simpler moving to slide 14 moonsong our global phase ii trial of at 527 in the outpatient setting continues to advance it s a randomized double blind multi center placebo controlled trial evaluating at 527 in mild or moderate covid 19 outpatients it s being conducted in collaboration with roche and will enroll up to 220 patients to evaluate the antiviral activity safety and pharmacokinetics of at 527 in adult patients the primary endpoint of this trial is change from baseline in the amount of sars cov 2 virus rna as measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at specified time point there are multiple cohorts with varying doses and we expect results in the second half of this year either late q3 or early q4 enrollment in covid 19 studies is challenging across the industry and we re continuing to open additional clinical sites which is helping with recruitment this is a surprisingly challenging disease for clinical trials in that its spread around the world is unpredictable seemingly without seasonality and when patients do become infected there is a very limited window for eligibility for entry into our studies next this is a phase ii proof of concept study to show antiviral activity supportive data for dosage and importantly to confirm the safety profile of the drug this study has not been powered for statistical significance as highlighted on slide 15 we continue to advance our phase iii morningsky trial a global multi center trial evaluating at 527 in mild or moderate covid 19 patients in an outpatient setting this trial is being conducted with our partner roche and it is currently enrolling patients outside of the united states we anticipate that it will enroll approximately 1 400 adults and adolescents with mild to moderate covid 19 patients with or without risk presses will be randomized within five days of symptom onset at the time of enrollment patients must be stable and not for hospitalization the primary endpoint evaluating the efficacy of at 527 compared with placebo will measure the time to alleviation or improvement of covid 19 symptoms other key efficacy endpoints will include the number of patients acquiring medically attended visits or hospitalization for covid 19 and also mortality additionally among other secondary and exploratory endpoints the study will also identify and or evaluate biomarkers that are predictive of an antiviral response to at 527 we currently expect results from the study in the second half of 2021 patients from this study have the option to roll over into meadowspring a phase iii six month long term follow on study conducted in collaboration with roche this trial was recently initiated and will evaluate the impact of at 527 on long covid it s expected to enroll approximately 1 000 patients and is already currently accruing patients let me now turn the call over to john for an at 527 commercial update john john vavricka chief commercial officer thank you janet turning to slide 17 we tend to view the target population as four broad patient segments there is symptomatic active disease in which a patient with symptoms would present and be treated there s asymptomatic active disease and although they re asymptomatic we believe these patients will be accessed through proactive testing from employers schools and travel and the third area is prophylaxis both pre and post exposure and finally a government purchase which would include purchases both for active disease as well as for stockpile and we see all of these segments have large market opportunity we also consider it important to look at vaccinated and unvaccinated people in each of these segments when considering different patient motivations and communication needs compared to the last pandemic with h1n1 in 2009 one of the biggest differences was that there were fda approved antivirals readily available so that the government chose to stockpile during the pandemic current government efforts appear to target availability of new oral therapeutic treatments for covid 19 and are meant for immediate utilization within the u s distribution system following an eua or an nda approval there is currently a 3 2 billion government offering from oral therapeutic treatments for high risk outpatients mild to moderate patients and pre and post exposure prophylaxis treatment and we remain in active discussions with the u s government agencies regarding this offering we also believe that given the devastating global impact of covid 19 it is highly likely that the u s government will also stockpile treatments for future preparedness similar to what they stockpiled during h1n1 with that overview i ll now turn the call back over to janet janet hammond chief development officer thanks john on slide 19 i m pleased to report that we are also making progress with at 752 our program for dengue the phase ia single ascending dose study portion of the trial evaluating multiple doses have been successfully completed and the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial was initiated during this quarter the objective of the study is to establish the safety and tolerability of at 752 and also to support dose selection for future studies of at 752 as a treatment and also for prophylaxis of dengue fever it s expected to roll up to 60 patients with that i ll now turn the call over to andrea for a review of the financials andrea corcoran chief financial officer executive vice president of legal thank you janet as john mentioned in her introductory remarks this afternoon we issued a press release containing our financial results for the second quarter of 2021 the statement of operations and balance sheet are on slides 21 and 22 for the second quarter 2021 the increase in research and development expenses in comparison to the second quarter of 2020 was principally driven by an increase in external clinical development and manufacturing expenses incurred primarily in conjunction with the advancement of at 527 for the treatment of covid 19 and to a lesser extent at 752 which is being developed for dengue fever these expenses included our share of costs incurred by roche and increases in internal spend mostly due to an increase in personnel related expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the expansion of our organization and consists principally an increase in payroll and personnel related expenses i am pleased to report that we ended the second quarter with a strong balance sheet to support our clinical development programs as of june 30 2021 cash and cash equivalents were 816 5 million please note that this does not include the 50 million development milestone the company achieved in june under our license agreement with roche that payment was received in july i ll now turn the call back over to jean pierre for closing remarks jean pierre sommadossi founder chairman and chief executive officer thank you andrea in closing we cannot underestimate the importance of the at 527 clinical development program and the progress we are making the covid 19 endemic remained very much with us and all data points to another surge this fall due to the delta variants and low vaccination rates around the world it is our goal to advance this important program and to provide rapidly a solution that can play an important role in helping to reduce the global burden of this disease the atea team along with our partners at roche are doing everything in our power to make this happen our success would be everyone s success as reviewed today we continue to make substantial progress with at 527 and now we have demonstrated that at 527 has rapid and sustained antiviral activity against sars cov 2 reaches target drug level in the lung which as you know is the primary site of infection a unique dual mechanism targeting the rna polymerase which we believe will be important for high barrier to resistance and hopefully also for addressing the problem that we are seeing with the variants demonstrated that it is not a mutagen very likely not leading to new variants in the future and no dose adjustment necessary for co administration of drugs that are substrate as you know and janet has indicated are the largest majority of drug being metabolized by these enzymes as we continue to advance multiple global clinical studies in parallel with our partner roche we look forward to the upcoming results from the phase ii moonsong and the phase iii morningsky studies in addition to the substantial progress with at 527 we continue to make progress with the other drug candidates in our antiviral pipeline for the treatment of dengue hepatitis c and rsv and we expect to provide an update on these programs later this year with that operator we will now open the call to your questions questions answers operator and your first question comes from the line of eric joseph with j p morgan eric joseph j p morgan analyst hi good evening thanks for taking my questions a couple from us i guess first as it relates to the phase ii inpatient data i m curious to know whether at this stage whether the field kind of has a sense of how the normal decay of viral load mirrors onto symptom improvement or symptom resolution i guess if we re trying to relate the comparative viral load data in the phase ii study is there sort of an absolute threshold of viral load that might predict for a symptom resolution or is kind of a goal trying to get to viral clearance and as great a proportion of patients as possible and then secondly jp you highlighted the unmet need in the pediatric population i d be curious to know whether there are any plans to kind of begin safety testing in a pediatric population to kind of expand access to that opportunity jean pierre sommadossi founder chairman and chief executive officer two great questions eric thank you janet can you maybe address both questions janet hammond chief development officer thank you jean pierre yes happy to so firstly in regards to your question around the symptoms in comparison to what happens to the viral load decay in our overall cohort of patients and it s a very small cohort of patients we didn t see much of a correlation between symptom decline and viral load decline however when we looked at the patient group who had viral load in excess of the median so greater than 5 26 logs of our viral load we actually saw actually a surprisingly good correlation between decline in viral load and decline in symptoms and so what that would translate to them was really that the viral load decline in patients who were treated was associated with a very much more rapid improvement in symptoms and approximately a two day earlier overall time to resolution of symptoms so i think that answers that question and then in regards to the pediatric population yes we are already in talks with both the ema and the fda in regard to our pediatric plan and those agencies have seen the plan and have provided comments to that and actually i think as i mentioned in our morningsky study we do have plans to start enrolling adolescents into that study because obviously it s going to be a really important patient population for that to be treated particularly as it s taking longer for the vaccines to roll out eric joseph j p morgan analyst thank you great thanks for taking the questions operator so our next question comes from the line of jonathan miller with evercore jonathan miller evercore isi analyst first one on the big phase iiis what percentage of the patients do you expect to be seronegative at baseline since as we ve seen another direct acting antiviral trials those have been responsible for driving the majority of the benefit and secondly we ve seen some recent positive results in post exposure prophylaxis trials done with monoclonal antibodies and we ve been wondering how you think that reads through to an oral small molecule approach can you do even better or worse and remind me what your time line is for initiating some sort of prophy trial whether pre or post exposure jean pierre sommadossi founder chairman and chief executive officer janet janet hammond chief development officer thanks jean pierre so with regard to the proportion of patients who are going to be seronegative i think to some extent my interpretation of the literature to date has been that actually patients who are more immunocompromised and to have high viral loads tend to be seronegative and patients who have fewer risk factors and are generally in better shape tend to have zero lower viral loads and also to be seropositive so i think that for our phase iii study where we are planning to enroll both high and low risk patients and really to roll both populations into a single study i think it s likely that we will see more patients who tend to be seropositive and seronegative because of the fact that we will have the patients who are already low risk and likely to be seropositive and then the patients who are high risk i think as you saw in our hospitalized study approximately 50 of patients were seropositive or seronegative so i m guessing that that will translate into a higher proportion of patients being seropositive but you re right it s a good question because i think one tends to see a better viral response or it s more easy to see that correlation in patients who start with seronegative just because they have a higher viral load initiative to start with with regard to your question around post exposure prophylaxis i think that there are differences and similarities between what we re anticipating i think we anticipate that pre exposure prophylaxis ought to deliver similar levels of benefit to what you see with the antibodies i think there are both pros and cons to both approaches the beauty of the approach of a small molecule in that type of setting obviously is that access is relatively considerably easier in that you don t need to go and get an injection and you can initiate therapy much more conveniently i think the disadvantage to some extent will be that the monoclonal antibodies have a longer duration of effects after a single dose whereas the prophylaxis with a direct acting antiviral will be dependent on taking the drug but of course that means that there is more room for tailoring it and potentially i suppose also ultimately less likelihood for genesis of resistance so i think we ll have to see how it all evolves and how and what we learn but i think that in general there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches but we believe that the antiviral efficacy for both approaches ought to be very similar jonathan miller evercore isi analyst and your plans to initiate those trials janet hammond chief development officer sorry yes we plan to initiate the trial in this second half of the year jonathan miller evercore isi analyst thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of tim lugo with william blair lachlan hanbury brown william blair company analyst hi guys this is lachlan on for tim first of all i just wanted to clarify when you said that the morningsky is enrolling globally does that include the u s because i know that the fda has kind of delayed that a bit in the past so i just wanted to check that s up and running and second you ve said that you re looking at higher doses can you share any details on what that higher dose is when we might see the first data from that is that going to be with the morningsky readout that you said it might be late q3 early q4 and how much incremental efficacy you might expect to see from that especially given the bronchoalveolar lavage that you may have shared from healthy patients jean pierre sommadossi founder chairman and chief executive officer i m going to address the second one and janet will go over the first one look first we anticipate that we should show a proportional increase in those concentrations and until we don t have the data obviously we cannot make some extrapolation but from the data that we see and that from the phase i that are ongoing at higher doses we believe that there s going to be substantial drug exposure increase and hopefully this should translate in better antiviral efficacy and ultimately a clinical benefit so we are encouraged by the fact that we continue to see the same tolerance and safety and obviously we have to expand in larger cohort now which study will show the results as janet has indicated we have six studies in parallel and as soon as the cohort will be completed we ll share with the street janet do you want to address the first question janet hammond chief development officer so the first question i think was in regard to morningsky was it currently and running in the u s and the answer to that is no it is not we re in discussions with the fda but it is currently not in running in the u s lachlan hanbury brown william blair company analyst and just to follow up on that have they given any guidance as to how much data or how many patients worth of data they need to see to allow that to enroll do you have a sense of when that might be able to get up and running janet hammond chief development officer so we don t generally comment on those types of specifics unfortunately so i m not able to answer your question lachlan hanbury brown william blair company analyst thanks operator and i m showing no more questions at this time jean pierre sommadossi founder chairman and chief executive officer so thank you everybody for your interest and support and appreciate and so thank you for again for joining us and continued support out there thank you operator duration 39 minutes call participants jonae barnes senior vice president of investor

the edinburgh teenager who did not want to be identified was given the moderna vaccine at leith community centre on june 28 despite assurances that stocks of pfizer would be available she had turned 16 days before and was eligible as a household contact of her mother who is severely immuno compromised read more healthy under 30s given astrazeneca vaccine told there was no alternative the schoolgirl told the herald she wanted her mother who has been shielding to feel safer at home and stressed that she did not want her own experience to deter others from getting protected she said i do think that people my age should get vaccinated but i would like to know what i should do now people in my vaccine group should receive their second dose within eight weeks it has been nearly seven weeks since i received my first dose i was given an unauthorised vaccine for my age in error i don t know if i can get a second dose because the nhs have not confirmed their advice in writing i am really quite worried about this situation the moderna vaccine has not yet been recommended for use in under 18s by uk or us regulators with european regulators only authorising it for 12 to 17 year olds on july 23 based on a clinical trial involving more than 3 700 adolescents the schoolgirl attended the appointment in leith with her father who was told he could not accompany his daughter to the cubicle during vaccination had he been present he says he knew that the moderna vaccine was not yet authorised for use in teenagers and would have intervened speaking to the herald on condition of anonymity the girl s mother said he thought this was for covid secure reasons so did not object my daughter was given the moderna vaccine she did not know this was not authorised for under 18s and only discovered this when reading the leaflet she was given while sitting on her own for 15 minutes in the observation area my daughter left and told her dad who was waiting outside their conversation was overheard by a member of staff and they were reassured incorrectly that the vaccine was already being routinely administered to under 18s in the us the girl s mother subsequently telephoned the hub and received verbal apologies from the vaccinator and later from a senior member of staff within edinburgh s health and social care partnership hscp who she says admitted to a breach of safeguarding policy regarding the girl s father being excluded i was informed i would receive a letter outlining everything we had discussed said the girl s mother six weeks later and as yet i still have not received a letter read more covid cases in scotland up 10 in week before beyond zero move the couple have repeatedly requested formal advice about what to do about their daughter s second vaccine dose due on august 23 while the moderna vaccine is not authorised by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra for use in under 18s nor is a mix and match regime combining moderna and pfizer the girl s mother says that she and her partner have been encouraged verbally by officials within nhs lothian including a public health consultant to proceed with a second dose of moderna but despite repeated requests for advice in writing nothing has been provided they have instead been directed to submit a complaint the girl s mother said this had infuriated her partner adding that the lack of communication from the health board has been extremely unnerving and only exacerbated their uncertainty the teenager has not experienced any adverse side effects and her mother stressed that the last thing we want to do is put anyone off attending for vaccination but that they did want to ensure procedures are put in place to avoid the situation being repeated it is understood that pfizer supplies were showing as available at the leith site at the time the girl s appointment was booked but that the system is not always updated quickly enough if stocks are moved the girl s mother said we feel the onus has unfairly been put on us to make a decision we should never have had placed on us due to the series of avoidable errors that led to my daughter receiving an unauthorised vaccine we are not prepared to do that we want the public health consultant to confirm in writing the advice she happily offered verbally for my daughter to take the second dose i have experienced every emotion possible from distress to guilt and anger my daughter has had her life on hold for over a year she attended school only and did nothing else while her friends were all socialising she did this to keep me safe i am so proud of her it s not fair what happened to her it should never have happened read more mass vaccine hub no show rates exceeded 60 on some days after rollout extended to young the girl s father said he felt frustrated and disappointed by the lack of clinical advice he said the vaccine is not authorised for use in the uk for my daughters age group which has led to worries my daughter was looking forward to getting the vaccine that s the world we live in now where a teenager wants a vaccination i feel the onus should not be on us as a family to decide what the best way forward is i thought that the nhs would have treated this as a priority dona milne director of public health at nhs lothian said we are currently investigating an open complaint regarding vaccination and will respond to the family shortly we are unable to comment any further on the details of the case while this process is ongoing ensuring patient safety is our

americans have felt the effects of ballooning inflation as a direct result of government mandated shutdowns of the economy prices on essential goods including food and gas have risen steadily over the past few months leaving many wondering about the economic health of the nation this past year and a half we also saw a very sharp economic decline larger in a single quarter than we have seen in any of our lifetimes unless you were around back in the 1930s says joel griffith research fellow in financial regulations at the heritage foundation griffith joins us today on the daily signal podcast to talk about the latest inflation numbers and how good fiscal policy can help us right the ship we also cover these news stories the taliban capture the strategically significant cities of ghazni and herat marking the fall of 11 out of 34 provincial capitals after a weeklong blitz of fighting texas gov greg abbott and state attorney general ken paxton push back on dallas county s new mask mandate

gov andrew cuomo is going to step down but republicans and democrats alike call for him to be held accountable for his handling of nursing homes during the covid 19 pandemic listen to the podcast below or read the lightly edited transcript doug blair our guest today is joel griffith a research fellow in the heritage foundation s roe institute for economic policy joel welcome to the show joel griffith hey hello thanks for having me today good to be here blair great awesome so there s been a lot of talk in the news recently about high inflation and what impact it s having on the american financial situation right so can you explain exactly to us what high inflation means and what the effects are on the economy griffith yeah when we talk about inflation overall what we mean is the overall price level rather than any one particular item that you might be buying now of course a lot of us have noticed over the past year it is costing us noticeably more to fill up our vehicles energy prices are up about 40 year over year and there s a lot of food items too there s a number of items we talk about inflation we re talking about the overall increase in the price level and that too actually has been dramatically higher than what we ve been used to over many years just today the new numbers came out for the month of july prices rose overall by 0 5 in just one month alone and year over year we re looking at increases that are 5 4 higher year over year and that is the highest it s going back to 2008 so for a lot of people that have entered the jobs market in the past decade they have never experienced a year in which prices overall have increased by this much blair now you mentioned 2008 and obviously a lot of our listeners that s going to probably bring back some pretty negative memories of like wow my economic situation was horrendous at that time are we saying that now the current economic health of the country is similar to 2008 or is it worse is it better where are we at griffith back in 2008 2009 era that was one of the worst economic downturns we have seen since the great depression which was in the 1930s in the 2008 era that was when housing prices collapsed we had a stock market collapse we had many big banks that went under now this situation that we re dealing with right now is quite a bit different this past year and a half we also saw a very sharp economic decline larger in a single quarter than we have seen in any of our lifetimes unless you were around back in the 1930s but that was an economic collapse this past year caused by governmental response to covid 19 the first time in our nation s history where we actually saw governments intentionally suppress economic activity and because of the nature of that economic collapse that we saw a year and a half ago the rebound has been very very sharp on the upside because once government said all right you can go back to work you can resume your lives we saw the economy snap back so in many ways the economy now that we re experiencing is actually much better for most people than it was in the recession before which is more than a decade ago blair sure so it sounds almost like what you re saying is that a lot of the current economic situation is tied more to efforts made by the government and government bodies as opposed to the pandemic itself is that accurate griffith and that really plays out across the united states because unlike pretty much every other developed country in the world we have a federalist system meaning that each of our 50 states has quite a bit of power to determine their own economic policy so over the past year and a half you had some states that were shut down just for two weeks to three weeks like florida that rapidly reopened and meanwhile you had places like new york and michigan and california that kept much of their economy shuttered for the better part of a year and now the data started really showing the difference in economic output by state you have a dozen states or so that have bigger economies now than they did before the pandemic but you have places like hawaii new york and california that are still quite a bit smaller and still have a higher unemployment than they did prior to the pandemic blair sure so going back to what you mentioned earlier at the beginning of the interview you mentioned that july inflation numbers actually just released i have some of the data in front of me right now they said the core inflation rose about 3 while the consumer price index rose 5 4 from last year having these numbers in our hands what does that tell us about the direction the economy is heading coming from data from last month or from early in the year griffith yeah well a number of these items really reflect the rapid reopening of the economy if you look at energy costs for instance that s the biggest increase year over year has been an energy overall and that s in large part because the economy reopened in some ways faster than some of the experts and some of the energy producers predicted so as you saw travel surge for instance airline travel people just driving manufacturing overall it caught some of those producers off footed so we have seen supply outpace demand growth and we ve seen a surge in those prices if you look at vehicle prices i m one of those who actually bought a used vehicle earlier this year it s not in your imagination used car prices are up 40 in just the past year many people are finding that they bought a vehicle four or five months ago and they re finding their used car value has actually increased in value despite the norm of it going down fairly steadily over time well that in part is because we re flush with a lot of extra cash but also we have a microchip problem where we have a shortage so it s much more difficult to find a new car at a comparable price so everything is really interrelated here it s hard to put your finger on any one cause but we know the reopening the supply chain issues and then our own government s mismanagement of the monetary system that is also partially to blame for this unusually large increase in prices blair now i m curious because we see all these products like you mentioned obviously used cars and other kind of items that people generally buy on a daily basis are becoming more expensive how does this affect a paycheck how does this affect somebody s wages is there any effect that this inflation has on people s actual money griffith when you see inflation and the overall price level increasing faster than someone s salary growth which is what we have seen lately well that means that your real wages they purchase less and that s one of the concerns really longer term is even if this burst of inflation proves to be temporary that the rate of inflation let s say this 5 rate will come back down to the typical average that we ve seen over the longer term of say 2 per year well if your salary this past year your wages only increased 2 and your cost of living increased 5 even if inflation comes back down to that 2 long term average if your income growth only continues at its historical rate of growth well that means that you have permanently seen a 3 decline in your income relative to where you would have been were it not for this surge of inflation blair so you re basically saying that you could be making the same amount of money as you were before but due to inflation and due to the fact that this level of inflation that we re seeing right now is so severe you in effect are taking a pay cut griffith right even if this is a lot of economists are using the word transitory to refer to this inflation burst suggesting that it ll come back to normal that inflation will return to its historical norm the problem is if you never make up for that gap in terms of your wages then that could be a permanent reduction in your real wages for years to come blair wow that sounds like a big issue on that sort of similar topic of wages and work another topic that s been popping up a lot recently in the news is the job market we also got some relatively recent numbers on the american labor market and it shows that there are around 10 million open jobs in the country currently now that seems like a lot of jobs but there s also reporting that indicates that unemployment is huge as well so i guess how does that mesh like how do we have such high unemployment when there seems to be so many jobs out there griffith well we lost many jobs of course during the shutdown and in some areas of the country thanks to the reopening we actually do see unemployment rates that are as low or lower than they were prior to the pandemic in fact as you just referenced the number of job openings we have now is actually at an all time record high for a number of months now we ve had an all time record high of job openings we have more job openings now than we did prior to the pandemic we have more job openings than we do people looking for work and we have a situation that in our small business sector nearly half of all businesses that participated in a recent survey reported that they re having problems staffing and if you go to any town or city across america you ll probably see this as well i was with family recently in south carolina and most of the bars and restaurants had help wanted signs many of them had limited their hours or their seating not because of covid they re over those restrictions in south carolina it s because they cannot find staff well in this instance government has actually caused a big part of this problem and that s because we are paying people thanks to a federal unemployment bonus many people have found they can earn more not working than working and because of that many people have chosen to simply stay home it s a big part of why we actually have a labor shortage right now and once again the data confirm this is we have a number of states i think two dozen states now that have said we are no longer going to accept these federal unemployment benefits and it just so happens that it s most of those states that are ahead of the pack in terms of getting their unemployment rates down but that s because people have been incentivized to go back to work because they can no longer take in those enormous federal unemployment bonuses blair it sounds like basically the biggest issue here is bad fiscal policy i m curious then joel what is the role of government in terms of fiscal policy i mean does congress have a role in controlling inflation does it have a role in doing these types of things where does the government step in griffith well congress has the ultimate power of the purse to actually appropriate and spend and tax and unfortunately both republicans and democrats for many years now have not acted prudently it s why nearly each and every year actually each and every year since the era of president bill clinton and speaker newt gingrich back in the early 90s each and every year we ve actually run a deficit and in the last few years those deficits have gotten wider and wider and we re fortunate we live in a free market economy where we do have quite a bit of economic freedom so we ve still achieved productivity gains we ve still been able to see families earn more over time but it could ve been so much better because we ve seen the government gobble up more and more of our resources and it s gotten far far worse over the past year and a half throughout covid blair right so now that we have this sort of idea of the government has this role in matters of fiscal policy and this is what they should be doing where should our listeners go if they want to learn a little bit more about fiscal policy we want to be seeing from our government griffith well here at the heritage foundation if you go to heritage org any type of issue that you re interested in you can just put it in the search bar and it ll pop up and of course we also are very active on twitter just staying up with current events but these are very important issues and we have seen so much happen over the last year and a half with politicians using covid as an excuse to embark on wild spending programs under the guise of helping us through the crisis but we know what can get us through this crisis it s allowing people to go back to work and in states where that has happened people are actually enjoying their lives again we see the economy s booming again and unfortunately a lot of what we see in terms of legislation continues to suggest that we re in this state of emergency in which we need massive government help just look at the package that is working its way through congress now with infrastructure and a green new deal and these are going to be serious economic consequences if we see our folks in d c continue to act this imprudently when we think about the inflation numbers something to keep in mind is we have seen a boom in housing prices and a lot of people have enjoyed their home equity going up but they re finding that when they look to get a bigger home they have a few kids look for a bigger home they re finding the price out of the marketplace same goes for people that are looking to buy their first house they re realizing wow these housing costs are out of control a lot of people are being forced to rent longer term of interesting note that big rise in house prices doesn t even factor into these inflation numbers and that s because the inflation numbers basically estimate what people are typically paying in rent and rent costs have been rising but at a more subdued rate than other items and now that these leases are beginning to expire and now that landlords are beginning to recognize that there s a risk of eviction moratoriums being continued or possibly happening in the future there s a good chance that these rental prices are going to be increasing at a faster clip over the next year which may also end up impacting overall inflation blair wow that definitely seems like a really strong consequence of this that we should be focusing on

investors pricing in the likelihood that federal reserve officials will start withdrawing the vast financial support put in place at the start of the pandemic also playing on sentiment were the fast spreading delta virus variant which is forcing governments to introduce containment measures and the chinese government s regulatory steps to tighten its grip on the world s number two economy asia

regulator look set to finish the week on a mixed note while markets here in europe look set to open slightly higher said cmc markets analyst michael hewson for now markets appear to be working on the

from 2020 due to the slowdown in the demand for nonwovens in the second half of 2021 as well as some continuing volatility in the raw material and transportation markets in 2020 suominen s comparable ebitda was eur 60 9 million petri helsky president ceo in the second quarter our net sales decreased by 7 0 from the comparison period to eur 113 6 million 122 2 sales volumes decreased from the very high level of q2 2020 but sales prices increased following higher raw material prices our comparable ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization was on a good level and reached eur 15 3 million 18 0 the result was impacted negatively by the higher raw material and logistics costs as expected as well as by the lower sales and production volumes these were partially compensated by the higher sales prices and improved raw material efficiency going forward suominen is in a strong position both strategically and financially the global market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre covid levels in europe we see that the eu single use plastics directive supd will benefit suominen as we are well placed to respond to the growing demand for innovative and sustainable nonwovens with our pioneering fiber based nonwovens know how and spunlace technology we are the leader in sustainable nonwovens and our target is to increase the share of sustainable products by 50 by 2025 compared to 2019 and to have at least ten sustainable product launches per year by the end of june we have launched nine sustainable products this year however towards the end of the second quarter especially our north american customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain has created an imbalance of inventories this has impacted also suominen s orders although in several cases we have been able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers we expect that the demand for our products will recover once this temporary imbalance is cleared our current view is that the recovery will start in the fourth quarter in europe another specific factor impacting demand has been the earlier uncertainty regarding the final formulation of the supd that postponed our customers development projects and now that the formulation is clear our orders have been affected as converters and retailers seek to sell out their existing stocks the investment project to upgrade and restart one of our existing production lines in cressa italy neared completion during the quarter and will be finalized during the third quarter slightly ahead of the original plan this investment strengthens our capabilities in europe and is made in line with our strategy aiming for growth the two other ongoing investment projects one in italy and another in the us are proceeding as planned and will be finalized during the second half of the year in june suominen issued a senior unsecured 6 year bond of eur 50 million with a coupon rate of 1 50 percent the net proceeds from the bond offering will be used for general corporate purposes in the first half of the year we were able to improve our financial performance versus h1 2020 in the second half the main uncertainty is related to the customer demand and we also continue to experience some volatility in the raw material and logistics markets it is now clear that at least the third quarter will be very difficult in terms of sales volumes our current expectation is that the demand will start to recover towards the end of the year as the imbalance in the supply chain is being resolved we are naturally taking all possible measures to mitigate the impacts from this temporary slowdown in demand net sales april june 2021 in april june 2021 suominen s net sales decreased by 7 0 from the comparison period to eur 113 6 million 122 2 sales volumes

the covid 19 pandemic continues to cause uncertainty in suominen s business environment the key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of suominen personnel and customers possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics as well as potential closures of customers or our own plants due to virus infections or authority decisions remain valid at least until there is broad enough vaccination coverage in the countries relevant to suominen s business we have implemented extensive precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees and to ensure business continuity and progress of our strategic projects during the pandemic we continuously monitor the raw material situation closely and we have identified risk mitigation measures such as utilization of supplementary raw material sources the very recent demand slowdown has naturally affected some of our customers so far we have not experienced significant issues with customer payments and hence we do not see that our customer credit risks would have materially increased we continue to monitor the financial positions and payment behavior of our customers the covid 19 pandemic has not increased suominen s risk of impairment losses on non current assets suominen s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to risks related to manufacturing competition raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits changes in legislation political environment or economic conditions and investments and financial risks a more detailed description of risks is available in suominen s annual report 2020 at suominen fi investors business environment suominen s nonwovens are for the most part used in daily consumer goods such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products in these target markets of suominen the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature north america and europe are the largest market areas for suominen in addition the company operates in the south american markets the growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points the market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre covid levels however towards the end of the second quarter especially our north american customers started to experience a sudden deceleration of demand which in combination with extraordinary stockpiling throughout the entire supply chain has created an imbalance of inventories this has impacted also suominen s orders although in several cases we have been able to benefit from our position as the preferred supplier of our customers we expect that the demand for our products will recover once this temporary imbalance is cleared our current view is that the recovery will start in the fourth quarter in europe another specific factor impacting demand has been the earlier uncertainty regarding the final formulation of the single use plastic directive supd that postponed our customers development projects and now that the formulation is clear our orders have been affected as converters and etailers seek to sell out their existing stocks events after the reporting period profit warning on august 12 2021

culley chief executive officer thanks ioana and good afternoon everyone we always appreciate you joining us on our quarterly calls the lineage team continued to execute on its aggressive business plan making significant operational and clinical progress during the second quarter most notably we delivered additional positive clinical data from our opregen program to treat dry age related macular degeneration with geographic atrophy we made substantial progress moving our spinal cord injury program toward further clinical testing we generated revenue from the first milestone payment under our new vac based cancer alliance and we even monetized some of our noncore assets i m also very happy that we have strengthened our leadership team through the appointment of kevin cook as our new chief financial officer and as ioana just mentioned kevin is joining me on the call today and i appreciate the immediate impact he s had on our organization as i say each call lineage is pioneering a new branch of medicine our approach is to manufacture differentiated cell types and transplant those cells into the body to restore or improve function which has been lost due to injury or disease simply put we believe that if retina cells or spinal cord cells are dying off or dysfunctional you need to replace those specific types of cells this regenerative medicine platform which we own is both broad and powerful not only for the value of our current indications but also because our self transplant approach might someday be applicable to a large number of different cell types and address many different unmet needs manufacturing different cell types and demonstrating their safe use in clinical trials so that they can be commercialized and reach patients is vital to our long term goal of becoming the leading cell therapy company all of our cell therapy programs use cells which we manufacture from nih approved cell lines which were established and characterized decades ago because our cells are clearly potent and have never been differentiated they can surpass the hayflick limit a principal of cellular agent the hayflick limit states that a normal human cell can only replicate 40 to 60 times before it breaks down by a programmed cell death the cells manufactured from our pluripotent cell lines can be replicated far above the ceiling simply put this means we can generate enough material to supply even the largest commercial markets without ever sourcing new material or changing our starting material that s very different from what some of the competing allogeneic companies do with adult cells or mesenchymal cells when you start with mesenchymal cells or adult cells there is a limit to how many times you can divide them before you have to obtain new starting material i don t believe the advantages which lineage enjoys in this area are fully appreciated yet but as our programs continue to advance through clinical trials and show additional promise i believe people will start to ask increasingly detailed questions about the limits of various approaches and discover that our endless supply of cells provides us with an advantage over companies which have to change their starting material every 10 100 or even 1 000 patients using the same starting cell line for the entire lifetime of a program should provide lineage with fewer regulatory complications superior quality control and of course lower lifetime costs of manufacturing these advantages of our true off the shelf platform are even greater when compared to autologous or individual patient specific approaches where a therapy is created for just a single person every bit as important as cost effective scale up our approach also avoids the risk of genetic manipulation which many of you will certainly have noticed recently has reemerged in the news due to serious unexpected safety issues associated with certain gene therapies and ophthalmology clinical trials instead of manipulating the genome and potentially causing changes which we can t track or control we utilize directed guided differentiation to manufacture ourselves with directly guided differentiation we harnessed the natural steps in the developmental pathway in order to manufacture only our desired cell types we never modify the genome as part of our manufacturing process because it simply isn t necessary our cells are tested to ensure they have the attributes needed to perform the job of the cells they are replacing without changing their genome in uncontrollable ways and to date we have never documented a single case of rejection of our cells from any of our patients even up to five years after treatment these advantages help establish our belief that our technology platform has potential not only in the indications we currently are pursuing which are valuable in their own right but also may produce additional product candidates beyond dry amd spinal cord injury and cancer and as we continue to generate encouraging data on both the safety and efficacy of our three current cell transplants will consider opportunities to investigate new applications of our technology and potentially address new or related diseases either on our own or through strategic alliances i now will turn to doing a quick review of our recent accomplishments and set some expectations for the remainder of this year i will as usual begin with opregen our lead product candidate intended to treat dry amd with ga a disease with no fda approved treatments our approach to treating this disease is to transplant healthy new retina cells to replace or support the ones that have died off or are dysfunctional replacing the entire cell avoids risks and limitations inherent in approaches that just target a single pathway which may prove to be the wrong pathway or approaches that target a certain mutation which might only be relevant to a small subset of patients i ve said many times that we believe our approach may be able not only to slow the disease process but may even be able to halt or reverse it and we now have evidence of this claim occurring in multiple patients we also believe that opregen which currently is contemplated as a one time treatment performed in about 30 minutes under local anesthesia has an enormous advantage in terms of compliance and convenience over traditional drugs being developed by competitors that require monthly or semi monthly injections since the beginning of the phase 1 2a clinical trial for opregen we have provided a cascade of positive updates from its use we believe our data set has improved with each update as the amount of evidence has grown and more and more times lapsed from the date of treatment and we intend to continue providing these interim updates moving forward in fact our next update showing with at least nine months of follow up on all treated patients is expected later this quarter as i just mentioned we have reported three separate cases of retinal tissue restoration in dry amd patients treated with opregen and specifically what this means is that outer retinal layer restoration has been observed using clinical high resolution optical coherent tomography or oct and this was evidenced by the presence of new areas of rpe monolayer with overlying ellipsoid zone external limiting membrane and outer nuclear layer which were not present at the time of baseline assessment these findings suggest integration of the new rpe cells the opregen therapy integration with functional photoreceptors in areas that previously showed no presence of any of these cells and remarkably these outcomes occurred in three out of the four patients who received their dose of opregen throughout the atrophic area rather than placing the cells away from or even adjacent to the atrophic area none of the other 20 patients received cells in this manner so we believe the correct way to measure our event rate for this finding is three out of four patients demonstrated restoration or 75 and of course the higher your event rate the easier it is to demonstrate statistical significance in the context of a clinical trial now the totality of these findings supports the view that atrophic amd is not an irreversible degenerative condition and that some portion of diseased retinal tissue may be recoverable if the right intervention is used and to our knowledge despite many hundreds of patients with dry amd and ga having been treated in clinical trials by different sponsors lineage is the only company that has shown even a single case of retinal tissue restoration and that we have three cases each one adding durability with each passing day in light of these unprecedented findings we hosted a call with therapeutic area experts to discuss the results in detail and we really encourage those who have not listened to this replay of the call to do so by visiting the events presentations section of our website in addition to retinal restoration which is an anatomical observation we also have seen functional improvements in the majority of treated patients eyes with 83 of all cohort 4 patients continuing to exhibit stable or improved best corrected visual acuity or bcva at least six months post treatment meanwhile visual acuity declined or worsened in the majority of the patients untreated eyes and to further support the anatomical restoration data and the visual acuity data we have collected we also have reported that we now have microperimetry data collected at the year 2 and year 3 post treatment study visits of one of our restoration patients and which indicated improvements in the patient s ability to discern different intensities of light this patient also experienced clinically significant improvement in visual acuity for more than two years at one point gaining 12 letters on an early treatment diabetic retinopathy scale or etdrs scale the standard assessment measurement tool altogether the data set we are collecting includes both functional and anatomical evidence which further reinforces our belief that a suspension of opregen rpe cells can generate clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with dry amd with ga and particularly in those with earlier stage atrophic disease now for those of you for whom the subtleties of the details of oct imaging and etdrs scores is a little too technical we would also just invite you to visit our website and watch the two patient testimonials we recently posted we ve realized that there is a lot of attention on competitors attempts to slow the growth of atrophy but despite hundreds of treated patients those approaches have failed to report both a structural and functional benefit to patients vision in contrast we have patients in our trial who have not simply slowed the growth of ga but actually reversed it and have benefited from an improvement in their vision at the same time looking ahead for the promising opregen program in addition to the regular updates that we provide we plan to provide additional updates at important medical conferences this year including the 54th annual retinal society scientific meeting which takes place in chicago september 29 through october 2 as well as at the 2021 annual academy of ophthalmology annual meeting the largest ophthalmology meeting in the world which takes place in new orleans november 12 through the 15th we also are working with our advisors in preparation for a meeting with the fda in the fourth quarter of this year where we intend to discuss our proposed next steps for further clinical development of opregen overall the data we have generated to date reinforces our belief that rpe cell transplants can provide outcomes beyond the reach of traditional pharmaceutical approaches which are limited to a subset of biological pathways and which may fail to provide the maximum restorative benefit available to patients we continue to work to position opregen rpe transplants as the best available option in the race to address the large unmet medical need in dry amd with ga now moving next to opc1 our allogeneic cell transplant program to treat spinal cord injuries opc1 is a one time administration of specialized spinal cord cells called oligodendrocyte progenitors which are delivered directly into the area of injury and a spinal cord patient spinal cord injuries can lead to paralysis and loss of motor and sensory functions and the lifetime cost of care for an sci patient has been estimated to be as high as 5 million but like dry amd there currently are no fda approved treatments for spinal cord injury because the material used in the prior clinical trial of opc1 by a different sponsor was not manufactured through a process compatible with late stage clinical and commercial development the lineage team needed to develop a new manufacturing process which led successfully to significant improvements in the production quality and scale of opc1 these are improvements which we expect will enhance the commercial viability of a future approved product we also developed a new thaw and inject formulation simplifying logistics and enabling investigational use broadly at any spinal cord treatment center which we expect will help accelerate enrollment for late stage clinical trials and specifically this new formulation will allow us to eliminate the dose preparation steps and the need for a specialized facility and trained staff which will reduce overall logistics of preparation from several hours in a lab to just a few minutes in the or and reduce costs by approximately 90 this new process which we developed has been established into our in house gmp facility at a scale necessary to support the next clinical trial phase and we are working through the steps to increase our production scale to eventually support commercial operations in parallel with this work we are focused on completing our manufacturing comparability plan which is intended to demonstrate that our new process has maintained the same safety and activity attributes as the material which was previously cleared by fda for clinical use at the same time that we are fulfilling these fda requirements to introduce our new manufacturing process into the next phase of clinical development we plan to initiate an interim clinical safety study of a new delivery device through our collaboration with neurgain technologies the neurgain parenchymal spinal delivery or psd system is expected to reduce a significant technical hurdle to conducting any larger scale clinical trials because it has been designed to allow for the administration of cells to the spinal cord without stopping the patient s respiration and it can accommodate our new thaw and inject formulation we currently are conducting preclinical studies in a large animal model to validate this device and we intend to submit an amendment to our investigational new drug or ind application for opc1 in the fourth quarter of this year to initiate a clinical safety study in sci patients and we have already received feedback from fda in june 20 in june of this year under the regenerative medicine advanced therapy or rmat program for such a study and as an added benefit from that fda interaction we learned that in addition to patients with sub acute injuries which are the patient characteristics treated previously we anticipate that patients with chronic spinal cord injury also will be eligible for enrollment in the safety study this larger patient population will not only provide safety and device performance data across a broader range of patients and injury types but also may aid enrollment because chronic patients are generally easier to identify and enroll than patients who would need to have had an injury within a few weeks or months prior overall these data will be more informative to the program and support further product and device development testing this new delivery system in a small study will simplify the design and execution of a subsequent controlled study introducing opc1 manufactured with our new process there are few options for sci patients to enroll in clinical trials so we believe this is an important program for the entire field of spinal cord injury and we will be working closely with the sci community to launch it on a successful trajectory now thirdly i will move to vac2 our investigational off the shelf dendritic cell cancer vaccine vac2 as many of you will recall is comprised of mature dendritic cells which we manufacture from proprietary and established cell banks which are then loaded with a tumor specific target or an antigen to instruct enhance and deploy the body s immune system about which cells it should attack and eliminate last year we exercised our option with cancer research u k to bring the vac immuno oncology platform in house and not long thereafter we reported encouraging preliminary phase 1 clinical results in non small cell lung cancer patients and in which vac2 demonstrated potent induction of immune responses providing us with additional mechanistic validation and reinforcing data obtained in the autologous vac1 clinical trials conducted previously our partner cancer research u k is responsible for this study and with enrollment impacted by covid restrictions across the u k they are still working on enrolling the final patient into this study but following completion of enrollment we anticipate additional clinical data from this study will be available and reported meanwhile our focus is on making improvements in modernizations to the vac manufacturing process which will help prepare vac2 for further trials and provide competitive advantages for any future vac programs we may design and advance this manufacturing focused investment is fairly similar to what we did successfully with both opregen and opc1 and is very core to the highest competencies at lineage as part of the manufacturing enhancement process we aim to enhance the flexibility of the vac platform because one could theoretically insert any antigen into our dendritic cells and we believe the vac platform is capable of therefore producing nearly a limitless number of product candidates with each one being distinguished by the specific antigen which the dendritic cells are carrying to the patient s immune system so this opens up a large number of potential corporate partnerships by allowing us to use our dendritic cells as carriers for other companies antigens and while simultaneously retaining the option to advance our own carefully selected antigens as an example of us implementing that exact strategy in april we announced our first collaboration for our vac platform with immunomic therapeutics or iti with whom we re collaborating to generate a novel product candidate derived from our vac platform and targeting a proprietary antigen construct provided by iti and this would be for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme as of early august we have already achieved the first technical milestone under this agreement which triggered a payment to lineage of 0 5 million and allows us to continue working toward the achievement of subsequent milestones which by the way includes another 1 5 million which we are working to receive within the next year this illustrative collaboration represents the first of many partnerships we hope to enter into with our vac platform and we believe it helps to further validate vac not only as a promising new therapeutic vaccine platform but also as an engine for partnering the early success demonstrated in our first iti collaboration provides real world validation of this approach and our plan is to leverage our technology to generate additional vac derived cell therapies for our pipeline and capitalize on the strength of lineage s recent manufacturing and cell transplant accomplishments these alliances can diversify our oncology pipeline across more programs and provide new opportunities for success without the financial burden of independent development and i ll continue with the theme of corporate partnering and add that in june we announced an option agreement with amasa therapeutics a privately held biopharmaceutical company for our hystem technology and for the development and commercialization of therapies for local treatment of solid tumors we believe that many tissue engineering and regenerative cell based therapies will require the delivery of therapeutic cells in a matrix or a scaffold for accurate placement retention and engraftment and through this agreement we have an opportunity to provide amasa with access to our clinical grade hystem material to support the development of oncology related products alongside a previously announced deal with advanced biomatrix this deal represents the second hystem related transaction we have entered into over the past two years as many of you will recall lineage has an extensive intellectual property portfolio and from it we will continue to seek opportunities to unlock value from our non core assets in june we reported that we have been added to both the russell 3000 index as well as the russell microcap index these additions reflect the continued progress we have made in establishing ourselves as a leader in cell therapy and regenerative medicine and should help us benefit from the tremendous growth that we foresee in the field of cell therapy our addition to the russell indexes can expand awareness of our corporate mission and objectives among a broader audience of investors and could help drive an increase in the liquidity of our stock enhancing our own internal market awareness efforts overall i believe we have continued to execute and generate valuable progress advancing all three of our clinical programs and further strengthening the company s capabilities so with that i m happy to now turn the financial section over to our new cfo kevin cook kevin brings lineage more than 20 years of significant strategic financial and operational experience and he has executed over 30 billion of capital raising and corporate development transactions and kevin will walk you through the financial update before joining me for our q a session kevin cook chief financial officer thank you brian and good afternoon everyone i m excited to be here and i look forward to connecting with many of you more closely in the months ahead in the meantime let s talk about some of our recent financial results total revenues for the second quarter were approximately 500 000 a 100 000 increase from the same period in 2020 the increase was due primarily to a 200 000 increase in booked collaboration revenues from the new immunomic therapeutics licensing agreement plus a 100 000 increase in royalties offset by a reduction in grant revenues resulting from the completion of nih grant activities in the prior year total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were approximately 7 5 million an increase of approximately 800 000 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily related to an increase in general and administrative expenses due to higher investor relations expenses asterias merger related expenses and other legal costs our loss from operations for the second quarter was approximately 7 1 million an increase of 700 000 as compared to the same period in 2020 this increase was mostly due to higher g a expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2021 the net loss to lineage for the second quarter of 2021 was 4 8 million or 0 03 per share as compared to 6 5 million net loss or 0 04 per share for the same period in 2020 it s important to remind investors that the variance between our loss from operations and our overall net loss is impacted by changes in the value of our investments in oncocyte and hadasit as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to lineage s international subsidiaries additionally in the second quarter we recognized a gain of 0 5 million related to the extinguishment of debt for our paycheck protection program loan which was forgiven in full while these nonoperational fluctuations are important we tend to utilize loss from operations as a more relevant measure of performance with regards to moving our clinical programs forward turning to the balance sheet the company ended the quarter with approximately 68 7 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities accordingly we continue to feel that our liquidity level provides us flexibility and funding to reach additional value creating milestones in the months and years ahead that wraps up the financial section so i thank you for your time and we ll now turn the call back over to brian brian culley chief executive officer thanks kevin we believe that the field of cell therapy is poised for explosive growth and that scalable allogeneic or off the shelf approaches have the ability to provide significant commercial advantages over autologous or patient derived methods and lineage s objective is to be positioned for the rapid growth of this emerging branch of medicine by providing evidence that off the shelf cells can generate safety and efficacy data in large commercial opportunities where small molecules have not succeeded some of the events and milestones which shareholders can look forward to include with respect to the opregen program the presentation of additional interim data from the phase 1 2a study which is anticipated during this quarter and the next quarter of this year we also plan to meet with fda to discuss further clinical development and that is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year with respect to the opc1 program in spinal cord injury we will be evaluating the neurgain psd device in both preclinical and then clinical testing we are conducting gmp production of opc1 via an improved manufacturing process and we ll be conducting release testing to support a late stage clinical trial and we have an fda interaction to discuss manufacturing improvements which is anticipated around the end of this year or maybe early next year and then just to wrap up again on the vac program we re looking for the completion of enrollment in the ongoing phase 1 study in non small cell lung cancer and then of course reporting results from that study and we will continue to evaluate new opportunities for vac product candidates based either on internally identified or partnered tumor antigens and overall we will look continue to look and evaluate partnership opportunities and ways to expand either existing collaborations or identification of nuke collaborations to fully enjoy the benefits of our platform here at lineage we re immensely proud to have the opportunity and responsibility to advance this new and exciting branch of medicine and we aim to make a profound impact on the millions of people who serve our inspiration so for those of you who would like to understand better about what it means on a personal level i really encourage you to check out the media section of our website where you can hear directly from the same patients that we aim to help so thank you very much for joining us this afternoon we appreciate your support as we position lineage to become a leader in cell therapy and transplant medicine and with that operator we are definitely ready to respond to any analyst questions which we may have questions answers operator for our first question we have kristen kluska from cantor fitzgerald your line is open kristen kluska cantor fitzgerald analyst hi good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my question brian culley chief executive officer hi kristen kristen kluska cantor fitzgerald analyst the first one i have hey the first one i have is on opc1 so with your recent announcement that chronic spinal cord injury patients will be eligible for enrollment in the study could you discuss if there will be any different clinical parameters in measuring the effect for these patients or perhaps what would be considered a meaningful result for them and then how do you anticipate the inclusion of these patients could change the addressable market opportunity brian culley chief executive officer thank you kristen for the question so the study that we will that we re planning to conduct next in for opc1 is the device study and so the objective of that study is to demonstrate not just the safety of that device but its ability to be able to successfully deliver cells into the correct location the spinal cord we intend to collect some efficacy data in that study but that s not the purpose of the study so it won t be large enough to have a lot of statistical findings but what i like in particular about the design and the inclusion of chronic patients is that chronic patients have typically plateaued you don t often see meaningful spontaneous recovery in a chronic patient so we have what i think is a very asymmetric setup to this study ostensibly we re there to make sure that we can deliver the cells to the right place in the spinal cord however if we see some sort of signal in even a non statistical signal in a chronic patient i think that opens up an incredible new and exciting area for us which would certainly have a large impact on the addressable commercial opportunity because our current expectation for this therapy is that you would want to administer it between 21 and 42 days after an injury but if we can have some benefit even a small benefit in patients that were injured three months ago three years ago 33 years ago now you get to not just include the incidence of a condition but also the prevalence of the condition so it would be multiples larger if we were able to treat and provide a benefit to chronic patients but the real advantage for us on its face is that we can we are just trying to make sure that the new system is effective and safe at delivering the cells and that we can do that in a chronic patient because it really is more of an anatomical question that we re getting an answer to rather than an efficacy question does that make sense kristen kluska cantor fitzgerald analyst yes it does thank you for that and then on opregen one of the potential benefits you ve cited outside of efficacy and safety is on durability and convenience as this treatment doesn t entail frequent injections we ve seen for other trials so i wanted to ask how long you intend to follow up with these patients in cohort 4 to determine how long the effects could be maintained in order to determine if future procedures will be needed on a couple of years basis or do you think this is really going to have to be evaluated more on an individual patient basis brian culley chief executive officer so what we plan to do with the current protocol is follow these patients for five years if we decide to make a change at some point in the future and follow them for longer that that s fine i think we would like to eventually answer the question as to what is the mean length of benefit how durable is the therapy and when you do get out to five years you re kind of assuming it s lifetime but at present we would follow these patients for five years we don t that obviously is not a clinically fungible period of time from which to build a study for the purposes of approval so thankfully the fda has conveyed to a number of sponsors that a 12 month observation period would be appropriate in the setting of dry amd so we intend to continue to collect anatomical and functional data on patients which started monthly and then it s going through quarterly and eventually to become an annual assessment but ultimately reaching out for five years but we don t intend to use five years as a clinical trial endpoint i would expect completely that we would follow the standard path of a 12 month observation period so we ll collect the data i expect that we ll continue to report that long term data but for people who are wondering which data point they should pay the most attention to the six month and 12 month data points are the ones that are the most well established as being relevant to a regulatory process kristen kluska cantor fitzgerald analyst thank you and just on that note now that you ve observed a number of patients beyond six months and you have long term follow up for many others were there any other important takeaways or observations that you think will be important as you look to meet with the fda to discuss the next steps around this program i know of course you ve highlighted the placement of the cells and the importance there and how this has translated for the cases of retinal tissue restoration but anything else you know that you found to be notable brian culley chief executive officer yeah you mentioned placement i think that s really important the other one that i think is very important is how you image the patients so the traditional way which i think is going away is to use faf which is sort of like an aerial picture the future and certainly our intended future is to use oct because you re getting a cross section you can see all of the layers almost at the level of histology you can see the cross section so for us having the ability to deliver tissue and be looking to measure the functional activity of that tissue in areas where it wasn t present you actually can t see that using faf we cannot see that using faf because our cells do not fluoresce under faf so we feel that we are in a we are aligned with the future and it s not a distant future this is more present but we are aligned with the future of how to measure and evaluate geographic atrophy and that would be to use optical coherence tomography or oct rather than faf so that s an important consideration for us going forward and i think where it s most striking is some data we have one slide that we shared not too long ago where it shows about a 30 benefit for a patient it reduces their area of atrophy by about 30 when you look at it using faf but again that s sort of imperfect aerial view when you look at the same patient at the same time points using oct you can see that their area of atrophy is unchanged that s 100 as a stopping a ceasing of growth of atrophy so clearly there s more information to be learned from using oct so i think placement of cells and i think that the measurement tool the assessment tool are really important ones other ones like the frequency of assessment some of the characteristics of patients those are a little bit more straightforward and conventional kristen kluska cantor fitzgerald analyst great thank you brian brian culley chief executive officer you bet thank you kristen operator next question we have joe pantginis from h c wainwright your line is open joe pantginis h c wainwright co analyst hey guys good afternoon thanks for taking the question i got a couple of questions on opregen and a shorter question on vac2 so first on opregen i guess i wanted to focus on do you have some feedback you can provide as to you know kol feedback or physician feedback that you ve had now that you have three patients that have shown you know restoration which has been unheard of up until this point you know that you re using for feedback ahead of your upcoming fda meeting and this is beyond say the physicians that you ve had on your recent kol events and then secondly with regard to opregen i guess you know as you re looking to your fda meeting you know your wish list what kind of endpoints are you looking for for a primary endpoint you know there s been a lot of evolution from the fda with regard to ocular endpoints you know you mentioned microperimetry before the fda is focusing on that more and more say versus bcva which has been in a lot of the wet amd study so how do you think it might play out or what s your wish list around that brian culley chief executive officer great hi joe and thank you for the question so with respect to therapeutic area experts and their input we ve been delighted with what we have heard and in some cases it s sort of extraordinary comments we re not planning to build a meeting package for fda around their extraordinary comments we ll build that around the data but the benefit for us is that this is heavily anatomical data so going in and bringing visual acuity data or patient reported outcomes data that s fine that s useful and informative but everybody knows that those assessments the tools and how they re collected they tend to be a little bit more subjective but anatomy does not change you know but for the fact that you ve got this right in the back of your eye getting bigger you can take images collect images and you can line them up exactly the same based on where vessels are and you can really see these changes and so you re able to separate from some of the let s say placebo effects of clinical assessments or separate away from some of the more subjective factors you know you ve got one data collector who you know lets the patient lean forward a few inches when they re reading the eye chart you re not allowed to do that so you know it can be difficult to get really clean data when you have some of these subjective assessments which is what puts us in such a good place with respect to going to the fda with an emphasis around retinal restoration because it s an anatomical observation for which the individual has no ability to influence you cannot regenerate retinal tissue by wishing for it playing forward etc so i think that although we have heard some really wonderful i m reluctant to even restate some of them because they re almost too much to believe but i think that although we ve heard some really wonderful comments from some thought leaders in the field in particular ones who have been very close to the data and been able to really dig into it we won t rely on that for the discussions with fda we will rely on just the pure observations there was elm here there wasn t elm six months ago where did that come from what happened six months ago that was our intervention so i don t feel that we need to rely on some of that that is the result of the data that they saw so we ll let the data do the work for us with respect to the endpoint i kind of touched on it a little bit in that answer i think the division director in ophthalmology has been quite clear that that changes in the growth rate of geographic atrophy would be an approvable endpoint i saw a competitor recently had a special protocol assessment conducted that would suggest to me that the fda is supportive of that anatomical endpoint on its face it might be viewed as a secondary marker of efficacy but it s also inevitable if that area of atrophy gets really big you will lose your vision so i think that being able to use an anatomical endpoint is where we want to be i do not want to use visual acuity and to my mind visual acuity is this amazing secondary endpoint that might give us overwhelming commercial power if we have evidence of a benefit and vision or no loss of vision compared to a control arm that is an extremely powerful talking point for commercializing an asset if that s included in the package insert but i think that our probability of clinical success and regulatory approval is really going to be driven more by our ability to halt or even reverse the growth of these atrophies and so that s where i want us to be and i think that s the best place for us to be and it s funny for me to say that because 12 months ago i had to be very vague about it i couldn t tell you if i thought we would be a ga story or a visual acuity story because we didn t have enough data we have enough data now that it s very easy to say we want to be a ga growth inhibition story with the added benefit of being able to look at a functional improvement for the patient or absence of loss for the patient either of which would be something that i have not seen the competition be able to deliver yet joe pantginis h c wainwright co analyst no no i really appreciate that and it s been nice to see the evolution of these answers and i said my question on vac2 would be a little bit shorter because i think you might be a little circumspect with regard to your answer obviously as you alluded to in your prepared comments and in prior calls this really is a platform type of technology so i guess i wanted and you ve already shown your ability to attract business development activities so i guess with that said i know you can t be qualitative can you i m sorry you can t quantify per se but maybe some qualitative type comments as to any potential in additional inbounds you ve been having on the platform brian culley chief executive officer i will be evasive about that only because i prefer you can always be close to deals and sometimes they can go away so we will communicate any additional vac2 deals after they are signed but i think it represents a very compelling growth area not only because it s oncology for which there s a lot more precedent in cell therapy and a lot of activity and interest and investor enthusiasm i mean oncology there are a lot of reasons why that s an attractive area for us but also because it does allow as i said in my previous remarks it does allow us to be able to increase our development pipeline by fractional ownership or partial ownership or joint ownership or even majority ownership with a bunch of other companies because there are literally billions of potential antigens and one of the great challenges in our field is trying to figure out which antigens would actually be the ones that are most selective and the most antigenic and so forth and their whole companies built around trying to figure out what s a good thing to stick in front of the patient s immune system to get a response so our ability to use the dendritic cells as carriers i m delighted that we have the first case of this that we ve got a partner that from which we are generating revenues and delivering against that partnership and i would be really happy to have a bunch of those so it s not the no 1 priority at the company by any means but it is a really exciting area of growth where we can capitalize on prior investments to spin out a flywheel style a bunch of new programs and maybe the others will do the development maybe we ll do the development i don t know i d love to see a combination of different structures you can even create a whole new company just around the oncology side of what we do so really the sky is the limit comes out of the conversations that we have with various parties joe pantginis h c wainwright co analyst look i really appreciate the color despite yourself described evasiveness brian but thanks a lot i appreciate it kevin cook chief financial officer thank you for the space joe thank you operator next question sir we have dane leone from rjf your line is open dane leone raymond james analyst hi thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress just one question for me could you just maybe detail what the interactions with the fda have been around opregen and what the next meeting is planned for and what s going to be discussed in that meeting thank you brian culley chief executive officer yeah of course dane thanks for the question there haven t been many the interactions that occurred shortly after i joined the company tended to be protocol amendments we introduced the new thaw and inject formulation we introduced the orbit subretinal delivery system into the protocol so we ve not had a formal end of phase 2 meeting so that s something for everyone to look forward to and it s planned for q4 of this year because it would be the first time that we would have frank discussions around endpoints study design etc so the phase 1 2a study which has now completed enrollment is essentially a trigger to go on to this next higher level of discussion so that s where we are and i think it s actually a pretty important event because it will speak to what the questions are that we will ask next from a regulatory perspective and of course from that the size of the study the cost of the study the duration of the study the importance and significance of the study all of that will precipitate out of that meeting right i hope it will so it s an important meeting for us to look forward to and prepared for dane leone raymond james analyst and is that sorry one follow up is that meeting has a set date as of now brian culley chief executive officer we have not called the meeting and we have not set what category i m sure you re familiar there s type a b c there s different categories under which you can request meetings that is work that is ongoing we re preparing our side before we set our gate but we would presumably once we have a meeting confirmed and on the calendar we would presumably make everyone aware of when that will occur so that people can anticipate that we would have some follow up from minutes etc from that meeting dane leone raymond james analyst ok so as it stands now 4q is your internal target not something actually on the calendar with that yet brian culley chief executive officer that is correct and as you know maybe some listeners don t know there s also a waiting period between when you request the meeting and when the meeting is actually granted it can be 30 60 days it can be in between that it really varies according to a number of different parameters i won t go into but just so that people know you don t just pick up the phone and say hey can i come and see you tomorrow over lunch dane leone raymond james analyst perfect thank you so much brian culley chief executive officer you bet thank you dane operator i am having no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mr brian culley for closing remarks brian culley chief executive officer well thank you and thank you everyone for joining i think we had a great quarter i m very happy about it i m excited about rejoining in our next quarterly update in the meantime we ll get back to work and keep opening the company forward thank you all very much and

thank you corey good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review tff s second quarter operations and recent highlights during the call i will provide an update on our clinical and corporate progress and then i ll ask our head of clinical development dr dale christensen to update us on the important progress we are making in our internal clinical programs following dale s remarks kirk coleman our chief financial officer will then review the company s financials for the quarter following kirk s comments dr bill williams of the university of texas at austin will provide an update on the latest r d advancements using our thin film freezing platform technology as well as an update on the expansion of our intellectual property estate finally chris cano our chief operating officer and head of business development will update us on business development and operational initiatives for the company with the value of our thin film freezing technology enabling us to expand the number of meaningful partnerships with pharmaceutical companies academic institutions and the government health agencies we ll then open up the call for your questions as we enter the second half of 2021 tff is now poised to reach several value creating inflection points in the voriconazole and tacrolimus development programs each of the therapeutic markets represent a substantial commercial opportunity for our company we estimate the yearly market potential for both compounds to be meaningful voriconazole is forecasted to take a significant share of the invasive pulmonary aspergillosis market focusing on the patient segment requiring treatment beyond 30 days for tacrolimus we have forecasted sales potential to exceed 1 billion once approved for lung kidney heart and liver transplant patients given the optimal pharmacokinetics of our inhaled formulations we are confident that both vori and tac will demonstrate efficacy and better adverse events profiles over the oral formulations currently on the market let me briefly review our progress made to date and then what investors can expect in terms of our catalysts in the second half of 2021 in july we announced the successful completion of single ascending and multiple ascending dose studies for tacrolimus later in the call dale christensen will describe the significance of these data in greater detail on why tff tacrolimus represents an exciting opportunity in the setting of lung treatment with respect to voriconazole earlier in the year we announced the successful completion of the phase one clinical trial and based on these results tff plans to study the 80 milligram dose of tff vori in the planned pivotal trial so for you the investors i want the message to be clear tff pharmaceuticals is now poised to enter 2022 with pivotal trials being conducted for our two lead internal programs each of which represents a substantial commercial opportunity at our present valuation i believe that many investors are simply not paying close enough attention to the progress we have made to date but with expected advancement of tff tacrolimus and voriconazole into pivotal testing we anticipate a positive shift in how investors perceive the value of our internal pipeline tff has two later stage differentiated proprietary drug candidates each targeting highly attractive markets with the potential to generate significant future revenues to help investors better understand the tff story we held a virtual science day event back in june highlighting our thin film freezing technology and its applications in transplants and vaccines the event featured three key opinion leader perspective dr deborah levine from ut health san antonio provided background on lung transplantation the current toxicity limitation of oral tacrolimus for immunosuppression and the potential improvements with an inhaled formulation of tacrolimus referencing of course our tff tacrolimus program dr kartik chandran from the albert einstein college of management then discussed the benefits of using the tff technology to create a dry powder pulmonary formulation for rvsv vaccine against covid 19 and dr ted ross from the university of georgia discussed his experience utilizing the tff process for creating a universal influenza vaccine for pulmonary delivery and its potential benefit over their existing annual vaccination for those investors who could not attend our science day the webcast and presentation materials for this event can be accessed on the tff corporate website as the tff development programs advance for voriconazole tacrolimus niclosamide and our antibody collaborations with augmenta bioworks we also understand the importance of building the company s capabilities to further support maturing clinical programs as part of that effort today i m very pleased to announce the formation of tff pharmaceuticals scientific advisory board we have assembled an extraordinary group of accomplished individuals who are globally recognized as thought leaders in their respective fields the members of the tff scientific advisory board are dr david kornfield dr cornfield was professor of pulmonary medicine and the director of the center for excellence in pulmonary biology at stanford university dr david denning who is a professor of infectious diseases and global health university of manchester dr anthony hickey director of the university of north carolina unc at chapel hill catalyst for rare diseases dr jay peters chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the university of texas health science center in san antonio dr ted ross professor at the university of georgia in the animal health research center center for vaccines and immunology and the department of infectious diseases dr michael saag professor of medicine and associate dean for global health at the uav school of medicine in alabama and last but not least dr drew weismann professor of medicine for the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania i m sure you will agree that this is an outstanding scientific advisory board these renowned experts share the interest in the potential of the thin film freezing technology and are excited to help contribute their expertise and guidance to help the company optimize its potential at this point in our company s growth we believe that this was the right time to have significant depth and expertise in medicine medicinal chemistry virology and the formulation sciences as we continue to advance multiple programs both internally and for our numerous and growing portfolio of partnerships the full biographies of our sab will be posted on our company website before moving on to a review of our existing partnership and business development programs i also want to share with you some important additions to the tff team in the area of manufacturing and product development dr john koleng will be transitioning from his current role as a consultant to a full time position as vice president of product development and manufacturing john has been a key contributor to tff since its inception now as the internal programs progress and the number of partnership programs increase i ve asked john to join the team in this role we have also added another key person to this group reporting to john that person is don owens who will join the company as director of product development don has an extensive background in the field of inhaled drug delivery and formulation now having reviewed the progress on our internal programs and company growth initiatives let me review the recent development in our external partnerships as you all know the tff business strategy has two elements applying the thin film freezing technologies developing products internally and then licensing those assets to partners for commercialization and then licensing access to the technology to pharmaceutical company partners to formulate their assets last quarter we highlighted our worldwide licensing agreement with union therapeutics the thin film freezing to produce both an oral and inhaled version importantly recent data from union suggests that niclosamide is effective against the new prevalent covid 19 variants tff is progressing the development of niclosamide and we ll begin the phase one program later this year just recently tff announced additional progress in our second covid 19 directed program with our partner augmenta bioworks dff and augmenta announced the selection of a lead monoclonal antibody aug 3387 which is being developed for the prevention and treatment of covid 19 similar with our union collaboration we consider our partnership with augmenta to be an important example of how our thin film freezing technology can be applied to develop proprietary therapeutics addressing a large unmet medical need in the area of public health and also demonstrates the application of the thin film freezing technology in biologics we re also pleased that catalent biologics has been selected to conduct cell line development utilizing their proprietary gpex platform and to lead drug substance manufacturing and scale up efforts for aug 3387 as the program advances through our clinical development our work with plus products on the thin film freezing versions of cannabinoids has entered into the market testing phase plus has successfully produced formulations that they determined to be ready for consumer input we expect feedback from those efforts shortly and finally our work with neurorx and greenlight is also moving forward well currently we were working with the majority of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as measured by sales in some cases on multiple open mtas at various stages our number of material transfer agreements and statements of work also steadily increases i remain highly confident in our ability to close two meaningful transactions by the end of 2021 this has been our stated annual goal for licensing transactions later in our call our chief operating officer and head of business development chris cano will provide a more detailed review of our partnership and business development activities before reviewing our quarterly financial results i want to turn the call over to dr dale christensen our head of clinical development who will give you more detail on the outstanding progress we continue to make with our programs dale dale christensen director of clinical development thank you glenn and good afternoon to everyone who has joined our update call today in the last quarter we made tremendous progress in our internal clinical development programs on our first quarter conference call i provided details about the safety and pharmacokinetic results from our phase one trial of inhaled voriconazole powder or tff vori in healthy normal volunteers these data were used to initiate a phase 1b study in asthma patients to understand if the tff vori is likely to trigger bronchospasm in patients with hyperreactive airway diseases when dosed up to the 80 milligram dose that we intend to pursue for our pivotal clinical studies despite the effects of the pandemic on clinical trials globally we continue to enroll asthma patients and have demonstrated that the 40 milligram dose was well tolerated and upon completion of the safety review of pulmonary function testing and complete clinical data dose escalation to the 80 milligram twice daily dose was approved we re currently completing the enrollment of that 80 milligram dosing cohort importantly this reactive airway study sets the stage for our pivotal studies by providing guidance on whether patients with asthma or other diseases with hyper responsive airways should be premedicated with a bronchodilator or whether this pretreatment will not be required to be clear pretreatment would not stop development because other anti infectives that are inhaled do require pretreatments but if we don t require pretreatment our label claims would be cleaner than those compounds the data generated to date suggests that we have a clear path to initiate our phase two studies and to get this moving we have begun to interact with regulatory agencies to define endpoints for the pivotal studies and will file for regulatory approvals to start treating patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by the end of the year in addition to the voriconazole results i am also pleased to report that dosing of all subjects in our phase i study of tacrolimus inhalation powder was completed successfully we have also completed the chronic toxicology study that is required by the fda for registration and we are preparing for a phase two study in lung transplant patients during our science day dr levine provided guidance that lung transplant patients undergo therapeutic drug monitoring of maintenance 12 hour trough tacrolimus levels so that they achieve blood levels of five to 15 nanograms per mill after transplant dosing to these blood levels for oral tacrolimus is required to get a high enough concentration of tacrolimus in the lung tissues to prevent acute allograft rejection in our phase one study in healthy normal subjects we dosed for a total of seven days and found that the tff formulation as inhaled tacrolimus has greater bioavailability than oral program and with a 1 milligram twice daily dose of inhaled tacrolimus the mean blood levels of the subjects in the cohort reached almost 15 nanograms per ml that s the upper limit of what s needed for successful immunosuppression in lung transplant patients we believe this ability to efficiently reach therapeutic drug levels with our tacrolimus inhalation powder dramatically reduces the risk for the program furthermore this data when coupled with the demonstrated deposition in the lung during toxicology study supports our working hypothesis that we can reduce systemic exposure to levels that are safer for the kidney and other organs while maintaining sufficient levels in the lung to prevent rejection we are currently preparing for dialogue with regulatory agencies and expect to initiate phase two study activities by the end of the year turning to our partnered programs i also want to report that tff pharmaceuticals has completed dosing and toxicology studies with our niclosamide product designed to treat covid 19 and other respiratory viral infections these data are supportive of continued development and we expect enrollment in our phase one study of inhaled niclosamide to begin in early q4 finally we also announced that we had selected a lead monoclonal antibody as part of our collaboration agreement with augmenta bioworks together with augmenta we selected catalent biopharma to manufacture the antibody for toxicology and clinical supplies and this work is ongoing with promising early results we ve also been screening for binding and neutralization of the lead antibody known as aug 3387 to measure potential efficacy against newly emerging variants as an ongoing part of the development program we were excited to find that our lead compound neutralizes the delta variant that is currently sweeping through the u s and locations around the world this exciting data underscores the critical need to accelerate development of aug 3387 which could provide a critical therapy not only for newly infected patients but for preventing infection in patients who are at high risk of covid 19 complications once infected with the sars cov 2 virus this becomes possible because the stable dry powder created using the tff process can easily be administered at home and the dose reduction that can be achieved by direct pulmonary delivery means that more people can receive the drug for every manufacturing run the stability at room temperature also means that it can be more easily distributed to places where the cold chain requirements of most biological drugs limit their availability and with that update i d like to turn the call over to chief financial officer kirk coleman for a review of the financials kirk kirk coleman chief financial officer thank you very much dale for the three months ended june 30 2021 research and development expenses for the company were 2 8 million compared to 2 6 million for the same period in 2020 the increase in research and development expenses during 2021 was due to increased preclinical activity related to niclosamide and increased clinical activity related to vori and tac the ramp up also includes our preliminary analysis and testing of dry powder formulations of several drugs and vaccines we believe have the potential to become product candidates general and administrative expenses for the three months ended june 30 2021 were 2 4 million compared to 1 3 million in 2020 the company reported net loss for the quarter of 4 7 million compared to a net loss of 3 8 million in 2020 weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted for the three months ended june 30 2021 were 25 369 144 compared with 19 071 658 for the same period in 2020 as of june 30 2021 we had total assets of approximately 57 2 million and working capital of approximately 53 9 million at the end of the quarter our liquidity included approximately 52 1 million of cash and cash equivalents and with that i d like to turn the call over to dr bill williams who will talk about some of the groundbreaking work we re doing using our thin film freezing platform particularly with large molecule biologics and how our technology is unique in its ability to successfully transform these complex molecules into an inhalable dry powder bill bill williams scientific consultant thank you kirk good afternoon everyone i am pleased to report that we have continued to advance the science and partner applications supporting thin film freeze drying this includes strengthening our robust intellectual property portfolio we have filed an international patent application based on our work on biologics and completed supporting work for three additional provisional patent applications based on our work on vaccines adjuvants and monoclonal antibodies our most recent research for providing stabilized powder forms of liposomes liposome based compositions adjuvants adjuvanted vaccines and monoclonal antibodies is key to further applications of thin film freeze drying to the stabilization and pulmonary delivery of vaccine antigens and monoclonal antibodies we have continued to publish and file intellectual property around our innovative work in applying thin film freeze drying to the delivery of low molecular weight hard to deliver drugs as well as biologics these activities are key to our continued work to differentiate improve the advantages of our process and powder characteristics to therapy as enabled by the thin film freeze drying process we were invited by the american editorial board of the journal kona powder and particle journal a high impact internationally recognized journal that publishes papers in powder science and technology we just published our paper titled the development of thin film freeze drying and its application to improve delivery of biologics as dry powder aerosols this is important recognition of our technology and its impact also our paper titled niclosamide inhalation powder made by thin film freezing multi dose tolerability and exposure in rats and pharmacokinetics in hamsters was recently published in the high impact journal international journal of pharmaceutics and the paper s findings directly support the company s efforts developing inhaled dry powder niclosamide to treat viral infections including covid 19 lastly our paper based on a research collaboration with takeda vaccines that began during a poster presentation at an aaps pharmsci 360 meeting a couple of years ago was recently published in bioarchive and recently peer reviewed by the international journal of pharmaceutics this paper confirmed that thin film freeze drying successfully transformed a liquid suspension form of a bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate absorbed onto aluminium oxyhydroxide into powders by thin film freeze drying without causing antigen loss or particle aggregation all while maintaining the potency of the antigens within a specified acceptable range notably we showed that the potency of the antigens in our dry powders was maintained in the specified acceptable range for eight weeks at 40 degrees c 75 relative humidity in a completed stability study thus confirming the potential to eliminate the cold chain requirement for transport and or storage of this adjuvanted vaccine these findings have broad applicability to other adjuvanted vaccines that we are currently working on our technology validation efforts for applying thin film freeze drying to partner compounds has been robust as highlighted by glenn and dale at a high level i d like to describe some of those efforts first our work with augmenta monoclonal antibody aug 3387 has confirmed that thin film freeze drying resulted in stable inhalable dry powders suitable for dry powder inhalation as recently confirmed the antigen binding and virus neutralization activities of this monoclonal antibody and the powders were indistinguishable from the monoclonal antibody before being subjected to thin film freeze drying these efforts will allow us to demonstrate that a sufficient dose of aug 3387 to achieve a neutralizing concentration in the lungs can be delivered using an already approved commercially available dry powder inhaler device i note that we are similarly validating other partner monoclonal antibodies with the goal of stabilizing and delivering them as dry powders next we continue to validate applications of thin film freeze drying through stabilization and delivery of partner mrna lipid nanoparticles including those for improving cold chain requirements and creation of dry powders for inhalation these studies demonstrate the benefit of the intermediate freezing rate and very small interfacial area as used in thin film freeze drying such as maintaining particle size of the mrna lipid nanoparticles and the encapsulation efficiency integrity and function of the mrna in the lipid nanoparticle as compared to those of spray freeze drying which has high interfacial area and sheer stress created during the atomization step next we have applied thin film freeze drying to various other partner peptides and proteins and confirmed their potency stability and deliverability as a dry powder including those to improve storage stability and delivery by dry powder inhalation i would like to acknowledge my colleague professor zhengrong cui for his continued commitment to our efforts to leverage thin film freeze drying to solve drug delivery problems i would also like to acknowledge the significant contributions of postdoctoral fellows chaeho moon willy sahakijpijarn and for their dedication and commitment during these most trying of times during covid i want to also thank the graduate students supported by the sponsored research agreement and technology validation agreements with tff pharmaceuticals for their scientific contributions upon which our platform as possible thank you all for your continued efforts in supporting tff pharmaceuticals and now i d like to turn the call over to chris cano chief operating officer who can update you on more of the progress the company is making in its business development and partnership efforts chris chris cano chief operating officer thanks bill and good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today as previously shared the tff business development team is focused on three key areas of growth for the company these three key areas are one growing the tff pipeline of internal development programs two our pharma partnering efforts and three our government and academic contracting efforts we continue to make great strides in each of these key areas for today s call i will be focusing on the wide breadth of different modalities where the tff technology has differentiated itself from other dry powder technologies tff continues to be very active in the mrna space we currently have 10 ongoing projects and we are in discussions with other potential companies to discuss additional mrna projects this number continues to grow we are working with pharma partners to formulate their proprietary mrna into a dry powder for some partners we are formulating a dry powder for inhalation delivering the dry powder mrna deep into the lung to treat respiratory elements for other partners we are formulating their proprietary mrna vaccines into a dry powder to form a more stable vaccine that is not subject to cold chain storage and transportation this dry powder is then quickly reconstituted for injection on site cold chain storage and transportation continues to be a tremendous challenge for many regions of the world tff also has many other nucleic acid projects underway including formulating sirna oligonucleotides plasma dna and other rna compounds into our tff dry powder these programs predominantly focus on delivery of the nucleic acid formulated as a dry powder for delivery directly to the lung to treat different respiratory diseases tff continues to be very active in the monoclonal antibody space formulating either mabs or fabs we currently have eight ongoing projects and are in discussions with other potential companies to discuss additional antibody projects the number of antibody projects is on the rise as mentioned previously we have made very good progress with our partner augmenta bioworks and we continue to build our expertise in formulating antibodies utilizing our innovative dry powder technology for delivery of these therapeutics directly to the lung the tff dry powder technology is differentiated when it comes to formulating both peptides and proteins we are currently partnered with eight different companies formulating their proprietary peptides and proteins the number of our vaccine projects continues to grow we are currently formulating numerous vaccines seven projects as of last month we are currently in the process of negotiating with usamirid in order to put a new crada a cooperative research and development agreement in place we expect the crada to be signed over the next few weeks this crada will progress one of our vaccine projects into an animal efficacy study tff is also working with four different partners on their proprietary phase products again by formulating a dry powder which after testing reflects minimal tighter loss and high viability we can deliver active phase directly to the lung on the government contracting front we continue to work very closely with leidos the prime on the darpa contract this is the first government contract for tff and we are actively pursuing additional government contracting opportunities with our academic partnerships we continue to make very good progress with ted ross at the university of georgia we are moving our universal influenza program into a second species of animal testing we previously reported our results in a mouse immunogenicity study and we are now moving into ferrets with karthik chandran at the albert einstein college of medicine we are now moving our vsv program into animal studies with drew weisman at upenn we are beginning our initial mrna formulation work and have finalized our protocols for animal testing which we expect to start in the next month in summary the tff bd team has been making tremendous progress in our partnering efforts we continue to grow the number of collaborations we have with pharma partners and we continue to expand the application of our thin film freezing technology the tff pharma team is currently working with the majority of the top 20 pharma companies and we have ongoing discussions with many others as we continue to expand our collaborative projects across the wide range of modalities from an ip perspective building our patent portfolio is a key value driver and foundational component of the tff corporate strategy as of august 1 2021 tff has 58 issued and or filed patents patent protection and exclusivity is interwoven into the fabric of everything we do at tff as we grow our company and expand our technology in closing i would like to thank our partners at the university of texas at austin with the continuing support and efforts of dr bill williams and his research team we continue to expand the applications of the thin film freezing technology into new and innovative areas of drug delivery the tff bd team is focused on closing at least two signature licensing transactions in 2021 we are very well positioned to meet this objective and we continue to foster future growth opportunities for both our technology and our company thank you for your time today enjoy your evening i will now hand it back over to glenn glenn mattes president and chief executive officer thank you dale kirk bill and chris let me conclude this call by saying that tff pharmaceuticals remain steadfast and confident in the progress we are making to build short mid and long term value for you our shareholders we are making steady progress on our internal portfolio of clinical assets and producing strong data positioning these assets for meaningful value creation remember we are a platform technology company applying thin film freezing to both internal and external opportunities our business model has already created significant opportunities that are moving ahead with purpose with numerous and diverse partners the team is intensely focused on execution of our existing programs as well as delivering transactions on the business development front my confidence level continues to grow on a daily basis as always we appreciate the support of our investors and partners and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter and with that i ll turn the call back to the operator and open it up to questions operator questions answers operator thank you and our first question comes from jonathan aschoff with roth capital partners jonathan aschoff roth capital partners analyst thanks a lot glenn i was wondering if you can tell me about how your greenlight agreement is going and how it might be energized by the recently announced stack agreement glenn mattes president and chief executive officer hi jonathan hope you re well so we generally don t make a lot of comments about the partnerships in this case i can we ve done have really good interactions with greenlight we ve worked on their materials we ve produced some really stellar results in formulation and i m actually quite excited about the fact that they ve been able to gain financing so that this gives us an opportunity when we do get to the level of a transaction we can do a meaningful transaction we don t we will not do deals where there s not meaningful economics so having greenlight funded is really a very very positive step in the relationship with them so that s moving along and even looks better now that they re funded right thanks for the question jonathan aschoff roth capital partners analyst also are you still confident in cannabis revenue in third quarter this year glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah jonathan so you get one chance and one chance only to launch a consumer brand right so we have really done a lot of formulation work with plus and right now i think we re at the point where we are in position to test these formulations and different put ups with consumers and once we have a good handle on what that reaction is assuming there s no tweaks we need to make we ll be ready to move forward jonathan aschoff roth capital partners analyst ok do i have time for a third question or should i get back in the queue glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah sure jonathan yes you do jonathan aschoff roth capital partners analyst by activities by year end 21 for vori and tac do you mean patient dosing or some earlier activity glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah so dale do you want to take that i don t want to these are your trials so i ll let you speak to those ok dale s the one that s i want to compliment dale he just doing as is the whole team jonathan an incredible job if you look at the trials the outcomes the amount that we ve been on time and on budget i think it is time to give dale and the team a real big shout out here but dale go ahead please dale christensen director of clinical development thanks glenn and thanks jonathan for yes jonathan for the question so we are doing everything we can to push into scientific advice meetings and so that we can negotiate some of the endpoints and then get our regulatory filings in place and unfortunately we re going to be doing our best to actually dose patients by the end of the year but some of that is dependent upon regulatory approvals and how various countries handle those regulatory approvals it could be pushback based on but we will file for approval and hopefully we ll have everything in place and be dosing the other thing with all of these trials as you know is that even if you have sites activated regulatory approval drug on site you may not end up with the patient ready to enroll so we re going to we ll be doing everything we can to make sure that everything is in place and we hope that those patients come this year glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah so jonathan it s in our headline right so we have some more we ll get the rad data back from on vori we ll publish the phase one data report on tac and we intend to do everything we can and we intend to be moving forward with the phase two pivotal trials by the end of the year jonathan aschoff roth capital partners analyst thank you glenn and dale glenn mattes president and chief executive officer thanks jonathan operator and our next question comes from jason mccarthy with maxim group michael okunewitch maxim group analyst hey there this is michael okunewitch on the line for jason thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress this quarter glenn mattes president and chief executive officer thanks mike michael okunewitch maxim group analyst so i d like to ask just regarding the timelines in tac and vori it looks like we re on track to enter those pivotal studies in the second half and if i recall those were supposed to be relatively short positioning potentially for filings in the first half of 22 are we still looking at that time frame and then based on the enrollment you ve seen in the phase one how should we look at the time lines for data in those glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah so we believe that we ll have the interim analysis done in the first half and the trials will probably now conclude in the second half of next year michael michael okunewitch maxim group analyst all right thank you very much then going forward it looks like we re pretty quickly approaching tac and vori crossing that finish line so i d like to ask in your view what comes next it seems like much of the pipeline is in the form of your platform collaborations so is this more so how we should think about the future of tff or do we expect to get some additional internal pipeline compounds that come on board glenn mattes president and chief executive officer great question and it speaks i think to our strategy so you re right first you think about the fact that kirk mentioned that we do have significant capital that will cover the trials that we have planned and that kurt s assumption here is also that that includes no which is a really extreme assumption no internal revenue no generation from our transaction so we yes we plan on identifying other internal portfolio opportunities and if you look at our last transaction it was a co development with augmenta right so in that transaction we agreed to share the cost of the preclinical and clinical work through phase one and then look for a partner going forward so i m not saying definitively that we do more transactions like that but it could be some of those it could be something we would take on but we are as i said in the script we are a drug development company and we ll develop those apply the technology to either internal assets or partner assets and we ll keep churning so this is i think the quintessential short mid and long term value creation opportunity here and if you listen to chris the partner programs are growing dramatically we ve increased the patent portfolio now to 58 i think the last time we reported 45 so this is just it s just really it s just accretive every day in terms of how many more opportunities but yes to answer your question surely we will look to add to the internal portfolio either with partner programs or programs that we would do by ourselves michael okunewitch maxim group analyst all right thank you very much and then just one more for me and i ll hop back in the queue so sometime last summer you were discussing a tff formulation of remdesivir we haven t heard much on that recently but the reason i m bringing it up is because gilead recently stopped developing their own inhalable remdesivir due to deposition challenges so what i d like to ask is were you able to get lung deposition with your remdesivir formulation and as we thought of as a prime example of just how difficult dry powder inhaled formulation can be and the value of the tff platform glenn mattes president and chief executive officer i m going to give this off to the man who did the work and it s dr williams so bill could you comment here bill williams scientific consultant yes yes thank you glenn yes so we have shown in multiple rodent models one of which was hamster and that s the preferred infection model for covid we showed very good deposition in the lungs and we modeled it in the two papers that are or the one paper i referenced in the script so we believe we can do it gilead to the best of our knowledge was testing a liquid form and it does it goes to show you that these inhaled drugs they are difficult the formulations are difficult we spend every waking hour trying to figure these out and we believe with the remdesivir we nailed it and up through animals at least so great question and thank you michael okunewitch maxim group analyst all right thank you very much glenn mattes president and chief executive officer that is a great example of just how broad the application is here and we actually think we it has to be tested right but we solved their problem at least in terms of drug in getting to position is it an effective therapeutic that only would remain to be seen here but bill i think solved the formulation problem michael okunewitch maxim group analyst yeah thank you very much glenn mattes president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from mayank mamtani with b riley securities sahil kazmi b riley securities analyst hi good afternoon team this is sahil kazmi on for mayank thanks for taking our questions maybe just a brief one for glenn kind of going off the last question nice to see the progress across the tac and vori programs and looking forward to see those trials start but as you kind of think beyond that it would be great if you could opine on any thoughts you had on the philip morris vectura transaction that closed today how do you think about kind of expanding the platform into that consumer space including your discussion with plus products etc glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah so mayank i mean obviously we ve watched the philip morris interest in in delivery companies as i sit here today we re certainly focusing on execution and moving our business forward and certainly we ll always be opportunistic but more importantly i think we re just going to our focus is on creating value for the shareholder if that moves on to some other opportunistic activity so be it i think sum of the parts here right now are perhaps worth more than the whole but that remains but i think that s getting closer it s kind of catching up to it because some of the whole is starting to look pretty good so we just we come to work every day thinking about moving the needle forward and closing more partnerships etc so i think that s the best way i can answer that question did i answer the whole question or is there a second part to that sahil kazmi b riley securities analyst no no that s very helpful and then maybe just a quick follow up is do you have any deal sheets that you re reviewing right now that you can talk about glenn mattes president and chief executive officer the answer is yes and i can t talk about them i don t think you d want me too because we will we re looking to create meaningful economics and hopefully these discussions will result in that and when we have the deal signed we ll report it but we re at all levels with these partnerships that chris described in vitro in vivo and term sheet sahil kazmi b riley securities analyst great thanks a lot thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the progress glenn mattes president and chief executive officer thanks so much i appreciate that say hello to mayank for me ok sahil kazmi b riley securities analyst absolutely operator and our next question comes from daniel carlson with tw research group daniel carlson tailwinds research analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress first off glenn on tacrolimus the clinical pk data release so far shows that the drug can reach blood levels needed for systemic immunosuppression and i m wondering if you have reason to believe that you can lower the dose for lung transplant patients to a level closer to what is used in the other transplants like heart liver and kidney glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah i guess we are going to go to dale dale could you take that one please dale christensen director of clinical development yeah thanks glenn and thanks dan for the question so to date as you mentioned we have the clinical pk data that shows that we can reach that upper limit the 14 15 range with a low dose we re getting about 80 bio availability in our 26 week toxicology study what we ve demonstrated is that we can achieve about three to four fold higher levels of the drug of tacrolimus in the lung tissue compared to the blood and so what that gives us is the ability to when you dose from an oral perspective or from an oral route you have to push the blood levels high enough to get enough into the long to prevent the rejection in the lung tissue itself but because we have a higher blood level or a higher tissue level from the inhalation we can reduce the blood level and still have that same or more in the lung tissue and so we think that essentially this is like topically delivering it right to the site where it needs for the immunosuppression and then we can reduce the systemic level down to levels that would be protective of the kidney daniel carlson tailwinds research analyst got you ok that s helpful thank you switching gears your augmented tff lead has shown activity against the delta variant and i m wondering if you ve tested against the new delta plus variant that fauci has mentioned recently glenn mattes president and chief executive officer ok go ahead dale i think that s going to be for you also dale christensen director of clinical development ok thank you again a very good question so the delta plus that has been mentioned it has the full complement of mutations that are in the delta variant but it s also picked up this k417 n mutation and that k17 or k417n mutation was also in the beta variant that was first identified in south africa last year and we already have data showing that aug 3387 works against the beta variant so we have strong reason to believe that 3387 will work on the delta plus and we re again as each of these new variants emerge it takes there s a lag time in being able to get all the reagents to perform that testing but that is something that will be coming up daniel carlson tailwinds research analyst ok great and then glenn can you talk a little bit more about your relationship with catalent glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah actually i m glad you picked up on that daniel so we re very pleased that catalent is obviously one of the leading in fact the leading cmo especially in the area of biologic so the fact that we have catalent on board to help produce augmenta the map is a great signal because they now become a provider of manufacturing gmp materials and beyond that can help us satisfy the needs of our maturing discussions with partners right so there s an evolution here we ve never talked about manufacturing before right so we weren t kind of except for our internal pipeline which was satisfied with the relationships we have with corex and but now you re into this whole sort of biologics sterile product environment right which is really being the genesis of that is all of the partnerships that chris described in those categories so getting catalent on board is really critical because we need to develop capacity and expertise to start producing products as these products get into animal testing and beyond especially even in the sterile environment so to me in running this business holistically and looking at the life cycle and the evolution of the business that s a great they re a great partner and i think it s frankly to the investor that should be signaling something and it is so i think that congratulate for bringing up on that i generally don t like to be use a lot of hyperbole but putting mentioning catalyst i think it should is a signal to just where we are in the life cycle especially on the biologic daniel carlson tailwinds research analyst yeah no they re great so congrats on that and then one last question for me if i could is i know your vaccine work would help relieve cold chain issues and a company that has been working over in africa on some vaccines is dyadic and i m wondering if you ve done anything in conjunction with them at all glenn mattes president and chief executive officer ok well i had permission from their ceo to say this so mark emalfarb i want to congratulate mark on his transaction with sorrento which again is good i think because it now gives mark some capital to do something so we have successfully formulated a vaccine candidate and i think it s just now we have the opportunity i think to really hopefully again i think hopefully and hypothetically look at how and if we can move that project project daniel carlson tailwinds research analyst great ok well congrats on the progress glenn mattes president and chief executive officer we don t comment on who all these mdas are with no 1 a lot of companies don t want us to in the case with mark because we are close with mark we feel comfortable disclosing that we have a relationship with them daniel carlson tailwinds research analyst yeah ok well thanks guys appreciate it i ll jump back glenn mattes president and chief executive officer right maybe we have time operator for one or two more questions if there are any others operator and that question will come from richard deutsch with national securities richard deutsch national securities corporation analyst yeah thanks for taking my call and if you don t mind a little pun here your presentation is just breathtaking i really heard such a detailed broad and incredible presentation especially for what you ve done in the last quarter it s phenomenal i got a couple of questions first of all i thought i heard you say out of the business deals that have been percolating for a while did you say you actually put out finished term sheets that are under review right now glenn mattes president and chief executive officer we have we do have term sheets in place with some partners and richard i just want to be really clear it doesn t mean that we re going to get transactions done with these partners but we are in the term sheet stage richard deutsch national securities corporation analyst ok glenn mattes president and chief executive officer and look i wanted to say and why wouldn t you do a deal well maybe the economics won t be right ok and or something happens in diligence but yes i want to put a big qualifier on that so people don t single out you said you re going to get a deal done in two weeks we do have some term sheets and we are and that s good richard deutsch national securities corporation analyst all right well i mean you ve got a term sheet out there that you re happy with money is it s all a matter of it going further glenn mattes president and chief executive officer i m saying we re happy with them either because we do have term sheets ok richard deutsch national securities corporation analyst ok and the other thing glenn mattes president and chief executive officer you can count on me and my team to get if there s a deal to be done to get it done in a value creating way richard deutsch national securities corporation analyst yeah well if you give them the ring and all they got to do is accept that s pretty much progress one other thing i ve got a whole list of all your projects which are as everybody can hear more numerous than anybody can deal with but there s some very very short term things that are coming up when do you expect or have you heard about orphan drug status for tacrolimus glenn mattes president and chief executive officer we actually have orphan drug status already for tacrolimus that was i guess about a year ago or so that we actually received yes richard deutsch national securities corporation analyst then i misspoke i m looking for vori then aren t you glenn mattes president and chief executive officer vori yes we are in the process of applying for the orphan designation for voriconazole richard deutsch national securities corporation analyst and what s the time frame on that glenn mattes president and chief executive officer yeah i don t want to say specifically again i don t want to give everybody

doubling down on dual releases disney boss bob chapek is standing up for the company s movie distribution model in the wake of a lawsuit filed against the studio by scarlett johansson chapek reportedly spoke with investors and analysts during an earnings call on thursday where he addressed disney s dual distribution plans which involve releasing films in theaters and on disney at or around the same time deadline reports this model of release was one reason for johansson s lawsuit after black widow dropped off in earnings significantly following its debut the actress claimed in the lawsuit that releasing on both platforms was a breach of contract chapek didn t mention johansson or black widow by name during the conference call but reportedly explained we value flexibility in being able to make last minute calls he also said that during the studio s initial plans to release films in theaters once more they didn t anticipate the resurgence of covid chapek said that he and former disney ceo bob iger who is now the chairman of the board for the studio determined that hybrid distribution was the right strategy to enable us to reach the broadest possible audience amid the pandemic he also explained that the strategy would be a viable option for the studio in the future distribution decisions are made on a film by film basis chapek said we will continue to utilize all options going forward chapek also addressed concerns with fair compensation for actors when it comes to releasing films on disney instead of solely in theaters and reportedly claimed we ve found ways to fairly compensate our talent so that no matter what everyone feels satisfied johansson who stars as natasha romanoff in the latest marvel film is suing disney for intentional interference with contractual relations and for inducing breach of contract she is also demanding a jury trial johansson alleges in the docs which were submitted to the los angeles superior court late last month that the simultaneous release of black widow in theaters and on disney was a breach of contract the actress claims in the docs that she agreed her compensation for starring in black widow would be largely based on box office receipts generated by the film and agreed to a theatrical release exclusive to movie theaters in order to maximize her pay there is no merit whatsoever to this filing a walt disney company spokesperson said in a statement to et the lawsuit is especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the covid 19 pandemic disney has fully complied with ms johansson s contract and furthermore the release of black widow on disney with premier access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the 20m she has received to date john berlinski johansson s attorney also released a statement to et reading it s no secret that disney is releasing films like black widow directly onto disney to increase subscribers and thereby boost the company s stock price and that it s hiding behind covid 19 as a pretext to do so but ignoring the contracts of the artists responsible for the success of its films in furtherance of this short sighted strategy violates their rights and we look forward to proving as much in court the statement continued this will surely not be the last case where hollywood talent stands up to disney and makes it clear that whatever the company may pretend it has a legal obligation to honor its contracts for more on johansson s involvement in black widow check out the video below updates on celebrity news tv fashion and more sign up by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy related content

the impact of this summer s drought across the prairies could be felt by canada s cattle sector for the next two to three years according to market watchers with consumers continuing to face high beef prices hot dry weather has strained pastures and hampered hay production at a time when farmers are usually producing feed for winter feed costs have spiked as a result the situation has ranchers weighing the difficult decision to sell their cattle early with potentially large numbers expected to be sold to slaughter if the drought results in smaller herds it could keep beef prices already high due to strong demand elevated with fewer cattle coming to market over the next couple years if you sell cattle due to a drought it takes you two or three years or more to rebuild that supply chain and rebuild those supply numbers said analyst brian perillat of canfax a division of the canadian cattlemen s association that tracks cattle market data that sort of medium term outlook is continued high beef prices assuming this demand in north america and internationally remains strong so you just don t see much relief down the line for consumers any time soon if cattle herds shrink this summer it could keep beef prices high for the next couple of years as the supply chain recovers j scott applewhite the associated press the summer s drought has been widespread stretching from northwest ontario to b c pasture and forage conditions continue to deteriorate across western canada and a large area of the u s said livestock market analyst jason wood with alberta agriculture and forestry in a report thursday prices on the rise since january the drought comes as north american consumers have seen beef prices rise with growing demand as pandemic related public health restrictions ease and restaurant dining opens up statistics canada s monthly average retail food price data shows the cost of several popular cuts of beef largely increasing from the start of the year through june the average price of a sirloin steak according to the data climbed from 22 68 per kilogram in january to 24 34 kg in june an increase of more than seven per cent economists have said rising demand isn t the only factor driving price increases at the grocery stores also pointing to covid related supply chain issues and the canadian dollar but even if more ranchers sell their cattle on the market in the coming weeks analysts aren t expecting beef prices to tumble due to strong domestic and international demand if there is a silver lining to the increased liquidation of cattle due to the drought it is that demand remains strong for beef said farm credit canada economist leigh anderson in an email dry hot weather has hit pastures and hampered hay production at a time when farmers are usually producing feed for winter resulting in a spike for feed costs bonnie allen cbc in addition rising cases in the u s has spurred consumers wholesalers and restaurants to stock up on beef as concerns over potential restrictions surface again he said strong demand is likely to support consumer prices even with the marketing of additional cattle anderson said one potential wild card for consumer prices of beef is the direction of the pandemic a fourth wave could disrupt either supply or demand or both impacting prices in either direction export demand high according to canada beef which helps market the country s beef and cattle sector beef exports are up 18 per cent this year as of june i don t see anything on the global horizon that s going to change demand said michael young the agency s chief executive demand will remain high but domestic beef prices are unlikely to march much higher without a consumer response cautions sylvain charlebois senior director of the agri food analytics lab at dalhousie university in halifax higher beef prices could lead shoppers to seek other sources of protein he said noting that beef prices are up about eight per cent overall from the start of the year the thing about meat counter economics though is that there s not a whole lot of space anymore to move up because you re likely to spook consumers charlebois said they just could walk away from the category altogether and consider either the other two components of the meat trifecta pork and chicken or they actually just could go on and buy a plant based or another source of protein

interview ceo of development partners international dpi runa alam talks about the history of pan african private equity the potential for institutional capital to drive the continent s development and the role of the prosper africa initiative in catalyzing two way trade and investment between the united states and african nations from the time she was a teenager alam knew she wanted to do work that brings private capital into emerging markets as a means to reduce poverty even in the 1970s i realized that most capital sits in the private sector and without that capital coming into countries that need development they are not going to develop she says in 2007 alam founded dpi a leading pan african private equity firm and long term investor dpi works closely with the management and entrepreneurs of their portfolio companies to create value and drive impact dpi s hands on investing strategy is extremely granular according to alam we work with the management teams ceo coo and lots of other people up and down the hierarchy with a view to achieving high returns and simultaneously high impact investment firms like dpi that focus on impact investing and environmental social and corporate governance esg investing are driving positive social and environmental change across africa however nothing has the potential to impact africa s development like increasing the amount of institutional capital including from pension funds and insurance companies throughout the continent tell me about your experience working with pan african equity funds my interest in working in emerging markets started when i was a teenager so i studied development economics as an undergraduate and went on to business school then for the next 20 years i had a front row seat watching that huge shift towards private sector development leading to job creation betterment of life and poverty reduction in the 1990s a number of things happened the berlin wall came down and the cold war ended the last of the african countries that were not yet independent became independent and the all race elections in south africa had led to the election of nelson mandela with all these things coming together development institutions asked themselves the question how do we develop this continent what s the bigger vision and the long term plan and they realized that a lot of the gdp in those countries was sitting with governments and government activities the development institutions thought we need to grow the private sector we can leverage our money by creating many fund managers using the private equity model from developed countries modifying it for africa and helping create or grow african companies if those companies become bigger then they will have more jobs and it will lead to development for me the interesting thing that has happened over the last 20 years is the increased focus on impact and esg twenty years ago the only talk i heard about impact investing and esg was in africa because when the development institutions put up their money with the private equity fund managers they put impact and esg requirements in the contracts so in africa we ve been doing this work for years which is something that a lot of investors from developed countries don t understand from the beginning we had to have returns and impact work within esg frameworks so over the years we ve become better and better at it prosper africa women entrepreneurs at a u s state department event how can an increase in allocations from institutional investors change the equity investment landscape in africa what impact could such investments have on the people living there it is the holy grail full stop most money most capital in the world lies in the private sector most invested money lies in the pension fund systems the sovereign funds and endowments and most of that money is in the u s accelerating u s pension fund money endowment money foundation and family office money into africa can transform the whole continent if it is done well through the right companies and with responsible fund managers then this will catalyze the continent africa today is in a place where the basics are there in most of the countries there is an entrepreneurial mentality look at nigeria technology companies are doing extremely well there throughout africa there are ecosystems of startups there are 23 stock markets there are business schools across the continent and the returning diaspora with great educations from top business schools in the world wharton harvard and elsewhere africa s got the energy all there as to what the possibilities could be in many parts of africa there have been several rounds of democratic elections and decent governance is there more to go absolutely and that is part of development but the basics are there now and if you bring in the money and invest it properly it will have a huge huge impact in africa on average one job supports 20 people that s not really true in the u s so sometimes what we do has an impact on many more people s lives than it would in the u s why is co investment between american and african pension funds a strong investment strategy co investment amongst american pension funds and african pension funds is an extremely positive thing what do they gain the african pension fund can interact with the american cio and the pension fund staff who have been investing in private equity for decades it provides a lot of expertise to draw from a lot of learning as i always say the problem with private equity is that it s private you can go out and read things and you can take a course but the reality is everybody learns through the experience of actually investing for an african pension fund to have access to pension fund investors who ve been doing this for decades and have gained expertise in best practices and the risks to look out for that is invaluable on the other hand as american pension funds go into a new continent there s this fear do we really know who the right managers are who the right companies are the local pension funds would know that they would know the right entities to invest with if something happens and a negative news item appears in the newspapers the local pension funds would understand whether it is important or not they can give perspective to the american pension fund manager as to why this is worrying and what to do about it or if this isn t worrying and it is just something that s written but it doesn t matter so african pension fund managers can provide the local expertise and american pension fund managers can provide their private equity investment experience prosper africa an example of manufacturing capabilities can investments in africa have positive impacts on developed countries absolutely fund managers who do impact and esg work must also return competitive internal rates of return so a pension fund should not have to choose between its pensioner s livelihood and doing good things and i think in africa because of our history of having to deliver high returns and impact we fund managers already think that way and we are all working to deliver that one of the big benefits of investment is getting a return from africa investing in africa can also be a hedge because the macro cycles in africa move more along the commodity cycles rather than how the u s is doing they re exporting to the u s so if that market strains those economies or countries have problems in africa not so much on top of that africa like any other part of the world is a consumer market there are people there a third of africa is middle class and that third is growing so the consumer market is growing why is it that china is investing so much time and money in africa yes they are looking at natural resources but they also see africa as the future for the products that they manufacture as africa grows its income level grows and chinese products will already be there and they will become household names people are going to grow up with them and they re going to go back to them african multinationals and african investors must think the same way it is a very young population the average age is 19 5 it is the second fastest growing continent in the world after asia there s a huge future there for african investment of all sorts whether it s corporate institutional or even american entrepreneurs going there to create businesses in partnership with africans it is a continent that cannot be ignored how can the u s government encourage private investment particularly institutional investment into the continent usaid s work with mida advisors in support of prosper africa is invaluable possibly more

local investment landscape things that are far away and unknown bring forth a lot of risk adverse reactions and a lot of anxiety which is normal however how does one take that first step towards

africa usaid and prosper africa are helping investors take that step and being able to get on the ground in africa has changed the view of so many cios continuing this work and maybe expanding like to family offices that are small and can t afford the trip that is the number one thing they can do this interview has been edited for clarity and length

customers entering the market with decades of potential activity ahead but this has been a boom unequally spread across the market for smaller and mid sized firms which currently account for 90 of the american market that future looks decidedly more treacherous the latest finra statistics set the scene in a ten year span the number of registered brokerage firms has dropped 25 to 3 435 that means since 2010 over 1 100 firms have either closed down been acquired or merged with other firms for smaller participants the threat of going out of business is very real but consider the roman

and behaviors this shift was no more evident than during the height of the covid 19 pandemic restricted to activities from home and easy access online investing platforms a new generation of investors turned to stock market volatility to generate income many of these investors certainly the loudest ones used complex financial instruments such as options and bragged about investments on online communities such as reddit this is not necessarily the demographic or behavior of the future regulators may tamp out some wilder strategies while changing market conditions mean chasing the vix isn t necessary a sustainable strategy but what the maelstrom of last spring created was a new group of people open to learning how to invest and with evolving needs around financial advice many of those
