by kevin nicholson cfa global fixed income cio co head of investment committee summary fixed income more of a treat than a trick for yield seeking investors in our view we expect a shift from equities to fixed income with yields above 4 for income investors 4 or higher risk free rates align with many financial plan distribution rates it is halloween a time when we dress up in costumes and lose ourselves in whatever character we have chosen as our alter ego for the day for some observers this is a time to trick others into thinking they will be rewarded for their efforts and for others it is a time to reap the benefits of their efforts with treats in our view halloween 2022 is shaping up to be a good time to evaluate whether the bond market is going to trick investors into believing that prices will stop falling and that the treat of sustainable higher income has finally arrived the lost decade not just a stock phenomenon content continues below advertisement it has been commonplace to speak of the lost decade for stocks the period from december 31 1999 to december 31 2009 when the total return of the s p 500 was down 9 08 while bonds have not suffered the same fate from a return perspective the asset class has been de emphasized in asset allocations for a decade as the 10 year treasury fell from 3 8 in 2009 to a low of 0 5 in 2020 low rates resulted from quantitative easing qe by the fed where large amounts of bonds were purchased to drive down yields and encourage investors to take risk again after the great financial crisis gfc this process created asset inflation sending home values and stocks soaring as investors cash looked for a home qe did its job from an economic perspective but as bonds appreciated yields fell bonds no longer gave investors adequate income thus driving millions of investors to take on more risk through equities to fill the income void we believe that may all be changing bonds offer fixed income opportunity to lock in more attractive distributions with yields of short and long maturity bonds yielding near 4 or better starting with 3 month t bills we believe there could be a large asset shift from stocks to bonds in the coming years many financial planners model a 4 annual distribution rate in their financial plans to address clients spending needs in retirement since the gfc those distributions have relied predominately on the total return of stocks rather than from bonds as stocks have returned an annualized 13 66 versus 2 25 for bonds the disparity in returns between stocks and bonds forced investors to take on more stock exposure than typically expected in a 60 40 portfolio however over the last year treasury yields have risen dramatically as indicated in the chart to the right of the 10 year treasury while this has been devastating to bond returns over the last year marking the trailing 12 months as one of the worst for government bonds in us history this acute weakness has sown the seeds for a brighter future for bonds going forward in our opinion historically as investors approached retirement age their allocation to bonds increased reflecting their lower risk tolerance however for more than a decade that has not necessarily been the case in 2019 54 1 million americans ages 65 and older who if they can receive a risk free 4 return in government bonds or even higher yields in high quality corporate bonds are less likely to want to take added risk from stock ownership in our opinion rather we think investors will want to protect their sizable stock gains over the last decade by swapping from stocks into bonds the options for fixed income as of october 28 2022 the s p 500 dividend yield is 1 70 and the bloomberg aggregate bond index yields 4 94 which is a significant spread this is a significant increase from a year ago when the index yielded a mere 1 66 and the dividend yield on the s p 500 at the time was 1 29 the bloomberg aggregate index a widely followed index meant to track the overall performance of the us investment grade bond market is comprised of treasuries agencies mortgage backed securities corporate bonds and asset backed securities by incorporating more than just treasuries in a portfolio investors can get a higher yield if they are willing to take on some incremental risk the full breakdown of the bloomberg aggregate index is shown to the left conclusion we believe bonds are finally offering investors attractive yields especially when compared to the dividend yield on stocks hence we see the value of adding bonds back to portfolios for investors needing income while we understand that the fed is not done with its rate hiking cycle we believe that it is closer to the end than the beginning furthermore we believe that bond prices have already anticipated some further rate increases by the fed for all the reasons discussed in this piece we are opportunistically looking to add fixed income to the balanced portfolios thus we believe that bonds yields are a treat for investors that have been getting tricked for the past decade or more risk discussion all investments in securities including the strategies discussed above include a risk of loss of principal invested amount and any profits that have not been realized markets fluctuate substantially over time and have experienced increased volatility in recent years due to global and domestic economic events performance of any investment is not guaranteed in a rising interest rate environment the value of fixed income securities generally declines

sacramento calif ap california s plans to reduce the nation s largest homeless population aren t good enough democratic gov gavin newsom said thursday prompting him to halt 1 billion in state spending for local governments as he seeks to reset the state s strategy ahead of his expected second term in office california s homeless population likely higher than the 161 000 people estimated in 2020 is one of the state s most pressing and public problems as the high cost of living has only increased the size and number of homeless encampments that dot cities throughout the state for decades california s state government has viewed homelessness as a local issue handing cities and counties tens of billions of dollars to design and run programs aimed at getting people off the street and into permanent housing that included a recent commitment by state lawmakers to spend 15 3 billion over the next three years but the state s homeless population seemed to grow in concert with increased state spending frustrating officials california s counties 13 largest cities and groups of homeless service providers were in line to receive about 1 billion in state homelessness spending but only if they submitted plans on how they would use the money to reduce the number of unsheltered homeless people on thursday newsom declared those plans were simply unacceptable as they would collectively reduce the state s homeless population by just 2 over the next four years he said he would pause spending until after a meeting with local officials this month to review the state s collective approach to homelessness at this pace it would take decades to significantly curb homelessness in california newsom said in a news release everyone has to do better cities counties and the state included we are all in this together local leaders were not happy now is not the time to play politics when people s lives are at stake said carolyn coleman executive director and ceo of the league of california cities failing to release state funding will not put roofs over the heads of californians or deliver desperately needed supportive services sacramento mayor darrell steinberg said he shared newsom s frustration but that his city needed the funds to maintain more than 1 100 shelter beds in oakland mayor libby schaaf who leads a coalition of mayors of the state s 13 largest cities said her city followed the state s process as instructed in san jose the 10th largest city in the u s with more than 1 million residents mayor sam liccardo said if newsom wanted to be bold in solving the homeless crisis he would dedicate 10 of the state s recent historic budget surpluses to build housing and require homeless people to take permanent housing when it is offered among other reforms let s put down the megaphones and pick up the shovels liccardo said in the state legislature senate republican leader scott wilk criticized newsom for taking too long to act while democratic assemblymember jim wood said he wholeheartedly applaud s the move the money is not going to go very far and you re not going to make much of a dent unless you figure out a different way to do things wood said a common plea echoed by mayors and advocates for the homeless was the need for dedicated funding so cities and counties can plan ahead and ramp up the number of people they expect to help chione flegal executive director of housing california said 1 billion sounds big but it s a drop in the bucket relative to the incredible need folks are facing she said there also needs to be massive investment in public health affordable housing stock and the social net to really solve homelessness newsom is running for reelection this year and is likely to win a second term as he faces a little known republican state senator but newsom s political future including a possible run for president could be complicated by california s persistent homelessness crisis since taking office in 2019 newsom has been more aggressive in setting and enforcing a statewide homelessness policy in 2019 the newsom administration sued the southern california city of huntington beach accusing local officials of ignoring the state s affordable housing requirements earlier this year the newsom administration launched a first of its kind investigation of san francisco s housing policies aimed at figuring out why it takes officials there so long to approve housing projects and last month the newsom administration and the state attorney general joined a lawsuit against the city of anaheim alleging officials there violated state housing laws in the past year the newsom administration says it has cleared 1 600 homeless encampments cleaning up 2 227 tons of trash enough to fill more than 40 olympic sized swimming pools he also signed a new law that will let judges force some homeless people into treatment a controversial proposal opposed by civil rights advocates who say it goes too far advocates for the homeless say compelling treatment when there are not enough beds or services and cleaning up encampments will not seriously reduce the number of unhoused people in california people experiencing homelessness are not garbage to be thrown away flegal said ___ har reported from san francisco

to carvana s third quarter results which featured falling sales higher unit and a material exhaustion of cash secured borrowing capacity may be available but we believe equity holders also face

in below expectations at 3 39 billion compared to estimates of 3 71 billion according to refinitiv while the company is continuing to pursue cost cutting actions we believe a deterioration in the used

between mega cap tech stocks and the rest of the market a massive bifurcation is underway between mega cap technology stocks and the rest of the market says andrew slimmon senior portfolio manager at morgan stanley investment management many popular technology stocks have sold off sharply in recent days on disappointing earnings results and forecasts despite the downdraft in their valuations slimmon says to steer clear of many of these names as earnings need to come down most are also trading at a premium to the rest of the market instead slimmon points investors to stocks he s confident will continue to make their numbers even in a slowing economy these sectors have also cut estimates and trade at low teen or high single digit multiples one area he views positively is home building stocks and home retailers that have been adversely affected by mortgage rates but are expected to recover from current levels those groups really started to break down in the fourth quarter last year

black men fell in october but for the wrong reasons the unemployment rate for black men fell to 5 3 in october from 5 8 a month earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis but it wasn t because the group was necessarily getting ahead in the labor market the downward motion in unemployment for black men is likely due to the labor force participation rate which dipped slightly to 67 2 in october just

that is incredibly tight with an unemployment rate below 4 she said so for the fed to cool off this economy the biggest hurdle right now is the labor market the fed may need to pivot to the housing market or other financial conditions to fight inflation as the job market shows continued signs of resilience she said samantha subin jobs report should support a 50 basis point hike in december says lpl financial s krosby despite a rise in hourly earnings october s jobs report should put a 50 basis point hike in focus come the federal reserve s december meeting said lpl financial s quincy krosby

report suggests more work is ahead for the federal reserve says rusty vanneman chief investment strategist at orion advisor solutions the october jobs report likely wasn t what the fed wanted to see he wrote while the news is good for consumers the labor market remains strong and wages are increasing these numbers don t suggest inflation is likely to slow at the rate the fed is looking for he noted that payroll growth was also higher than expected and further suggests that jobs remain plentiful and companies continue to hire payroll growth was stronger than expected this month and last month s growth was even revised higher while the unemployment rate may become part of the political conversation it is that season it s still a strong number and one that s not likely to rise much

while economists surveyed by dow jones expected just 205 000 average hourly wages grew by 0 4 versus estimates for a 0 3 increase there s no obvious sign that the labor market is cooling off that

in georgia this summer a fake wanted poster falsely identified a woman as a so called ballot mule in arizona voters dropping off their ballots complained about being photographed and filmed in some cases by people carrying weapons the incidents appear inspired by a film 2 000 mules that spins a wild tale of how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen from donald trump at its heart is a conspiracy theory claiming democratic groups are colluding with paid operatives the titular mules to stuff ballot drop boxes with fraudulent votes there s no evidence for any of this the film which is directed by right wing commentator dinesh d souza and relies on data and analysis from controversial election group true the vote has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked by fact checkers and rejected by law enforcement but the film is the latest in a long line of movies that use the tropes and signifiers of documentaries to gain credibility in recent years documentary style films about the 2020 election the covid 19 pandemic and vaccines have spread conspiracy theories and recycled debunked lies documentaries have been used for decades to try to make bad actors and folks who are trying to push conspiracies or push disinformation or push a specific political agenda look more professional look glamorous look like something that you can believe said jiore craig head of elections and digital integrity at the institute for strategic dialogue which tracks online extremism debunked and embraced one of the people identified as a mule in 2 000 mules is suing the film s creators for defamation true the vote s leaders were jailed this week for contempt of court in a separate matter in spite of all that many republicans have embraced the film local republican groups across the country have held screenings trump himself hosted a premiere at mar a lago its claims have been promoted by elected officials in texas and michigan and candidates for governor and secretary of state in arizona and now some are mobilizing around its false claims raising concerns over voter intimidation in the final days before the midterms what we re seeing now is a trend towards policing other people s voting behavior said emma steiner a disinformation analyst at the nonpartisan group common cause it s basically an endless template for taking a picture of someone or a video and saying oh actually what they re doing here is criminal and you can trust me on this and we need to find out who this person is and report them to the authorities true the vote referred questions about 2 000 mules to d souza who did not respond to a request for comment jell o mold to shape a lie while 2 000 mules didn t invent the big lie that trump won the 2020 election it s given coherent shape to voter fraud claims says matthew sheffield a former conservative activist who s now a correspondent for progressive news network tyt news they took all these ingredients and put them into a jell o mold and served the jell o basically sheffield said but even though the film fails to actually produce any evidence showing its core claim that people were dropping ballots at multiple drop boxes sheffield argues that s beside the point it is a narrative he said it is creating sentence structure to what had been just scattered feelings in 2 000 mules slick graphics illustrate true the vote s claims that it has cellphone location data showing mules traveling between the offices of left wing nonprofits and drop boxes but it turns out the maps don t actually correspond to the alleged data in one case a map supposedly showing atlanta was actually a stock photo of moscow this is not standard practice for documentary filmmakers we do three original sources for anything that looks anything like something we re saying or putting out into the world said director brian knappenberger whose latest project is a documentary series about online hoaxes that lead to real world harms and even if we kind of know it s true but we just can t back it up we don t do it but while mainstream documentaries like knappenberger s aim to bring a true story to a wider audience common cause s steiner said 2 000 mules serves a different purpose it gives people who ve already bought into the fiction of election fraud a satisfying story and a way to participate people feel like i can do my part by watching this movie keeping an eye out for these ballot mules and attempting to ensure that these people are not voting where i m voting she said copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

in georgia this summer a fake wanted poster falsely identified a woman as a so called ballot mule in arizona voters dropping off their ballots complained about being photographed and filmed in some cases by people carrying weapons the incidents appear inspired by a film 2 000 mules that spins a wild tale of how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen from donald trump at its heart is a conspiracy theory claiming democratic groups are colluding with paid operatives the titular mules to stuff ballot drop boxes with fraudulent votes there s no evidence for any of this the film which is directed by right wing commentator dinesh d souza and relies on data and analysis from controversial election group true the vote has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked by fact checkers and rejected by law enforcement but the film is the latest in a long line of movies that use the tropes and signifiers of documentaries to gain credibility in recent years documentary style films about the 2020 election the covid 19 pandemic and vaccines have spread conspiracy theories and recycled debunked lies documentaries have been used for decades to try to make bad actors and folks who are trying to push conspiracies or push disinformation or push a specific political agenda look more professional look glamorous look like something that you can believe said jiore craig head of elections and digital integrity at the institute for strategic dialogue which tracks online extremism debunked and embraced one of the people identified as a mule in 2 000 mules is suing the film s creators for defamation true the vote s leaders were jailed this week for contempt of court in a separate matter in spite of all that many republicans have embraced the film local republican groups across the country have held screenings trump himself hosted a premiere at mar a lago its claims have been promoted by elected officials in texas and michigan and candidates for governor and secretary of state in arizona and now some are mobilizing around its false claims raising concerns over voter intimidation in the final days before the midterms what we re seeing now is a trend towards policing other people s voting behavior said emma steiner a disinformation analyst at the nonpartisan group common cause it s basically an endless template for taking a picture of someone or a video and saying oh actually what they re doing here is criminal and you can trust me on this and we need to find out who this person is and report them to the authorities true the vote referred questions about 2 000 mules to d souza who did not respond to a request for comment jell o mold to shape a lie while 2 000 mules didn t invent the big lie that trump won the 2020 election it s given coherent shape to voter fraud claims says matthew sheffield a former conservative activist who s now a correspondent for progressive news network tyt news they took all these ingredients and put them into a jell o mold and served the jell o basically sheffield said but even though the film fails to actually produce any evidence showing its core claim that people were dropping ballots at multiple drop boxes sheffield argues that s beside the point it is a narrative he said it is creating sentence structure to what had been just scattered feelings in 2 000 mules slick graphics illustrate true the vote s claims that it has cellphone location data showing mules traveling between the offices of left wing nonprofits and drop boxes but it turns out the maps don t actually correspond to the alleged data in one case a map supposedly showing atlanta was actually a stock photo of moscow this is not standard practice for documentary filmmakers we do three original sources for anything that looks anything like something we re saying or putting out into the world said director brian knappenberger whose latest project is a documentary series about online hoaxes that lead to real world harms and even if we kind of know it s true but we just can t back it up we don t do it but while mainstream documentaries like knappenberger s aim to bring a true story to a wider audience common cause s steiner said 2 000 mules serves a different purpose it gives people who ve already bought into the fiction of election fraud a satisfying story and a way to participate people feel like i can do my part by watching this movie keeping an eye out for these ballot mules and attempting to ensure that these people are not voting where i m voting she said copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

new law to tackle the shortage of semiconductor chips will direct 280 billion to research and production of semiconductors in the united states while the dramatic increase in federal grants loans and other programs under the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors chips act of 2022 promises much manufacturers and other employers should consider carefully how to participate the basics found in everything from household appliances to cars and fighter jets semiconductors play a vital role in the global economy due to the country s dependence on foreign semiconductors semiconductor shortages in recent years have greatly affected manufacturers in the united states including in the automotive industry the chips act seeks to increase domestic production of semiconductors and reduce dependence on imported chips through two key methods 1 government funding and 2 tax credits government funding for manufacturers the statute earmarks 52 7 billion in federal grants loans and other programs for the fabrication production testing assembly and packaging of semiconductors within the united states eligible recipients must produce semiconductors or manufacture semiconductor materials and equipment eligible manufacturers will compete for funding through applications to the department of commerce funding documents providing specific application guidance are expected to be released by early february 2023 the department of commerce has signaled that it will give preference to manufacturers who secure state or local incentives according to the department s press release successful applicants will commit to maximizing regional and local competitiveness investing in the surrounding community and prioritizing broad economic gains rather than funneling funds exclusively to corporate expenditures the department also has indicated that it will prioritize projects that proactively work to ensure small businesses rural businesses and minority veteran and women owned businesses benefit from opportunities generated by the chips act international entities can apply for funding but the act prohibits foreign entities of concern from receiving any funding or assistance entities of concern are those owned by controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign country listed in 10 u s c 2533c including china russia iran and north korea in fact the act includes a guardrail or clawback measure to ensure recipients avoid foreign entities of concern altogether for example the department can claw back the full amount of an award if a recipient raises national security concerns by knowingly engaging in a joint research or technology licensing effort with a covered nation tax credits for manufacturers the chips act adds the advanced manufacturing investment credit amtc as section 48d of the internal revenue code the amtc offers manufacturers a 25 percent credit for the construction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities or facilities that produce manufacturing equipment which includes any tangible property essential to the facilities excepting offices and administrative buildings to qualify construction of the manufacturing facilities must begin by january 1 2027 to benefit from the tax credit manufacturers must avoid entanglement with foreign countries of concern the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in china for example will make an employer ineligible for the tax credit additionally like the funding clawback provisions the department of commerce can recover the credit if the transgression cannot be cured within 45 days after notice from the treasury department compliance recipients of chips act funding and tax credit will have to comply with federal requirements although more guidance are expected the act provides key considerations for manufacturers hoping to benefit from the increase in spending certain to garner the attention of manufacturers seeking chips act funding are the clawback provisions additionally chips act funded construction projects must comply with davis bacon prevailing wage requirements this means construction efforts must pay contractors and subcontractors no less than locally prevailing wages as determined by the department of labor in addition recipients must comply with the act s prohibition on the use of funds on stock buybacks or dividend payments to shareholders entities seeking chips act funding also are likely to find themselves subject to agency or congressional reporting requirements with respect to workplace demographic focused data similar to those that banks and other financial institutions are currently facing as the biden administration continues to press its social justice workforce transparency and equity initiatives manufacturers new to the role of federal contractor will need to act now to ensure their hr and information systems and organizational structures will facilitate the required reporting accurately as well as reflect the manufacturer s operating imperatives that help to explain their workforce demographic focused data in such areas as pay equity promotions and hiring staffing shortages workforce development with the influx of federal funds many manufacturers will need to hire to meet the increased market demand many semiconductor manufacturers reportedly are calling for immigration reform to attract qualified workers from abroad as the act is expected to exacerbate existing workforce shortages to ease the worker shortage the act provides 200 million to the national science foundation to formulate a shared curriculum and infrastructure to graduate qualified candidates the act contemplates shared training and regional partnerships between educational institutes and employers some reports estimate that semiconductor manufacturers will need to staff 300 000 newly created production jobs to fulfill the act s policy goal of sustained domestic production such a staffing goal could take years in the meantime however many manufacturers will have to compete for skilled stem professionals and international hires

in georgia this summer a fake wanted poster falsely identified a woman as a so called ballot mule in arizona voters dropping off their ballots complained about being photographed and filmed in some cases by people carrying weapons the incidents appear inspired by a film 2 000 mules that spins a wild tale of how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen from donald trump at its heart is a conspiracy theory claiming democratic groups are colluding with paid operatives the titular mules to stuff ballot drop boxes with fraudulent votes there s no evidence for any of this the film which is directed by right wing commentator dinesh d souza and relies on data and analysis from controversial election group true the vote has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked by fact checkers and rejected by law enforcement but the film is the latest in a long line of movies that use the tropes and signifiers of documentaries to gain credibility in recent years documentary style films about the 2020 election the covid 19 pandemic and vaccines have spread conspiracy theories and recycled debunked lies documentaries have been used for decades to try to make bad actors and folks who are trying to push conspiracies or push disinformation or push a specific political agenda look more professional look glamorous look like something that you can believe said jiore craig head of elections and digital integrity at the institute for strategic dialogue which tracks online extremism debunked and embraced one of the people identified as a mule in 2 000 mules is suing the film s creators for defamation true the vote s leaders were jailed this week for contempt of court in a separate matter in spite of all that many republicans have embraced the film local republican groups across the country have held screenings trump himself hosted a premiere at mar a lago its claims have been promoted by elected officials in texas and michigan and candidates for governor and secretary of state in arizona and now some are mobilizing around its false claims raising concerns over voter intimidation in the final days before the midterms what we re seeing now is a trend towards policing other people s voting behavior said emma steiner a disinformation analyst at the nonpartisan group common cause it s basically an endless template for taking a picture of someone or a video and saying oh actually what they re doing here is criminal and you can trust me on this and we need to find out who this person is and report them to the authorities true the vote referred questions about 2 000 mules to d souza who did not respond to a request for comment jell o mold to shape a lie while 2 000 mules didn t invent the big lie that trump won the 2020 election it s given coherent shape to voter fraud claims says matthew sheffield a former conservative activist who s now a correspondent for progressive news network tyt news they took all these ingredients and put them into a jell o mold and served the jell o basically sheffield said but even though the film fails to actually produce any evidence showing its core claim that people were dropping ballots at multiple drop boxes sheffield argues that s beside the point it is a narrative he said it is creating sentence structure to what had been just scattered feelings in 2 000 mules slick graphics illustrate true the vote s claims that it has cellphone location data showing mules traveling between the offices of left wing nonprofits and drop boxes but it turns out the maps don t actually correspond to the alleged data in one case a map supposedly showing atlanta was actually a stock photo of moscow this is not standard practice for documentary filmmakers we do three original sources for anything that looks anything like something we re saying or putting out into the world said director brian knappenberger whose latest project is a documentary series about online hoaxes that lead to real world harms and even if we kind of know it s true but we just can t back it up we don t do it but while mainstream documentaries like knappenberger s aim to bring a true story to a wider audience common cause s steiner said 2 000 mules serves a different purpose it gives people who ve already bought into the fiction of election fraud a satisfying story and a way to participate people feel like i can do my part by watching this movie keeping an eye out for these ballot mules and attempting to ensure that these people are not voting where i m voting she said copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

a nearly 40 increase in copper production at gibraltar head grades and copper production have continued to improve as mining advances deeper into the gibraltar pit higher throughput due to the softer ore in the new pit also benefited production with average daily mill throughput of 89 400 tons in the third quarter this was the highest quarterly mill throughput at gibraltar since the expansion ten

the fourth quarter we anticipate approximately a 10 increase in production and more stable production levels in the coming quarters our unit operating costs declined by 22 quarter over quarter as result of increased production and lower site spending but operating costs are still being impacted by diesel prices which are 55 higher than in 2021 during the third quarter we purchased diesel call

text size armageddon wasn t really around the corner in 1980 but us presidential candidate ronald reagan was all for talking it up out there in space the soviet union might make a push for world domination at any moment at home there were threats that were less explicit but you could hear the hum of racism in the motor of the arguments reagan used barely coded language to use race to help him win remembers film director james gray i wasn t aware of it as an 11 year old i wasn t but i was like you somehow absorb the drippings of it you somehow got the sense that something wasn t right for his latest film armageddon time gray whose more recent films such as the lost city of z and ad astra have leaned towards adventure has returned to his childhood stamping ground in queens new york while he has dealt with his family history more obliquely in the yards and the immigrant this is all about him specifically about his friendship with a black kid in his last year of primary school gray was jewish and growing up in what he describes as archie bunker territory he heard his share of anti semitic jibes in his last year of primary school however he would be confronted by the racism marbled into the social system much of armageddon time is actually pleasurable viewing because gray remembers so much with such honesty details were important to the film they even used his family s old dinner plates the gray family is renamed graf both being abbreviations of their real name it was important to fit in james becomes paul played by banks repeta gray s mother called esther in the film and portrayed by anne hathaway had been a home economics teacher and is as the story begins a big wheel in the school s parent teacher association his father called irving and played by jeremy strong is a plumber jeremy and annie are exactly what my parents were says armageddon time director james gray credit corina marie focus features paul is something of a mystery to them artistic flighty and sometimes unaccountably uncontrollably brattish sending his father into rages in which he beats the boy but he has an instinctively close relationship with his maternal grandfather a wise old owl played by anthony hopkins hopkins isn t jewish of course but gray says he finds the stock figure of the immigrant codger with a yiddish accent dense as a bagel quite offensive his grandfather wasn t like that he was a very proper person he came through southampton and he always wore a tie we gave tony hopkins my grandfather s tie and hat he s doing my grandfather uncannily jeremy and annie are exactly what my parents were details like the tie were important the carpet chandelier and the plates on the table were the same so was the mood of the house the whole passage of history a heaviness carried forward from the russian pogroms that drove his grandparents out of europe never forget his grandfather would tell him people are capable of this advertisement interestingly the actors say they avoided imitating gray s parents the character that i wanted to create was not necessarily what james wanted me to do with the role says jeremy strong whose own grandfather was also a plumber but as an actor you only have your own instincts at a certain point you can t think about that character as the father of the filmmaker anne hathaway agrees saying she worked on esther the way she would on any character they met gray s memories somewhere in the middle where it always felt truthful she says grandpa s influence bore fruit armageddon time is a great act of remembering with the canker of racism as its centrepiece in the united states the myth is that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps that you too can make it if you work hard james gray filmmaker irving and esther graf would certainly not think of themselves as racists on the contrary irving sneers at reagan just as gray s father did gray s parents even gave him the middle name marshall after their hero thurgood marshall the first black judge on the supreme court but they had their issues says gray paul s friend johnny is played by instantly likeable jaylin webb the real johnny would play up in class gray thinks now he had adhd but nobody thought about that then and lived in poverty with a grandmother rapidly succumbing to alzheimer s in the film paul s parents discuss school crowding they tut about children being bussed in from further north they murmur about bad influences when paul is hauled before the headmaster they worry about drugs like reagan they use codes for their anxieties that would be awkward if deciphered the decision is made as it was for gray to send paul to a private school kew forest where they have small classes uniforms computers and conflicts of a different kind the boys are entitled bullying and racist controversially gray has one use of the forbidden n word i refused to get rid of it because i didn t want to erase history he told deadline i can t rewrite a more pleasant nicer version of what those kids were the school s most famous alumnus who comes to lecture the children on their bright futures as the city s future ceos and political leaders is fred trump donald s father advertisement gray s enduring focus through his films unusually for american filmmakers has been class under capitalism specifically the unwritten ways in which people are kept in their place every successful civilisation requires a myth we can call it a lie that it tells itself in order to thrive he says in the united states the myth is that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps that you too can make it if you work hard but then there are times when you see behind the curtain they know that they re the ruling class you are the future leaders they would say that to us banks repeta as paul and jaylin webb as his friend johnny in armageddon time credit ap the system requires its collaborators like most people the gray graf family had signed up even his grandfather would urge him to take advantage of the opportunity to integrate he says your name is graf you re gonna fit in make new friends basically go and hide go and hide as someone who will fit into the system and then he says be a mensch it is paul s failure to be a mensch that brings armageddon time to its crisis point paul lets johnny down betraying him with his silence when the white boys at his fancy new school snigger at the idea of having anyone black in your actual house trying but failing to shelter him when he becomes homeless and finally abandoning him when they get into a scrape with the police johnny tells paul to leave and let him take the blame that s what was going to happen anyway paul s dad is able to pull some strings and so johnny fades from his life i think a lot of the movies that are made now are about enormous events that are about nothing you know this is the inverse of that jeremy strong actor after the film was first shown in cannes there was considerable discussion in the us press about whether armageddon time was a so called white guilt movie in which gray points the finger at himself sets out his mea culpa and seeks absolution not at all gray retorts he doesn t feel guilty when you re 11 or 12 you do not have the moral or ethical foundation to grapple with a world that is unendingly complex he told indiewire at the time i think my behaviour at times was utterly disgraceful and gutless but at the same time i don t know what the heck else i could have done at that age a white guilt movie he says now would show his alter ego moving towards the light but there is no solution no moral at the end it s not like the kid learns a valuable lesson and then becomes a great guy it doesn t work out that way it doesn t work out that way because it can t instead it becomes paul s personal armageddon advertisement i love the way that james takes what is a small not insignificant but certainly not a seismic event and we feel as the audience the enormity of it says jeremy strong i think a lot of the movies that are made now are about enormous events that are about nothing you know this is the inverse of that james gray centre with anne hathaway and jeremy strong at the telluride film festival in september credit getty images he remembers how gray talked to him about a passage in marcel proust s swann s way about the passing of places that we remember that no longer exist houses and roads and avenues being as fleeting as the year strong says james is also in search of lost time he is trying to retrieve a moment to bring this time capsule to us and show the kind of moral education that lead to a first crossroads these first moments of adulthood in this boy people are cruel people are driven to demean others slavery and the holocaust do not says gray exist independently of each other that s what adults know i don t mean this as medicine says gray the movie is not medicine in that way but it is my job as a creative person to talk about one of the major threads in our lives what it means to be a person so much of it is connected to this idea of i make more money than you down the block they have a nicer car than i do and that s part of my identity like skin colour and what religion i follow what we now generically call privilege the film may not be medicine but anne hathaway took a message from it the first thing that i would hope everyone is doing is to become educated about what privilege is she says and when you do make a mistake and you will because you re a human being make the mistake gracefully listen and apologise be aware of the way bias looks in the world and how others might be expecting you to participate in it then do the opposite but it s not a prescriptive thing it s an ongoing situation the conclusion that james offers is that it may not make a difference but it s in the doing of it that your character is formed banks repeta and anne hathaway in armageddon time credit ap when we talk via zoom gray is in his guesthouse what we would call a granny flat because the sink in his kitchen is spouting boiling water everywhere the plumber is trying to fix it and the dog is going berserk i am impressed he managed to get a plumber immediately he only lives three blocks away says gray he s a very nice guy i ask if he told him his own father and his father before him were plumbers in new york i think i did tell him he says but i don t know if he would remember advertisement

a version of this article originally appeared in the artnet news pro fall 2022 intelligence report this article examines how early interest affects artists long term prospects in the 21st century through data in particular we focus on the genres of ultra contemporary art which for purposes of this article is defined as work made by artists born in or after 1975 through the present 1975 present and postwar and contemporary art which is defined herein as work made by artists born in or after 1900 through 1974 1900 74 these categories of art have attracted a growing share of attention and dollars in recent years what can the numbers tell us about how the auction market has transformed over the past several decades to serve as a platform for new art and what effect can this have on the market for young artists the analysis takes two related approaches in the first we examine macro data to identify significant shifts in artists presence and results at auction in the past 20 years in the second we present five case studies of individual living artists whose auction sales have peaked at different points in the past two decades as windows into how the speculative market has evolved during this century methodology notes both samples of artists born 1900 74 and those born in or after 1975 present include only artists alive in the year their first work was included in a day auction at sotheby s christie s or phillips the samples also include living artists whose first appearance at sotheby s christie s or phillips was in an evening sale a phenomenon of recent vintage to best determine the average length of time between artists debuts in the two categories of sales day and the more prestigious evening at sotheby s christie s or phillips we began by identifying the artists who saw their first work included in one of the three houses evening sales in each year of the sample period we then looked back to measure the time between that appearance and when the same artists works were offered in any day sale held by sotheby s christie s or phillips finally we averaged the results for all qualifying artists in each year for artists whose first work in any sotheby s christie s or phillips sale was in an evening auction their time to progress to an evening was counted as 0 0 years total auction results for works by artists born 1975 present vs artists born 1900 74 based on the data above from 2013 through mid july 2022 the growth in auction sales of ultra contemporary art by artists born 1975 present has far surpassed that of work by artists born 1900 74 whether the annual sales growth is measured in dollar value or in the number of lots sold total auction sales of ultra contemporary art by artists born 1975 present have increased by more than 700 percent during this stretch rising from 91 4 million in 2013 to 739 3 million in 2021 sales achieved this year through july 21 2022 reached 396 5 million compared with 359 million through the equivalent period in 2021 in comparison the apex by sales value for the older cohort of artists was achieved in 2014 6 95 billion an increase of roughly 16 percent over the 2013 total sales achieved this year through july 21 2022 reached 3 4 billion close to the 3 5 billion sold during the equivalent period of 2021 the number of ultra contemporary lots made by artists born 1975 present sold at auction rose by roughly 250 percent over the sample period from 3 487 lots in 2013 to 12 216 lots last year through july 21 2022 the volume of lots sold this year was 7 132 compared with the 6 386 lots sold during the equivalent period in 2021 in contrast while 2021 did see an all time high number of lots sold by artists born 1900 74 this total nearly 148 000 lots was only about 16 percent higher than the equivalent total in 2013 about 127 400 as with total sales by value the number of lots sold through mid july 2022 fell from the equivalent period last year to 76 053 from 80 230 also of note the yearly sell through rate for artists born 1900 74 has been at best only a few percentage points greater than for artists born 1975 present on average both groups of artists have found buyers for roughly two thirds of the lots offered annually the largest gap arose in 2018 when 69 percent of the lots by the older group found buyers versus 63 8 percent for the younger group while we cannot state for certain the 5 2 percent advantage for artists born 1900 74 that year could be the result of the major auction houses offering multiple significant estates with especially strong holdings of works from the first half of the 20th century including the collections of david and peggy rockefeller¹ and barney a ebsworth both at christie s ² in summary the data shows that buyers have grown the size of the auction market for ultra contemporary art made by artists born 1975 present much larger by two statistical metrics than for artists born 1900 74 in recent years lots by the younger age group have also remained nearly as likely to find buyers at auction as lots by their more established predecessors which could potentially suggest that both auction houses and bidders have come to view the majority of these works as worthy secondary market acquisitions accelerating the path to a sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sale one indicator of the art market s pronounced push toward youth is the accelerating speed at which artists progress through the tiers of prestige and price at auction houses three of the leaders in the western auction sector are sotheby s christie s and phillips ³ the offering of an artist s work for sale at one of these big three auction houses implies greater market demand than would its appearance at any other house in the sector among all art auctions held by the big three houses the most prestigious are their evening sales where generally the most coveted and highest priced lots are offered 4 as another way to quantify whether bidders interest in works by ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present has been growing faster than for artists born 1900 74 we performed another analysis for both groups a year by year measure of the average length of time separating the first offering of qualifying artists work in any sotheby s christie s or phillips sale and the first offering of the same qualifying artists work at one of sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sales ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present have consistently graduated to the big three houses evening sales faster on average than artists born 1900 74 from 2008 through mid july 2022 qualifying ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present made the leap to a big three evening sale in between 1 2 years and 6 3 years on average in contrast qualifying artists born 1900 74 needed between 7 years and 16 6 years on average period between 2007 and 2010 both groups average time to reach an evening sale also increased or decreased in tandem with macro fluctuations in art auction sales for example the qualifying cohort of older artists progressed to the big three s evening sales fastest from 2007 through 2010 the years generally considered to have been most strongly impacted by the great recession during this period the number of such artists who were elevated to an evening sale ranged from 28 to 80 per year in an average time of between seven and nine years this outcome meshes with the notion of a retreat to proven quality as market anxiety heightened 5 it s plausible that the major houses would have responded to this tension by taking more established artists who had been consistently profitable in their day sales and elevating them to their evening auctions the comparatively low number of ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present debuting at sotheby s christie s or philips evening sales during this stretch just four per year from 2008 through 2010 represents the other side of this strategic coin period between 2016 and 2018 a similar dynamic played out from 2016 through 2018 of all the ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present who have graduated to sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sales from the day sales since 2008 those who did so between 2016 and 2018 took between 5 and 6 3 years on average longer than their peers in the other years on record this makes sense against the backdrop of a downturn that took place in the fine art auction market during these years total sales plummeted from roughly 15 billion to less than 12 billion from 2015 to 2016 a year over year drop of more than 20 percent and still had not fully bounced back to 2015 levels by the end of 2018 6 in this context 2016 may be a cautionary tale for auction house specialists who may have tried to balance a slowly growing appetite for younger artists in the preceding years evening sales against steadily worsening market conditions in 2016 itself opposing forces that could have led to elevating ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present who were deemed even surer sellers than the few who debuted in their evening sales during the great recession period between 2019 and the present the two groups progress has inverted since 2019 as auction sales of ultra contemporary works made by artists born 1975 present posted three consecutive years of record high results the number of ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present graduating to a big three evening sale climbed to a new high 33 artists in 2021 while the time required to do so shortened to an all time low of 1 2 years on average through mid july 22 new ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present had entered a big three evening sale in an average time of 1 6 years from their initial big three appearance meanwhile the number of artists born 1900 74 who made their evening sale debut dropped by nearly 30 percent from 2019 through 2021 and the time required to do so expanded to a new average length of 16 6 years in 2019 before contracting slightly to 11 4 years in 2021 these figures could represent a new flight to quality during and after the onset of covid 19 more conservative buyers may have been most interested in canonical artists who had long been fixtures at the sotheby s christie s and phillips evening sales more risk friendly buyers whose investment portfolios likely produced tremendous returns from the second half of 2020 through the end of 2021 may have been most interested in the ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present whose works were seen as the highest upside growth opportunities in the art auction market in short if the auction houses were going to promote artists untested in their evening sales they had greater incentive to do so for the very youngest than for any other group the data complements an organizational push toward ultra contemporary art made by artists born 1975 present at the big three auction houses primarily sotheby s in fall 2021 sotheby s reorganized its contemporary art evening sales into two more specific auctions the contemporary which generally encompasses artworks made from the postwar era through the late 20th century and the now which generally encompasses works completed in the 21st century a designation that puts ultra contemporary art made by artists born 1975 present at the forefront 7 meanwhile the focus on young female ultra contemporary artists born 1975 present in the now auctions represents a pivot away from past practice among the major auction houses in an era when gender equity has come to the fore 8 sotheby s also hired noah horowitz the former director of the americas for art basel to try to build bridges to primary market galleries across price tiers 9 horowitz unveiled artist s choice a recurring initiative that allows artists and their galleries to consign works directly to auction with a small portion of sotheby s fees and the hammer price going to a charity selected by the artist 10 auctioneer simon de pury launched a similar model in august 2022 with the sale women art in times of chaos which generated more than 800 000 for artists and their galleries 11 case studies two decades ago it took an average of around eight years for an artist to ascend from the day sales to the more prominent evening sales at sotheby s christie s or phillips 12 that time shrinks in moments of frenzied spending on young artists as during the zombie formalism craze for young abstract art in 2013 14 and more recently from 2020 to the present the increased glare of prominent auction trading can have a big impact on the trajectory of an artist s market just as the art market is made up of many individual genres each genre is made up of markets for specific artists there is much that may be learned from these individual cases we selected five living artists from and across different decades who had dramatic spikes on the secondary market early in their careers to explore how each of their markets unfolded in the years after we examine how a complex web of factors including timing gallery representation supply and broader market conditions can shape the arc of an artist s market after early auction success there are limits to what these case studies demonstrate we cannot get a full picture of each artist s private i e primary markets or insight into the personal decisions directing their careers however an analysis of auction results and other publicly available information does illustrate the different paths an artist s career can take after an early splash on the auction i e secondary markets disclaimer the following case studies are presented only for individual analysis of changing auction market demand for living artists during specific periods since 2002 the artists chosen are not necessarily representative of auction results for all living artists in the same genre nor are their past auction results indicative of future performance since there is scant publicly verifiable data about sales in the private art market i e the gallery dealer sector we have included the date of each artist s first solo gallery exhibition sourced from their curriculum vitae only as an approximate reference point to suggest when collectors saw them as viable propositions in the private market not just the auction market 1 damien hirst first solo gallery exhibition 1987 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips day sale june 1995 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sale may 2000 auction record set june 2007 damien hirst b 1965 who became famous in the 1990s after graduating from goldsmiths as a member of the young british artists a generation of boundary breaking painters and sculptors in the u k made his auction debut in 1995 seven years before the earliest sample period in the rest of our analysis and eight years after his first gallery show 13 unlike the other artists we are examining hirst himself was the engine behind his most prominent turn at auction in 2008 the artist consigned 218 works directly from his studio to sotheby s for the notorious beautiful inside my head forever sale the auction a then radical market gesture that cut out his galleries surpassed expectations bringing in around 200 million 14 that same night lehman brothers collapsed and financial markets plunged 15 the dramatically timed sale saw the artist s total 2008 auction sales propelled to a record 268 8 million the following year as the art market began to feel the effects of the financial crash hirst s annual sales value plummeted 92 percent to 20 3 million 16 ever since 2008 his auction market has been characterized by abundant supply which may have constrained his prices the number of works on offer each year has not fallen below 200 17 in the first half of 2022 429 hirst lots sold the most for any name among the top 15 contemporary artists at auction 18 with some renewed success on the private market from his cherry blossom series hirst saw his best year at auction since 2008 last year with his works generating some 37 9 million 19 still the market remains far below its pre recession peak last year 820 hirst works were on offer almost 30 percent more than in 2008 and the total sales figure was still 85 9 percent below the record setting sum 2 anselm reyle first solo gallery exhibition 2000 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips day sale october 2006 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sale october 2006 auction record set october 2007 the german artist anselm reyle b 1970 burst onto the art scene after attending staatliche akademie der bildenden künste karlsruhe with his first gallery show in berlin in 2000 within four years he had a solo exhibition at the prominent new york gallery gavin brown s enterprise 20 he became known for his crinkle pieces in which he bunched up colored foil mounted it on canvas and placed it behind glass reyle s first work sold at auction in 2006 for just under 58 000 comfortably within estimate 21 no other works by the artist appeared at auction that year as his star rose transactions began to pick up speed the following year reyle joined megadealer gagosian gallery and 16 of his works hit the auction block 22 as interest in ultra contemporary art rose more broadly reyle s auction market peaked in 2008 with total sales of just over 6 million for 35 lots 23 his works consistently outperformed estimates as he ascended to prime evening sale positioning a purple acrylic and foil piece from 2006 for example fetched 619 435 at the sotheby s contemporary art evening sale in february 2008 surpassing its 496 820 high estimate 24 then the recession hit the art market in 2009 reyle s total sales value dropped by 70 percent and more than 40 percent of his works offered at auction failed to find buyers 25 although he matched or exceeded 35 lots sold in two subsequent years 2011 and 2015 his total annual sales did not exceed 3 3 million in february 2014 reyle announced his retirement from art production he had what he stated was his last show at gagosian that same year 26 but the retirement didn t last long by 2015 he was back in his studio with considerably fewer assistants 27 and by 2016 he had returned to the gallery world with a solo exhibition at contemporary fine arts berlin 28 he has shown regularly at galleries and museums since but his prices on the secondary market remain considerably below where they were in 2008 in 2021 auction houses sold 18 of his works for nearly 805 000 in the first half of 2022 the corresponding figures were 10 lots sold for roughly 457 000 3 joe bradley first solo gallery exhibition 2000 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips day sale may 2010 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sale october 2011 auction record set november 2015 shortly after graduating from the rhode island school of design joe bradley b 1975 had his first solo gallery show in boston 29 he made his name creating what new york times art critic roberta smith called ironic anti painting paintings characterized by motifs outlined in black oil crayon that looked like overblown doodles 30 he left his new york gallery canada in 2011 to join gavin brown s enterprise where he stayed for four years between bradley s first solo show at canada in 2006 and his first exhibition at gavin brown in 2011 his prices on the primary market increased 1 100 percent 31 in 2015 he joined gagosian 32 these gallery shifts coincided with a sharp ascent on the auction market often when an artist joins a new gallery especially one of the largest the new dealer increases the works prices and also tamps down supply which can push collectors to compete more fiercely for that artist s work when it does come up for auction 33 bradley made his auction debut in 2010 between 2011 and 2015 his annual auction sales shot up 2 604 percent from 368 108 to just under 10 million the average price for one of his works at auction also rose by a factor of more than 10 his total sales peaked in 2015 at a strong moment for the contemporary art market the following year the number of bradley s lots sold peaked at 17 but the dollar value of his annual sales had already decreased by more than half to 4 8 million over the next six years the american artist continued to show at his galleries gagosian and eva presenhuber and his style evolved from anti painting to abstract expressionism inspired brushy compositions on dirty canvases he remained a consistent draw for bidders albeit at a considerably lower level the only full year in which his auction market has failed to generate at least 1 million was 2020 in 2021 bradley left gagosian to join petzel and xavier hufkens his first new york solo show in six years presented more conventional works that balance representation and abstraction and drew strong reviews 34 4 lucien smith first solo gallery exhibition 2011 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips day sale november 2013 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sale november 2013 auction record set november 2013 a graduate of cooper union the american painter lucien smith b 1989 rose to prominence as a member of the zombie formalists 35 the term coined by critic walter robinson referred to a cohort of young artists who became popular in 2013 and 2014 for a particular brand of process based abstraction they created good looking canvases with theatrical processes like applying paint with a fire extinguisher smith was considered among the group s most high profile members in 2013 at the age of 24 t magazine called him an art world wunderkind 36 that year he made his auction debut at phillips where the painting he created for his senior thesis was placed prominently as the first lot of the house s fall new york evening sale hobbes the rain man and my friend barney under the sycamore tree 2011 a scene from winnie the pooh with the characters missing carried a high estimate of 150 000 and ended up selling for 389 000 to an established dealer collector 37 just two years earlier it had sold at smith s thesis exhibition for 10 000 38 no work by smith has ever surpassed that price at auction in 2014 44 of his works hit the auction block delivering a total of just over 4 million but with the fever for young artists cooling his auction market fell 84 percent the following year when 18 works sold for a combined 639 000 the buyer of the record setting hobbes work told bloomberg in 2015 if you know someone who wants it let me know 39 smith s decline continued as he largely retreated from the traditional art market his annual auction sales have not reached 200 000 since 2015 though they have also never fallen below 113 415 in recent years he has reinvented himself as an nft non fungible token artist the founder of a nonprofit called serving the people and an ambassador for a fractional ownership platform 40 i knew it was unsustainable smith said in a 2021 interview luckily i put my earnings in the right places so i would be comfortable 41 5 njideka akunyili crosby first solo gallery exhibition 2013 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips day sale september 2016 first appearance at a sotheby s christie s or phillips evening sale november 2016 auction record set may 2018 njideka akunyili crosby b 1983 decided to become an artist only after she failed to get into her first choice medical school 42 after graduating from the prestigious yale school of art in 2011 she began attracting attention with her lush collaged depictions of her community in nigeria where she grew up and new york where she lives when she made her art fair debut with victoria miro in december 2014 at art basel miami beach her work stood out in contrast to the minimal abstract zombie formalist works that were peaking in the market at the time we ve never had such an immediate response to a new artist the gallery s director glenn scott wright said 43 the interior scene ultimately sold to cape town s zeitz museum of contemporary art africa for nearly 50 000 44 before long the number of people who wanted to buy a work by crosby far outpaced the available supply in an extremely productive year she makes around a dozen works 45 the growing demand helped push her into a sotheby s evening sale just two months after her first outing at one of the big three houses 46 she made her evening debut in november 2016 with drown 2012 it sold for 1 1 million shattering its 300 000 high estimate 47 as with smith crosby s auction sales peaked the year after her debut in 2017 eight of her works hit the auction block generating more than 9 5 million her auction record was set in 2018 when she donated the botanical composition bush babies 2017 to a benefit sale to support the studio museum in harlem it fetched 3 4 million more than four times its 800 000 high estimate crosby s annual auction sales totals have declined considerably since then but that has more to do with a tightening of supply than a drop in demand crosby and her dealers have taken deliberate steps to limit the number of her works that appear on the secondary market 48 in 2018 the artist joined mega gallery david zwirner which represents her alongside victoria miro 49 the following year no crosby works were offered at auction and only two were sold in each of the years 2020 and 2021 these efforts have continued in 2022 as none of the artist s works have appeared at auction to date 50 to download the full fall 2022 artnet intelligence report available exclusively to artnet news pro members click here average time

the ohio attorney general runs the largest public interest law firm in the state but democrat jeff crossman says incumbent republican dave yost uses the office for political fights rather than to serve all ohioans i think one of the real unfortunate or quite frankly reprehensible things that yost has done in that office is use that office for political purposes said crossman a state lawmaker from parma who is running against yost in the general election i completely and fundamentally disagree that that office should be used to file lawsuits based on political philosophy because as the attorney general you re supposed to represent all the people in the state not just the ones that agree with you politically yost noted that ohio led or joined 23 lawsuits against the federal government but skipped joining 16 other cases during his tenure as attorney general which started in 2019 yost said he is joining lawsuits that seek to push back against inappropriate use of presidential executive power to usurp congress the idea that because congress is divided like the country is divided that the president should just step in and become a monarch is to disassemble the american governance system i m against that yost said during yost s term as attorney general ohio joined prep for the polls see who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our voter guide a lawsuit that challenged vaccine mandates for federal contractors two lawsuits seeking to block the biden administration from enforcing rules against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation a lawsuit to overturn the federal ban on bump stocks a mechanism for converting firearms into machine gun like weapons the same day the u s supreme court struck down the constitutional right to abortion yost went to court to successfully get the stay lifted against ohio s six week abortion ban law weeks later he cast doubt on the existence of a 10 year old rape victim who traveled to indiana for an abortion yost also said the child could have received an abortion in ohio because state law provides exceptions for when the life of the mother or a major bodily function is at risk some medical experts disagree that the girl would have qualified for one of those exceptions no doctor is going to risk their license on a vaguely written exception that nobody has clarified crossman said yost countered first of all mr crossman is not a doctor or a prosecutor which calls into serious question his qualifications to say that secondly neither i nor he nor any other doctor in this state can offer an opinion you know why because we don t have a case file we don t have a medical history we don t have an examination yost has declined to offer an apology to the 10 year old or her family for questioning the existence of the case or her need to travel to indiana for an abortion i don t even know the 10 year old i ve never mentioned her he said who is dave yost yost 65 served as delaware county prosecutor and state auditor before beating steve dettelbach in the 2018 race for attorney general the ohio state university graduate worked as a newspaper reporter before jumping into politics and the law he earned his law degree from capital university i distrust power i distrust secrecy and i wanted to change the world for the better as corny as it sounds yost said of his career choices yost said the attorney general s office should be used to establish the rule of law for everyone no matter their status if elected to a second term yost said his priorities are increasing accountability for pharmacy benefit managers in medicaid continuing to fight against human trafficking and finding money for annual training for ohio s 35 000 sworn police officers yost maintains that annual training can t be mandated without funding he also supports reforms such as creating a police professional licensing program similar to licensing for doctors engineers and other professions he noted that it requires legislative action it wasn t on the top of the agenda this year apparently he said here is his position on other issues full abortion ban declined to say citing ongoing litigation eliminating training and checks to carry concealed weapons declined to say because his office represents the legislature which passed the new law legalizing recreational marijuana opposed establishing database of police shootings supports who is jeff crossman crossman earned his undergraduate degree from mount union university a master s degree from the university of akron and a law degree from cleveland marshall college of law initially he wanted to be a college professor but shifted to a legal career after he determined it would be a better opportunity to serve and address problems crossman 50 spent five years on the parma city council before joining the ohio house in january 2019 as a state lawmaker he was among 26 democrats who voted for republican larry householder to become speaker a vote he says he regrets and notes he called for householder s removal from office after he was indicted in a federal public corruption case if elected attorney general crossman said he d use the resources of the office to investigate public corruption householder and house bill 6 ohio can be number one in the country for opportunity like it used to be but it can t be number one for opportunity while it s number one in the country for corruption he said yost filed a civil lawsuit to block firstenergy from collecting fees from ohio consumers for two nuclear plants in northern ohio a move crossman called insufficient federal prosecutors are expected to reveal their corruption case in detail when householder and former ohio republican party chairman matt borges go to trial in january crossman concedes that federal authorities may have asked state officials to hold off on investigations but said that doesn t excuse the state attorney general who has specific jurisdiction the power of the office the resources to conduct their own independent investigation here is his position on other issues full abortion ban opposes eliminating training and checks to carry concealed weapons opposed legalizing recreational marijuana says it should be up to the voters to decide establishing database of police shootings supports more what you need to know

erika now to forecasting our future a new report out tonight shows boston is not keeping its promises when it comes to fighting climate change ben the report shows the city will not meet climate goals it set just a few years ago newscenter 5 s david bienick is live in boston with what went wrong david reporter this new report hurts boston s reputation for being a climate change leader it says even the city s short term goals are already out of reach under a goals by former mayor marty walsh in 2017 boston planned to cut greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles businesses and homes using 2005 as a benchmark boston said it would slash emissions in with the policies in place now we cannot achieve those goals reporter public policy professor joan fitzgerald headed up the team at northeastern that prepared this report for the boston foundation what we focused on what it will take to get us back on track reporter for example fitzgerald says boston needs to convert not just big downtown office buildings but also smaller apartment buildings and individuals homes to electric heat that way they can be powered by solar wind and other non polluting sources we re still building fossil fuel infrastructure and the state really needs to stop if we have any hope of beating global warming reporter mayor wu who ran on a promise to acclerate the city s climate plan says it is still a top priority my kids are five and seven i think about it every day for the next generation the one after that it s really on our shoulders right now to take action reporter the report does not address how much it will cost to get boston back on track for its climate goals but the professor points out advertisement majority of boston climate goals out of reach new climate report says share copy link copy an inaugural boston climate progress report shows the city faces multiple obstacles and is not on track to meet its goals the research conducted by researchers at northeastern university s dukakis center for urban and regional policy for the boston foundation shows that the city is off track to cut carbon emissions by 50 before 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2050 with the policies that are in place now we cannot reach those goals said joan fitzgerald professor of urban and public policy at northeastern university what we focused on is what it would take to get us back on track the report commented on the city s progress on broader policies and how some systematic obstacles are present in meeting set climate goals city climate policies such as the building energy reduction and disclosure ordinance berdo also show potential but barring more systemic changes the city has no clear path to meet its interim 2030 goal or its 2050 net zero target the foundation wrote in a summary the report also showed that although the policy is showing some potential an immediate pivot is needed with the federal and state legislation the new climate progress report also lists 12 key outcomes that are needed to achieve net zero emission and boston s progress towards that goal the report found that a few of the outcomes are critically behind for example a push for low carbon electricity is facing permitting delays in the wind growth and transmission capacity expansion the growth of renewable energy in the northeast region is dependent on the ability of many localities to scale and site solar and wind recent examples of local opposition highlight the challenge of conflicting interests that push back against renewable deployment the report said the inaugural report called for action by the state and regional authorities on both wind growth and transmission capacity expansion the progress report also said the pace of building electrification across boston is too slow the city is not producing enough housing or improving transit systems to meet goals for providing equitable housing and mobility according to the climate report community opposition has made it difficult to build housing outside the core despite many of these communities having access to the commuter rail system the report reads this failure to provide housing for people in places they want to live is a primary driver of inflated housing costs and often pushes people further away from walkable bike able or transit accessible areas however boston is showing some measurable progress on the 12 proposed outcomes such as phasing out non zero emission vehicles or planning for robust and resilient urban forests how boston performs on these twelve outcomes tells us a great deal about how boston is doing in moving toward its broader goals said co author michael walsh this report sets the framework for evaluating our collective efforts which will require commitment from the city of boston critical partnerships with state and regional governments and investments from the private sector the climate progress report proposed four critical areas of improvement to get back on track to reach the proposed goals including retrofitting the small building stock planning local energy for an electrified city building a resilient coastline through improved governance and prioritizing planning for boston s frontline neighborhoods the boston climate report is to be updated every two years the full report can be found here
today good reasons remain to continue saving seed of your own best garden vegetables open pollinated pre 1970 s vegetable varieties are fast disappearing from the commercial marketplace pushed out by the latest and greatest new hybrids saving and sharing seed of such older varieties helps preserve their rich genetic heritage for farmers and gardeners of the future and allows you to rub shoulders with your ancestors and if these varieties are to be saved home gardeners will have to do it most of the professionals are headed another way farmers and gardeners routinely saved the seed of their crops until the turn of the 20th century when commercial agricultural interests planted the false idea among them that only skilled professionals were capable of handling this job seed saving has helped humans grow their own food in the face of changing demands and environmental pressures ever since they began planting seeds historically home seed saving was how uniquely adapted crop varieties were handed down from generation to generation for continued selection and adaptation find out how you can be self reliant when you grow your own seeds for food including tips on when to harvest seeds spacing the crop population size and harvesting seeds many home gardeners feel a sense of empowerment and satisfaction when they rely on their seed saving abilities one of the oldest basic human skills to build up personal seed stocks as they strive for self sufficiency and with many seeds now costing more per packet saving some of your own also can save you cold hard cash seed saving also helps you develop a better working knowledge of your crops and even improve varieties to meet specific contemporary needs or growing conditions for examples of how you can create exciting new varieties see saving improved seed from your garden three basic factors you need to consider when you want to save seed from a particular crop establishing the right separation distance to keep seed plants from crossing with other varieties of the same species correct population size saving seed from more than just a few plants to maintain genetic diversity and harvesting when the seed is mature then cleaning and drying it properly beans peas and southern peas are easy to save because they make harvestable seeds in the pods being produced as the vegetable crop all you need to do is to let the pods fully mature on the plant in order to gather seeds tomatoes also are an easy beginning crop they bear mature seeds as a natural consequence of producing ripe fruit these four crops and lettuce also are naturally self pollinated which means each plant is pollinated primarily from its own pollen making it much easier to maintain distinct varieties such a seed crop plant is called a selfer in contrast other common crops including corn squash carrots and beets are called crossers because before they can produce seeds one plant usually is cross pollinated with pollen carried by wind or insects from a different plant growing a seed crop to properly manage selfers and crossers seed savers need to know the minimum distance that each variety should be from any other sexually compatible crossable varieties growing nearby called isolation distance this spacing depends on whether the variety is self pollinated or cross pollinated for self pollinated crops like beans peas peppers and tomatoes the ideal distance between two varieties to ensure no crossing should be 50 feet however many seed savers and some seed companies report only infrequent crosses at 20 feet frank morton lettuce breeder for his company wild garden seed in philomath oregon confirms that lettuces seldom cross when planted 20 feet apart even in the presence of a number of insect pollinators saving seeds of cross pollinated crops is more challenging with crossers you must grow only one variety of each crop type per year it also is important to know if neighboring gardens or farm fields have any related crops that could spread their pollen to your seed crop crossers arugula and radish make good crops for a beginner to try because relatively few gardeners grow arugula or allow their radishes to go to seed spacing the crop healthy plants unfettered by space restrictions produce much more seed per plant than plants growing in crowded conditions but many people plant their seeds more densely in a row than recommended on seed packets for example green beans should be planted at the rate of six to eight seeds per foot per row but frequently overzealous gardeners plant them at twice that rate if you re planning to save seed plant row crops like beans and peas even more sparsely four to six seeds per foot to encourage maximum aeration which helps reduce possible bacterial or fungal rot on the pods should wet conditions develop plant lettuce for seed saving at the recommended rate on the seed packet handle radishes differently pull and spread out the entire crop in a shady spot to select the best ones in terms of color shape and good health trim off the oldest leaves of those plants and replant the roots in a new spot at 12 to 18 inch intervals in the row many gardeners know that considerable leeway as much as six weeks for beans and peas and even more for arugula lettuce and radish exists wits respect to how late you can plant and still get a harvest before it freezes this isn t the case for crops being grown for seed plant breeder morton says a full 150 to 180 days are needed to produce viable lettuce seed at his western oregon farm for the seed to mature by late september at the earliest and by the middle of october at the latest he must have planted the crop by mid april for southern gardeners with long growing seasons southern peas including crowder black eyed and pink eyed peas are good choices because they produce a healthy seed crop under hotter conditions than the other crops on this list they also are an excellent seed crop choice because many of the once numerous southern regional favorites are in dire need of preservation seed population size many novice seed savers collect seed from just a couple of plants unfortunately this practice tends to narrow genetic variation in the variety and over a number of generations it can cause a variety to change and eventually lose some of the unique traits that made it special in the first place the population size for cross pollinated crops is even more important than for selfers genetic variation from plant to plant in any particular crosser is considerably greater than in most selfers this means that no one plant in a stand of crosser plants contains all of the particular traits and the genes determining those traits that comprise that variety crossers openly pollinate with other plants of their variety sharing their genes with any other plant in that group each time they reproduce harvesting seeds seeds harvested before they reach maturity will have a low germination rate and any resulting seedlings may lack vigor and may be more susceptible to disease especially under stressful conditions dry seeded crops like beans peas southern peas radishes and arugula make seed in pods that signal when the crop is ready to harvest collect pods when they have completely dried turned beige or light brown in color and are crisp and easy to crack open when pods look and feel ready harvest them quickly or risk losing them to either too much moisture or a lack of it wetness from rain and dew encourages rot overly dry conditions leave the pods susceptible to splitting open shattering and spilling their seeds on the ground to harvest pod bearing seed crops cut the entire plant near its base lay out cut plants a single layer deep on a tarp in the sun if rain is forecast or if wind is excessive place the plants on a cement or wooden floor inside a warm airy structure after several days thresh the seeds from the pods by picking up a few plants at a time and whacking them against the bottom of a large container such as a wheelbarrow that has sides at least a foot high this works well with crops like arugula and mustard which have pods that easily release their seeds but many bean and pea plants are not so easily threshed they can be shelled out by hand or you can dance gently on cloth bags filled with these plants to get the pods to shatter take care not to overdo it any damage to the seed itself can destroy its ability to germinate or shorten its storage life considerably after threshing winnow the seed with the help of a good stiff breeze or fan winnowing is the act of cleaning the seed of debris called chaff which is mainly pieces of pods and stems to winnow slowly spill uncleaned seed from one container to another while the breeze or a fan blows the broken pods and stems away two 5 gallon buckets or for smaller quantities two rectangular dishpans work well for this task the debris will blow over the top edge of the bottom bucket or pan while most of the good seed will fall into it repeat the process several times until the seed is cleaned after harvesting a dry seeded crop spread the seed to be saved out on a clean dry surface that is out of the sun and protected from the wind but in a warm dry place make sure cross ventilation is good fans come in handy for this but not strong enough to blow the seed off the drying surface wet seed harvesting determining the maturity of wet seeded crops such as tomatoes and peppers which bear their seed inside the fruit yes botanically these are the fruit is much easier than with dry seeded crops with wet seeded crops when the fruit is ripe the seed is too viable tomato seed can be extracted from fruit picked at the perfect eating stage but the quality of the seed will be superior if you allow selected fruit to overripen on the plants for just a few days don t allow the fruit to start rotting though because fungal or bacterial growths could damage the seed a wet seeded crop should be spread out thinly on a screen best or a clean nonstick cookie sheet or tray place the screen or tray in a warm dry place out of the sun with plenty of airflow which can be facilitated by a fan both wet and dry seeded crops should be stirred once or twice a day during this stage to assure even drying master seed saver suzanne ashworth author of the seed saving manual seed to seed see mother s bookshelf page 120 in this issue says flat seed should break instead of fold if it is dry enough to store and hard shelled seed like corn or beans should shatter not mash when struck with a hammer always store seeds in cool dry conditions in most locations breathable paper envelopes work well with smaller quantities of seed in dry climates muslin sacks are good for larger quantities and in humid locations airtight containers such as glass canning jars work best but you should be sure the seed is perfectly dry before placing it in the container for several years of successful storage seed should he stored where temperature and humidity fluctuate as little as possible never put seed in an attic or an outdoor shed many seeds will remrain viable for six to eight years if kept cool

top 25 firm withum awarded 95 000 in grant funding through the thomas r suarez student loan grant program to help its employees pay off their student loans in 2021 withum instituted the thomas r suarez student loan grant in honor of a past partner in charge at the princeton office suarez had been working at the firm since he graduated from college in 1976 and unexpectedly passed away in 2020 shortly before his retirement according to theresa richardson withum s chief talent officer suarez wanted recent graduates to navigate their first job without the financial burden of student loans and to achieve their professional goals in a welcoming environment to date withum has awarded nearly 200 000 to withum members through the initiative the last thing young professionals need is to have more stress about money and if we can help eliminate that it truly is a win win for everyone said richardson we always say that life should come before work and we want to release some of the pressure they re feeling when they first come to the firm students already have so much to learn about the world and the industry and they should have the opportunity to focus on their families as well around july the company sent an email to its 2 000 employees and offered team members the opportunity to apply for a renewable 5 000 grant to help reduce their debt hr administrator julia zottman a close friend of suarez receives the applications and transfers them to the withum committee candidates need to write a brief essay explaining how the grant would help them financially and all names remain hidden to guarantee objectivity withum building in princeton n j courtesy of withumsmith brown according to a 2021 education data initiative report the average student loan debt for accounting students is around 23 000 for a bachelor s degree and 28 000 for a master s but according to sherry goode one of this year s recipients the grant extends beyond financial assistance currently working as a lead consultant on digital and technology transformation advisory services at withum s washington d c office goode said she sees the grant as an extension of withum s family culture along with its core values often referred to as the withum way our student loan grant program is a unique benefit to withum and certainly one within the accounting profession said bill hagaman withum s managing partner and ceo in a statement we recognize that our people work hard to get degrees in accounting and advisory roles which then require additional certifications and credentials such as taking the cpa exam becoming microsoft certified professionals or isc ² to further their career path with a 10 000 grant grace hounsou is one of the other 16 team members who benefited from the student loan aid she graduated from mcdaniels college in maryland with 60 000 in debt but with the help of withum and if she also qualifies for president joe biden s student loan forgiveness program hounsou will end the year debt free after paying 600 per month for the past four years and dedicating every last cent to her student loans hounsou is impatient to switch her attention to her mortgage and savings grace hounsou hounsou had her share of pain in her life she lost her mother at a young age and with her father currently incarcerated she had to make her own way toward success hounsou explains she was lucky to find a well paying job straight out of college as a tax accountant and benefit from a supportive team at withum and she says she owes it all to higher education therefore hounsou wants to start her debt free life by setting up a savings account for her future children so they ll be able to go to college without struggling as much as she did without this grant and the biden forgiveness program it would have taken me years to reimburse my debts and those are years that i am getting back said hounsou i felt that my first job wasn t very team oriented but as soon as i got here i felt very connected to my colleagues withum is really trying its best to keep us in the loop with weekly team meetings and quarterly reunions with the entire firm to tell us how the company is doing it feels very good to be heard and to feel like everyone belongs it s not the first time the national accounting and advisory firm has offered unique benefits to its staff withum offers a shadow stock program for team members to share in the success of the firm and a tuition reimbursement package for anyone looking to return to school to expand their expertise and career development nearly 10 years ago the firm also created a company sponsored team member hardship relief fund to support employees who experienced unforeseen financial hardships because of hurricane sandy in 2021 withum announced the industry s first childcare reimbursement expense program which reimburses 25 of eligible annual childcare costs for employees richardson says the program was born out of the pandemic because withum s leadership knew how difficult it was for single parents to find an acceptable work life balance to continue with those efforts the firm has embraced flexible work arrangements and provides additional fitness wellness and mental health incentives for all team members i have been here for 25 years and withum always put the people first because they truly believe human capital is their number one asset said richardson whenever we do a survey the no 1 thing that comes back is our culture and our workplace atmosphere is also what we market to applicants we are very proud to value hard work compassion and family and i think that s the heart of everything we do

however it is estimated that eighty percent of an organization s data is unstructured or only semi structured a significant portion of such unstructured and semi structured data is in the form of documents the industry and or organizations try applying analytics tools for handling their structured data in efforts of easing access data processing and data management however this does not mean that such unstructured and semi structured documents no longer exist they have been and will continue to be an important aspect of an organization s data inventory further semi structured and unstructured documents are often voluminous such documents can consist of hundreds or even thousands of individual papers for example a risk transfer underwriting document a risk transfer claim document or a purchaser s mortgage document can be stored as a single 500 page or even larger document comprising individual papers such as for the latter case the purchaser s income tax returns credit reports appraiser s reports and so forth bundled into a single mortgage document each purchaser is associated with a different mortgage document thus the size and volume of documents can be very large documents may be stored across various storage systems and or devices and may be accessed by multiple departments and individuals documents may include different types of information and may comprise various formats they may be used in many applications as e g mortgages and lending healthcare environmental and the like moreover they are draw their information from multiple sources like social networks server logs and information from banking transactions web content gps trails financial or stock market data etc more than data accumulation within organizational structures the recent years have further been characterized by a tremendous growth in natural language text data including web pages news articles scientific literature emails enterprise documents and social media data such as blog articles forum posts product reviews and tweets this has led to an increasing demand for powerful data processing tools and engines to help individuals manage and analyze vast amounts of structured semi structured and unstructured data as pure text data effectively and efficiently unlike data generated by a computer system sensors or measuring devices these text data are often generated by humans for humans without intermediary instance in particular such text data that are generated by humans for humans accumulate into an important and valuable data source for exploring human opinions and preferences or for analyzing or triggering other human driven factors in addition to many other types of knowledge that people encode in text form also since these text data are written for consumption by humans humans play a critical role in any prior art text data application system a text management and analysis system must therefore typically involve the human element in the text analysis loop according to the prior art existing tools and engines supporting text management and analysis can be divided into two categories the first category includes search engines and search engine toolkits which are especially suitable for building a search engine application but tend to have limited support for text analysis mining functions examples include lucene terrier and indri lemur the second category is text mining or general data mining and machine learning toolkits which tend to selectively support some text analysis functions but generally do not support a search capability nonetheless combining and seamlessly integrating search engine capabilities with sophisticated text analysis capabilities is necessary for two reasons while the raw data may be large for any particular problem as discussed above it is often a relatively small subset of the relevant data search engines are an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection on the other hand however we need search engines that will help analysts interpret any patterns that are discovered within the data by allowing them to examine any relevant original text data in order to make sense of any discovered pattern a possible solution should therefore emphasize a tightly controlled integration of search capabilities or text access capabilities in general with text analysis functions thus facilitating a fully supported function for building a powerful text analysis engine and tool further in the prior art there already exist different classifiers as e g meta cf meta toolkit org mallet cf mallet cs umass edu or torch cf torch ch whereas the latter is technically speaking an example for a deep learning system not a classifier as such which however can be used to build an appropriate classifier typically these classifiers allow for the application of one or more standard classifiers either alone or in combination as for example meta with naive bayes svm and or knn using bm25 as a ranking structure mallet with naive bayes max entropy decision tree and or winnow trainer or torch using deep learning approaches conv net for image and text processing under the standard classifiers naive bayes classifier nbc is one of the most widely used standard classifiers in the field of the machine learning systems often nbc is the first classifying structure that tried in the context of a new field however one of the inherent weakness of its technical assumption that features are independent bayesian networks bypass this assumption by encoding feature dependence into the structure of the network this normally works well in classification applications with substantial dependence among certain sets of features and such dependence is either known or learnable from a sufficiently large training set in the latter case one may use one of the various structure learning algorithms however they are not always operable because the structure learning problem is very complex undirected graphical models are another option for bypassing this assumption like bayesian networks they also require domain knowledge or a structure learning procedure domain knowledge can be manually coded into the structure but this only works if domain knowledge is available and even then manual coding is usually very laborious alternatively structure learning algorithms require extensive training data and present a technically and computationally complex problem in addition there is the concern of over fitting a model due to the use of a limited data set thereby creating a model that predicts structures that are less likely to work well on data not seen during training undirected graphical models typically also operate poorly if either the domain knowledge is wrong or if the instance of the structure learning problem is either intrinsically difficult or there is insufficient training data prior art systems and engines able to analyze large data sets in various ways and implementing big data approaches normally depend heavily on the expertise of the engineer who has considered the data set and its expected structure the larger the number of features of a data set sometimes called fields or attributes of a record the greater the number of possibilities for analyzing combinations of features and feature values accordingly there is a demand for modalities that facilitate automatically analyzing large data sets quickly and effectively examples of uses for the disclosed inventive classification system are inter alia the analysis of complex life or non life insurance or risk transfer submission documents means for identifying fraudulent registrations for identifying the purchasing likelihood of contacts and identifying feature dependencies to enhance an existing classification application the disclosed classification technology consistently and significantly outperforms the known prior art systems such as meta mallet or torch and their implemented classification structures such as naive bayes svm and or knn max entropy decision tree winnow trainer and or deep learning approaches there

automated or semi automated engine and system should be able to generate test data without significant human interference the system shall have the technical capability to apply a particular decision based on which a particular form can be easily and automatically added to the whole training set on the other hand the system should be able to automatically refer similar pages to a selected page or form if it is not clear how a page or data element should be classified the system should also provide structures for automatically detecting inconsistently or wrongly labeled data and it should provide appropriate warnings instead of having to label thousands of training pages which are mostly identical and thus not adding much value the system should be able to detect and flag gaps in the training data so that these gaps can be closed easily once all training and testing data have been labeled the system should also provide automated features for detecting and flagging where inconsistent labels have been assigned for the same forms finally the system should allow for an automated rating specifically regarding the good or bad quality of an ocr text quality or

in georgia this summer a fake wanted poster falsely identified a woman as a so called ballot mule in arizona voters dropping off their ballots complained about being photographed and filmed in some cases by people carrying weapons the incidents appear inspired by a film 2 000 mules that spins a wild tale of how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen from donald trump at its heart is a conspiracy theory claiming democratic groups are colluding with paid operatives the titular mules to stuff ballot drop boxes with fraudulent votes there s no evidence for any of this the film which is directed by right wing commentator dinesh d souza and relies on data and analysis from controversial election group true the vote has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked by fact checkers and rejected by law enforcement but the film is the latest in a long line of movies that use the tropes and signifiers of documentaries to gain credibility in recent years documentary style films about the 2020 election the covid 19 pandemic and vaccines have spread conspiracy theories and recycled debunked lies documentaries have been used for decades to try to make bad actors and folks who are trying to push conspiracies or push disinformation or push a specific political agenda look more professional look glamorous look like something that you can believe said jiore craig head of elections and digital integrity at the institute for strategic dialogue which tracks online extremism debunked and embraced one of the people identified as a mule in 2 000 mules is suing the film s creators for defamation true the vote s leaders were jailed this week for contempt of court in a separate matter in spite of all that many republicans have embraced the film local republican groups across the country have held screenings trump himself hosted a premiere at mar a lago its claims have been promoted by elected officials in texas and michigan and candidates for governor and secretary of state in arizona and now some are mobilizing around its false claims raising concerns over voter intimidation in the final days before the midterms what we re seeing now is a trend towards policing other people s voting behavior said emma steiner a disinformation analyst at the nonpartisan group common cause it s basically an endless template for taking a picture of someone or a video and saying oh actually what they re doing here is criminal and you can trust me on this and we need to find out who this person is and report them to the authorities true the vote referred questions about 2 000 mules to d souza who did not respond to a request for comment jell o mold to shape a lie while 2 000 mules didn t invent the big lie that trump won the 2020 election it s given coherent shape to voter fraud claims says matthew sheffield a former conservative activist who s now a correspondent for progressive news network tyt news they took all these ingredients and put them into a jell o mold and served the jell o basically sheffield said but even though the film fails to actually produce any evidence showing its core claim that people were dropping ballots at multiple drop boxes sheffield argues that s beside the point it is a narrative he said it is creating sentence structure to what had been just scattered feelings in 2 000 mules slick graphics illustrate true the vote s claims that it has cellphone location data showing mules traveling between the offices of left wing nonprofits and drop boxes but it turns out the maps don t actually correspond to the alleged data in one case a map supposedly showing atlanta was actually a stock photo of moscow this is not standard practice for documentary filmmakers we do three original sources for anything that looks anything like something we re saying or putting out into the world said director brian knappenberger whose latest project is a documentary series about online hoaxes that lead to real world harms and even if we kind of know it s true but we just can t back it up we don t do it but while mainstream documentaries like knappenberger s aim to bring a true story to a wider audience common cause s steiner said 2 000 mules serves a different purpose it gives people who ve already bought into the fiction of election fraud a satisfying story and a way to participate people feel like i can do my part by watching this movie keeping an eye out for these ballot mules and attempting to ensure that these people are not voting where i m voting she said copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

opinion magical realism is a literary style that latin americans have used for decades it is a way of storytelling in which ordinary people experience some inexplicable almost mystical phenomena they seamlessly assume a dreamlike kind of logic to what is happening as threads of fantasy are woven into the fabric of their everyday stories that are neither questioned nor explained in magical realism some things just are levitating people eerie premonitions and talking animals are all examples of things that just happen in a magical realist world magical realism is more than a literary genre though it is a way some people perceive events in their lives this is especially true in the bolivarian republic of venezuela the socialist disaster flooding our southwest border with migrants and drugs the regime simply cannot believe the surreal world it sees today they are giddy at what s going on if not for magical realism how else the venezuelans might ask could anyone explain what has happened to the united states how could u s officials travel to caracas to discuss increasing petroleum imports when the u s does not recognize the government of venezuela and its president nicolás maduro 15 million and its speaker of the house equivalent diosdado cabello rondón 10 million remain targets of u s narcotics rewards in magical realist venezuela drug trafficking represents 90 of the regime s income and is their priority while petroleum is an afterthought requiring too much thought and planning among themselves the u s visit is mocked as naive and a huge sign of how far the united states has fallen in the bubble of magical realism unbelievable things happen and disbelief is suspended even more puzzling is how the united states would come to venezuela hat in hand to ask for increased oil imports when everyone in the petroleum industry knows venezuela s state owned oil and natural gas company petróleos de venezuela pdvsa has been decimated by years of mismanagement neglect and corruption pdvsa is a shell of its former self producing less than 25 of what it did 20 years ago pdvsa used to have some 40 000 employees producing 3 4 million barrels per day now it has about 120 000 employees producing around 700 000 barrels a day pdvsa refining capability used to be 1 5 million barrels per day now it hovers around 200 000 and cannot even meet local demand if not for magical realism then how could the u s release two convicted drug traffickers serving 18 years who just happened to be the nephews of venezuela s first lady simply by concocting some pretext for a prisoner swap that no one finds credible as they utter some drivel to u s officials about increasing petroleum imports as if talking about it makes it so for more than a decade the united states imposed sanctions on venezuela for its lack of cooperation on narco trafficking human rights abuses and corruption the embassy was shuttered in 2019 and crippling sanctions on venezuela s oil exports virtually unplugged them from important financial markets now we make prisoner swaps freeing drug traffickers and go begging for oil disbelief suspended what explanation could there be for the maduro regime besides magical realism when the biden campaign signaled an open borders policy just as they were desperate to rid themselves of millions of venezuelans their socialist experiment failed although it has been very lucrative for the elites and their acolytes there hasn t been a semblance of economic stability and basic services such as education health care and reliable utilities for years the regime recognized it could collapse and their personal fates would be in peril so something had to be done the answer was to create a bolivarian diaspora which has turned into the largest refugee crisis ever in the western hemisphere using the blueprint parroted from the 1980 cuban mariel boatlift they have pushed almost a quarter of venezuela s nearly 30 million people out of the country finally in its magical realist fog the maduro regime believes it is on the cusp of accomplishing the long awaited dream of unifying the diverse nations of latin america into an all powerful socialist bloc the ghosts of simon bolivar hugo chavez and fidel castro are guiding events from the grave as the dreamlike unification advocated by the sao paulo forum is amazingly in sight the sao paulo forum is a coalition of socialist political parties and movements in latin america and is perhaps the most important political organization in the region today chavez and castro along with luiz lula da silva from brazil were the intellectual forces behind the forum its unspoken goal coincided with castro s life s purpose to bring the imperio del norte the imperialist from the north to its knees mr lula da silva has apparently won a runoff for the presidency in brazil it will not be long before he joins the mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador in leading an aggressive anti us regional coalition ultimately they will not succeed but a lot of damage could be done and the united states appears woefully unprepared to respond magical realism twists life like a funhouse mirror and conjures up a subjective reality capturing a feel for how a mystical world could be we can avoid reality by living in a world of magical realism but we cannot avoid its real world consequences venezuela is dumping drugs and its deplorables on us while they scheme with the chinese russians and cubans to freeze us out of latin america and conspire to facilitate our global demise the cold face of logic tells us pigs cannot fly and the venezuelan government cannot and should not be trusted ron maccammon is a retired u s military officer who served in venezuela he taught international relations and the government and politics of latin america at the u s military academy at west point and he has more than 30 years of experience in the region

when prices in a market fall the first instinct of many investors is to hang on and wait for values to recover but if a slide goes on long enough fear of deeper losses can outweigh such hopes when enough investors reach that breaking point and sell the result is called market capitulation it s not easy to tell in the moment many dips are followed by rebounds some observers look for signs of approaching capitulation in spiking volatility and jumps in equity put call ratios that is when investors hedge their portfolios on speculation of another selloff large scale movements out of stock funds and into cash are often taken as a signal that capitulation has arrived a chart included in a bank of america report in october on capitulation showed that spikes in cash balances have historically been taken as a bullish message to the market the idea being that once almost everyone who wants to sell has sold prices aren t likely to fall much further and that the money that investors hoard will eventually be put back into the stock market capitulation can also happen in single stocks and in other securities in the bond and commodities markets
the white house ted m gallegos community center albuquerque new mexico 4 07 p m mdt the president thank you thank you thank you applause do you all have do you have chairs to sit in you ve been

decided to make sure we defeat cancer applause no no no i m not joking now here s the deal what we did was we have a thing in the i didn t plan just going to keep you a little longer i apologize but what happened was that there s a thing in the defense department that it has a special agency that does nothing but deal with those things that are needed to keep us safe like for example everything they invented they re the ones that came up with the internet they re the ones that came up with a whole range of things that make us much safer and and i decided to set up the same thing at the department of health and human services that focuses on one thing defeating cancer defeating cancer applause and we provided an additional 5 billion grant to do that and so we re going to defeat cancer we really are there s nothing beyond our capacity one of the things that bothers me the most about sort of what s happened under the other guy s control is that we ve sort of lost confidence in ourselves we you know there s nothing we cannot do when we set our mind do it when we do it together i mean nothing nothing applause and so folks folks we are going to beat cancer and i promise you that look the other thing is that you know i tell you what that that governor of yours she s something else isn t she applause she talks about being the shortest governor she s the tallest governor i

the tribal leaders here today i look forward to them coming to the white house to the tribal nations summit we re having in a few weeks look folks in new mexico we need to el reelect your governor to state the obvious we need to elect the ballot up and down we got look that s why we re here we re here for simple reason five days five days to go and until the most important elections in our lifetime and i that s not hyperbole it s going to shape what the next two generations look like not a joke because so much is changing so much it s clear this is not a referendum this is the choice a choice between two vastly different visions of america i ve said from the beginning that my objective when i ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out an economy that rewards work not just wealth an economy that works for everybody so the poor have a ladder up the middle class do well and when that happens the wealthy still do very well man they don t need our help applause and look it s a fundamental shift and it s working compared to the maga republican trickle down economics that republicans inaudible let s take a look at the facts when i took office this economy was in ruins my predecessor was the first president the first president since herbert hoover who actually lost more jobs in four he had fewer jobs when he left than when he came in unemployment was at 6 4 percent people were really hurting hundreds of thousands of small businesses in your state and all across america they had closed today we re in a much better place although people are still hurting we got more to do but 10 million jobs created since i ve taken office that s more than any time with the help of your administration unemployment rate is 3 5 percent the lowest it s been in 50 years applause 5 4 million americans applied to start new businesses last year the highest ever in american history thanks to michelle there are small businesses in new mexico there are more of them now than before the pandemic and look guys new mexico added 32 000 jobs this past year alone in this state applause and by the way by the way you know putin s invasion of ukraine sent gas prices soaring around the world but because of the action we ve taken gas prices are coming down here in america at home they re down to 1 25 since the summer peak of 5 and look back in june back in june they were 5 average price across america it was a difficult time across america the country stepped up and did the right thing but not everyone i know we have a lot of leases out here in new mexico for oil companies and we haven t slowed them down at all they should be drilling more than they re doing now if they were drilling more we d have more more relief at the pump but the oil industry hasn t met their commitment to invest in america and support the american people one by one major oil companies reported their record profits this last quarter shell shell oil shell oil they deserve a hard return on their profit shell oil made 9 5 billion in 90 days in the last quarter in the last quarter well guess what that s been a long that s twice what they made the third quarter of last year exxon s third quarter profits this year this quarter 18 7 billion that s more than they made in their 152 year history now look i want them to make money that s fine by me but the last six months the six largest oil companies made more than 100 billion in profit in 200 days well here s the deal these companies are taking advantage the average profits they re making if they did the average profits they ve made for the last 20 years well guess what your gasoline prices would be down 50 cents a gallon no i m serious if they were investing in profits that are at a historic rate prices would come down even further but instead they re buying back their own stock primarily the way executives get paid and giving their profits to shareholders but these outrageous profits are the windfalls of war look earlier this week i made clear that the industry has a choice either invest in america or pay higher taxes for your excess profits and face restrictions applause you know it s amazing even though my republican friends in congress seem to be hoping for a recession last week s gdp report shows the economy is in fact still growing my guess is the report at the end of this week is going to show that as well the fact is the economy grew at 2 6 percent last quarter although in many it not feel that way but business income is up and guess what we have created in the united states just since i ve become president 700 000 manufacturing jobs brand new 700 000 applause so the economy is up the price of inflation is down real incomes are up gas prices are down and need to come down further exports are al also up which means a simple thing we re making a lot of money in america because of that guess what we re exporting products we made rather than jobs applause no i m serious that s why it s up we re building it in america and exporting it overseas not sending the jobs overseas to pay less and bringing it back home so folks here s one thing my predecessor promised remember he promised infrastructure week you know we re going to rebuild the country well infrastructure week lasted for four years never came it became a punchline on my watch on my watch with the help of the folks in this room we turned infrastructure into a decade a headline applause we passed the largest infrastructure bill since eisenhower s interstate highway system applause look we ve invested in our road highways bridges railroads ports airports water system clean water high speed internet look folks and by the way that includes for example i landed in your airport 7 million at the albuquerque airport already going inaudible applause look you know your governor is going to make sure that the money and it will be billions of dollars not a joke billions of dollars are coming for infrastructure here in this state applause and she s going to be making sure it s getting out the door right away to projects all across this state and folks look the american people are beginning to see the benefit of the economy that works for them families have more net worth than before the pandemic fewer families are behind on their mortgages their credit card bills than before the pandemic a lot of families are still in trouble more important americans have health insurance more than they had before before the pandemic applause you know we pay the highest prescription drug costs of anywhere in the world the same exact manufacturer of the same exact drug you sell it here in albuquerque or in washington d c it costs more than if you sell it in paris or london or anywhere else not a joke not a joke and it s wrong without a single republican vote in congress congressional democrats we finally beat big pharma applause and here s the result beginning january 1st seniors on medicare their out of pocket costs for prescription drugs can no matter what it costs no matter how much it costs it cannot be higher than 2 000 a year even if it s a 10 000 cancer drug or 12 000 applause look and one more thing if big pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation beginning next year because of the bill we passed they re going to have to write a check to medicare for the difference between what they inaudible and what applause i ve been trying this for 22 years finally beat them applause and by the way last year they raised the price of 1 200 drugs they manufacture faster than the rate of inflation but guess what it s stopping now man applause one more significant change we re capping the cost of insulin for those of you who know somebody who has diabetes and had to take insulin well guess what it only costs them 10 bucks to make it they re not going to be able to charge more than 35 for it instead of 400 applause that s the law that s not a joke and i m going to make sure that 35 buck limit is for everybody who needs it it s not just seniors and folks on top of these actions earlier this month we lowered the cost of hearing aids you know it costs you know what we re saving people you go into walgreens or walmarts this is what it s going to save it s going to save 3 000 for a pair no i m not joking three thousand bucks because you go straight and then get it at the counter and look and on top of that i m doing away with unfair hidden fees known as junk fees like surprise banking overdraft applause all of a sudden you find you got i just did it you bounce a check and you have to pay 35 bucks or 50 bucks you have an excess credit card fee of 50 bucks if you re late on your payment ending those they re gone applause and by the way those of you who are going to be you know making trips to see your relatives back east or out west further out west you buy a plane ticket and you find out after the fact that your cost of your baggage the cost of having your kid sitting next to you the cost of being having to reschedule is out of this world no more no more no hidden fees applause they got to state what it is the department of transportation is working on rules that are going to require airlines and travel sites to disclose all the fees upfront a little truth in spending you know now look republicans want to pass a tax break for the wealthy they re they re very upset you know i mean guess what i did i actually signed a law that said those 55 corporations that in 2020 and beyond made 40 billion and paid zero in taxes my god they now have to pay 15 percent applause that s less than you make you pay more than that and they re whining they re whining we re passing tax credits to help families buy energy efficient appliances put solar panels on their home do a whole range of things to weatherize saving on average experts say at least 500 per family but guess what these things we promised was to ease the burden ease the burden on people and one of the burden how many of you have any student debt audience member right here the president say goodbye applause say goodbye i promised that we d lower 10 000 minimum if you have a if you had a loan and by the way 90 percent people who earn less than 75 grand will get this that s where that s where it s going but here s the deal here s the deal thanks to her in new mexico this is the first state in the nation to make it so every citizen of the state can go to college or trade school tuition free applause i took action on the federal level we re giving up 20 billion 20 000 of relief for people with student debt 10 000 for most folks and another 10 if you had a pell grant look what have the republicans done they moaned about it they challenged it in court republican governors are trying to stop it and they re going to put a lot of people in a position buy a home start a business and so much more when that debt is relieved folks take a look at who s complaining this this i find fascinating this i find fascinating the people who are complaining the maga republicans who sit in congress had hundreds of thousands of dollars even millions of dollars in pandemic relief forgiven but they re now attacking middle class americans and student relief programs who the hell do they think they are applause look and by the way you know you have one one member from south florida he got a he had he had 1 2 million forgiven 2 1 million forgiven you know marjorie taylor greene audience booo the president she had 178 000 forgiven look i ve been able to do all this by reducing the federal deficit the very deficit the republicans voted against voted against every single one when i passed the inflation when we passed the inflation reduction act last year alone under our leadership the democrats in congress the democrats in congress now without any republican vote reduced the deficit by 1 trillion 400 billion applause one year more than any time in american history we cut the federal debt in half a fact all of this last year follows a historic drop the year before when i was first year president 350 billion reduced and we re going to do further reduce the deficit over the next decade by another 250 billion and a big part of this because of corporations are finally having to pay a tax and one more thing for the first time in a decade

times right flying out here headline gop signals plan to shrink social security they re saying it out loud congress congressional republicans eying midterm election victory that could hand them

affected only the top 1 percent of the american public come on republican leader kevin mccarthy god bless his soul and his fellow maga republicans say their number one priority these guys are saying it out loud they re telling you what they re going to do number one priority is deny medicare the right to negotiate drug prices which we just passed give the power back to big pharma so they can continue to rip us off with prescription drugs the 2 000 cap on prescriptions for seniors max gone a 35 a month cap on insulin for seniors gone savings on healthcare premiums of 800 a year for millions of you who are under the affordable care act gone and of course they re still determined to repeal the affordable care act which would mean anyone with a pre existing condition would lose their insurance folks the protections are gone as well tax credits for lower energy bills gone corporate minimum tax of 15 percent gone under the republican plan many the biggest corporations are going to go back to paying zero in taxes as they did as i told you earlier 55 of them are paying making 40 billion paid nothing look folks that s their plan it s reckless and it s irresponsible it would make inflation considerably worse badly hurt working class and middle class americans that s not all now i m told by the republicans that unless i support between election day and the end of the year unless i support reducing social security and medicare guess what audience member inaudible the president no i guarantee you i guarantee you not a shot applause look senator rick scott is in charge of elected republicans the distinguished senator from florida he has a plan he puts social security and medicare on the chopping block every five years here s what that means every five years if they gain control and pass it i ll veto it but if they somehow were able to do it congress will have to vote either to cut reduce or completely eliminate social security and medicare if they don t do anything it goes not not a joke it s no longer an entitlement program it means it s on the block every year then along came ron johnson of wisconsin the united states senator he thinks five years is too long to wait no i m serious he says every single year social security and medicare should be on the chopping block every single year if congress doesn t vote to keep it it goes away that s what they re that s the law they re introducing and it s not just social security and medicare he wants veterans benefits and everything else in the federal budget to be put at risk you know you know they re saying if we can t cooperate in cutting social security and medicare one more thing they re going to shut down the government now some of you remember when when i was vice president and barack was president the leader of the republicans did that in the senate i negotiated christmas eve i mean new year s eve day and we finally settled it and they backed down but applause but even though it didn t happen our credit rating as a nation dropped plummeted and we got hurt badly so you know going to let us to default on a debt that s totally irresponsible and they go far as threatening that default that alone has consequences there s nothing nothing that will create more chaos and more damage to the economy than this and folks look we heard republicans say they want to make permanent the dobbs decision the supreme court s decision on abortion audience booo the president denying a woman s right to choose well no matter what by the way whether it s rape incest anyway you know it all the republican congress already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right to choose michelle s opponent has promised to do the same thing here in new mexico saying he ll pass a statewide ban instead michelle repealed the 1969 law on the books that criminalized abortion applause look the bottom line is this if michelle s opponent wins the right to choose here in new mexico is going to go away and then if republicans gain control of the congress and pass a nationwide ban as the senator from from south carolina wants to do the ban on abortion i will veto it it won t happen but if we elect more senate democrats and keep control of the house we re going to be able to codify roe v wade as the law of the land applause look we passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years without any help from them the nra fought us tooth and nail your governor is committed to protecting public safety so she got gun legislation passed here in new mexico universal background checks as if that s a problem red flag laws as my son who was attorney general was the first one to get passed in the state of delaware keeping the guns out of the hands of those who harm themselves she doubled state spending for public safety and raised salaries for state police which i provided billions of dollars for people to be able to do many of her opponents meanwhile her opponents have the highest possible rating from the nra and is against a simple measure to get dangerous weapons off the street and one more thing i m coming back and i got it done once i m going to do it again eliminate assault weapons applause look folks they travel that bullet travels five times as fast as something coming out of a muzzle of a gun and guess what guess what i don t know a whole lot of deer running around wearing kevlar vests and what the hell are we talking about here what are we talking about a republican extremist isn t isn t lim extremism is not limited to social programs and the economy they re going after your right to vote and how we audience booo the president no not a joke mark my words they re going after your right to vote and who s going to count the vote folks as i spoke about this last night democracy is on the ballot this year in america it is it genuinely is it s literally on the ballot folks you know you have over 350 republican candidates for everything from state auditor all the way to secretary of state to governor who are election deniers who say that they in fact do not believe the last election was fair even every single appeal that took place was they ruled against them well guess what guess what let me close with this it s been a rough four or five years for hardworking americans a lot of families things are still pretty darn tough but the bright spots where america is reasserting itself we ve made enormous progress in just 20 months but we have more to do everything is literally at state and just at stake and it s just five days in this country that we love so dearly you know when i got elected i went to the first g7 meeting which is the largest democratic economies in the world in london and i sat down and i said america is back i know all these people because i ve been involved applause for years i d been chairman of foreign relations and i did a lot of foreign policy for barack and one of them turned to me and said for how long not a joke macron said for how long then another head of state said to me what would you say mr president what would you say joe if you picked up the paper tomorrow morning after this meeting and found out that a crazy mob stormed the british parliament broke down the doors of the house of the parliament and killed two cops in the process to overturn an election what would you say imagine if we read that in the paper tomorrow that that happened in germany or france or england we d really wonder about it well we re scaring the living hell out of the rest of the world by the way things are acting they look to us no no no not not a joke they look to us and guess what the democrats and mainstream republicans and independents if we come together we can meet this moment together applause it s not all republicans it s not all of them and i truly believe we re just getting started because i ve never been more optimistic about america s future we have to remember who we are we re the united states of america applause and there s nothing nothing nothing we beyond our capacity if we do it together together so vote get out the vote vote vote vote vote and may god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you thank you thank you thank you applause 4 36 p m mdt
fairfax county va virginia has three competitive races in the 2022 house elections the 2nd 7th and 10th congressional districts and they re all trending republican in the final days before election night a week ago the nonpartisan cook political repor t moved the 7th congressional district from lean democrat to toss up and the 10th congressional district from solid democrat to likely democrat the 2nd congressional district remains a toss up according to the report and last week fox news moved the 2nd congressional district from toss up to lean republican all three congressional districts changed because of the virginia supreme court s redistricting decision in december 2021 all three republican challengers are running for congress for the first time and all three democrat incumbents are two term congresswomen who belonged to the class of 2018 part of the blue wave in the last midterm elections the three potentially competitive races in virginia with democratic incumbents could be a national bellwether veteran virginia political analyst bob holsworth told the epoch times if luria wins it ll be a better night for democrats than the conventional wisdom foresees if spanberger loses a close race to vega we could see a gop victory in line with historic midterm trends of a 20 seat pickup for the party not holding the presidency if wexton loses it s a red wave due to virginia s off year state legislative elections midterm ballots are short hence the vote counts are expected to be quicker than in other states sean brown vice president of axiom strategies which advises republican challenger yesli vega s campaign in the 7th congressional district told the epoch times that vega is going to kick off a big win for republicans across the country i do think we re going to be that first one that goes and then it will be a night for republicans brown said former u s congresswoman tulsi gabbard 3rd l republican congressional candidate yesli vega 4th l and virginia delegate tara durant pose with deputies at the stafford county sheriff s office at a campaign event for vega in fredericksburg va on oct 22 2022 terri wu the epoch times vega a prince william county supervisor and former police officer is challenging two term incumbent rep abigail spanberger d va in virginia s most competitive congressional race brown called the 7th congressional district race a bellwether for how republicans do around the country according to him virginia s 7th congressional district is democrat leaning on paper in a normal year with a normal candidate the district which mainly spans prince william stafford and spotsylvania counties has become slightly more democrat leaning after redistricting in 2021 but you ve got a unique candidate with a unique story running in a year against a candidate from a very unpopular party with an unpopular president and unpopular economy around their neck brown said and i think that s the story we see play out across the country republicans in virginia expect jen kiggans a virginia state senator and navy veteran to unseat rep elaine luria d va in the 2nd congressional district which includes virginia beach and nearby localities a late october poll by the wason center of christopher newport university cnu shows luria and kiggans tied at 45 percentage points each with 8 percent of voters still undecided in the 10th congressional district which covers loudoun county and part of prince william county republican candidate hung cao a navy veteran takes on jennifer wexton d va if hung cao wins in the 10th then it s going to be a red wave across the country that is probably the tightest one with the capability of flipping ron wright a co founder of the suburban virginia republican coalition told the epoch times wright described the current political cycle as generational this is a whole new republican generation coming through whether it s glenn youngkin ron desantis tom cotton yesli and hung cao he said it s new lifeblood for the party and that s where our cycles are once you get a generation that stays in and wins the next generations come again so you re seeing all these young conservative republicans running for office now wright noted that he expects to see many interesting republican candidates in the race for the 2024 presidential election which issues will win former virginia gov jim gilmore a republican said three things matter a lot in elections the definition of the district the dominating issues that will sway independents and the quality of the candidate he had helped with the 7th and 10th congressional district campaigns and saw republican advantages on each of the above factors former virginia gov jim gilmore at a campaign event for republican congressional candidate yesli vega in fredericksburg va on oct 17 2022 terri wu the epoch times gilmore said virginia s election results like in the rest of the nation would confirm whether the public cared more about republican campaign issues such as inflation border and crimes or democrat issues such as abortion and former president donald trump the cnu poll in the 2nd congressional district shows that independents and republicans consider inflation and the economy as top issues and the top issue for democrats in the district is abortion gilmore noted that the education issue also became prominent in the virginia midterms the underlying issue is whether there s going to be a quality education or whether it s going to be a pileup indoctrination of culture which i believe the public is rejecting and they rejected it in the youngkin race he told the epoch times they don t want to see the schools become indoctrination centers for students on nov 1 the three incumbents held a joint press conference criticizing house republicans commitment to america midterms agenda that included a goal to save and strengthen social security and medicare the three congresswomen interpreted the agenda as cutting these federal programs 7th congressional district race spanberger has run her reelection campaign as a moderate candidate who isn t afraid of challenging authorities in september she called for a day earlier the democratic party of virginia issued a statement criticizing vega s position against abortion spanberger has run her reelection campaign as a moderate candidate who isn t afraid of challenging authorities in september she called for new democrat leadership after house speaker nancy pelosi d calif didn t support her legislation to ban members of congress from trading individual stocks she has also been running tv ads of endorsements from a local republican police chief and former virginia republican congressman for gilmore the 7th congressional district race is the most important because abigail spanberger is a real problem she s a liberal democrat she votes that way but she pretends to be something different he said silvia ramirez l a member of casa in action the political arm of the immigration rights nonprofit with rep abigail spanberger d va in woodbridge va on oct 22 2022 terri wu the epoch times holsworth the analyst disagreed he said spanberger was the best democratic candidate in the state she has voted mostly with democrats but at the same time has certainly worked in a bipartisan way he said noting that spanberger had proven to be an independent voice in terms of bipartisan credentials spanberger probably has more than vega right now but vega does have an opportunity for some crossover vote holsworth was referring to hispanic voters who previously tended to vote democrat but now tend to vote republican hispanic votes hispanic votes make up representatives for spanberger s campaign didn t respond to a request by the epoch times for comment by press time hispanic votes make up 17 percent of total voters in the 7th congressional district the election result there would demonstrate how much of the latino vote has shifted to republicans wright said noting that some of the heavy latino precincts in prince william county would be interesting to follow the county has about 35 percent of the total voters in the district he thought the hispanic support of republicans was a continued trend that might have been disrupted by covid 19 but is now back more middle class latino voters are realizing just how damaging democratic policies are so it s a shift they start to realize the tax burden and the economic burdens and they re starting to shift their priorities wright said he noted that the hispanic voting results would indicate whether economic and education issues or racial justice and immigration reform are more important to latino voters trump endorsement former president donald trump recently endorsed vega spanberger s campaign used the endorsement to garner more voter support wright said focusing on trump wouldn t work because it didn t work in the gubernatorial race last year former virginia gov terry mcauliffe a democrat and youngkin s opponent had campaigned on tying youngkin to trump virginia gov glen youngkin l at a campaign event for republican congressional district candidate yesli vega in fredericksburg va on oct 17 2022 terri wu the epoch times the youngkin factor brown said vega s campaign built on the movement that started last year youngkin won the governorship by identifying the voter sentiment and running on kitchen table issues axiom strategies advised youngkin s campaign in 2021 and vega co led a hispanic coalition and helped youngkin win brown said vega s campaign built on the movement that started last year youngkin won the governorship by identifying the voter sentiment and running on kitchen table issues axiom strategies advised youngkin s campaign in 2021 and vega co led a hispanic coalition and helped youngkin win hispanic votes in the state i think when you have one of spanberger s top surrogates guzman talking about legislation that would jail parents for not affirming woke ideology of a 9 year old that s the exact kind of stuff that people rejected last year with what was going on in schools brown said in mid october guzman a democratic state delegate backed down from introducing legislation to expand the definition of child abuse to include inflicting physical or mental injury on children because of their gender identity or sexual orientation when she first announced the measure she said parents who don t affirm their children s choice of gender identity could incur child protective services charges holsworth agrees that vega is trying to harness the momentum that youngkin had last year but he questioned whether the parental rights issue which in his view had a lot to do with people frustrated with a year and a half of covid and their kids not in school would sway independents it just seems to me that in this election the issues that are driving voters who are going to make the difference are really other matters holsworth said it s what they think about inflation what they think about biden what they think about the dobbs decision what do you think about abortion youngkin for his part has been full throated in his support for republican nominees in his state having attended many rallies for vega kiggans cao and other republican candidates his empowering virginia parents pac has spent more than 400 000 for the 2nd 7th and 10th congressional district races according to the virginia public access project a nonprofit organization connecting virginians with nonpartisan political information when stumping for candidates in and outside virginia youngkin repeatedly said the red wave movement that propelled him to victory in last year s gubernatorial race is happening again and he credited virginia as the headwaters of the movement representatives for wexton s and luria s campaigns didn t respond to requests by the epoch times for comment by press time
in georgia this summer a fake wanted poster falsely identified a woman as a so called ballot mule in arizona voters dropping off their ballots complained about being photographed and filmed in some cases by people carrying weapons the incidents appear inspired by a film 2 000 mules that spins a wild tale of how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen from donald trump at its heart is a conspiracy theory claiming democratic groups are colluding with paid operatives the titular mules to stuff ballot drop boxes with fraudulent votes there s no evidence for any of this the film which is directed by right wing commentator dinesh d souza and relies on data and analysis from controversial election group true the vote has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked by fact checkers and rejected by law enforcement but the film is the latest in a long line of movies that use the tropes and signifiers of documentaries to gain credibility in recent years documentary style films about the 2020 election the covid 19 pandemic and vaccines have spread conspiracy theories and recycled debunked lies documentaries have been used for decades to try to make bad actors and folks who are trying to push conspiracies or push disinformation or push a specific political agenda look more professional look glamorous look like something that you can believe said jiore craig head of elections and digital integrity at the institute for strategic dialogue which tracks online extremism debunked and embraced one of the people identified as a mule in 2 000 mules is suing the film s creators for defamation true the vote s leaders were jailed this week for contempt of court in a separate matter in spite of all that many republicans have embraced the film local republican groups across the country have held screenings trump himself hosted a premiere at mar a lago its claims have been promoted by elected officials in texas and michigan and candidates for governor and secretary of state in arizona and now some are mobilizing around its false claims raising concerns over voter intimidation in the final days before the midterms what we re seeing now is a trend towards policing other people s voting behavior said emma steiner a disinformation analyst at the nonpartisan group common cause it s basically an endless template for taking a picture of someone or a video and saying oh actually what they re doing here is criminal and you can trust me on this and we need to find out who this person is and report them to the authorities true the vote referred questions about 2 000 mules to d souza who did not respond to a request for comment jell o mold to shape a lie while 2 000 mules didn t invent the big lie that trump won the 2020 election it s given coherent shape to voter fraud claims says matthew sheffield a former conservative activist who s now a correspondent for progressive news network tyt news they took all these ingredients and put them into a jell o mold and served the jell o basically sheffield said but even though the film fails to actually produce any evidence showing its core claim that people were dropping ballots at multiple drop boxes sheffield argues that s beside the point it is a narrative he said it is creating sentence structure to what had been just scattered feelings in 2 000 mules slick graphics illustrate true the vote s claims that it has cellphone location data showing mules traveling between the offices of left wing nonprofits and drop boxes but it turns out the maps don t actually correspond to the alleged data in one case a map supposedly showing atlanta was actually a stock photo of moscow this is not standard practice for documentary filmmakers we do three original sources for anything that looks anything like something we re saying or putting out into the world said director brian knappenberger whose latest project is a documentary series about online hoaxes that lead to real world harms and even if we kind of know it s true but we just can t back it up we don t do it but while mainstream documentaries like knappenberger s aim to bring a true story to a wider audience common cause s steiner said 2 000 mules serves a different purpose it gives people who ve already bought into the fiction of election fraud a satisfying story and a way to participate people feel like i can do my part by watching this movie keeping an eye out for these ballot mules and attempting to ensure that these people are not voting where i m voting she said copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
