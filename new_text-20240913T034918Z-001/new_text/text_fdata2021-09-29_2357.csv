this was originally published as a skadden client alert on august 10 2021 on august 6 2021 the securities and exchange commission sec approved1 the nasdaq stock market s nasdaq proposal to amend its listing standards to encourage greater board diversity and to require board diversity disclosures for nasdaq listed companies subject to transition periods and limited exceptions nasdaq listed companies will be required to i publicly disclose board level diversity statistics on an annual basis using a standardized matrix template under nasdaq rule 5606 and ii have or disclose why they do not have a minimum of two diverse board members under nasdaq rule 5605 f 2 the mandatory board diversity matrix disclosure and the comply or explain board diversity framework are described in greater detail below background original proposal on december 1 2020 nasdaq filed its original proposal with the sec to amend its listing standards related to board diversity and enhanced diversity disclosures the original proposal set forth board diversity matrix disclosure and board member diversity objectives in response the sec received over 200 comment letters of which the overwhelming majority supported the goals of the proposed rule some commenters however requested revision or clarification of the proposed rule to account for factors such as board size burdens on newly listed companies feasibility of near term compliance and alignment of additional disclosures with existing disclosure timelines amended proposal on february 26 2021 nasdaq amended the original proposal to address commenters concerns in particular the amended proposal i allows companies with five or fewer board members to meet the board diversity objective by having only one instead of two diverse directors ii grants newly listed companies additional time to comply with the diversity objective and iii provides a grace period for regaining compliance with the rule in the event that a director s departure and subsequent board vacancy results in a company falling out of compliance sec approval in a 3 2 vote the sec approved the amended proposal in its entirety sec chair gary gensler noted that hese rules will allow investors to gain a better understanding of nasdaq listed companies approach to board diversity while ensuring that those companies have the flexibility to make decisions that best serve their shareholders 3 new nasdaq rules board diversity matrix format and categories nasdaq rule 5606 will require companies to disclose in a standardized matrix set forth in the rule or in a substantially similar format i the total number of company board members and ii how those board members self identify regarding gender predefined race and ethnicity categories4 and lgbtq status nasdaq published sample matrix disclosures to demonstrate how companies can comply with the rule foreign private issuers fpis must disclose a similar matrix but they can apply a broader definition of diversity and report the number of individuals who self identify as underrepresented in their home country jurisdiction based on national racial ethnic indigenous cultural religious or linguistic identity matrices require aggregated disclosures instead of identifying individual directors by name and directors will not be compelled to identify as a member of any group in which case the matrix will reflect a response of undisclosed this disclosure requirement would not preclude companies from providing more detailed diversity disclosures such as on an individual basis in addition to the matrix required by nasdaq rule 5606 publication companies will be required to publish the board diversity matrix in their annual meeting proxy statement or alternatively on the company s website provided that the company submits a link to the information through the nasdaq listing center no later than 15 calendar days following the annual meeting after the first year of publishing the statistics companies would disclose the board diversity matrix for both the current and the immediately preceding year on an annual basis compliance date all nasdaq listed companies must comply with the board diversity matrix disclosure rule by the later of i august 8 2022 or ii the date the company files its proxy statement for its 2022 annual meeting of shareholders or if the company does not file a proxy statement in its annual report on form 10 k or 20 f 5 if a company files its 2022 proxy statement or its annual report on form 10 k or 20 f before august 8 2022 and does not include the matrix the company will have until august 8 2022 to disclose its matrix either i on the company s website or ii in an amended annual report such as on form 10 k or 20 f appointment of diverse directors comply or explain nasdaq rule 5605 f requires companies to have at least two diverse board members or to explain the company s reasons for not meeting this diversity objective for u s issuers one diverse director must self identify as female and the other director must self identify as either a racial or ethnic minority or a member of the lgbtq community companies may comply with the rule by having two directors who self identify in racial or ethnic categories beyond those described in the nasdaq rule and explaining that the company considers diversity more broadly than the categories defined in the rule 6 smaller reporting companies and fpis also will be required to have two diverse directors at least one of whom identifies as female but companies may satisfy the diversity requirement for the second director by appointing a second director who identifies as female unlike u s issuers fpis may satisfy the board diversity requirement under the broader definition of diversity applicable to the matrix disclosures by appointing a director who self identifies as an underrepresented individual based on national racial ethnic indigenous cultural religious or linguistic identity in the company s home country jurisdiction companies with five or fewer board members can meet the board diversity objective by having only one instead of two diverse directors transition period the phase in period depends on a company s listing tier as nasdaq recognizes that smaller companies may face greater director recruitment challenges while all companies are expected to have at least one diverse director within two years by august 7 2023 larger companies listed on the nasdaq global select market or nasdaq global market tiers have four years from august 6 2021 so by august 6 2025 to have two diverse directors while smaller companies listed on the nasdaq capital market tier have five years until august 6 2026 to appoint a second diverse director companies that do not meet the applicable board diversity objective by the end of the phase in period will not be subject to delisting provided that they publicly disclose the reasons they did not satisfy the objective similar to the disclosure requirements for the board diversity matrix a company needs to publish such explanation in its annual meeting proxy statement or on the company s website provided that the company furnishes nasdaq with timely notice of website location nasdaq will verify that companies have provided an explanation in the event of noncompliance but will not evaluate the disclosure from a substantive perspective companies that have not appointed a sufficient number of diverse directors also will be eligible to access through nasdaq free services to help identify suitable diverse board candidates 7 compliance considerations limited exemptions both rules are broadly applicable exempting only a limited number of investment and other companies that do not have boards are not operating companies or do not list equity securities special purpose acquisition companies spacs are exempt from the rules until the completion of their initial business combination companies may reference nasdaq s related faqs to understand and assess compliance with the new rules next steps nasdaq listed companies should assess their board composition and director succession planning in light of the amended listing standards and consider any necessary changes to the information they request from directors in order to comply with the new director diversity matrix requirements in 2022 in addition companies should consider the voting policies and guidelines of their significant shareholders which may reflect board diversity expectations that differ in scope or timing from the nasdaq rules _______________ 1 see securities and exchange commission order approving proposed rule changes august 6 2021 2 the text of the amended nasdaq rule 5605 and new nasdaq rule

editor s note opinion by dana m peterson for cnn business perspectives peterson is an executive vice president and chief economist at the conference board the opinions expressed in this commentary are her own high costs for everything from food and gasoline to automobiles and airline tickets have made the pandemic that much more difficult for us consumers so of course many were relieved to see that consumer prices rose by less than expected in august but this unfortunately isn t the beginning of the end of inflation for american households in fact consumers may not see lower prices until the latter half of 2022 the total consumer price index cpi rose by 5 3 year over year in august after hitting 5 4 on an annual basis two months earlier the core index which excludes volatile food and energy components rose by 4 year over year in august after cresting at 4 5 in june importantly the month over month rates of increase in each of these gauges 0 3 for the total index 0 1 for the core measure were notably slower than they were over the last several months these figures tease the hope that the worst of the inflationary pressures may be behind us but it is likely a false aspiration yes the intensity of price hikes slowed over the summer but the delta variant and its disruptions risk another bout of us consumer price spikes in the fall even if they do not occur consumers are unlikely to see lower prices this year thanks to computer chip shortages rising wage pressures as businesses reopen and the return of rent hikes delta variant the delta variant may prompt monthly price increases and consequently year over year readings to temporarily worsen before improving the delta variant has renewed major supply chain disruptions as factories in asia that provide the united states with consumers goods are shutting down also as spending on in person services amid the delta surge like going to bars and restaurants remains flat powerful demand for durable goods like clothing and furniture will persist as businesses struggle to stock their shelves customers prices will continue to rise this is particularly bad timing with the winter holiday shopping season just around the corner chip shortage the global semiconductor shortage cannot be solved overnight suggesting higher prices of new cars and high tech gadgets that use computer chips a deficit of used cars to satisfy buyers unable to purchase a new vehicle will simultaneously push these prices higher labor costs the delta variant may temporarily slow in person services activity but once beyond the shock of the latest virus resurgence prices at places like amusement parks sporting events and bars may continue to pop as those businesses reopen amid a major national labor shortage with some potential workers fearing infections closed schools keeping many moms at home older workers retiring and still generous unemployment benefits in some states keeping others on the sidelines labor costs are likely to continue creeping up indeed businesses are already passing some of their higher wage costs onto customers rents meanwhile the prices of actual rents and owners equivalent rent the money that a homeowner might receive if she put her house up for rent which typically tracks the ups and downs of actual rents are likely to take off during the pandemic strong demand for owned home purchases depressed rents however as more people are priced out of the hot housing market and young people who escaped to their parents homes outside of city centers during the pandemic return to urban life demand for rental units should rebound they will probably rise concurrent with demand and push consumer prices upward over the next nine to 12 months the delta variant s prolonging voracious consumer demand for goods in the very short run as well as ongoing pressures on wages surges in reopening costs for services like airlines and hotels and rent normalization all suggest pinched wallets for many more months to come indeed the cpi may hold in the 4 to 5 year on year range into 2022 more than twice its 20 year average of 2 also the total and core personal consumption expenditure inflation rates which the federal reserve watches closely since they measure the prices of goods and services that consumers purchase may not settle back near the central bank s 2 target until the second half of 2022 while nine or 10 more months of lofty prices is not an eternity in economic terms it may feel like one to consumers so if households longer term three to five years inflation expectations continue to creep higher then the fed may be prompted to signal higher interest rates sooner than expected typically if consumers expect prices to continue rising sharply over the longer run then the fed will increase interest rates to prevent runaway inflation from occurring so while the august cpi report was better than expected prices were still very high in the month and it is very likely that inflationary pressure probably will be with us for a while longer the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

by daniel john sobieski a horse is a horse of course of course and no one can talk to a horse unless of course that talking horse is the famous sleepy joe let out on work release by the handlers he always says he will get in trouble with dementia joe biden addressed a handful of carefully selected reporters with prepared questions and promised that those responsible would be punished and there would be consequences oh no not those responsible for flooding our borders with untested unmasked and unvaccinated illegal aliens and then shipping them at taxpayer expense to communities around the nation where they are free to wander burden our health education and criminal justice systems when they commit crimes want to witness the mother of all super spreader events just look at the border that joe biden has flung wide open certainly not those responsible for the afghanistan withdrawal debacle which created a terrorist state armed with billions in state of the art american weaponry that has resumed public executions getting 13 u s servicemen needlessly killed and then flying out hundreds of thousands of untested unmasked unvaccinated and unknown refugees as american citizens were shamelessly left behind joe biden did not get angry and promise to punish those responsible for the droning of an innocent afghan and his family including seven children loading containers of water in their car he needed a media sorry about revenging the deaths of the 13 american servicemen he got killed just as he needs a media story about horsemen whipping migrants to distract from the letting in of covid infected illegal aliens into american towns and cities joe biden did not threaten to punish the rogue cop who violated every police manual ever written to murder yes murder unarmed trump supporter ashlii babbitt on jan 6 at the capitol you do not shoot to kill unarmed people whose intentions are unknown and when the imminent danger of physical harm is not present joe biden s wrath is reserved for and laser focused on the u s border patrol for using horses to control the throngs of haitian refugees which joe biden invited into the country to congregate in squalor under a del rio texas bridge on this side of our supposedly closed border says the presidential horse whisperer president biden on friday issued a stern warning to border patrol agents seen this week chasing migrants on horseback vowing those people will pay amid an ongoing investigation into the images which some democrats have claimed showed agents whipping migrants the president said border patrol agents were victimizing migrants horses run them over people being strapped however critics have pointed out the agents were holding onto reins to control the horses not whips or straps for migrants of course i take responsibility biden said i m president but it was horrible what you saw to see people treated like they did horses barely running over people being strapped it s outrageous biden said i promise you those people will pay there will be an investigation underway now and there will be consequences there will be consequences he added that it is an embarrassment but beyond an embarrassment it s dangerous it s wrong he said it sends the wrong message around the world it sends the wrong message at home it is joe biden that is beyond embarrassment and is dangerous the message that joe biden is sending is the wrong message that we won t enforce our laws or our borders and will punish those who risk their lives daily to do so forget the dozens of border patrol agents who have contracted covid 19 forget the border patrol agents hospitalized when haitians commandeered a bus they thought was taking them to be deported mounted law enforcement has been used in a variety of settings throughout our history reins are used to control the horses not whip migrants agents use reins to keep migrants from getting too close to the horses risking spooking them and getting injured professional democratic race baiters like mad maxine waters and al tawana brawley sharpton portray mounted border patrol agents as echoes of slavery past forgetting that the last time slaves were whipped it was at the hands of democratic plantation owners it was democrats who blocked the selma bridge unleashed the dogs turned on the fire hoses stood in the schoolhouse door and wrote the jim crow laws and if race were a factor explain the threat by the secretary of hhs that cubans that attempted to sail to florida fleeing their oppression would be forcibly turned away why wasn t that racist ah cubans tend to be republicans and would not fit into the democratic plan to import migrants as a new voter base in a plan to change the electoral demographics of america the fact is that most haitians under the del rio bridge were not victims of oppression and in fact had achieved refugee status in various countries like brazil and chile and headed north only when joe biden extended them an invitation and grabbed all the free stuff including their absentee ballots an immigration expert in del rio texas says all of the haitian illegal immigrants he has interviewed among the 15 000 huddled at the u s mexico border in squalid conditions have lived pretty good lives in chile or brazil for the past several years i ve never met one yet who is actually coming directly from haiti but they will probably apply for asylum on the basis of in haiti said todd bensman a senior national security fellow at the center for immigration studies and author of america s covert border war the reporting by bensman who has interviewed migrants for more than a year in his traveling through guatemala and mexico was featured by new york post columnist miranda devine bensman said the haitians in del rio were living a pretty good life but they are seeing an opportunity to improve their situation the haitians according to bensman say they heard joe biden was opening the border up so they came if you open the border joe they will come perhaps that s the whole idea since you recently celebrated the fact that america was becoming minority white on tuesday vice president joe biden said it will be a good thing when whites are an absolute minority in america in 2017 the u s census though has projected that america will be a majority minority nation in 2044 the census report released in march also projected that by 2060 nearly one in five of the nation s total population is projected to be foreign born by 2017 those of us of european stock will be an absolute minority in the united states of america biden said at a state department luncheon for brazilian president dilma rousseff according to pool reports biden added that that s not a bad thing that s a good thing because it means the country is becoming more diverse which part of e pluribus unum does joe biden not understand we already welcome legal immigrants from all over the world but america was supposed to be a melting pot and not a salad bar we are a nation of laws and not men and not a collection of tribes either enforce the laws joe and quit horsing around daniel john sobieski is a former editorial writer for investor s

new york afp it was a bad day for us stocks on tuesday sept 28 as poor consumer confidence data rising bond yields and fears of a debt default caused indices to sink sharply trading started on a sour note when the conference board reported its us consumer confidence index slumped for the third straight month as the fast spreading delta variant of covid 19 made americans wary of economic conditions there was little apparent progress throughout the day in washington where lawmakers must approve both a resolution to keep the government running and an increase in the debt ceiling to prevent a default which the treasury warned could come around oct 18 the impasse fuelled a selloff on wall street and the benchmark dow jones industrial average closed 1 6 per cent lower at 34 299 99 the broad based s p 500 fell 2 per cent to 4 352 63 while the tech rich nasdaq composite index lost 2 8 per cent to 14 546 68 analysts at wells fargo pointed to an increase in yields on us treasury bonds saying they are inciting a perceived risk off mood the benchmark 10 year bond was yielding nearly 1 55 per cent shortly after markets closed traders are looking ahead to thursday s joint testimony before congress by treasury secretary janet yellen and federal reserve chairman jerome powell yellen will likely again warn of the dire consequences of not raising the debt ceiling and also face questions about president joe biden s twin proposals to overhaul us infrastructure and social services at the cost of trillions of dollars
boston sept 28 2021 prnewswire stealth biotherapeutics corp nasdaq mito a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of novel therapies for diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction announced today the presentation of positive elamipretide data showing improvements in mitochondrial respiration and heart muscle function in tissue from failing human hearts at the international society for heart research north american section meeting 2021 problems in energy production are well characterized in pediatric and adult heart failure and postulated to be centrally involved in impaired cardiac function in these patients in this study mitochondria and muscle fibers from the explanted failing left ventricle were isolated from adult and pediatric patients undergoing cardiac transplant post organ transplantation the effects of elamipretide on mitochondrial respiration and muscle function were determined in the laboratory mitochondrial respiration was decreased in heart tissue from patients with pediatric cardiomyopathy compared to explanted tissue from non failing hearts study findings showed that these impairments in respiration were significantly improved with elamipretide treatment in the pediatric hearts the study also demonstrated that elamipretide treatment improved both contraction and relaxation in muscle fibers isolated from failing hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy this study builds upon our previously published findings that elamipretide improves mitochondrial and muscle fiber function in heart tissue isolated from the failing human heart the observation of improved mitochondrial function from pediatric cardiomyopathy is very encouraging as there are currently no therapies that target mitochondrial dysfunction in this patient population these data are consistent with our observed effects of elamipretide across other types of heart failure including idiopathic cardiomyopathy and metabolic muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy said dr brian stauffer chief of cardiology at denver health medical center and professor of medicine cardiology at the university of colorado anschutz medical campus who was the lead author on the study about stealth we are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of novel therapies for

treasury secretary janet yellen warned lawmakers tuesday that the federal government could run short of cash to pay its bills by oct 18 unless congress acts quickly to increase the government s borrowing authority the warning at an appearance before the senate banking committee comes amid a standoff in congress over the so called debt ceiling senate republicans blocked a measure to increase or suspend the debt ceiling on monday yellen said the exact date was subject to change given the unpredictability of the government s cash flows but she made it clear that failure to clinch a deal by mid october would lead to the first default in u s history an event she has described as catastrophic for the economy it would be disastrous for the american economy for global financial markets and for millions of families and workers yellen told senators she warned that social security benefits child tax credits and paychecks for the military could all be jeopardized if the federal government is unable to borrow more money yellen cautioned that even flirting with a default could rattle financial markets she recalled an earlier standoff during the obama administration in 2011 when congress waited until the last minute to raise the debt limit resulting in higher borrowing costs for both the government and consumers this would be a manufactured crisis we have imposed on this country yellen said it would be a self inflicted wound of enormous proportions sen john kennedy r la pressed yellen on why democrats don t simply raise the debt ceiling on their own using a procedural move to sidestep the need for gop support why don t y all just do it and then we don t have this fight kennedy asked let s go have a cocktail kevin dietsch getty images getty images sen john kennedy r la said democrats can deal with the debt ceiling on their own through reconciliation freeing up the republicans to get a cocktail democrats pushed back noting that more than a quarter of the federal debt that the government needs to pay was accumulated during the trump administration i wonder if secretary yellen takes you up on that offer to go get a cocktail if you would pay or you d skip out on paying the bill and expect secretary yellen to pay committee chairman sherrod brown d ohio asked kennedy there were signs the political stalemate is making investors nervous at a time when high inflation and the continuing pandemic are already hitting markets stocks fell sharply tuesday while the yield on government bonds increased powell pressed on fed s stock trading controversy federal reserve chairman jerome powell who also appeared before the committee echoed yellen on the importance of avoiding a government default powell was also pressed about the recent revelations that two regional federal reserve bank presidents actively traded in securities last year while the central bank was deeply involved in financial markets dallas fed president robert kaplan and boston fed president eric rosengren both announced their retirements on monday while both men have defended their trading as in compliance with the fed s ethics rules powell acknowledged those rules need to be tightened the appearance is just obviously unacceptable powell said our need to sustain the public s trust is the essence of our work copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

the federal fiscal year ends this week and once again congress is scrambling to get its act together and as the prospect of government shutdown looms so does the wilder prospect of the government running out of cash and defaulting on its debt as always political differences and partisan wars make the money process difficult but two key elements of procedure also feature in the showdown raising the stakes and defining the battlefield one is the debt limit the other are the senate rules that allow the minority party to stop legislation cold the two are intertwined at this moment because the debt limit suspended three times during the trump administration has passed its latest suspension date the treasury department has for weeks been using extraordinary measures to cover the checks it writes and also honor bonds that come due without a green light from congress to borrow more money the treasury will be unable to continue this stopgap accounting next month that means checks you might be expecting from the government would bounce and the u s would be in default on its obligations for the first time in its history the financial consequences both short term and long could be severe and getting that done in the usual fashion has been thrown into question with republican threats to filibuster the debt limit suspension democrats are seeking in the senate curiously both these potentially crucial elements became ensconced in congressional practice in a single year a century ago a year that changed the country in many ways cloture s origin story in 1917 the country was confronting momentous issues of war conscription prohibition and votes for women all at once but the premier preoccupation was with war the year began with germany escalating to unrestricted submarine warfare against u s shipping to great britain congress moved to arm merchant ships against these attacks but the bill died in the senate after a filibuster by a dozen senators who saw it as a backdoor u s entry into the war they blocked a vote in the waning days of a congressional session and the bill died when the session ended at the time there was no procedure for cutting off such an extended debate which had been a senator s right since the early 1800s the weapon existed but was rarely used reserved for paramount issues such as creating a national bank or limiting slavery arming the merchant ships seemed to be just such an issue to the filibustering group whom president woodrow wilson immediately condemned as a little band of willful men wilson called a special session and a manifesto supporting his bill and denouncing the anti war senators was signed by 75 senators on top of that the senate adopted a rule that established cloture for the first time allowing a supermajority to cut off debate and force a vote the rule was adopted after six hours of debate by a vote of 76 to 3 war fever brought more change that lopsided vote expressed the war fever gripping much of the country in march 1917 most americans had been opposed to involvement in the war that convulsed europe beginning in 1914 wilson had campaigned in 1916 on the slogan he kept us out of war now wilson was not only for arming merchant vessels he also was moving toward an outright declaration of war one big reason was a telegram that had been disclosed purporting to reveal a german plot to get mexico to make war on the united states the reward for mexico was supposed to have been the return of the territory that had become texas new mexico and arizona this so called zimmermann telegram did not transform american attitudes as violently as the japanese attack on pearl harbor would in 1941 and the terror attacks of sept 11 would again in 2001 but it moved the country and it moved the congress ap ap president woodrow wilson delivers a speech to a joint session of congress in april 1917 requesting a declaration of war against germany wilson got his declaration of war in april 1917 congress began considering a draft to bulk up the peacetime army and a 4 billion appropriation to bolster all the armed services as quickly as possible congress passed the war revenue act raising income and corporation taxes a new tax on inheritances and an excess profits tax and higher taxes on tobacco and a host of amusements and other luxury items but tax money comes in gradually and much more money was needed right away in the month congress declared war it also passed the first liberty bond act to provide the initial billions in financing in september it passed a second such act this time including a limit on the overall indebtedness of the u s at 15 billion the idea was to make the debt more palatable by keeping a lid on it at least theoretically congress added the debt limit by statute it is not a constitutional amendment that means it could be altered or done away with at any time by the passage of another statute and indeed that original limit would have to be raised in the course of the war which eventually involved more than 20 billion in five bond issues before and after the fighting ended this can also be seen as a nod to fiscal conservatives at the time and to those elements of the nation s population either opposed to the war or ambivalent at best americans with german backgrounds were distressed and in many cases persecuted and many americans with irish heritage were incensed by great britain s suppression of ireland s bid for independence in the easter rising of 1916 the debt limit has often been circumvented but never abolished the debt limit language also acted to ease the process of issuing new debt which had previously been done through short term instruments that were neither efficient nor sufficient for the fiscal task of a modern war as longtime congress scholars thomas e mann and norman j ornstein wrote in 2012 the drive to enable congress to issue longer term debt instruments even for specific appropriations both lowered interest costs and made the borrowing easier for the treasury department mann and ornstein noted that the limit had long since become vestigial especially after congress consolidated federal borrowing in the late 1930s anticipating the arrival of world war ii for most of the 20th century congress simply raised the debt limit to whatever was needed to accommodate the budgets already enacted from 1979 to 1994 this was accomplished in the adoption of the annual budget resolution it should surprise no one that the limit has been raised or suspended nearly 100 times since its creation more than 80 times between 1960 and 2017 and three times during the presidency of donald trump with republicans in control of the senate u s debt grew by 7 trillion in the trump years there have been problems from time to time particularly when democratic presidents sought to raise or suspend the limit when annual budget deficits were rising republicans in the house dug in on this battleground in 2011 under president barack obama insisting he make deep cuts in federal spending a deal was negotiated but the specter of default haunted washington for some while thereafter defaulting on these obligations would raise the cost of borrowing for the government severely impact the u s economy and likely create upheaval in the world s financial markets wrote richard a arenberg in his textbook titled congressional procedure adding that the near miss in 2011 led to a downgrade in the nation s credit rating by standard poor s which derided political brinksmanship as the debt limit is statutory it could be eliminated just the way it has so often been raised or suspended but such a vote has not happened perhaps because politically speaking it has seemed even riskier than voting to raise or suspend it cloture has also become a fixture and has shaped senate behavior the threshold for cloture was initially set at two thirds the same required for a constitutional amendment it was not as insuperable a barrier in that era as it would later become as there was considerable crossover between the parties on certain issues in that same year for example the senate would muster two thirds for the 18th amendment prohibition and come within one vote of doing the same for women s suffrage votes for women the 19th amendment got through in 1919 in later generations especially after world war ii the filibuster became closely associated with opposition to civil rights bills southern democrats used it against anti lynching laws and repeated attempts to break down segregation it took the postwar civil rights movement and decades of effort to get two thirds for the civil rights act in 1964 the following year the voting rights act was passed without a filibuster and 10 years later the senate lowered the cloture requirement to three fifths the requirement is still three fifths or 60 votes in our time but lowering the requirement only made the filibuster tactic seem less extreme allowing filibusters to be virtual with no all night floor sessions needed made it all the more attractive a standard tool in a senator s toolbox so while a typical two year congress once had a handful of filibusters that required cloture votes the majority leader now files cloture petitions on literally scores of measures every year that is why it takes 60 votes in the senate has become a litany and bringing over 10 members of the other party across the aisle on something important to their leadership is regarded as all but impossible copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

a big reason why we remember the alamo today is because of a tejana woman s dedication to preserving the structure no matter what it cost her the first night in the dark cold barrack of the alamo was the hardest adina de zavala had no bed or even a chair to sleep on rats skittered nearby the electricity and telephone lines had been cut but years of effort of obsession had led her to this desperate stand it was february 1908 and the oldest building in the alamo complex in san antonio was in danger of being razed she d locked herself inside as a sheriff waited at the door with a court order the barrack was a two story building of a catholic mission that centuries earlier had been home to priests and nuns during the time of spanish rule over texas by the time de zavala occupied the former convento there was little trace of its past the historic building had been owned by a grocery company and had housed crates of milk sugar and other goods now the place was barren and musty without food or drink available she was left to find the coziest spot on the floor this series explores the unseen unheard lost and forgotten stories of america s people of color word spread quickly in san antonio and beyond the morning after de zavala s one woman standoff began journalists and supporters jockeyed to speak to her through the door she didn t emerge for three days the alamo is one of the most iconic images in texas the site had an average of 1 7 million visitors per year before the coronavirus pandemic more than 70 years after mexican soldiers overran texas rebels at the alamo in 1836 the site became the subject of another battle how to commemorate its history it was waged in large part by de zavala the granddaughter of a mexican man who was the first vice president of the republic of texas a schoolteacher and author one of the first preservationists in the country and by many accounts a sharp tongued firebrand more recently de zavala has earned the moniker the angel of the alamo it took almost a century for that recognition to catch on in part because of her mexican last name yet de zavala s complicated identity as a tejana or texan of mexican descent was her driver in saving the alamo and its storied history if it were not for her we probably wouldn t even have an alamo today said sharon skrobarcek treasurer general of the daughters of the republic of texas and of the organization s alamo mission chapter in san antonio know adina de zavala the woman who saved the alamo tourists flock to the alamo but without adina de zavala texas most beloved landmark might not have survived annie rice usa today strong will strong heritage de zavala was born in harris county texas in 1861 she was the oldest of six children of augustine and julia de zavala her father was a confederate soldier and later worked as a ship caulker adina de zavala pale skinned and blue eyed was one quarter mexican in a time of deep anti mexican racism the family s surname became an ethnic label according to suzanne groves who wrote a 2013 master s thesis on de zavala at the university of texas at arlington the family tried to anglicize their name by capitalizing the d they earned no special status from their association with her grandfather lorenzo de zavala a prominent figure of the texas republic adina de zavala was described by contemporaries as a firebrand whose legacy in texas history was obscured because of her mexican last name dolph briscoe center for american history the university of texas at austin native americans had lived in what is now texas for thousands of years when spanish conquistadors settled there in the 1500s despite that early occupation the spanish largely ignored the area until the french claimed matagorda bay on the texas coast near the end of the 17th century that colony lasted only two years stricken by disease and attacks by native americans the spanish took over the region by founding villages and catholic missions the latter of which were meant to civilize the natives in 1821 mexico won independence from spain and spanish texas became part of the new country never been told the full history of american people of color has never been told a new usa today project aims to fill in the gaps more soul of the underground railroad david ruggles the man who rescued frederick douglass to grow the population mexico granted land to empresarios or land agents who would recruit americans to settle there with the new settlers the population with mexican heritage shrank anglo influence swelled the face of texas was changing and with that evolution came unrest the first attempt to secede from mexico came in 1826 with the fredonian rebellion that created a short lived anglo state near nacogdoches in east texas meanwhile lorenzo de zavala who was born in yucatan mexico had climbed the ranks of mexican politics he helped write the new country s constitution and became an ally of politician and general antonio lópez de santa anna when santa anna took dictatorial power in mexico in 1834 de zavala resigned in protest and defected to texas to join stephen f austin one of the principal empresarios to help start texas revolution the most famous battle in texas war for independence came on march 6 1836 at the mission san antonio de valero now it s better known as the alamo an illustration of the battle of the alamo in san antonio texas on march 6 1836 kean collection getty images it was the final assault on the texas fortress mexican forces had begun a siege on the site in february santa anna had about 1 800 soldiers outnumbering the rebels by about 10 to 1 virtually all of the texas defenders were killed that day texas was vindicated however at the battle of san jacinto a month later the texan army battered the mexican forces in a surprise attack that lasted 18 minutes and won the texas revolution and specifically the alamo battle became shrouded in an anglo centric myth of heroic white settlers defending their independence against barbaric mexicans only recently has the true history of the revolution become mainstream that texas defenders fought in part to preserve slavery and that mexican americans fought and died alongside the rebels lorenzo de zavala helped draft the constitution of the republic of texas and his fellow delegates elected him as interim vice president of the new country due to illness he resigned in october 1836 and died that year texas joined the united states in 1845 adina de zavala grew up in galveston and later san antonio she was a teacher in the rural north texas city of terrell for two years in her 20s she then moved to san antonio and took another teaching position to support her family her father was in poor health and her mother didn t work her father died in 1892 de zavala was strong willed she did things her way in 1900 eight years before her alamo protest she read aloud a letter to the san antonio school board protesting her low job classification and salary it s not clear if she won a higher salary but her delivery was so zealous that the trustees voted to bar teachers from giving verbal complaints to the board allowing them only to submit them in writing in the years after the civil war historical activism was on the rise around the country in response to an immigration boom and industrial growth said groves communities cherry picked historical figures and sites to build a patriotic narrative during a period of deep racial divide women mostly upper class and white were particularly active in this movement eager to wield political agency de zavala began learning about her grandfather in this period for several years she and other relatives tried fruitlessly to recover land and stock that had belonged to him they were in search of some respite from their financial woes or at least some social standing in 1889 de zavala organized a group of women around a goal of preserving texas history a similar group of wives daughters and female descendants of men who d served the republic of texas formed the daughters of the republic of texas de zavala s group joined the drt and became the de zavala chapter named for her grandfather her grandfather s history gave her some celebrity and it also gave her passion and purpose skrobarcek said though de zavala s grandfather was a source of pride her relationship to her mexican heritage was tenuous her last name along with her lack of status prevented her from fitting in with anglo high society particularly amid the deep racial divide emerging in san antonio at the time across texas people of mexican descent had lost property faced segregation in schools were relegated to labor jobs and encountered other forms of discrimination hundreds of mexican americans in texas were lynched

the voting rights movement how a black man s death in 1965 changed american history more on the trail of jimmie lee jackson i found my civil rights roots racism touched the daughters of the republic of texas as well according to groves in 1911 an anonymous writer sent de zavala a letter with damning information about two members one woman was a descendant of an alamo fighter s illegitimate child with a mexican woman and another claimed french heritage but was actually of mexican descent in de zavala s writings she did not refer to herself as part mexican or tejana when she wrote about her grandfather she described him only as spanish he and his parents were criollos people of pure spanish descent who were born in spain s colonies as opposed to mestizos who were of spanish and indigenous mexican descent and in one of her books about the battle of the alamo she listed white soldiers who had died as well as white women who d been there she did not include tejano soldiers who died fighting yet many texans connect with her last name and her fervor even if she was not explicit about her heritage copy text copy this quote s text the quote has been copied tweet facebook email

an article about her in observance of hispanic heritage month i think it s not a bad thing that she was drafted to be this tejana heroine groves said because the work that she did regardless of her ethnicity or her appearance was important saving the alamo de zavala was a devoted catholic and she soon set her sights on saving san antonio s five spanish missions which dated to the 1700s san jose concepcion san juan capistrano espada and san antonio de valero or the alamo amid texas rocketing commercial and industrial growth near the start of the 20th century the historical sites were falling into neglect san jose s dome and stone roof had collapsed the walls were decaying the cedar paneled doors were damaged and without fences to protect them graves had been trod upon according to a history journal of the national park service de zavala helped solicit money and materials from business owners to restore san jose the alamo was unrecognizable in the 1880s the state of texas bought the alamo chapel from the roman catholic church a man named honore grenet owned the rest of the property after his death a wholesale grocery called hugo schmeltzer co bought grenet s property and

texas includes the long barrack where priests and nuns lived and where historians confirm most of the fighting in the 1836 battle took place dolph briscoe center for american history the university of texas at austin it had undergone so many alterations that many did not know the long barrack existed but based on her research de zavala was convinced it still stood within the wooden framework of the warehouse because of her catholic faith it incensed de zavala to think of any harm being done to the alamo s convento then there was the building s role in the texas revolution she maintained that the long barrack was where most of the alamo defenders had died in battle making it the most historically significant part of the complex she approached gustav schmeltzer one of the grocery company owners in 1892 to promise that her chapter would have the first opportunity to buy the property but about a decade later a hotel syndicate acquired a lot behind the warehouse and intended to build a hotel there and tear down the warehouse to make way for a park when it came to historical preservation de zavala was tenacious researching planning writing manuscripts and articles on history lobbying

de zavala s historical knowledge de zavala needed driscoll s deep pockets driscoll put up the money to purchase the building on behalf of the de zavala chapter which struggled to fundraise over the course of a year driscoll lobbied the texas legislature to reimburse her and she then transferred possession of the property to the daughters of the republic of texas de zavala believed the facade of the grocery warehouse needed to be removed to restore the barrack to its original condition she hoped to turn the first floor into a museum and library and house a hall of fame honoring texas heroes on the second floor that was where the schism between her and driscoll emerged driscoll inspired by the great monuments of europe believed the long barrack hiding the alamo chapel needed to be torn away altogether to make a park she went public with her disdain for keeping it intact there does not stand in the world today a building or monument which can recall such a deed of heroism and bravery such sacrifice and courage as that of the brave men who fought and fell inside those historic walls she wrote in a letter to the san antonio daily express today the alamo should stand out free and clear all the unsightly obstructions should be torn away de zavala however had the historical reference of we got to preserve the right thing no this is not going to be a place where people come and eat a picnic this is hallowed ground where hundreds of human beings died groves said legal battles and infighting ensued when the daughters of the republic of texas gained possession of the alamo in 1905 de zavala initially refused to turn over the keys the group filed a civil suit against her and she surrendered the keys to driscoll who had been appointed the custodian of the property the following year driscoll s supporters broke off to form a new chapter of the daughters of the republic of texas according to ables de zavala sought custody of the alamo complex for her chapter but the effort failed tensions between the factions built over the next year with the daughters of the republic of texas calling for de zavala and her supporters to be pushed out of the group s executive committee the driscollites as ables described them later sought an injunction from a harris county court to bar de zavala s group from interfering with the alamo property the grocer s lease at the warehouse expired on feb 10 1908 driscoll s faction planned to lease the building to reliable business men of san antonio the group s president wrote in a letter when feb 10 arrived and the grocer vacated the barrack de zavala seized her chance she entered the building had its locks changed and barricaded herself inside a harris county sheriff held an injunction but she refused to be served a

defeated in court and appeals failed the courts ruled that because driscoll s group had written the de zavala chapter out of the daughters of the republic of texas any action by the chapter afterward

the federal fiscal year ends this week and once again congress is scrambling to get its act together and as the prospect of government shutdown looms so does the wilder prospect of the government running out of cash and defaulting on its debt as always political differences and partisan wars make the money process difficult but two key elements of procedure also feature in the showdown raising the stakes and defining the battlefield one is the debt limit the other are the senate rules that allow the minority party to stop legislation cold the two are intertwined at this moment because the debt limit suspended three times during the trump administration has passed its latest suspension date the treasury department has for weeks been using extraordinary measures to cover the checks it writes and also honor bonds that come due without a green light from congress to borrow more money the treasury will be unable to continue this stopgap accounting next month that means checks you might be expecting from the government would bounce and the u s would be in default on its obligations for the first time in its history the financial consequences both short term and long could be severe and getting that done in the usual fashion has been thrown into question with republican threats to filibuster the debt limit suspension democrats are seeking in the senate curiously both these potentially crucial elements became ensconced in congressional practice in a single year a century ago a year that changed the country in many ways cloture s origin story in 1917 the country was confronting momentous issues of war conscription prohibition and votes for women all at once but the premier preoccupation was with war the year began with germany escalating to unrestricted submarine warfare against u s shipping to great britain congress moved to arm merchant ships against these attacks but the bill died in the senate after a filibuster by a dozen senators who saw it as a backdoor u s entry into the war they blocked a vote in the waning days of a congressional session and the bill died when the session ended at the time there was no procedure for cutting off such an extended debate which had been a senator s right since the early 1800s the weapon existed but was rarely used reserved for paramount issues such as creating a national bank or limiting slavery arming the merchant ships seemed to be just such an issue to the filibustering group whom president woodrow wilson immediately condemned as a little band of willful men wilson called a special session and a manifesto supporting his bill and denouncing the anti war senators was signed by 75 senators on top of that the senate adopted a rule that established cloture for the first time allowing a supermajority to cut off debate and force a vote the rule was adopted after six hours of debate by a vote of 76 to 3 war fever brought more change that lopsided vote expressed the war fever gripping much of the country in march 1917 most americans had been opposed to involvement in the war that convulsed europe beginning in 1914 wilson had campaigned in 1916 on the slogan he kept us out of war now wilson was not only for arming merchant vessels he also was moving toward an outright declaration of war one big reason was a telegram that had been disclosed purporting to reveal a german plot to get mexico to make war on the united states the reward for mexico was supposed to have been the return of the territory that had become texas new mexico and arizona this so called zimmermann telegram did not transform american attitudes as violently as the japanese attack on pearl harbor would in 1941 and the terror attacks of sept 11 would again in 2001 but it moved the country and it moved the congress ap ap president woodrow wilson delivers a speech to a joint session of congress in april 1917 requesting a declaration of war against germany wilson got his declaration of war in april 1917 congress began considering a draft to bulk up the peacetime army and a 4 billion appropriation to bolster all the armed services as quickly as possible congress passed the war revenue act raising income and corporation taxes a new tax on inheritances and an excess profits tax and higher taxes on tobacco and a host of amusements and other luxury items but tax money comes in gradually and much more money was needed right away in the month congress declared war it also passed the first liberty bond act to provide the initial billions in financing in september it passed a second such act this time including a limit on the overall indebtedness of the u s at 15 billion the idea was to make the debt more palatable by keeping a lid on it at least theoretically congress added the debt limit by statute it is not a constitutional amendment that means it could be altered or done away with at any time by the passage of another statute and indeed that original limit would have to be raised in the course of the war which eventually involved more than 20 billion in five bond issues before and after the fighting ended this can also be seen as a nod to fiscal conservatives at the time and to those elements of the nation s population either opposed to the war or ambivalent at best americans with german backgrounds were distressed and in many cases persecuted and many americans with irish heritage were incensed by great britain s suppression of ireland s bid for independence in the easter rising of 1916 the debt limit has often been circumvented but never abolished the debt limit language also acted to ease the process of issuing new debt which had previously been done through short term instruments that were neither efficient nor sufficient for the fiscal task of a modern war as longtime congress scholars thomas e mann and norman j ornstein wrote in 2012 the drive to enable congress to issue longer term debt instruments even for specific appropriations both lowered interest costs and made the borrowing easier for the treasury department mann and ornstein noted that the limit had long since become vestigial especially after congress consolidated federal borrowing in the late 1930s anticipating the arrival of world war ii for most of the 20th century congress simply raised the debt limit to whatever was needed to accommodate the budgets already enacted from 1979 to 1994 this was accomplished in the adoption of the annual budget resolution it should surprise no one that the limit has been raised or suspended nearly 100 times since its creation more than 80 times between 1960 and 2017 and three times during the presidency of donald trump with republicans in control of the senate u s debt grew by 7 trillion in the trump years there have been problems from time to time particularly when democratic presidents sought to raise or suspend the limit when annual budget deficits were rising republicans in the house dug in on this battleground in 2011 under president barack obama insisting he make deep cuts in federal spending a deal was negotiated but the specter of default haunted washington for some while thereafter defaulting on these obligations would raise the cost of borrowing for the government severely impact the u s economy and likely create upheaval in the world s financial markets wrote richard a arenberg in his textbook titled congressional procedure adding that the near miss in 2011 led to a downgrade in the nation s credit rating by standard poor s which derided political brinksmanship as the debt limit is statutory it could be eliminated just the way it has so often been raised or suspended but such a vote has not happened perhaps because politically speaking it has seemed even riskier than voting to raise or suspend it cloture has also become a fixture and has shaped senate behavior the threshold for cloture was initially set at two thirds the same required for a constitutional amendment it was not as insuperable a barrier in that era as it would later become as there was considerable crossover between the parties on certain issues in that same year for example the senate would muster two thirds for the 18th amendment prohibition and come within one vote of doing the same for women s suffrage votes for women the 19th amendment got through in 1919 in later generations especially after world war ii the filibuster became closely associated with opposition to civil rights bills southern democrats used it against anti lynching laws and repeated attempts to break down segregation it took the postwar civil rights movement and decades of effort to get two thirds for the civil rights act in 1964 the following year the voting rights act was passed without a filibuster and 10 years later the senate lowered the cloture requirement to three fifths the requirement is still three fifths or 60 votes in our time but lowering the requirement only made the filibuster tactic seem less extreme allowing filibusters to be virtual with no all night floor sessions needed made it all the more attractive a standard tool in a senator s toolbox so while a typical two year congress once had a handful of filibusters that required cloture votes the majority leader now files cloture petitions on literally scores of measures every year that is why it takes 60 votes in the senate has become a litany and bringing over 10 members of the other party across the aisle on something important to their leadership is regarded as all but impossible copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
is it time to panic over a possible default this week congress is getting ready for another fight over the debt ceiling on monday per cnbc senate republicans blocked a bill passed by the house last week that would have suspended the debt ceiling for a year and prevented a government shutdown such a shutdown would begin thursday while a default would take place sometime in october if the debt ceiling is not raised by then all republicans in the senate voted no on the measure as did senate democratic leader chuck schumer d ny who did so in what cnbc described as a procedural move to enable him to reintroduce the measure later per the report democrats must now have to pull off a daunting series of maneuvers to avoid a sequence of events that could ravage the economy and cost millions of americans their jobs possibly folding it into the ongoing reconciliation bill the republican party has solidified itself as the party of default and it will be the american people who pay the price majority leader schumer said per the report usa today looked at whether it s time to panic over a possible default this week lawmakers have raised the debt ceiling more than a dozen times in the past twenty years and it ll be easier this go round because one party democrats controls the white house and congress yet this feels different that report also looked at what happened in 2011 when the obama administration and congress clashed over the debt ceiling the brinkmanship had consequences the stock market turned volatile bond prices rose and the rating agency standard poor s downgraded the u s aaa credit rating for the first time in history usa today the government accountability office estimated that delays in raising the debt limit in 2011 led to an increase in treasury s borrowing costs of about 1 3 billion in fiscal year 2011 there were no such fights during the trump administration either when the republicans controlled both houses of congress in the first two years or after the democrats captured the house in the 2018 elections also monday two officials with the federal reserve warned of what could happen if the debt ceiling isn t suspended or raised john williams the president of the federal reserve bank of new york said per the financial times that chaos in markets could ensue if the issue is not resolved if you actually crossed that line and got to a place where the government wasn t paying off its obligations i think it would create a very negative dynamic not only in the u s but around the world williams said meanwhile federal reserve governor lael brainard said also per the financial times that congress knows what it needs to do it needs to step up it has responsibilities stephen silver a technology writer for the national interest is a journalist essayist and film critic who is also a contributor to the philadelphia inquirer philly voice philadelphia weekly the jewish telegraphic agency living life fearless backstage magazine broad street review and splice today the co founder of the philadelphia film critics circle stephen lives in suburban philadelphia with his wife and two sons follow him on twitter at stephensilver image reuters
the federal fiscal year ends this week and once again congress is scrambling to get its act together and as the prospect of government shutdown looms so does the wilder prospect of the government running out of cash and defaulting on its debt as always political differences and partisan wars make the money process difficult but two key elements of procedure also feature in the showdown raising the stakes and defining the battlefield one is the debt limit the other are the senate rules that allow the minority party to stop legislation cold the two are intertwined at this moment because the debt limit suspended three times during the trump administration has passed its latest suspension date the treasury department has for weeks been using extraordinary measures to cover the checks it writes and also honor bonds that come due without a green light from congress to borrow more money the treasury will be unable to continue this stopgap accounting next month that means checks you might be expecting from the government would bounce and the u s would be in default on its obligations for the first time in its history the financial consequences both short term and long could be severe and getting that done in the usual fashion has been thrown into question with republican threats to filibuster the debt limit suspension democrats are seeking in the senate curiously both these potentially crucial elements became ensconced in congressional practice in a single year a century ago a year that changed the country in many ways cloture s origin story in 1917 the country was confronting momentous issues of war conscription prohibition and votes for women all at once but the premier preoccupation was with war the year began with germany escalating to unrestricted submarine warfare against u s shipping to great britain congress moved to arm merchant ships against these attacks but the bill died in the senate after a filibuster by a dozen senators who saw it as a backdoor u s entry into the war they blocked a vote in the waning days of a congressional session and the bill died when the session ended at the time there was no procedure for cutting off such an extended debate which had been a senator s right since the early 1800s the weapon existed but was rarely used reserved for paramount issues such as creating a national bank or limiting slavery arming the merchant ships seemed to be just such an issue to the filibustering group whom president woodrow wilson immediately condemned as a little band of willful men wilson called a special session and a manifesto supporting his bill and denouncing the anti war senators was signed by 75 senators on top of that the senate adopted a rule that established cloture for the first time allowing a supermajority to cut off debate and force a vote the rule was adopted after six hours of debate by a vote of 76 to 3 war fever brought more change that lopsided vote expressed the war fever gripping much of the country in march 1917 most americans had been opposed to involvement in the war that convulsed europe beginning in 1914 wilson had campaigned in 1916 on the slogan he kept us out of war now wilson was not only for arming merchant vessels he also was moving toward an outright declaration of war one big reason was a telegram that had been disclosed purporting to reveal a german plot to get mexico to make war on the united states the reward for mexico was supposed to have been the return of the territory that had become texas new mexico and arizona this so called zimmermann telegram did not transform american attitudes as violently as the japanese attack on pearl harbor would in 1941 and the terror attacks of sept 11 would again in 2001 but it moved the country and it moved the congress ap ap president woodrow wilson delivers a speech to a joint session of congress in april 1917 requesting a declaration of war against germany wilson got his declaration of war in april 1917 congress began considering a draft to bulk up the peacetime army and a 4 billion appropriation to bolster all the armed services as quickly as possible congress passed the war revenue act raising income and corporation taxes a new tax on inheritances and an excess profits tax and higher taxes on tobacco and a host of amusements and other luxury items but tax money comes in gradually and much more money was needed right away in the month congress declared war it also passed the first liberty bond act to provide the initial billions in financing in september it passed a second such act this time including a limit on the overall indebtedness of the u s at 15 billion the idea was to make the debt more palatable by keeping a lid on it at least theoretically congress added the debt limit by statute it is not a constitutional amendment that means it could be altered or done away with at any time by the passage of another statute and indeed that original limit would have to be raised in the course of the war which eventually involved more than 20 billion in five bond issues before and after the fighting ended this can also be seen as a nod to fiscal conservatives at the time and to those elements of the nation s population either opposed to the war or ambivalent at best americans with german backgrounds were distressed and in many cases persecuted and many americans with irish heritage were incensed by great britain s suppression of ireland s bid for independence in the easter rising of 1916 the debt limit has often been circumvented but never abolished the debt limit language also acted to ease the process of issuing new debt which had previously been done through short term instruments that were neither efficient nor sufficient for the fiscal task of a modern war as longtime congress scholars thomas e mann and norman j ornstein wrote in 2012 the drive to enable congress to issue longer term debt instruments even for specific appropriations both lowered interest costs and made the borrowing easier for the treasury department mann and ornstein noted that the limit had long since become vestigial especially after congress consolidated federal borrowing in the late 1930s anticipating the arrival of world war ii for most of the 20th century congress simply raised the debt limit to whatever was needed to accommodate the budgets already enacted from 1979 to 1994 this was accomplished in the adoption of the annual budget resolution it should surprise no one that the limit has been raised or suspended nearly 100 times since its creation more than 80 times between 1960 and 2017 and three times during the presidency of donald trump with republicans in control of the senate u s debt grew by 7 trillion in the trump years there have been problems from time to time particularly when democratic presidents sought to raise or suspend the limit when annual budget deficits were rising republicans in the house dug in on this battleground in 2011

james s brady press briefing room 2 11 p m edt ms psaki hi everyone good afternoon hi okay zeke i know this is disappointing i have nothing at the top for you so let s just get into whatever you all have questions about laughter q okay well why don t we start with testimony on capitol hill that s ongoing with general milley and general mckenzie testifying that they believe that 2 500 u s troops were needed to sustain the afghan government and hold off the taliban the president that just seems to be the disconnect between that and how the president described the advice from his military advisors in that abc interview six or so weeks ago when he said he denied that the pentagon wanted troop to continue the american troop presence there so did the president mislead the american public about the advice of his military advisors ms psaki well let me give you a full a couple of specifics from the actual transcript because i know it s been shorthanded a bit no malintent but the question asked by george stephanopoulos was but your mil top military advisors warned against withdrawing on this timeline they wanted you to keep about 2 500 troops the president said no they didn t it was split that wasn t true that wasn t true it was split i think that s a pretty key part of that phrasing there later on he george stephanopoulos said so no one told your military advisors did not tell you quote no we should just keep 2 500 troops it s been a stable situation for the last several years we can do that we can continue to do that no no one said that to me that i can recall i would note today in the testimony that was given by secretary austin by general milley they made clear secretary austin specifically said if you stayed there at a force posture of 2 500 certainly you d be in a fight with the taliban and you d have to reinforce so what should everybody take from that there was a range of viewpoints as was evidenced by their testimony today that were presented to the president that were presented to his national security team as would be expected as he asked for he asked for a clear a clear eyed didn t asked them not to sugarcoat it what their recommendations were it was also clear and clear to him that that would not be a longstanding recommendation that there would need to be an escalation an increase in troop numbers it would also need it would also mean war with the taliban and it would also mean the potential loss of casualties the president was just not willing to make that decision he didn t think it was in our the interest of the american people or the interest of our troops q i m sure some of my colleagues will have a couple of follow ups on that i just want to get to a couple of different topics ms psaki sure q on the reconciliation negotiations senators manchin and sinema were were over here are they still over here and is there agreement on a topline number ms psaki so first senator sinema was here earlier today senator manchin was still here as of when i came out he may have wrapped up the meeting but he was going into the meeting a little while ago and senator sinema had a meeting with the president earlier today they had a constructive meeting agreed that we are at a pivotal moment need to continue to work to finalize the path forward he asked his team to follow up later this afternoon with her directly to continue the conversation and continue the discussions i will leave it to them to convey where they are comfortable in terms of topline numbers but the president felt it was constructive felt they moved the ball forward felt there was an agreement that we re at a pivotal moment it s important to continue to finalize the path forward to get the job done for the american people q an agreement on a pivotal a pivotal moment but is there an agreement on the number ms psaki again i would point you to senator sinema and senator manchin to speak to their viewpoints on where they stand on the package at this point in time i m not going to speak on their behalf q jen ms psaki go ahead i ll come to you back i ll come around to you in a little q back on afghanistan the president said his military commanders were split we now know that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general milley the head of centcom general mckenzie and the commander on the ground general miller all recommended that the president keep 2 500 troops so who in his military advisors told him it d be fine to pull everybody out ms psaki look i m not going to get into specific details of who recommended what but i can i would reiterate a little bit of what i conveyed before which is that there were recommendations made by a range of his advisors something he welcomed something he asked them to come to him clear eyed about to give him candid advice what is also clear though and i d also note again what secretary austin said today is that was not going to be a sustainable over the long term troop presence we were always going to look at escalating the numbers at potentially going back to war with the taliban at risking casualties that was not a decision the president was going to make but of course he welcomes advice he welcomed advice ultimately it s up to the commander in chief to make a decision he made a decision it was time to end a 20 year war q but you are saying here that military advisors to the president said it was okay to pull all the troops out that it would be fine ms psaki that s not what i said what i said was they recommended and i think we should not dumb this down for anybody here we re talking about the initial phase post may 1 we re not talking about long term recommendations there was no one who said five years from now we could have 2 500 troops and that would be sustainable and i think that s important for people to know and to understand it s also important to note that the risks we were talking about here were the possibility the likelihood of increasing a troop presence which we now know to absolutely have been the reality given it required 6 000 troops to just protect the airport something we now know q but the president pulled all u s troops out you are saying that there were military commanders who advised him that that was a good idea to pull all american troops out and that general milley general mckenzie general miller they said something else but the president s top military advisors and others who you won t name told him sure we can pull everyone out ms psaki that s not how these conversations go it s a risk assessment for every president about what is in the interest of the united states of america our military and our national interests and if we had kept 2 500 troops there we would have increased the number of troops we would have been at war with the taliban we would have had more u s casualties that was a reality everybody was clear eyed about there are some as is evidenced by people testifying today who felt we should have still done that that is not the decision the president made it s up to the commander in chief to make those decisions go ahead q jen thanks it might be helpful if you could just tell us what do you mean by split what were they split between ms psaki what s confusing about that q well it s either one they were advising that 2 500 troops should remain on the ground or two that someone was advising that it should be zero ms psaki well again weijia i don t think i think it s important for the american people to know that these conversations don t happen in black and white or like you re in the middle of a movie these conversations are about a range of options about what the risk assessments are about every decision and of course there are individuals who come forward with a range of recommendations on what the right path forward looks like i m not going to detail those from here they re private conversations and advice to the president of the united states ultimately regardless of the advice it s his decision he s the commander in chief he s the president he makes decisions about what s in the national interest and he believed we should end the war q more broadly who who does he consider to be his top military advisors ms psaki he considers of course the secretary of defense the secretary the joint the chairman of the joint chiefs he considers a range of advice from his national security team his secretary of state his national security advisor and others who can give him he asked for candid advice from q thanks and today general milley also testified that he spoke with several authors for their books about the former president does president biden think that s appropriate ms psaki i don t i m not going to make an evaluation on that from here obviously the chairman makes his own decisions about that q but does he though does the white house not have to sign off on any time an sao senior administration official sorry speaks to the press ms psaki we certainly give people advice on what people are writing about and whether it s constructive for them to engage with it but individuals do make a range of decisions weijia q so did you advise him before he spoke to authors ms psaki i don t have anything more for you weijia go ahead q as we sit here today does president biden believe that his military advisors supported his decision to withdraw all of u s troops based on their own judgments ms psaki well kelly i think what you heard them say during their testimony is that about certain stages they gave a variety of advice which is accurate and something the president of course welcomes he ultimately had to make the decision as the commander in chief about what is in our national interest you also heard secretary austin make clear about the commitment of delivering on what the president had decided and the fact that if we left troops in there past september 1st we would have been at war with the taliban so i think what s important for people to take away from the testimony today is that it reiterated and confirms a lot of what we ve been talking about over the past couple of months about what the risks were of keeping troops on the ground what the taliban s intentions were what the impact was of the deal that was struck by the prior administration directly with the taliban that released 5 000 taliban fighters into the into afghanistan without the engagement of the afghan government those are all the repercussions and the impact and yes they gave their advice as they should and then they implemented the president s decision q so knowing that the president gets to make this decision knowing he may have to make further decisions going down the line so not looking at the history what i think the public wants to know if the generals and military advisors give advice how will the president use and process that and how will he talk about it publicly that matters to the public did the president convey accurately what these generals were saying to him ms psaki he conveyed in the interview in what aspect q well in the interview and then going forward can they understand how the president will use that kind of information when we see there s a conflict between what the generals were saying and the president s public statements with respect to afghanistan ms psaki well the president made clear that the advice was split he didn t outline what every individual conveyed to him in private advice as i don t think anyone in the american public would expect obviously they re testifying before congress today they re answering questions accurately they re providing more detail on their advice as they should that s how that process works and as they should i think what the american people should know is the president is always going to welcome a range of advice he asked for candor he asked for directness and in any scenario he s not looking for a bunch of yes men and women and what that means is that ultimately he s going to have to make the decision about what s in the best interest of the united states if there s conflicting advice given by necessity some people some people s advice will not be taken go ahead q so what is the white house s reaction to some other aspects of general milley s testimony he said among other things that it was a mistake for two successive american presidents to have a date based or date certain withdrawal that it ought to be conditions based he also indicated in his testimony the idea of the u s credibility would be damaged would be a word that should be looked at what s the white house s response to those aspects of his testimony today ms psaki well first i would say that secretary austin spoke directly about our credibility in the world during the same testimony and he said our credibility remains solid and people place great trust and confidence in america and what we also look at is the fact that the nato secretary general has affirmed that our allies were consulted on the president s decisions we communicated to the afghans and to our allies and since the time of the withdrawal we worked to get 100 countries together to unite in an effort to make clear that the international community s expectations what they are of the taliban led government that shows the united states still has power still has trust still has partnerships in the world even as it relates to afghanistan what was the first part of your question q well so general milley specifically said that he believed that it was a mistake for there to be date certain withdrawals versus conditions based he said that was a lesson he learned does the president agree with that does this white house acknowledge that it was a mistake and is there any not to say second guessing but is there any thought that perhaps a mistake was made ms psaki in which piece when did we set a deadline for withdrawal you re talking about september 1st q the general said that the two successive american presidents made the mistake of setting dates so the president this president had first september 11th and then he adjusted to august 31st general milley indicated that that was a mistake ms psaki well to be clear we had a may 1st timeline with no plan we had a deadline and no plan for withdrawal that we walked into when the president was inaugurated and took office the september 1st timeline was related to was based on the recommendations of the military and on the timeline needed to operationally effectively and safely withdraw our troops once the president made the decision to withdraw our troops so it s not the same thing q i do want to ask you one more question general milley also said that he wasn t asked about whether to keep troops on the ground until august 25th is that true ms psaki say that one more time q well general milley said he wasn t asked by the president whether to keep troops on the ground until august 25th ms psaki past september 1st q past september 1st i suppose that was the question but can you confirm ms psaki well the context of that s pretty important isn t it q sure so what more context can you add ms psaki well i m saying that because when you say august 25th people would infer that to mean that he wasn t asked for his point of view on what our approach should be until then that s not accurate there were ongoing daily discussions in the situation room where the president asked for advice for viewpoints from the military from his national security team about how we should proceed as it related to august 31st that s no secret we made that clear certainly at the time i d also note that during the testimony sec general milley also made clear that we would have gone to the war with the taliban had we not withdrawn before september by september 1st that was also advice he gave privately go ahead q thank you jen a quick question on the energy crisis oil prices have reached 80 a barrel first time in three years there is an energy crisis underway china uk europe we understand from the white house that you re monitoring the situation but what in the near term is the white house doing to ease pressure on the market are you are there any conversations that you are having with opec or you re planning to have with opec that you can tell us a little bit more about and we also know that jake sullivan is in saudi he s planning to meet with mbs although that is about yemen does he plan to bring this up during that meeting ms psaki well we are in we continue to speak to international partners including opec on the importance of competitive markets and setting prices and doing more to support the recovery we re obviously monitoring as you ve already alluded to and i would note that last month our nec director brian deese also sent a letter to ftc chair lina khan asking the ftc to use all of its available tools to monitor the u s gasoline market and address any illegal conduct that might be contributing to price increases the ftc responded committing to take specific actions to identify deter and investigate we also noted i d also note that jake sullivan also put out a statement at the time which you referred to the engagements he has in the middle east and with the saudis that specifically the meetings with the saudis are really focused on yemen our yemen our envoy is participating in a part of those conversations that s really the focus so i don t have a further readout beyond that at this point about how the conversations have gone obviously our national security advisor has been deeply engaged but that s not the focus or the purpose of his trip q and specifically in terms of sort of regulatory action from the ftc that is obviously going to take some time but the pressure on the market is building up right now i mean are there perhaps any again conversations on you know reaching out to the emergency stockpile to you know ease some pressure on the market is there anything being done in the near term ms psaki i don t have anything in the near term to preview for you obviously that s up to the ftc in terms of their timeline but i would assure you we re not only engaged with opec we re looking at every means we have to lower gas prices but i don t have or address the cost of oil i should say but i don t have anything else to preview for you q and a question quickly on senator warren s comment on the fed chair she said she will not support his reappointment she said he s a dangerous man who s harmed the country s banking industry does the white house have a comment on that and where is the president with his decision on reappointing a fed chair ms psaki i understand the interest i don t have anything on personnel announcements to make and nothing further on senator warren s comments go ahead q one milley question and then a couple on the agenda ms psaki sure q general milley was asked if he echoed the president s term using extraordinary success for what transpired in august and milley said it was a logistical success but a strategic failure i think those are two different is that kind of an accurate assessment in your guys view of what transpired in august ms psaki well he later made clear and clarified that he was referring to the 20 year war as a strategic failure and of course the president agrees we were there for far too long we should have withdrawn sooner and that it was a war that was long overdue to come to an end q and a couple on the domestic agenda i understand what you re saying about asking senators sinema and manchin but a lot of democrats on the hill want the president to press for that top line they think that s crucial to the thursday vote was that his intent today because that seemed to be the view on the hill of what he was trying to do with these meetings today ms psaki well i can assure you that when he has conversations they re quite candid they re direct and he s had a long relationship a good relationship with senator sinema as he has had with senator manchin who he has been meeting with i m not sure if the meeting has ended yet but i m going to keep those private and we re obviously in a very sensitive time right now in these discussions a pivotal time in these discussions and i understand the interest but i m going to try not to say anything that gets me fired today i enjoy speaking with you all so much every day laughter q and just one more and i m not trying to be clever here ms psaki no go ahead q speaker pelosi wrote a letter to a dear colleague letter today it says as i write this negotiations are being led by president biden to advance his agenda is there because it s an inflection point are the roles changing in terms of who s leading things right now what the role between the speaker the leader and the president are am i reading too much into that how do you view the president s role right now ms psaki i would say the president is deeply engaged i know we ve read out some of the calls and meetings he s had we haven t read all of them out in terms of the engagements and calls he s had he s talked with a range of members across this political spectrum and the democratic party i can assure you and but i would say the way he sees it is that he s working together in lockstep with speaker pelosi with leader schumer to get this done they are all clear headed i know i said this yesterday but it s worth repeating about the challenge of what we re pressing to achieve this week as you all know he spoke with them last night he will continue to remain closely engaged with them and so he s working i would say in lockstep in partnership with the speaker and the leader go ahead q so i m going to try one more along those lines ms psaki go to it q and then and then i have another reconciliation question ms psaki okay q is there is there a sense in which the president s posture in these discussions with manchin sinema and the rest has changed over the course of the last week in other words is he listening does he go into these meetings to listen to hear what they re saying is he going into these meetings to tell them what he wants from them and has that dynamic changed in the sense of him being more forceful about what he wants to achieve in these negotiations and discussions because we re coming up against that deadline this week ms psaki again q wasn t that a better way to try to do that than phil laughter ms psaki that was good that was good mike you led you led me down a rabbit hole there look i think these are a discussion these meetings the president as you all know was in the senate for 36 years he didn t want any president to tell him what to do he s not going to tell anyone what to do he is going to have a discussion have an engagement those can be direct those can be candid those can be straightforward and as i noted earlier on this is clearly a pivotal moment this is clearly a sensitive time and there was agreement which is a good sign that we need to press forward and work to get these packages across the finish line that s a good thing but i m going to keep the tone and tenor and flow of how many who had more words in the meetings private at this point in time q okay one more one more question on the reconciliation package you guys have made a lot of the administration officials have made a lot about the idea that the cost of the program is zero and by that i expect you mean net zero into the treasury once you sort of take into account the money that s raised versus the money that s spent correct ms psaki yes it doesn t i know none of us are mathematicians otherwise we wouldn t be here but yes of the investments that were proposed including tax cuts and the payfors including making the tax system more fair zero q okay but do you guys acknowledge the sort of broader truth that it s not that it does cost somebody right that the cost of the investments that the president wants to make don t simply they re not simply a free lunch right whether they re going to cost people who smoke cigarettes or they re going to cost business people or they re going to cost companies or they re going to cost rich people like the cost of what the president wants to do over the course of the next decade and beyond falls on somebody right ms psaki but there s a clear difference between what we re talking about as it relates to taxpayer funds right or funding that or lead to our debt right which i know a lot of republicans are supposedly concerned about and asking businesses 50 of the top companies last year in 2020 paid not a dollar in taxes a lot of high income net net high or high income individuals pay lower tax rates than nurses and teachers nobody thinks that s fair yes they we re asking them to pay more yes q okay ms psaki so it will cost them more go ahead q thank you jen just a question on the debt limit i wanted to see if you guys are raising the possibility of going using reconciliation to raise the debt limit particularly as this october 8th deadline or excuse me october 18th date is fast approaching ms psaki yeah so we obviously wanted to do this in a bipartisan fashion as we ve talked about quite a bit in here it s a shared responsibility it s been done 80 times in a bipartisan manner in the past and now leader schumer wants democrats to be able to do it alone if republicans refuse to help so that s really what is being pursued at this point in time in terms of the mechanisms of that i d certainly point you to leader schumer s office it s also our hope that if senator mcconnell isn t going to help us avoid a default and a shutdown at least he ll get out of the way and let democrats do it alone so we can avoid a default and right now that question remains up in the air q is one other option to get rid of the filibuster to do this i mean without a filibuster it would be much easier for democrats to do that ms psaki i certainly understand the question and the interest but the president s position has not changed on that go ahead q thanks jen i have a question about the not raising taxes on people who make over 400 000 make under 400 000 would a carbon tax violate that rule or would there be some way with a rebate something like that to make it okay with your criteria ms psaki well so on the carbon tax first let me just say that there are a lot of ideas being debated the president has asked members to submit their own proposals including on critical issues like how to address the crisis of climate change so i just throw that out there because there s a lot of revenue raisers and a lot of options that are out there obviously the president put forward his own plan for addressing climate change that doesn t involve a corporate carbon fee but as you can see from the corporate polluter fee embraced in the bipartisan infrastructure deal polluter fees and corporations do not conflict with the 400 000 pledge so in our view that that would be one way but again there s a range of revenue raisers and options on the table the president didn t propose this one they re looking at a range of options and obviously we re at a pivotal moment as we ve said go ahead jackie q thanks jen on reconciliation one more has the president given a topline number to members of congress that he would accept that s less than 3 5 trillion ms psaki the president always knew it would be a compromise that s why he s been engaging with and listening to a range of members on their points of view some have expressed publicly that they re not comfortable with 3 5 even though zero costs zero dollars but i m not going to speak on their behalf of what they re advocating or negotiating with each other the president is just looking to unite the party to get across the finish line q it sounds like he has given a number then ms psaki no i wouldn t say that i would say he is hearing from a range of members on what they re comfortable with that s part of the discussions right now q okay and then president obama said on abc about the border ms psaki president obama or president biden q president obama ms psaki okay q on abc he said immigration is tough this was an interview that aired on good morning america ms psaki got it yes q immigration is tough it has always been because on one hand i think we re naturally a people that wants to help others at the same time we re a nation state we have borders the idea that we can just have open borders is something that as a practical matter is unsustainable does president biden agree with president obama that open borders is unsustainable ms psaki we don t have open borders so yes he agrees q okay and then did the white house have any discussions with abc or president obama about the content of that interview ms psaki not that i m aware of obviously the current president the former president are friends and they engage on a regular basis but i m not aware of any conversations about it q and then i wanted to ask about secretary mayorkas yesterday he said that the administration is continuing to message to the diaspora community that migrants should not take the journey but he also said in the same sentence that the now 13 000 who ve been released into the u s is an appropriate figure and a function of our operational capacity how should migrants hear both of those messages at the same time and not think that they should come and expect the same treatment ms psaki well by the same treatment these indi the 13 000 or 12 000 individuals we re talking about here are put into immigration proceedings right when they re put into immigration proceedings it does not mean they get to stay in the united states there are some exceptions as the secretary spoke about when he was here on friday to title 42 which we re still continuing to administer that includes if you are you know if individuals have immediate health concerns if they are expressing fear you know and these are considered and they are as a part of our immigration proceedings and our immigration process but when they go into immigration proceedings they are given a notice to appear many are have ankle bracelets their biometric data is taken and they are expected to appear back in immigration court so it is not accurate to suggest or for anyone who is contemplating coming to the border to think that they re going to come to the border and be allowed to stay long term in the united states there s an immigration process immigration proceedings of course people get their day in court but they are arbi or they are they go through that process q but these cases are taking two and a half years on average i mean to people living in conditions that they re trying to flee that is long term ms psaki well i would say first that we are still applying title 42 we are still sending people away at the border and again individuals who come who do meet any of those criteria go through an immigration process immigration proceedings but you know some of those conditions are being in ice detention facilities some of those conditions are being secured with ankle bracelets or give again giving their biometric data it s not an easy process or an easy system and absolutely nothing is guaranteed it has to go through our own immigration process but again our system is broken needs to be fixed that s what we d love to work with republicans on q and is the administration doing anything to prepare for this second group that we re now expecting on the southern border within the next month or so there have been reports that the numbers could be between 15 and 20 000 more migrants ms psaki we re continuing to apply title 42 at the border we are continuing to convey through a range of means communicating directly with people through paid media and otherwise this is not the time to come i would note that while there are a number of people who are in the immigration proceedings process there are also thousands of people who went back across the border when they realized they could not stay here and could not stay in the camp and would not be able to stay in the united states so there are some deterrence mechanisms that have been put in place obviously our department of homeland security continues to prepare in any scenario as we look to migrants coming to approach the border go ahead lynn q aptly obama gave that interview in connection with his being in chicago today for the ceremonial groundbreaking of his presidential center which goes back to your origin story that lands you here my question is about president biden in chicago tomorrow ms psaki okay sure q i need some details that you haven t given out what you want to do for the business vaccination event that you want to do a source says to me you re also going to suburban chicago i need some more information on that and since you have so many options on where to go around the nation to promote your policies why in specifics did you pick chicago and you know i don t want a general answer ms psaki okay lynn always a pleasure to see you laughter lynn so we will get you absolutely all the details on the business in intricate detail and everyone here who wants that detail we will give it to them as well he is going to chicago because he wants to lift up and communicate not to just people of chicago but the people of the country about the effectiveness of vaccine mandates how they can work for businesses how they can make workplaces safer and how they can be constructive to our economy this is a place where we ve identified some options to do exactly that so that s why he s headed to chicago tomorrow q but that doesn t tell me why he picked chicago there are other places that could maybe do that and then what about this whatever he s going to do in this suburban stop a source tells me about ms psaki i promise you we will get you details it will not be generic we will get you details after the briefing even as we speak check your email we ll see if we can get you details while we re talking here go ahead sabrina q thank you does the white house support speaker pelosi s decision to hold a vote on infrastructure without also doing reconciliation in tandem ms psaki well let me be clear the president is committed to getting both pieces of legislation passed and across the finish line as is speaker pelosi as is leader schumer we are working in lockstep to get both of those pieces of legislation done one is absolutely not being dropped anyone who thinks that that s not true or accurate we certainly trust the speaker we trust leader schumer and we re obviously the president is playing his role on getting these pieces across the finish line q what is president biden s message to house progressives who are threatening to vote the infrastructure bill down on thursday and is he planning to speak directly with progressives this week ms psaki as i just noted he s spoken with a range of democrats from different parts of the party he has and he ll continue to i d also note that our team senior members of the white house team have had even more conversations than the president to be expected in september we had over the white house senior staff or members of the legislative team had over 260 engagements on build back better with members and their senior teams over 50 with departments or so they could provide specific policy expertise that s the level of detail and granularity we ve been focused on over the past few mon month or so q one question on a separate matter the journal published an investigation today revealing that more than 131 federal judges traded stock of companies that appeared in cases in their courtrooms this comes after two federal reserve presidents resigned earlier this week over stockholding controversies what is president biden s position on federal judges federal reserve officials members of congress and other officials in the administration owning and trading shares of companies that could appear before them in official capacity ms psaki well obviously every scenario is different but i will say that the president expects that everyone serving as a public servant should be held to the highest standards ethical standards obviously we respect the independence of the federal reserve they ve made their own announcements there beyond that that s certainly his expectation q does he support legislation to bar stock trading and stockholding by members of congress ms psaki i d have to look at we d have to look at specific legislation to see what it looks like q jen jen ms psaki yeah go ahead q jen can you confirm that president biden will be meeting with pope francis october 29th at the vatican ms psaki i don t have anything about the trip to confirm at this point in time q cross talk ms psaki go ahead q two questions jen ms psaki go ahead q first i ms psaki i lots of people have different sources i have nothing yet on the trip as soon as we have it i promise we ll share it with all of you go ahead q thank you so much how important is getting the reconciliation package to the president s credibility as he goes into glasgow and if he doesn t get the deal made will the u s be able to get other countries to believe our commitments and make serious ones of their own ms psaki well as you know secretary former secretary kerry members of our climate team members of our national security team have been working around the clock to secure commitments as we lead up to glasgow i think the president s record and his commitment on climate is evident to the global community he rejoined the paris climate agreement he took steps himself through his own executive authorities to put in place climate friendly actions including as it relates to the auto industry he s been an advocate and the author of or i shouldn t well the author of the ideas the bold ideas in the build back better agenda so i can t speak to how other countries will assess but i can convey that his record is clear addressing the climate crisis is top and front and center of his agenda he conveys that to world leaders and that s certainly something that sec former secretary kerry our climate envoy and others are conveying in their conversations leading up to glasgow q and just one more question has president biden been too passive in dealing with congress on some key matters you know today we saw senator warren turning against powell some democrats are criticizing him over not being involved enough in the debt ceiling and the infrastructure talks has the president thought about staying far enough ahead of these issues to keep them from blowing up among democrats ms psaki i m not sure that s a criticism in terms of him not being engaged enough that s actually coming from members but you can tell me if you have members who have said that q but debbie dingell said it yesterday on msnbc ms psaki that he s not engaged in the in getting the build back better agenda passed q she said that she wanted she wanted him to take a more aggressive stance ms psaki in what way did she say it i didn t see her comments q i don t have the transcript in front of me ms psaki okay look i would say as i just conveyed the president or senior members of his white house team had over 260 50 engage 260 sorry engagements on build back better we ve done 50 briefings with different departments on policy components the president proposed the entirety of this agenda these are based on his bold and ambitious ideas and he has had a range of hosted a range of meetings here gone across the country and communicated about his agenda so i would say that he knows pretty well how to get legislation passed and through sometimes that means private conversations sometimes it means private meetings sometimes it means public speeches and obviously the proof will be in the pudding if we get the legislation passed go ahead q hi jen just two questions about immigration first the state of florida as you re probably aware announced a lawsuit today that it s filing governor desantis also issued an executive order in which he tells florida agencies that they shouldn t be quote aiding or abetting the federal government when it comes to what they re saying is a violation of u s immigration policy does the white house have a response to that lawsuit ms psaki i haven t seen details of the lawsuit it s about immigration it sounds like q it has to do with they re saying that bor the rules at the border aren t being enforced that the administration has ms psaki i haven t seen details of the lawsuit what i will say is that any republican or any member who wants to have a constructive conversation about solutions to addressing what we all agree is not a long term sustainable operational or moral approach to immigration we re happy to have that conversation q and then on a related point secretary blinken met with the dominican foreign minister today obviously d r officials have been talking about their concerns about the international community needing to play a more active role in stabilizing haiti does secretary blinken agree that there needs to be more international cooperation ms psaki i think the state department is going to have the best readout of that meeting and more details than i would simon go ahead q thank you i have a couple of questions on ethiopia ms psaki sure q and then zambia and afghanistan on ethiopia it s been 11 days since the president authorized sanctions to be used against those undermining peace in ethiopia and nothing seems to have changed until now does the president have a deadline does he expect anything to happen for the sanctions to go into effect ms psaki so for people who are not following this as closely because we haven t talked about this a lot in here so on september 17th president biden signed an executive order establishing a new sanctions regime to help push for a resolution of the ongoing crisis in northern ethiopia we re continuing to urge from our diplomats and certainly members of our team on the ground or nearby to urging the parties to end ongoing hostilities take steps to initiate discussions to achieve a negotiated ceasefire and grant unimpeded humanitarian access the united nations secretary general african union leaders and a growing number of international actors have made clear there is no military solution unless the parties to the conflict make clear the cha make clear changes the administration is prepared to take aggressive action under this executive order to impose targeted sanctions so the sanctions authority the executive order gives sanctions authority this would be imposing targeted sanctions would be the next step here it gives us the authority to do exactly that i would also note that we are continuing to provide substantial humanitarian assistance to ethiopia totaling over 1 billion this year alone and we ll continue to support the people of ethiopia with assistance throughout the country and certainly there this issue deserves continued attention q and last week the white house was hosted for the first time two african presidents the president of ghana president akufo addo and the president of zambia was anything achieved during those you know those meetings and why were they not received by the president himself since he received the prime minister of india japan and australia ms psaki why were they not received in the same way q why were they not received by the president himself they were received by the vice president ms psaki oh sure look first of all i would say that you know the president is you know absolutely committed to our relationships with africa and are and calling out issues where we have concern but also looking for places we can work together having the vice president of the united states have these high level meetings shows the commitment of the biden harris administration to these relationships and to having open and constructive dialogues and hopefully the leaders who were here will take it as exactly that q jen ms psaki i just have to jump q inaudible ms psaki i guess i i m sorry i just got to jump around because i got to get more people karen go ahead q thanks jen according to the labor department the childcare industry is down more than 125 000 workers nationwide which is more than a 10 percent drop since before the pandemic when the president is having these conversations with lawmakers right now about the reconciliation bill how much of a priority is it for him to ensure that funding for childcare workers is included in that final bill ms psaki well clearly it was a part of his initial proposal so that tells you that it s a priority and certainly he recognizes the role that childcare workers many of whom also have challenges that are preventing them from them from being in the workhorse workforce maybe it s their own childcare needs maybe it s elder care that they are affording and paying for and there are a range of impacts that all of these components have on the reduction of childcare workers i would say also a fear of covid and fear of not being safe in workplaces so i m not going to prioritize from here as the bill as discussions are ongoing but certainly it was a priority to the president given it was his initial proposal and there are many advocates on capitol hill and in the american public for this as well q in terms of impact as you just said just since june there s been more than 10 000 childcare workers who ve left the industry and many are taking jobs that have higher increasing wages how quickly could the build back better agenda have an impact how quickly could funding potentially reverse this trend we re seeing ms psaki that s it s a great question karen i can check with our labor department and see if there s more specifics on projections i would say that this is a 10 year plan it s meant to address challenges over the long term certainly something that would be implemented as soon as it s passed into law but in terms of the projections of the immediacy of the impact i d have to check with our economists in the labor department george go ahead q thanks jen it s hard to find a good precedent for this morning s hearings given the importance of civilian control of the military are you at all uncomfortable with the generals testifying so openly and candidly about their advice to the president or disagreements with the president ms psaki we aren t and we feel this is a part of democracy the president values the candid advice of the secretary of the joint chiefs and of his military advisors as well as members of his national security team it doesn t mean he agrees always with every component and every element of his of advice but he welcomes the candor he welcomes the debate and that s the kind of president that he will continue to be go ahead q yeah i wanted to follow up actually on this question lieutenant colonel stuart scheller a marine officer who questioned the withdrawal and questioned essentially the commander in chief has been put in jail does president biden believe that that is appropriate given that president biden called lieutenant colonel alexander vindman a hero for speaking out against his commander in chief he even testified on capitol hill while in uniform so how is this different especially since you just said the president welcomes the candor and the advice of his military advisors does the president also see lieutenant colonel stuart scheller as a hero ms psaki i don t have all the details on these circumstances i understand that s going to be frustrating to you but we will work to get you an answer on it q one more one more ms psaki sure q okay i just wanted to follow up on a question from friday could you comment on the report over the weekend that the u s government had planned to kidnap julian assange how concerned is the white house about these reports is it going to going to investigate them and edward snowden tweeted about this saying maybe after story that the government literally plotted to murder assange this white house will finally stop stonewalling the press pool over the dubious charges against the biggest single biggest press freedom case in the united states can you respond ms psaki i would say i would point you to the department of justice about espionage charges and i would point you to the cia about the other report you asked about go ahead q and with respect to press freedom ms psaki i think i spoke to that on friday go ahead q thank you jen the president has not shied away from the historical implications of leaving afghanistan he s noted that it was time to end a 20 year war he has said that he is not going to pass this war on to a fifth president so given that he understands the gravity and he has framed it in the historical context i know that you said you re not going to detail private conversations but can you give us a little bit more of an explanation as to why not don t the you know doesn t the american public given the historical gravity of that decision don t they deserve to know who was advising the president and who was on the other side of that argument about leaving troops in afghanistan ms psaki i would say first that what the american public can know and understand is that the president will welcome and take and ask for and push for a range of opinions on every national security decision that he makes and we re not going to detail those private discussions private decisions that happen in the situation room for the public what the president has also been very candid and clear about and will continue to be and you outlined much of this is why he made the decision that he made and even as it relates to the recommendation on 2 500 it s also important for the american public to understand that was not going to be a sustainable number over the long term and what the decision he was making was about was not sending their daughters their sons their grandchildren back to fight a war that the afghans would not fight themselves and it was about a phase not a long term recommendation q and then two quick follow ups yesterday i asked you about the uyghur forced labor prevention act ms psaki yeah q which sailed through the senate with bipartisan support can you tell us where the president stands on that legislation and then another follow up you mentioned the monitoring devices such as ankle bracelets and biometrics that some of these folks are being outfitted with as they await their court date is there a percentage that you can tell us about how many folks have you know been issued that biometric ms psaki that s part of the process q but can you tell us how many have already been issued that or is that happening later ms psaki biometric that s required as it relates to putting people back into the immigration proceedings q yeah ms psaki the department of homeland security can give you the rundown but that s part of the standard process q okay gotcha and then the uyghur ms psaki sure so we of course the president has of course expressed concern as you know in the past about the treatment of uyghurs has of course raised that as it has been raised directly with the chinese as it relates to the legislation we don t have a position at this point in time on this particular piece of legislation it does include but i will note that we have implemented concrete measures to promote accountability for individuals and entities implicated in human rights abuses and atrocities in xinjiang this includes steps we ve taken on our own i should say visa restrictions global magnitsky and financial sanctions export controls import restrictions the release of a business advisory and committed to taking action to ensure all global supply chains are free from the use of forced labor at the g7 i know it s passed the senate but i don t think it has moved in the house at this point in time the status q thank you jen ms psaki okay thanks everyone all right have a great day i ll see you tomorrow or later this afternoon whenever 2 58 p m edt
americans believe they re being ripped off by pharmaceutical companies and almost any policy that promises to lower drug prices polls extremely well even among republicans so it s somewhat surprising that democrats are fighting internally over a proposal to let medicare negotiate drug prices what s not to like about a policy that would lower costs for consumers while sticking it to big pharma in one sense americans are right that they re paying too much a rand corp report this year found that in 2018 the cost of brand name drugs in the united states averaged more than three times what people in comparable rich world countries were paying for the same medications the congressional budget office cbo estimates that letting the government negotiate prices for medicare across the board rather than continuing to leave it to the individual insurers that participate in medicare part d could save almost 500 billion over 10 years unfortunately saving that money could have some unwanted side effects americans outsized health related spending provides an outsized share of the incentive for the global pharmaceutical industry to innovate the cbo suggests that the negotiation proposal would ultimately reduce the number of drugs brought to market by about 10 percent a year coincidentally 500 billion is almost exactly what covid 19 knocked off the u s economy in 2020 what if something such as the vaccines that liberated us ends up in that missing 10 percent advertisement how much was it worth to us collectively to avoid another year or two of full on pandemic more than 500 billion for sure once you add all the other devastating costs the pandemic inflicted the businesses that failed and will never come back the year of social isolation and psychological distress the staggering learning loss suffered by children and the lost social and emotional development the hundreds of thousands of deaths the untold number of people afflicted with lingering disabilities from their bout with covid 19 and that doesn t count the effect on other nations where the gdp losses alone run into the trillions worldwide follow this author megan mcardle s opinions follow all this is the benefit from just one treatment admittedly the most extreme and obvious example of the great benefits pharmaceutical research can bring but there are plenty of other examples from recent years such as cancer immunotherapies and a cure for hepatitis c of course advocates for tougher price negotiations would say that they don t want to give up those innovations they want to shave a different 10 percent off the pharmaceutical industry s output the minor tweaks to existing products or say the dubious alzheimer s treatments better still they d like drug companies to spend the same amount on research and less on marketing or dividends for shareholders advertisement but this argument fundamentally misunderstands corporate decision making it treats research and development as a budgeting problem rather than an investment problem as if drug companies were deciding how much to spend on r d the way you decide how much of your income to spend on groceries every month in fact corporations consider the decision the way individuals choose mutual funds for their 401 k is this investment likely to make me better off than any of the other things i could do with the money like you pharmaceutical firms want to be compensated for taking on extra risk which is why bond funds pay a lower rate of return than an aggressive growth stock fund and drug development is an extremely risky activity it costs billions of dollars for a company to develop a pharmaceutical candidate and take it through the many layers of expensive food and drug administration mandated clinical trials nine out of every 10 candidates flunks those tests somewhere along the line the cost of all those failures is why the cbo estimates that companies have to spend an average of 1 billion just on the clinical trials to bring a new drug to market moreover that cost has been increasing over time advertisement investors and companies will put their money into such projects only if the potential upside compensates them for the likelihood of failure if the government steps in to reduce the price they can charge fewer projects will look like potential winners and fewer will be funded in the first place and while it would be nice if the ones that get cut were the ones we least need forcing broad price cuts by government fiat uses too blunt a tool for such delicate surgery arguably the tweaks and me too projects will be the last things to go after all we know they work and there s a good market for them unlike some blue sky project that s potentially more useful but also much more likely to fail

used in fair transparent and inclusive ways the consensus for change report also reinforces the need for transparency and trust to increase public support for technology deployments citizens want the benefits of technology to be easily understood and for it to be used in ways that are transparent fair and inclusive the research also identifies that more public engagement is needed to increase understanding of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence ai as technology continues to quickly evolve it is critical for organisations to ensure that their advancements are built and understood to be human centric saptharishi said for example artificial intelligence should be designed in a way that respects human decision making and considers the public s input and needs while allowing users to make better informed decisions and respond to complex threats by designing advanced technologies to be assistive we ensure that the decision making remains the sole responsibility of humans the consensus for change report is an essential resource for public safety agencies and enterprises to understand and apply lessons from the pandemic the pandemic has highlighted the need to look at things and respond differently from assessing risks and better predicting areas of operational disruption to evaluating and integrating the right technologies to support business continuity it

so should investors play the ev space by investing in vehicle manufacturers battery makers lithium producers or charging stations well all of th this story originally appeared on marketbeat once a group that could seemingly only go up electric vehicle ev stocks have had a rough ride in 2021 first it was fears of rising rates and the corresponding impact on companies with high valuations more recently it has been doubts about the viability of the biden administration s infrastructure plan weighing on ev stock performance while the path of interest rates and government spending on clean energy initiatives remains unclear one thing is for certain electric vehicles of all shapes and sizes are coming governments worldwide are rolling out new carbon emission targets and incentives designed to make people and businesses want to go green according to consulting group alixpartners evs will account for roughly one in four global vehicle sales by the end of the decade so should investors play the ev space by investing in vehicle manufacturers battery makers lithium producers or charging stations well all of the above consider charging your long term growth portfolio with these three oversold ev plays will canoo stock make a comeback there are several upstart ev manufacturers not named tesla and canoo nyse goev is among the most interesting the former spac has developed a versatile platform that serves as the base for a range of personal and commercial evs some designs look more like brinks armored trucks but its plausible the canoo look catches on with rugged outdoorsy consumers and fleet operators while the boxy vehicle design is unappealing to some canoo s proprietary plug and play technology is appealing from an investment standpoint because it makes the company s cost structure more manageable the ability to use the same platform across its vehicle fleet creates operating efficiencies and improves profit potential like its vehicles canoo s financial statements aren t pretty the company is still pre revenue and therefore piling up the losses at this stage so risk bearing investors will have to take a leap of faith that management s path to manufacturing will play out as expected and that pre orders will be good canoo is targeting q4 of next year to start contract manufacturing in europe before launching production at its own u s plant in 2023 in the last few days canoo stock has started to paddle back upstream in good volume a head and shoulders bottom pattern has formed on the daily chart putting the 10 to 11 range in the crosshairs and with the influence of social media investors a potential squeeze on the highly shorted stock could be forthcoming is lithium americas a good long term ev play vancouver based lithium americas nyse lac hasn t experienced the selloffs that other ev stocks have but the recent dip is looking like a good entry point the company is well positioned to be a long term winner as a supplier of battery quality lithium carbonate to battery makers and ev manufacturers lithium americas is developing a pair of promising lithium mining projects its thacker pass project is located north of reno nv while its cauchari olaroz project is in argentina construction at the fully owned thacker pass the largest lithium resource in the u s is slated to begin early next year with a mine life of 46 years annual lithium production is forecast to be 60 000 tons once up to full speed at cauchari olaroz production is set to get underway around the middle of next year that project has a 40 year life and annual production capacity of 40 000 tons projected cash costs to operate the mines are around 3 000 compare that to lithium carbonate prices which have recently soared above 16 000 and the expected profit margins are enormous demand for lithium as a key input for ev batteries is expected to increase throughout the decade with global lithium supply limited many customers will be turning to lithium americas and so should investors is chargepoint a good ev infrastructure stock after nearly touching 50 chargepoint holdings nyse chpt is now a 20 stock and an inexpensive play on ev infrastructure the company runs one of the largest ev charging networks in north america and is quickly expanding its footprint in europe as ev adoption unfolds around the world consumers and commercial fleet operators will need the hardware software and services to keep their vehicles moving chargepoint is in a good position to be one of the leading providers well before you could buy an electric vehicle chargepoint was building its business today there are more than 100 000 stations on the chargepoint network that serve early ev adopters including three fourths of fortune 50 companies and with approximately 60 billion projected to be spent on ev charging infrastructure across north america and europe by 2030 the network is about to get much bigger since chargepoint is

matt mcclain pool getty images washington u s treasury secretary janet yellen said tuesday that if congress doesn t raise the debt ceiling by the deadline it would be a calamity testifying before the u s senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs alongside federal reserve system chairman jerome powell yellen said the u s would hit its debt limit in less than three weeks on oct 18 this would be a manufactured crisis we had imposed on this country which has been going through a very difficult period and is on the road to recovery she said this would be a self inflicted wound of enormous proportions the united states has never defaulted on its debt congress has voted 80 times to raise or suspend the debt limit since 1960 yellen has previously laid out the consequences to lawmakers of missing the deadline she has said nearly 50 million seniors could temporarily stop receiving social security checks troops could go unpaid and millions of families who receive the monthly child tax credit could experience delays a default could also trigger a spike in interest rates and result in a steep drop in stock prices and other financial turmoil reversing the current economic recovery into a recession with billions of dollars of growth and millions of jobs lost yellen painted a grim picture again tuesday even if congress increases the debt limit but does so too close to the deadline it could cause economic fallout yellen said furthermore we know from previous debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence raise borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the united states for years to come failure to act promptly could also result in substantial disruptions to financial markets as heightened uncertainty can exacerbate volatility and erode investor confidence yellen outlined in a letter to congressional leadership yellen also reiterated that raising the debt limit has nothing to do with future government spending a point some republicans have tried to push as reason for not supporting a debt limit hike as democrats on the hill scramble to try to pass both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a larger social spending package i want to see that the debt ceiling is raised i believe that it would be catastrophic not to do so but i equally believe that deficits have been under both democratic and republican administrations it s important to recognize that and that means paying the bills for those deficits is a shared responsibility yellen testified abc news congressional correspondent rachel scott contributed to this report copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

history of u s relations with japan the long history of japanese immigration is full of racism segregation and exclusion congress passed the chinese exclusion act in 1882 prohibiting further chinese immigration this xenophobia carried over to other east asians and the growing anti japanese sentiment culminated in 1906 when san francisco segregated its japanese students requiring them to attend exclusively chinese schools president theodore roosevelt keen to placate an offended japan worked out a gentleman s agreement nullifying the segregation but limiting japanese immigrant laborers during this period most immigrants were japanese women chosen in arranged marriages picture brides who had never met their future spouses until they arrived on the docks of san francisco or honolulu the gentlemen s agreement was superseded by the immigration act of 1924 which prohibited any further japanese immigrants until the controversial mccarran walter act of 1952 once again opened up limited asian immigration discriminatory immigration policy finally ended with the immigration act of 1965 which allowed for 170 000 annual immigrants from the eastern hemisphere and 120 000 from the western hemisphere with a quota of 20 000 per asian country between 1965 and 1985 four times as many japanese immigrated to the u s than between 1849 and 1965 no country has had more influence on japan during its modern history than the united states it was the us that pried open japan s closed feudal society in the mid 19th century thanks to matthew perry s visit which led to the convention of kanagawa in 1854 within several years renewed contact with the west profoundly altered japanese society the shogunate resigned and the emperor was restored to power numerous western institutions were adopted including a western legal and educational system and constitutional government along parliamentary lines in 1898 the last of the unequal treaties with western powers was removed signaling japan s new status among the nations of the world japan s sneak attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 represented up until that time the single most shocking assault on american territory in us history it also launched one of the greatest civil rights tragedies in american history with the forced relocation of japanese americans from the west coast and into internment camps the japanese military leadership had hoped the attack on pearl harbor would cripple the us naval fleet in the pacific leaving the west coast vulnerable to japan s navy and force officials in washington to sue for peace although the attack produced considerable damage to numerous naval vessels including the core of us battleships the aerial assault failed to harm the most important weapon in the american arsenal aircraft carriers this blunder on the part of the japanese navy would come back to haunt japan as the us was able to challenge japanese fleets in key battles in 1942 specifically in the coral sea and near midway island the latter proved to be a turning point in the war as us warplanes destroyed four japanese aircraft carriers effectively curtailing the power of japan s navy for the remainder of wwii by 1945 the us navy and marines had captured important islands from the japanese including guadalcanal the solomon islands new guinea the philippines iwo jima and okinawa president harry s truman argued that a full invasion of japan would prove too costly and decided on aerial attacks to force japan into surrendering after four months of intense bombardment with conventional weapons the united states dropped the atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki an estimated 340 000 persons died from the two attacks and the subsequent effects of radiation missouri on september 2 1945 the subsequent occupation 1945 1952 by the united states resulted in a dramatic reshaping of japanese society political reforms included the adoption of a parliamentary system of government based on democratic principles and universal suffrage a symbolic role for the emperor as titular head of state the establishment of independent trade unions and the disarmament of the military economic reforms consisted of land reform and economic and political rights for women on august 14 japan accepted the potsdam declaration for unconditional surrender with formal surrender documents signed aboard the usson september 2 1945 the subsequent occupation 1945 1952 by the united states resulted in a dramatic reshaping of japanese society political reforms included the adoption of a parliamentary system of government based on democratic principles and universal suffrage a symbolic role for the emperor as titular head of state the establishment of independent trade unions and the disarmament of the military economic reforms consisted of land reform and economic and political rights for women heavy economic aid from the united states helped the japanese to rebuild their country a revision of the 1952 defense treaty with the united states under which a limited number of troops were to remain in japan for defense purposes was signed amid growing controversy in 1960 the us japanese security treaty was renewed in 1970 despite vigorous protest by the opposition parties and militant student organizations the japanese government had to balance left wing pressure advocating dissociation from the united states against the realities of the need for military protection recognizing the popular desire for the return of the ryukyu islands and the bonin islands in 1953 the us relinquished its control of the amami group of islands at the northern end of the ryukyu islands but the us made no commitment to return okinawa which was then under american military administration for an indefinite period as provided in the peace treaty japanese lawmakers unanimously adopted a resolution in june 1956 calling for a return of okinawa to japan bilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959 and the new treaty of mutual cooperation and security was signed in washington on january 19 1960 when the pact was submitted to the diet for ratification it became the subject of bitter debate over the japan united states relationship and the occasion for violence in an all out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its passage japan socialist party deputies boycotted the lower house session and tried to prevent the ldp deputies from entering the chamber and they were forcibly removed by the police massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions followed these outbursts prevented a scheduled visit to japan by president dwight d eisenhower and precipitated the resignation of prime minister kishi nobusuke but not before the treaty was passed by default on june 19 when the house of councillors failed to vote on the issue within the required thirty days after lower house approval under the treaty both parties assumed an obligation to assist each other in case of armed attack on territories under japanese administration it was understood however that japan could not come to the defense of the united states because it was constitutionally forbidden to send armed forces overseas in particular the constitution forbade the maintenance of land sea and air forces in june 1968 the united states returned the bonin islands including iwo jima to japanese administration control prime minister sato eisaku visited washington in november 1969 and in a joint communiqué signed by him and president richard m nixon announced the united states agreement to return okinawa to japan in 1972 a new problem between the us and japan arose in the early 1970s in july 1971 the japanese government was surprised by nixon s dramatic announcement of his forthcoming visit to the people s republic of china many japanese were chagrined by the failure of the united states to consult in advance with japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign policy the following month the government was again surprised to learn that without prior consultation the united states had imposed a 10 surcharge on imports a decision certain to hinder japan s exports to the united states relations between tokyo and washington were further strained by the monetary crisis involving the december 1971 revaluation of the japanese yen us dissatisfaction with japanese defense efforts began to surface in 1975 when secretary of defense james a schlesinger publicly stigmatized japan as a passive defense partner due to the crisis in iran in 1979 the united states decided to relocate more than 50 of its naval strength from east asian waters to the indian ocean japan was repeatedly pressed not only to increase its defense expenditures and build up its antisubmarine and naval patrol capabilities but also to play a more active and positive security role generally japan reacted to the iranian hostage crisis by condemning the action as a violation of international law at the same time japanese trading firms and oil companies reportedly purchased iranian oil that had become available when the united states banned oil imported from iran this action brought sharp criticism from the united states of japanese government insensitivity for allowing the oil purchases and led to a japanese apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against iran in concert with other united states allies the japanese government constrained by constitutional limitations and pacifist public opinion responded slowly to pressures for a more rapid buildup of its self defense forces sdf it steadily increased its budgetary outlays for those forces however and indicated its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining the united states military bases in japan in 1976 the united states and japan formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation in the framework of a bilateral security consultative committee provided for under the 1960 security treaty this subcommittee in turn drew up new guidelines for japan united states defense cooperation in 1978 under which military planners of the two countries conducted studies relating to joint military action in the event of an armed attack on japan a qualitatively new stage of japan united states cooperation in world affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of prime minister nakasone yasuhiro officials of the reagan administration worked closely with their japanese counterparts to develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their common security and international outlook nakasone reassured united states leaders of japan s determination against the soviet threat closely coordinated policies with the us toward such asian trouble spots as the korean peninsula and southeast asia and worked cooperatively with the us in developing china policy the japanese government welcomed the increase of united states forces in japan and the western pacific continued the steady buildup of the sdf and positioned japan firmly on the side of the united states against the threat of soviet international expansion the main area of non cooperation between the united states and japan in the 1980s was japanese resistance to repeated american efforts to get japan to open its markets more to foreign goods to deal with domestic pressures while trying to avoid a break with the united states the japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations this tactic bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new industries to grow stronger agreements reached dealt with some aspects of the problems but it was common for trade or economic issues to be dragged out in talks over several years involving more than one market opening agreement such agreements were sometimes vague and subject to conflicting interpretations in japan and the united states a key arena for trade talks was the market oriented sector selective moss talks started by the reagan administration in march 1985 the moss talks covered japanese trade in five areas telecommunications medical equipment and pharmaceuticals forestry products electronics and auto parts one problem that involved both trade and security occurred in 1987 when american officials and media lashed out at toshiba for illegally selling sophisticated machinery of american origin to the soviet union which reportedly allowed moscow to make submarines quiet enough to avoid united states detection us japan relations became more uncertain in the early 1990s than at any time since world war ii the post cold war environment strengthened the relative importance of economic over military power as the major source of world influence this shift affected the perceived relative standing of japan the united states and other powers increasingly japan was expected to shoulder international aid and economic responsibilities that in the past were discharged by the united states and other western countries some public opinion polls in the us showed that most respondents considered the challenge from japan to be more serious than that from russia similarly poll data in japan showed that most japanese considered negative american attitudes toward japan a reflection of us anger at america s slipping economic position some japanese commentators argued that the united states was weak dependent on japan and unable to come to terms with world economic competition in 1993 the clinton administration negotiated the united states japan framework for a new economic partnership at the insistence of the clinton administration new criteria were developed to determine whether japan was fulfilling its obligations under the framework this proved highly controversial and the two countries never agreed on the role that objective criteria would play or what it would constitute over the years japanese investors have established a strong presence in the united states japanese foreign direct investment fdi in the us surged in the 1980s and continued to increase in the 1990s in the 1980s japanese investors acquired such high profile us assets as columbia pictures rockefeller center and pebble beach golf course these investments followed surges in japanese investments in the united states by japanese consumer electronics firms and auto producers the rapid increase of the investments and their high visibility generated concerns in the united states of japan buying up the united states

st paul marketed as an easy to use and convenient way to self diagnose covid 19 over the counter rapid tests seem hard to come by websites for walgreens cvs and other pharmacies list brands of the tests as out of stock even in minnesota where residents have easier access to free tests than neighboring states rapid tests appear to be in short supply having been to a couple pharmacies recently when we were looking for some of those rapid tests they are sold out at a lot of pharmacies in minnesota said dr amy karger an associate professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the university of minnesota medical school amid a surge in covid 19 infections driven by the coronavirus delta variant a renewed demand for the tests has made them hard to find the makers of one rapid test brand in august told the new york times that demand was 1 000 times what it had forecast the minnesota department of health last week cited the demand for tests in announcing the launch of two semi permanent testing sites in lino lakes and minneapolis the move stands in contrast to the closure of several state run testing sites earlier in the summer amid a decline in new cases advertisement testing rates in minnesota which help to gauge the spread of covid 19 seem to still be strong health department spokesperson doug schultz said in an email that labs handling tests last month processed between 10 000 and 30 000 samples a day we don t really know how many over the counter tests are being used daily in mn but it is not likely to be significant in comparison schultz wrote schultz said the health department is also continuing to evaluate to determine if the overall positivity rate is being affected by the absence of reports of at home test results with the exception of the free saliva tests minnesota offers at home tests aren t generally reported to the health department even a case reported by a doctor to the minnesota health department based on a patient s results from an over the counter test performed at home according to schultz would not be recorded there are a number of reasons why schultz said some of which have to do with inconsistencies in information collected by test makers such as zip codes and birth dates and we really don t have any way to validate the test result a patient calling their doctor to report their positive result on the other hand would likely be asked to come in for a follow up exam schultz said although protocols may differ from provider to provider karger who helped advise state officials in their efforts to test for covid 19 had a similar outlook generally speaking the data that department health is collecting is likely accurately going to reflect what s going on she said even if they re not capturing all the tests necessarily in the state they can look at those rates of positivity to kind of get a sense of whether we re going in the right direction or not advertisement test makers and health officials still recommend consulting a doctor and alerting close contacts if you do test positive on an over the counter product

washington sept 28 xinhua u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell said on tuesday that inflation pressures could last longer than expected amid supply bottlenecks inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating powell said at a hearing before the senate banking committee as the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds we are seeing upward pressure on prices particularly due to supply bottlenecks in some sectors these effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated but they will abate he said powell noted that bottlenecks hiring difficulties and other constraints could prove to be greater and more enduring than anticipated posing upside risks to inflation as the process of reopening the economy continues the fed chief also admitted that u s inflation is now more concerning than earlier this year as some of the supply bottlenecks have gotten worse if sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern we would certainly respond and use our tools to ensure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal he said the fed last week kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at the record low level of near zero while signaling that the central bank may begin tapering asset purchases soon the fed has pledged to continue its asset purchase program at least at the current pace of 120 billion u s dollars per month until substantial further progress has been made on employment and inflation the consumer price index cpi increased 5 3 percent over the past 12 months through august slightly down from the 5 4 percent pace in the 12 months through june and july according to the u s labor department u s treasury secretary janet yellen also said on tuesday that the elevated inflation this year largely reflected supply disruptions associated with the covid 19 pandemic these supply disruptions will likely fade again this view is not solely my own it is widely shared among economists and financial market participants yellen said in a speech to the national association for business economics enditem
unknown the golden reality behind uncle sam s inflated bar tab math vs double speak another glaringly ignored inflation indicator cola 2 2022 giving clarity to the taper debate but what if the fed tapers does it matter embarrassing treasuries bad iou s druckenmiller s astonishment from mania to desperate back to the what if of a naked taper predictable behavior the realpolitik of covid inflation is the new normal as we are now seeing a critical shift in global markets and this will have huge implications in the future matthew piepenburg at matterhorn asset management based in switzerland below we look at even more inflationary forces as confirmed by cost of living adjustments uncle sam s interest expenses objectively unloved treasuries and a roaring covid narrative given the fact that just about everything coming out of the mouths of debt cornered policy makers requires a lie detector and double speak translator we ve been arguing since the moment the fed began peddling the transitory inflation meme mythtoward this end we ve written and spoken at length as often as we can as to the from increased governmental guarantees controls over commercial bank loans commodity super cycles to just plain economic realism but let us not stop there as other inflationary storm clouds are on the horizon yet ignored not surprisingly by an increasingly clueless financial media in particular we are thinking about theit would seem that theunlike powell and therefore preparing i e adjusting for the same as the price for entitlement obligations rises so too will the level of money printing to pay for the same a veritable vicious circle for rising inflation then there s simple math we ve talked about the realpolitik ofas the final and desperate way for debt soaked sovereigns to service their debt the signs of this are literally everywhere if we take for example a 1 4 treasury yield and subtract a potential 6 cola increase for social security we get 4 6 real rates which is continuing to enjoy a debt jubilee of negative 3 real i e free mortgages the necessary evil of negative real rates also speaks to the ongoing taper debate as tweets by twits pour across the electronic universe it s often important to noticesuch asas the financial world hangs on the edge of its seat to see if the fed will taper its qe i e money printing program and send bonds and stocks to the floor and rates toward the sky specifically we are referring to the chart belowon the debt bar tab of a now fully debt intoxicated uncle sam with central bank accommodated asset bubbles from stocks to real estate to art now at historically unprecedented levels tax receipts flowing into the u s coffers from the ever growing millionaire to billionaire class have been rising this may seem good for that punch drunk uncle sam but what no one is talking about is that despite even those capital gain receipts in other words evencan anyone say uh oh given the stark but ignored reality of u s debt the implications going forward are fairly clear as less qe will mean a higher interest rate and thus higher interest expense on debt it can t even pay at today s artificially low rates stated otherwise given the dangers of such a taper it likely won t happen because it can t happen and this means more money printing and hence more negative real rates ahead a weaker usd and rising precious metal prices among others alternatively should the fed somehow turn hawkish and taper its qe support in the face of a debt forest fire treasuries will sell off dramatically rates will rise markets will tank and the usd will surge not good for gold btc or just about anything else but as we ve also tried to make crystal clear there is no way the fed will taper qe liquidity before it sets up a back channel for even more liquidity from the standing repo facility reverse repo facility and fima swap lines which are just qe by other names in simple speak therefore as the fed has many liquidity tricks up its tattered sleeves in addition to liquidity tricks theas we ve said so many times the biggest issue today is unsustainable and embarrassing debt levels compliments of policy makers rather than a viral pandemic narrative out of all proportion to its confused scientific truths for blaming global debt 300t or u s public debt 28 5t on a flu rather than a sordid history of grotesque mismanagement from politico s and bankers that was in play long before the first headlines out of wuhan furthermore covid monetary and fiscal policy measuresthan the post lehman bailout of those otherwise too big to fail banks in short the façade and branding of a humanitarian crisis allowed a market saving liquidity rescueto an otherwise dead on arrival bond market in late 2019 in case this sounds too controversial to consider please follow the treasury market rather than our bemused nouns and adjectives not to mention our total lack of scientific medical credentials just like friends don t accept ious from drug addicts global investors heading into 2020 stopped buying uncle sam s treasuries in simple speak as a result his treasury bonds once seen as safe havens were finally seen as bad bets akin to the paper coming out of equally discredited zip codes like greece italy or spain for this reason foreigners in a nervous 2020 unlike a broken 2009 had not only stopped buying u s treasuries they were selling them yep months ago smart voices from the street including stan druckenmiller were warning about the implications of such a shift in financial consciousness specifically druckenmiller spoke of something he d never seen in over 40 years as a market veteran that is as stocks were tanking in the spring of 2020 he also saw the bond market lose 18 points in one day this correlated fall in stocks and bonds was not as everyone tweeted a reaction to the fiscal profligacy of the cares act but more sadly a very new trend by foreigners to get rid of increasingly discredited u s ious for over two decades including during the great financial crisis of 2009 u s treasuries and the usd were once seen as safe landing places for foreign money rather than a risky bet now instead of seeing an annual average 500b inflow into u s bonds we are seeing annual outflows of 500b and how will they come up the money to cover these purchases you guessed it again needless to say such realism i e objective math puts a lot of pressure on the u s dollar as the fed is forced to create even more money at a record pace to buy otherwise unwanted treasuries but what kept the usd from falling in favor by end of 2020 if no one was buying our bonds but the fed well the short answer is that all that foreign money from sovereign wealth funds and central banks once ear marked for our once credible u s treasury bonds went instead into those massiveand how did druckenmiller describe this shift simple he called it a raging new mania foreign money once reserved for safe haven bonds was and is pouring into an already over sized equity bubble by july the usd had peaked but after a peak comes well a fall for the greenback all very good for commodities real estate precious metals growth tech stocks and of course gold but and this is a very big but what if the fed were insane enough to taper qe without any back door liquidity from foreign swap lines and the repo programs again ugly treasuries would get even uglier tank in price sending rates and the usd higher and gold lower along with a sharp sell off in risk assets i e corporate stocks and bonds and again we don t think this will happen because as desperate as central bankers are they are equally predictable that is they know that such a naked taper i e a taper without a back door repo or swap induced liquidity would cause rates to spike and hence uncle sam s bar tab to default as the fed s vice chair intimated last year us treasuries uncle sam s bar tab are simply too big to fail for now which choice do you think they ll make meanwhile and regardless of one s views on the vaccine mandates case fatality rates vs infection rates or mask wearing vs mask annoyance no one needs our amateur medical advice rather than as controversial health issue it s also fairly clear thatwhy again i e fiat monetary expansion and hence more inflation to inflate away the debt of debt drunk nations already fatally in debt pre covid rightly or wrongly there are already scientists out of the uk namely oxford vaccine creator sarah gilbert with more iq power and credibility than fauci or fergusson admittedly not a high bar who are already signaling that covid will resemble little more than a common cold by next year this if true would be good for the world but would the policy makers like this a post covid normal would be a boon to commerce and economic activity and hence a boon to the velocity of money which again we think is the realistic i e only option for these financial magicians running our governments lives and central banks in such a scenario upon the inflation to come in short and however we look at it regardless of how the taper or covid debate plays out as the future unfolds gold whose price is waiting for confirmation of such inflation will only grow stronger as the transitory meme gets weaker by the day

a big buy sell order hitting the asx for no specific reason other than one presumes a big offshore fund realigning its portfolio yesterday morning a 42 point fall in the futures did not synch with wall street overnight nor indeed the prior day s enthusiasm over light at the end of the lockdown tunnel typically in these instances the smarter investors simply step aside on down days looking forward to the opportunity the next day to pick up some positions at lower prices when the asx200 dropped from the open the market simply fed on itself and it s notable that these out of place sell offs so often pull up at the down one hundred level so typically i would suggest the index will bounce today as those smarter investors move back in but this time it s different wall street has tanked overnight and the spi futures are down 82 points this morning yesterday s was not exactly the usual market wide sell off nonetheless the stark outsider was the energy sector up 4 3 with a flow on to utilities up 0 7 energy is part of the problem and not of the solution the problem being rising wholesale inflation putting pressure on corporate margins best then to back the problem to offset its impact elsewhere the banks also stood out in only falling 0 5 despite having a solid run these past few sessions on rising bond yields the aussie ten year rose another 5 basis points yesterday to 1 46 which sell orders aside was a more fundamental effect on stocks every other sector fell at least 1 four sectors fell over 2 and healthcare was the biggest loser on 3 6 materials technology and property were the other 2 plus losers among individual stocks four of the top five index winners were energy names or five if you count thermal coal miner whitehaven coal whc the biggest losers were a mixed bag but that was yesterday and we move on to today and note that september has reminded us that it s still with us until friday when we then move into the historically most volatile month of the year the focus in the us is now very much shifting towards stagflation economic growth slowing as inflation rises rising inflation is typically a positive sign for an economy but only if it is demand side inflation the current issue in the us and across the globe right now is supply side inflation in both the us and australia a lot of faith is being put into a rapid rebound out of delta impacts in australia s case out of lockdowns we saw that last year so such faith is not unwarranted but in the meantime supply shortages and bottlenecks and soaring freight costs are painting a different picture okay i see your point we recall that at last week s fed meeting nine fomc members forecast the first rate hike in 2022 us futures markets were before last night pricing in the first rate hike in december 2022 the counter has been the fed chair who has insisted the inflation spike is transitory transitory does not come with a defined timeline economies perennial move through cycles everything could thus be called transitory in a regular testimony to congress last night jay powell admitted in prepared remarks that the surge in inflation because of supply chain bottlenecks and other challenges related to the reopening of the economy has been larger and longer lasting than anticipated but they will abate he said and as they do inflation is expected to drop backward toward the fed s 2 goal but powell acknowledged that there are risks that price pressures are higher than anticipated or more enduring hence the fed would raise interest rates if sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern on that note wall street tanked the us ten year yield rose another 5 basis points to 1 53 when last us bond yields spiked back in march the nasdaq copped the brunt in the interim investors reassessed the big tech names and decided in actual fact the faamgs are not so rate sensitive being reliable cash flow machines and hence more defensive than cyclical it is the faamgs that drove wall street to recent new highs while within the s p500 a bulk of stocks have actually undergone a correction technology is 40 of the s p market cap spread across three sectors being information technology apple microsoft communication services facebook google and consumer discretionary amazon as investors shifted out of 2020 winners and cyclicals hit by 2021 s delta wave they continued to push the faamg s into what most considered overvalued territory until last night last night the technology sector fell 3 0 communication 2 8 and discretionary 2 0 the other big losers were utilities 2 6 and property 2 3 which are genuinely impacted by rising yields financials spent the day trying to hang on given banks benefit from higher yields but in the end they too gave in 1 5 the only sector to close in the green on the day was you guessed it energy but only by 0 5 energy is only 3 of the s p these days once having been the biggest sector the rockefellers are still pretty well off nonetheless last night s sell off did not take the s p as low as last week s evergrande sell off and all year wall street has typically bounced fairly quickly after such blips evergrande

matt mcclain pool getty images washington u s treasury secretary janet yellen said tuesday that if congress doesn t raise the debt ceiling by the deadline it would be a calamity testifying before the u s senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs alongside federal reserve system chairman jerome powell yellen said the u s would hit its debt limit in less than three weeks on oct 18 this would be a manufactured crisis we had imposed on this country which has been going through a very difficult period and is on the road to recovery she said this would be a self inflicted wound of enormous proportions the united states has never defaulted on its debt congress has voted 80 times to raise or suspend the debt limit since 1960 yellen has previously laid out the consequences to lawmakers of missing the deadline she has said nearly 50 million seniors could temporarily stop receiving social security checks troops could go unpaid and millions of families who receive the monthly child tax credit could experience delays a default could also trigger a spike in interest rates and result in a steep drop in stock prices and other financial turmoil reversing the current economic recovery into a recession with billions of dollars of growth and millions of jobs lost yellen painted a grim picture again tuesday even if congress increases the debt limit but does so too close to the deadline it could cause economic fallout yellen said furthermore we know from previous debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence raise borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the united states for years to come failure to act promptly could also result in substantial disruptions to financial markets as heightened uncertainty can exacerbate volatility and erode investor confidence yellen outlined in a letter to congressional leadership yellen also reiterated that raising the debt limit has nothing to do with future government spending a point some republicans have tried to push as reason for not supporting a debt limit hike as democrats on the hill scramble to try to pass both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a larger social spending package i want to see that the debt ceiling is raised i believe that it would be catastrophic not to do so but i equally believe that deficits have been under both democratic and republican administrations it s important to recognize that and that means paying the bills for those deficits is a shared responsibility yellen testified abc news congressional correspondent rachel scott contributed to this report copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved
both princeton tool and the company it recently acquired paragon precision specialize in the precision machining of turbomachinery parts like this impeller photo credit princeton tool mergers and acquisitions m a among machine shops are in one sense business as usual and in another sense something new just like in any other business sector m a fluctuations among machine shops are typically driven by economic conditions conditions such as low interest rates and the availability of cheap money the existence of an economic recovery after a downturn and favorable stock market conditions that provide capital for m a activity what is new is the extent to which acquisitions and consolidation among machine shops seem to be on the rise as the baby boomer generation nears or enters retirement age many shop owners have no natural successor to turn to and as machining transitions from regional focused businesses to shops more and more often serving a national base of customers small or mid sized shops often are interested in merging with another company that is better able to manage costly business operations such as accounting or marketing or able to expand the combined company s customer base capacity and product line but no matter what the stated reasons are for consolidation among machine shops the goal is usually the same to emerge as a company that is bigger and better than the sum of its parts when the new leadership at princeton tool which was founded near cleveland ohio in 1997 wanted to expand the business organic growth was not accomplishing that goal quickly enough as the company looked into expansion arguments in favor of acquiring another shop began to grow photo credit provided by princeton tool that was certainly the objective for ken bevington iii and his company princeton tool a business that his father started in cleveland ohio in 1997 the company that began in the basement of the family home as a tool and die shop specializing in secondary operations and small mold work has continually expanded to the point that today it uses more than 160 edm machines and cnc machining centers for the manufacture of complex turbomachinery parts for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine industries we talked to bevington last year shortly after he announced that princeton tool had acquired a turbomachinery manufacturer based in valencia california paragon precision while the decision to acquire paragon precision aligned with favorable economic conditions including interest rates that have remained steadily low the strategic reasoning behind the purchase is worth understanding after talking to bevington we found that his arguments in favor of making the acquisition fell into three broad categories 1 having a west coast presence with its headquarters in mentor ohio and a second facility in tampa florida adding a third leg of operations in california has several benefits first the business of machining large castings necessarily involves moving heavy freight ken bevington iii president and owner of princeton tool an ohio based company that recently acquired paragon precision in california and as the number of u s based companies that produce large castings continues to shrink machine shops increasingly rely on imports that require shipping from a coastal port to as far away as halfway across the country the planning logistics and cost of this transport for a company located hundreds of miles inland is substantial a fact that undercut princeton tool s ability to provide its customers with low fixed costs for casting operations you re looking at two or three days if you don t want to overnight it bevington says and then obviously you re putting money into shipping cost that previously wasn t in the customer s plans these logistical challenges impeded princeton tool s ability to gain a foothold with customers on the west coast something that was already difficult for a company that wasn t a familiar name to potential customers hundreds of miles away but now that princeton tool has acquired paragon precision a company that offers 5 axis cnc machining and has deep experience producing turbomachinery parts the expanded company has the potential to increase its market share and keep costs lower for customers in or near the most populated state in the country 2 synergy paragon precision began as paragon tool die and engineering in 1946 and by the early 1950s had evolved into the production of rotating components for the aerospace industry including rotating assemblies for the titan rocket propulsion system in 1953 today the company specializes in the machining of blades blisks vanes rotors nozzles impellers and other parts associated with turbomachinery for the aerospace defense and commercial markets in other words the company would have been considered a competitor to princeton tool if the latter company was well known in the region this crossover in product lines means that the two companies can share not only technological capabilities but also operational knowledge about machining processes logistics and business operations on a less tangible level bevington says that a synergy existed between the cultures of the two companies as well he says that paragon places a premium on its employees many of whom have been with the company for more than 30 years i ve talked with people there who ve shared their stories about how they started working there when they were 17 years old and they ve never left bevington says they have loyalty you know you can go in there and you talk to these individuals and you can tell that they really care about what they do that was just something that really allowed us to take a step back and kind of realize that what they had was something special 3 risk mitigation the enhanced machining capacity that paragon precision brings to the table will do more than increase production for princeton tool bevington says it also offers technological redundancy capabilities that he says will put customers at ease each company boasts several dozen edm and cnc machining centers and with that equipment duplication comes an ability to shift production should there be future disruptions similar to what the current pandemic god forbid there is a natural disaster in our future but with our processes and capabilities at each location we could transfer jobs and continue to meet the customer s needs without putting a screeching halt to their program the shop floor of princeton tool which operates more than 160 edm machines and other cnc machines at its headquarters outside of cleveland ohio the right time to buy while these three categories speak broadly to the reasons why bevington decided to acquire paragon tool there was another motivation that has to do with the demographics of machine shop ownership in this country a category that skews heavily toward the baby boomer generation that is near or at retirement age bevington says that he and others at princeton tool had been thinking about expanding to the west coast for some time going so far as to meet with potential candidates as early as 2017 bevington says that none felt the right fit and then one day an employee for one of princeton tool s suppliers mentioned to bevington that he had heard that a machine shop in california was looking to sell the owner was ready to retire this source said and he would be happy to introduce him to bevington and his team so he made the introduction and really we just reached out and started going down that path bevington says we met and it became clear that we all wanted to roll with it from there in addition to the synergies that existed between the two companies bevington discovered untapped potential in paragon that made the acquisition even more enticing as the previous owner began looking for a buyer the motivation to invest in new equipment had naturally dropped this lack of recent capital investment in paragon may have been considered a shortcoming for the company under normal conditions but for bevington it presented a strategic opportunity paragon historically has been known to do a substantial amount of prototyping work bevington says the company has been known for making a great quality product but we want to get to production volumes we want to be able to grow this business and attract additional customers and go after production type of work the two areas of focus in the near term bevington says will be workholding and inspection he believes that new investments in equipment will make the work easier for existing employees and serve to increase product quality he expects these transitions to happen naturally as new equipment comes online a process he s eager to begin but only through methodical planning my father when he started the business organic growth was really his philosophy bevington says he was successful in doing that which allowed us to have this opportunity to look into acquisitions but looking at the pace of growth personally i would like to see princeton tool grow faster we want to reinvest in princeton tool and make us a stronger supplier not just as a west coast presence but on the east coast as well we want to grow our customer base and grow our business portfolio and strengthen our overall business stability over the next 25 years bevington says he is still taking in the lessons that he learned through the acquisition experience but one lesson he has learned already stands out patience when we started talking to paragon in october of 2019 we met with the team and had a really good feeling about it he says but still the progress from there seemed like inching forward the whole process of looking at the previous owner s idea of the value of the company and sort of squaring that with our idea of the value that was really the big learning curve for us getting to this perspective was worth the wait he says now looking at opportunities in the future means having a better understanding of that value understanding the negotiation side of the acquisition process that was really the big takeaway for us

mumbai hundreds of millions of indians over 250 million school students and hundreds of millions of workers and billions of people around the world are asking one question when will life become normal again post covid the answer is only a little clearer now than it was a year and a half ago but our understanding of the disease and what will effectively put it under control has definitely improved the larger questions are how long will covid 19 last in the way we know it today in india we ve gone through a brutal second wave cases have come down now across the country quite sharply except in kerala where cases are high but elsewhere life with masks and other restrictions has come back to some kind of normal if we were to look at history how does covid 19 compare with other diseases that we have seen in the past including something like smallpox also what is the combination of vaccine administration lifestyle changes and a cure whichever way it might come that can bring down the spread of this virus and take us back to life as we know it we speak with monica gandhi an infectious diseases specialist and a professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco she is also the director at the same institute s gladstone center for aids research gandhi has an md from the harvard medical school and a master s in public health from the university of california berkeley edited excerpts let me start with that very simple question what is the endgame looking like for covid 19 we have to look at history to understand what s happening with covid 19 and to look at the history of infectious diseases we have to also remember our definitions of infectious diseases there are four levels of what we call containment one is control which means that the virus has become endemic it doesn t cause undue burden of death or suffering or healthcare systems being overburdened but it s not gone that is actually the endgame and that is the hope for covid 19 and we are getting there in many places why can t we get to the other phases which we call the elimination where you take it away from a region eradication where it s gone for the whole world and extinction where you even destroy lab stocks the reason is it doesn t have those features that allow eradication those features means no animal reservoirs covid 19 has one those features means like smallpox it very clearly looks distinctive and not like other viruses that s not what covid 19 is it looks like a lot of respiratory infections the third feature is it has a short period of infectiousness like smallpox had that s not what covid 19 is and then the fourth feature is that you should be able to interrupt the chain of transmission unfortunately because people can still pass it on before they have symptoms with covid 19 it s going to be impossible to eradicate it you ve contrasted covid 19 in an article for the washington post with measles where you may see sudden outbreaks which may be quite big but do not mean that everyone else is going to be affected is that a fair comparison yes the best comparison is either with measles or even pertussis which is a bacterial infection that causes whooping cough and both of these infections over the world are in control you can absolutely see outbreaks those outbreaks are more among unvaccinated eligible people you may even see mild disease in people who have been vaccinated but you know how to treat it and we do have treatments for covid 19 so it doesn t mean it s gone worldwide measles and pertussis are not gone worldwide but they are at low levels and under control and that is what we re hoping for with covid 19 and you can see places that are getting it under control there are places that are wide open and they are saying that they are done with covid 19 that s denmark at 74 vaccination rate that s norway which opened over the weekend at 67 vaccination rate how are you seeing india at this point of time india is an interesting example of getting we are not there yet but getting to what we call control or endemicity endemic means low grade circulating virus that doesn t cause undue burden on the system why is india getting there very sadly it is actually what you just said there was a terrible second wave and there was a lot of death a lot of suffering that actually led to natural immunity in the population and at the same time india very quickly started vaccinating very strongly during their second wave so there was a lot of increase in vaccinations the population is becoming immune before vaccines remember that is the only way to get through a pandemic measles pertussis smallpox influenza a unfortunately before vaccination the only way to get through them was people getting naturally immune but in india there is natural immunity there is vaccination induced immunity and the cases are coming down and they are lower except in kerala like you just said would it be correct to say that like measles you could see an outbreak let s say 12 or 18 months later and that would be as deadly or as virulent as it is today except that it may happen in small pockets so in essence we cannot forget what this disease was like and the harm it could do yes this disease can do great harm the thing about measles is it can also do great harm measles was first identified in the ninth century and we actually didn t get a vaccination for measles until 1963 so remember the way that measles was controlled prior to mass vaccination is that people would be born they would be non immune to measles they d unfortunately have to get measles to become immune and that immunity was lifelong in fact we actually don t vaccinate people who are born before 1963 because we assume they ve had measles covid 19 is more deadly but we also have better treatments than we ve ever had for measles we actually have true treatments now monoclonal antibodies remdesivir steroids there s an antiviral coming out named molnupiravir that we have great hope for the results are going to be released this week so hopefully we ll be able to treat more mild cases and the question of lifelong immunity is still a debate but there are good features of immunologic research that show long t cells and long b cells that we hope will get lifelong immunity to covid 19 so there s a lot of hope that it can become like measles and if you think about measles you don t actually think about measles very much in the general population as an infectious disease doctor i think about it but it is gone from the public view that it is actually still a problem it s not gone it s called under control and that s the hope for covid you talked about t cells could you walk us through what that means and also in the larger context of vaccine efficacy as we know it at this point to put it very simply there are two arms of the immune system there are b cells and there are t cells the b cells are the ones that produce antibodies but those antibodies are going to come down with time totally natural not a glitch of the immune system you can t keep all those antibodies in your bloodstream your blood would be too thick so they re going to go down with time but memory b cells are blueprints to make more antibodies if they see the virus again t cells which are very long lasting not only aid b cells making more antibodies but prevent severe disease what we have seen from immunologic research with these vaccines also with natural infection is that t cells look like they re durable and they have what s called the very long half life meaning they don t look like they re coming down even when people were infected now we have 20 months of data and we know that t cell immunity is durable people who had their measles vaccines 40 years ago still have strong t cell immunity people who had sars in 2002 03 but recovered still have strong t cell immunity 17 years later if this protects us from severe disease and t cell immunity is long lasting the hope is we will get long lasting protection from the vaccinations or from natural infection for a very long time therefore where do you stand on the booster debate in the united states i did actually stand on the fact that i think older people immunocompromised people should get a third shot why because those are always the populations that we are not sure form the strong b cell and t cell immunity and those are the two arms of the immune system that you need high to get long lasting immunity so i approve the immunocompromised those over 65 however giving widely third booster shots to everyone the data do not indicate that here in the united states i would definitely talk to your doctor before you decide on a third shot if you are younger and healthier i really just would have that conversation and i would approve it for over 65 which is what i m recommending to my patients tell us about the evolution of covid 19 what could we see happening to this virus as time passes is it going to become stronger or weaker or is it going to be exactly as it was to again use the measles example and what can we learn from history or from other infectious diseases in this context the only thing we can look to is history one thing to remember about measles and pertussis and all of these infections is that they have never evolved to become more virulent in fact let s just remember that every pandemic except for hiv malaria tuberculosis where we don t have an effective vaccine and hiv of course affects the immune system every one of these virus pandemics have ended because of immunity they haven t kept on going and becoming more and more virulent and importantly we have never changed the measles vaccine we had the same vaccine in 1963 that we use in 2021 so why do viruses not evolve to become more virulent and keep on going and going because when a virus evolves and this is sort of evolutionary biology it usually takes a hit in some other function if it wants to gain function in one way so what is the delta variant for example the delta variant has gained the ability to be very transmissible it transmits very readily it s very quick to go from person to person but it hasn t clearly shown that that made it vaccine evasive or in some way more deadly we just had a lot more cases because delta is so transmissible this is true of hiv itself it can evolve to evade the hiv drugs that we use but it takes a hit to do so it becomes less fit so history will tell us we have never seen a virus that keeps on going and going remember measles was identified in the ninth century we don t see worse and worse measles now that s encouraging to note could you throw some light on hiv and if can we draw inspiration from where hiv is or isn t today hiv which was first described in 1981 but probably entered human populations around the turn of the 20th century has not evolved in any way to become more virulent in fact once we got good hiv medications which by the way the best ones were formed in 1996 and they ve just gotten better from there the virus actually becomes less fit if it actually evolves to evade the antivirals though hiv is still clearly a problem we don t have a vaccine against hiv it is controllable why is it controllable because we have antiviral medications that shut down viral replication and it keeps it a chronic lifelong disease so when we think about covid 19 in the 21st century we are developing treatments that hopefully are going to be targeted just against covid 19 for example mulnupiravir is this antiviral the phase 3 data will be presented just this wednesday at id week if mulnupiravir looks good you can imagine a world in which someone comes in they have a moderate respiratory infection they get swabbed it s influenza they get tamiflu and also tamivir and it s covid 19 and they have moderate disease they get mulnupiravir and they go home and if they have mild infection because that s what covid 19 should do bring down severe disease to a very mild infection then they go home they have a cold so this is the dream and the hope for what the vaccines have done for covid if you were to now look around the world how is the fact that we are still vaccinated and better controlled in some parts and not in other parts of the world likely to affect the transition or the trajectory of this virus as you see it particularly in the next year or so when i look around the world there are places that have a 2 2 vaccination rate in sub saharan africa for example only 2 of low income nations have gotten our vaccine supply so it really is tragic in terms of global vaccine equity but there is a combination in other places like india of natural immunity and vaccination induced immunity and then places like denmark and norway have more vaccine induced immunity because they have high levels of access and uptake of vaccines at all levels it s getting to the same point it s immunity to the virus and you want immunity of course through safe ways like vaccination but ultimately they ll all get to the same place which is endemicity low levels of virus that we can manage it s under control and we can live with it what are you working on specifically right now inasmuch as your understanding of where you see this disease going in the coming months maybe or a year and also what are your points of optimism and concern when i look at history as an infectious disease scholar the optimism is it will end it will not end exactly the way we want it it won t be eradicated from the face of the earth but it will end it will be controllable and we will go back to normal life i really do believe that and again about four countries in this world are completely wide open and going back to normal life with high rates of immunity so it does happen this will happen however i think what happened in this pandemic we have to learn about what we did as a world that we have had vaccines since december 2020 india for example appealed to the world trade organization in october 2020 asking for vaccine access for waiving of patents and they were denied and in march of 2021 this terrible second wave happened in india i think if we do not learn through this pandemic that we are one world and we have to give vaccines out to the whole world we could have this happen again so that s what i m working on and interested in and then fundamentally even with mild disease it s important to remember that we will have antivirals to work against mild disease and i m also interested in that we

california gov gavin newsom signed 27 new housing bills into law on sept 28 marking a total of 31 housing bills recently signed that are intended to cut the red tape in building new housing however critics say the bills will lead to high housing costs for home buyers former mayor of costa mesa jim righeimer said the bills goals of making accessory dwelling units adus easier to build may lower the cost of rent but will raise the cost of home prices making homeownership unaffordable this is the beginning of the end for suburbia righeimer told the epoch times you ll end up with less homeowners and more renters the governor is presenting the bills as part of the california comeback plan which will invest 22 billion in housing and homelessness leading to the creation of over 84 000 new housing units to help lead californians away from homelessness the plan will also fund a 100 million grant program for low to moderate income homeowners to build adus on their properties a type of secondary housing unit on a property that will increase density the acute affordability crisis we are experiencing in california was decades in the making and now we re taking the necessary steps to fix it newsom said in a statement after signing the bills at an affordable housing development in oakland this package of smart bipartisan legislation boosts housing production in california more streamlining more local accountability more affordability more density these bills plus this year s historic budget investments in affordable housing will directly lead to more inclusive neighborhoods across the state creating denser housing near jobs parks and schools is key to meeting our climate goals as well as our affordability goals the california comeback plan includes a 10 3 billion budget investment for affordable housing that will create more than 40 000 new affordable homes for low income residents part of this includes 850 million for incentivizing infill development and smart growth 800 million to preserve the state s affordable housing stock and 100 million to promote affordable homeownership as well as significant funding to scale up state efforts to increase accessory dwelling units newsom announced the launch of a 100 million grant program for low to moderate income homeowners to help build adus on their property where homeowners can receive as much as 25 000 in assistance this legislation is expected to help build 4 000 adus the process will help the regional housing needs allocation rhna cycle which requires every city and county in california to plan and zone for new housing creating a problem for some cities in finding where to place and how to build the housing in combination local governments will need to zone land for more than 2 5 million units statewide more than double the obligation under the previous rhna cycle according to the governor s office the new bills signed sept 28 will help cities to meet those goals also announced by newsom on sept 28 is the launch of california s new housing accountability unit hau which will ensure that local leaders are fulfilling rhna allocations the hau will work with local governments to help provide technical assistance to comply with the legislation it is absolutely imperative to meet these housing goals if we are serious about building an equitable future newsom said and it is similarly imperative to meet these housing targets because unaffordable housing leads to hours long car commutes directly inhibiting our efforts to meet our climate goals creating denser housing closer to major employment hubs is critical to limiting california s greenhouse gas emissions the bills signed by newsom on sept 28 include ab 68 by assemblymember sharon quirk silva d fullerton department of housing

the federal fiscal year ends this week and once again congress is scrambling to get its act together and as the prospect of government shutdown looms so does the wilder prospect of the government running out of cash and defaulting on its debt as always political differences and partisan wars make the money process difficult but two key elements of procedure also feature in the showdown raising the stakes and defining the battlefield one is the debt limit the other are the senate rules that allow the minority party to stop legislation cold the two are intertwined at this moment because the debt limit suspended three times during the trump administration has passed its latest suspension date the treasury department has for weeks been using extraordinary measures to cover the checks it writes and also honor bonds that come due without a green light from congress to borrow more money the treasury will be unable to continue this stopgap accounting next month that means checks you might be expecting from the government would bounce and the u s would be in default on its obligations for the first time in its history the financial consequences both short term and long could be severe and getting that done in the usual fashion has been thrown into question with republican threats to filibuster the debt limit suspension democrats are seeking in the senate curiously both these potentially crucial elements became ensconced in congressional practice in a single year a century ago a year that changed the country in many ways cloture s origin story in 1917 the country was confronting momentous issues of war conscription prohibition and votes for women all at once but the premier preoccupation was with war the year began with germany escalating to unrestricted submarine warfare against u s shipping to great britain congress moved to arm merchant ships against these attacks but the bill died in the senate after a filibuster by a dozen senators who saw it as a backdoor u s entry into the war they blocked a vote in the waning days of a congressional session and the bill died when the session ended at the time there was no procedure for cutting off such an extended debate which had been a senator s right since the early 1800s the weapon existed but was rarely used reserved for paramount issues such as creating a national bank or limiting slavery arming the merchant ships seemed to be just such an issue to the filibustering group whom president woodrow wilson immediately condemned as a little band of willful men wilson called a special session and a manifesto supporting his bill and denouncing the anti war senators was signed by 75 senators on top of that the senate adopted a rule that established cloture for the first time allowing a supermajority to cut off debate and force a vote the rule was adopted after six hours of debate by a vote of 76 to 3 war fever brought more change that lopsided vote expressed the war fever gripping much of the country in march 1917 most americans had been opposed to involvement in the war that convulsed europe beginning in 1914 wilson had campaigned in 1916 on the slogan he kept us out of war now wilson was not only for arming merchant vessels he also was moving toward an outright declaration of war one big reason was a telegram that had been disclosed purporting to reveal a german plot to get mexico to make war on the united states the reward for mexico was supposed to have been the return of the territory that had become texas new mexico and arizona this so called zimmermann telegram did not transform american attitudes as violently as the japanese attack on pearl harbor would in 1941 and the terror attacks of sept 11 would again in 2001 but it moved the country and it moved the congress ap ap president woodrow wilson delivers a speech to a joint session of congress in april 1917 requesting a declaration of war against germany wilson got his declaration of war in april 1917 congress began considering a draft to bulk up the peacetime army and a 4 billion appropriation to bolster all the armed services as quickly as possible congress passed the war revenue act raising income and corporation taxes a new tax on inheritances and an excess profits tax and higher taxes on tobacco and a host of amusements and other luxury items but tax money comes in gradually and much more money was needed right away in the month congress declared war it also passed the first liberty bond act to provide the initial billions in financing in september it passed a second such act this time including a limit on the overall indebtedness of the u s at 15 billion the idea was to make the debt more palatable by keeping a lid on it at least theoretically congress added the debt limit by statute it is not a constitutional amendment that means it could be altered or done away with at any time by the passage of another statute and indeed that original limit would have to be raised in the course of the war which eventually involved more than 20 billion in five bond issues before and after the fighting ended this can also be seen as a nod to fiscal conservatives at the time and to those elements of the nation s population either opposed to the war or ambivalent at best americans with german backgrounds were distressed and in many cases persecuted and many americans with irish heritage were incensed by great britain s suppression of ireland s bid for independence in the easter rising of 1916 the debt limit has often been circumvented but never abolished the debt limit language also acted to ease the process of issuing new debt which had previously been done through short term instruments that were neither efficient nor sufficient for the fiscal task of a modern war as longtime congress scholars thomas e mann and norman j ornstein wrote in 2012 the drive to enable congress to issue longer term debt instruments even for specific appropriations both lowered interest costs and made the borrowing easier for the treasury department mann and ornstein noted that the limit had long since become vestigial especially after congress consolidated federal borrowing in the late 1930s anticipating the arrival of world war ii for most of the 20th century congress simply raised the debt limit to whatever was needed to accommodate the budgets already enacted from 1979 to 1994 this was accomplished in the adoption of the annual budget resolution it should surprise no one that the limit has been raised or suspended nearly 100 times since its creation more than 80 times between 1960 and 2017 and three times during the presidency of donald trump with republicans in control of the senate u s debt grew by 7 trillion in the trump years there have been problems from time to time particularly when democratic presidents sought to raise or suspend the limit when annual budget deficits were rising republicans in the house dug in on this battleground in 2011 under president barack obama insisting he make deep cuts in federal spending a deal was negotiated but the specter of default haunted washington for some while thereafter defaulting on these obligations would raise the cost of borrowing for the government severely impact the u s economy and likely create upheaval in the world s financial markets wrote richard a arenberg in his textbook titled congressional procedure adding that the near miss in 2011 led to a downgrade in the nation s credit rating by standard poor s which derided political brinksmanship as the debt limit is statutory it could be eliminated just the way it has so often been raised or suspended but such a vote has not happened perhaps because politically speaking it has seemed even riskier than voting to raise or suspend it cloture has also become a fixture and has shaped senate behavior the threshold for cloture was initially set at two thirds the same required for a constitutional amendment it was not as insuperable a barrier in that era as it would later become as there was considerable crossover between the parties on certain issues in that same year for example the senate would muster two thirds for the 18th amendment prohibition and come within one vote of doing the same for women s suffrage votes for women the 19th amendment got through in 1919 in later generations especially after world war ii the filibuster became closely associated with opposition to civil rights bills southern democrats used it against anti lynching laws and repeated attempts to break down segregation it took the postwar civil rights movement and decades of effort to get two thirds for the civil rights act in 1964 the following year the voting rights act was passed without a filibuster and 10 years later the senate lowered the cloture requirement to three fifths the requirement is still three fifths or 60 votes in our time but lowering the requirement only made the filibuster tactic seem less extreme allowing filibusters to be virtual with no all night floor sessions needed made it all the more attractive a standard tool in a senator s toolbox so while a typical two year congress once had a handful of filibusters that required cloture votes the majority leader now files cloture petitions on literally scores of measures every year that is why it takes 60 votes in the senate has become a litany and bringing over 10 members of the other party across the aisle on something important to their leadership is regarded as all but impossible copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

while maine and the world have been focused on the pandemic a fight over the future of maine s second largest river system is raging inside the electronic docket of an obscure federal relicensing proceeding at stake in the drawn out proceedings before the federal energy regulatory commission relating to whether and under what terms to relicense a 106 year old dam that stretches across the river between benton and fairfield are the fate of river run fish in the kennebec river watershed and quite possibly that of atlantic salmon in the united states ferc regulates dams which typically start with a 50 year license a dam s owner typically a company seeking to produce revenue via the generation of electricity then must apply for permission to renew its license for another 30 to 50 years a process the agency carries out in consultation with the states the public and other federal agencies which may ask for certain terms to be met by the dam owner this is a great opportunity to have meaningful restoration and millions of sea run fish in the lower kennebec says sean ledwin director of the sea run fisheries and habitat division at maine s department of marine resources which recommends removing the dam between benton and fairfield we don t generally recommend dam removals but if we don t get this right it s unlikely that we can recover atlantic salmon in the united states maine has been a nationwide leader in the restoration of river systems and the sea run fish that spawn in them with the removal of augusta s edwards dam on the lower kennebec in 1999 and the great works and veazie dams in the lower penobscot in 2012 and 2013 alewives shad blueback herring and salmon had access to thousands of miles of river habitat for the first time since the early 19th century the alewife run into the sebasticook a tributary of the kennebec made accessible by dam removals is now the largest in the united states with nearly 6 million fish and a favorite bald eagle dining site now attention has turned to the sandy river where salmon and shad would find prime habitat were it not for four canadian owned dams blocking their way hydro kennebec and lockwood in waterville the weston dam near skowhegan and the dam in between that s currently under review for ferc relicensing the shawmut project conservationists and gov janet mills administration want at least one of them removed but owner brookfield renewable argues that building or improving fish passages will do the trick while continuing to provide clean power advertisement the dams are medium size by maine standards shawmut is a 19 foot tall concrete dam with two powerhouses and extends 1 500 feet across the kennebec lockwood located at the ticonic falls in central waterville is 17 feet high and 875 feet long and was built in 1919 to generate power for the lockwood textile mill the negotiations have dragged on for years and are occurring at the same time as separate federal processes regarding the protection of endangered species the salmon in this case and water quality standards over which states have a lot of influence they ve been acrimonious at times as when an independent engineering study submitted to ferc by brookfield was found in november 2019 to have been pruned of sections that undermined the company s position and they re complicated by the fact that while the quality of fish passage at all four dams needs to be taken into consideration if the fish runs are to thrive only shawmut s license is currently up for its 30 to 50 year renewal you can t just look at shawmut in this context you have to look at lockwood and hydro kennebec below it and weston above it because if we don t get salmon into the sandy it s a problem because that s where all the habitat is says jeff reardon of trout unlimited the sport fish advocacy group because the kennebec is believed necessary for the salmon s long term survival in the united states he adds the fate of the fish is tied up in the fate of the dams brookfield renewable partners part of the 100 billion brookfield asset global venture capital empire based in toronto owns 38 dams across maine and has argued that fish runs can thrive by retrofitting not removing the dams brookfield renewable owns more than 5 300 renewable power generating stations in 17 countries the majority of them hydroelectric plants and makes most of its money selling power to utilities through accurate design and engineering and an estimated investment of 22 million we will put in place the proper facilities and implement the right procedures to ensure fish movement on the kennebec the company whose u s offices are in new york city said in a statement these facilities provide many benefits to the people of maine and these communities in terms of recreation flood protection climate resiliency cultural and historical significance 2 2 million in annual tax revenue family sustaining wages power generation and more spokesman andy davis said in an interview that the company had been methodically studying the best engineering solutions for the four dams which generate a total of 46 9 megawatts of power enough to supply 37 000 homes and representing about 3 percent of the state s renewable electricity these and other dams in maine have been there for decades and centuries and we are going to use science and engineering to make sure there are solutions for everyone and everything for people and for fish he said we ve done it in other places and we think there s a way to do it here advertisement but state officials and conservationists are skeptical that engineered solutions alone can do the trick and argue that shawmut which generates just 8 6 megawatts of power should be dismantled altogether and probably also lockwood which generates 6 6 megawatts removing the dams would increase the odds a fish will make it through the fish bypasses in the ones that remain they argue and improve environmental conditions in the stretches of the river that have served as impoundments for the dams it would be really unfortunate to have atlantic salmon recovery in the entire u s be precluded because we couldn t take a look at removing a few projects that have really minimal energy contributions to the state dmr s ledwin says some scientists also believe restoring fish runs could help rebuild inshore stocks of fish like cod and haddock that used to feed on them ted ames a fisherman turned researcher won a macarthur foundation genius fellowship in 2005 for his work highlighting the connection we need to have the gulf of maine rebuilding its food web we need to have rivers sending billions and billions of young fish out into the ocean for species like cod says landis hudson executive director of the conservation group maine rivers to my mind brookfield has not been a helpful partner in our long and painful efforts to improve the health of the kennebec and reconnect its broken habitat fragments the lockwood dam in waterville the first of the dams the fish encounter has a notoriously bad fish bypass that even when it attracts fish ends with them being loaded on a truck and driven farther upriver last year only 180 shad found their way into the bypass and 44 the year before which strikes retired sixth grade science teacher and recreational fisherman willie grenier as inadequate grenier who lives in waterville says he regularly fishes for shad below the lockwood dam in springtime often with a guest and that each person fishing from his boat invariably catches 30 or more of the migratory fish in a few hours if i stayed all day fishing i could catch 200 without a doubt he says after 30 i ve usually had enough advertisement hydro kennebec also in waterville just upriver from lockwood has a recently built 14 million fishway that presumably will allow the fish to pass though dmr in its filings to ferc notes that this remains unproven so long as lockwood blocks the way shawmut the next of the dams has what dmr describes as significant uncertainty regarding the ability to effectively pass fish at required standard brookfield emphasizes the importance of keeping maine s hydropower capacity intact to help it meet its ambitious climate change goals which include gov mills goal of becoming carbon neutral having net zero carbon emissions by 2045 but the natural resources council of maine which champions climate change action backs decommissioning of at least some of the dams these four dams only generate a small amount of power but are causing enormous harm to the kennebec and the endangered atlantic salmon that depend on a healthy river to survive says pete didisheim the group s advocacy director the benefits for the fish wildlife and communities along the kennebec would be historic if these structures were removed and the river could run free again the timeline for a final decision remains unclear though it may be some years yet ferc rejected brookfield s proposed final species protection plan for the dams on july 13 and on dec 2 set a deadline for a new plan for may 31 2022 brookfield for its part says it s committed to safe and effective fish passage at the dams it s studying how to improve the bypass at lockwood and intends to start construction on a new passage at shawmut do you want to make a smart investment or a quick investment asks spokesman davis the extensions we ve sought and were granted so we could get the right way to do this stuff send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
the federal fiscal year ends this week and once again congress is scrambling to get its act together and as the prospect of government shutdown looms so does the wilder prospect of the government running out of cash and defaulting on its debt as always political differences and partisan wars make the money process difficult but two key elements of procedure also feature in the showdown raising the stakes and defining the battlefield one is the debt limit the other are the senate rules that allow the minority party to stop legislation cold the two are intertwined at this moment because the debt limit suspended three times during the trump administration has passed its latest suspension date the treasury department has for weeks been using extraordinary measures to cover the checks it writes and also honor bonds that come due without a green light from congress to borrow more money the treasury will be unable to continue this stopgap accounting next month that means checks you might be expecting from the government would bounce and the u s would be in default on its obligations for the first time in its history the financial consequences both short term and long could be severe and getting that done in the usual fashion has been thrown into question with republican threats to filibuster the debt limit suspension democrats are seeking in the senate curiously both these potentially crucial elements became ensconced in congressional practice in a single year a century ago a year that changed the country in many ways cloture s origin story in 1917 the country was confronting momentous issues of war conscription prohibition and votes for women all at once but the premier preoccupation was with war the year began with germany escalating to unrestricted submarine warfare against u s shipping to great britain congress moved to arm merchant ships against these attacks but the bill died in the senate after a filibuster by a dozen senators who saw it as a backdoor u s entry into the war they blocked a vote in the waning days of a congressional session and the bill died when the session ended at the time there was no procedure for cutting off such an extended debate which had been a senator s right since the early 1800s the weapon existed but was rarely used reserved for paramount issues such as creating a national bank or limiting slavery arming the merchant ships seemed to be just such an issue to the filibustering group whom president woodrow wilson immediately condemned as a little band of willful men wilson called a special session and a manifesto supporting his bill and denouncing the anti war senators was signed by 75 senators on top of that the senate adopted a rule that established cloture for the first time allowing a supermajority to cut off debate and force a vote the rule was adopted after six hours of debate by a vote of 76 to 3 war fever brought more change that lopsided vote expressed the war fever gripping much of the country in march 1917 most americans had been opposed to involvement in the war that convulsed europe beginning in 1914 wilson had campaigned in 1916 on the slogan he kept us out of war now wilson was not only for arming merchant vessels he also was moving toward an outright declaration of war one big reason was a telegram that had been disclosed purporting to reveal a german plot to get mexico to make war on the united states the reward for mexico was supposed to have been the return of the territory that had become texas new mexico and arizona this so called zimmermann telegram did not transform american attitudes as violently as the japanese attack on pearl harbor would in 1941 and the terror attacks of sept 11 would again in 2001 but it moved the country and it moved the congress ap ap president woodrow wilson delivers a speech to a joint session of congress in april 1917 requesting a declaration of war against germany wilson got his declaration of war in april 1917 congress began considering a draft to bulk up the peacetime army and a 4 billion appropriation to bolster all the armed services as quickly as possible congress passed the war revenue act raising income and corporation taxes a new tax on inheritances and an excess profits tax and higher taxes on tobacco and a host of amusements and other luxury items but tax money comes in gradually and much more money was needed right away in the month congress declared war it also passed the first liberty bond act to provide the initial billions in financing in september it passed a second such act this time including a limit on the overall indebtedness of the u s at 15 billion the idea was to make the debt more palatable by keeping a lid on it at least theoretically congress added the debt limit by statute it is not a constitutional amendment that means it could be altered or done away with at any time by the passage of another statute and indeed that original limit would have to be raised in the course of the war which eventually involved more than 20 billion in five bond issues before and after the fighting ended this can also be seen as a nod to fiscal conservatives at the time and to those elements of the nation s population either opposed to the war or ambivalent at best americans with german backgrounds were distressed and in many cases persecuted and many americans with irish heritage were incensed by great britain s suppression of ireland s bid for independence in the easter rising of 1916 the debt limit has often been circumvented but never abolished the debt limit language also acted to ease the process of issuing new debt which had previously been done through short term instruments that were neither efficient nor sufficient for the fiscal task of a modern war as longtime congress scholars thomas e mann and norman j ornstein wrote in 2012 the drive to enable congress to issue longer term debt instruments even for specific appropriations both lowered interest costs and made the borrowing easier for the treasury department mann and ornstein noted that the limit had long since become vestigial especially after congress consolidated federal borrowing in the late 1930s anticipating the arrival of world war ii for most of the 20th century congress simply raised the debt limit to whatever was needed to accommodate the budgets already enacted from 1979 to 1994 this was accomplished in the adoption of the annual budget resolution it should surprise no one that the limit has been raised or suspended nearly 100 times since its creation more than 80 times between 1960 and 2017 and three times during the presidency of donald trump with republicans in control of the senate u s debt grew by 7 trillion in the trump years there have been problems from time to time particularly when democratic presidents sought to raise or suspend the limit when annual budget deficits were rising republicans in the house dug in on this battleground in 2011 under president barack obama insisting he make deep cuts in federal spending a deal was negotiated but the specter of default haunted washington for some while thereafter defaulting on these obligations would raise the cost of borrowing for the government severely impact the u s economy and likely create upheaval in the world s financial markets wrote richard a arenberg in his textbook titled congressional procedure adding that the near miss in 2011 led to a downgrade in the nation s credit rating by standard poor s which derided political brinksmanship as the debt limit is statutory it could be eliminated just the way it has so often been raised or suspended but such a vote has not happened perhaps because politically speaking it has seemed even riskier than voting to raise or suspend it cloture has also become a fixture and has shaped senate behavior the threshold for cloture was initially set at two thirds the same required for a constitutional amendment it was not as insuperable a barrier in that era as it would later become as there was considerable crossover between the parties on certain issues in that same year for example the senate would muster two thirds for the 18th amendment prohibition and come within one vote of doing the same for women s suffrage votes for women the 19th amendment got through in 1919 in later generations especially after world war ii the filibuster became closely associated with opposition to civil rights bills southern democrats used it against anti lynching laws and repeated attempts to break down segregation it took the postwar civil rights movement and decades of effort to get two thirds for the civil rights act in 1964 the following year the voting rights act was passed without a filibuster and 10 years later the senate lowered the cloture requirement to three fifths the requirement is still three fifths or 60 votes in our time but lowering the requirement only made the filibuster tactic seem less extreme allowing filibusters to be virtual with no all night floor sessions needed made it all the more attractive a standard tool in a senator s toolbox so while a typical two year congress once had a handful of filibusters that required cloture votes the majority leader now files cloture petitions on literally scores of measures every year that is why it takes 60 votes in the senate has become a litany and bringing over 10 members of the other party across the aisle on something important to their leadership is regarded as all but impossible copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

maybe they re pooping on passersby more often or possibly more people are reporting a theft of their lunch no matter the inciting incident some communities are convinced that more gulls have moved from the coasts and into their cities if these anecdotes are to be taken as fact gulls a group of 40 species that people tend to lump together and call seagulls could be your newest neighbors or commute partners a flock now occupies the roof of a train station in frankfurt germany says alejandro sotillo an ecologist at ghent university in belgium but what we think are soaring gull numbers could be an illusion hiding how the raucous birds are faring over all bird s eye view despite the more recent chatter some groups of the birds have lived deep inland for a long time a group of white headed gulls have lived in landlocked belarus since the early 2000s for example and a cohort of lesser black backed gulls thrive in the even more remote siberia sotillo says in north america the species that typically pull off the move are ring billed and herring gulls these smaller kinds of gulls are more likely to lose in fights for marine food sources when up against larger gulls like the great black backed variety potentially driving smaller species inland where food is easier to access says laurie maynard an ecologist at the university of moncton in canada communities might say that there s a new gull presence throughout town but so far there isn t good evidence showing that gulls are nesting farther inland than they used to or spending more time soaring over cities for food this is largely because tracking urban population fluctuations is extremely difficult getting above buildings to count bird nesting sites requires scaffolding or drones sotillo says the latter of which could violate rules about footage of residential buildings a safer nest and better lunch if it s true that more gulls are moving inland the pursuit of easy food might be a motivator in the 1970s and 80s the fishing industry threw away comparatively large portions of their catches the byproducts fostered a boom in gull populations as the birds feasted on relatively easy nutritious meals maynard says now that some of those fishing habits have changed and stocks have been over harvested almost to the point of collapse researchers think there are fewer aquatic meals to go around potentially pushing gulls to find food elsewhere it s possible that a shift toward new food sources and safer breeding grounds could be good for different species the birds pecking away at garbage can be shockingly good at zeroing in on the most fruitful parts of dumps and farm fields rodents provide calcium for their bones just like fish do maynard points out and some gulls may have realized that nesting on buildings keeps their offspring safe from predators sotillo adds but so far research into how the birds fare show mixed results in some studies diving into garbage seems to help breeding success while in others the birds do better when they stick to more traditional food sources sotillo and his colleagues conducted their own study where they kept tabs on wild gull chicks while hand feeding different birds in the lab with either an ocean based or land based diet while all birds fed by the researchers gained weight the wild birds being fed a land based diet by their parents didn t keep up sotillo concluded that maybe the adults simply couldn t find enough decent food when foraging over land is the city big enough for the two of us because it s so hard to determine whether more gulls are actually moving inland and how that choice might be panning out for different species it s also not clear what these shifts mean for the future of the birds gull numbers have been declining since the golden era of good seafood in the 1970s and 80s and no one knows how small a population of gulls can get while staying healthy and stable whatever numbers existed before humans started meddling with their survival sotillo says we just don t know gulls could make like pigeons and take to downtown life just fine but even in that scenario the birds are still threatened by what human residents think of them people in general don t like gulls in the city sotillo says they are finding a livelihood in a place where they are not welcome cities putting pressure on the birds to find yet another home might leave them with few places to go gulls used to nest along the belgian dunes sotillo says but communities developed much of the coastline and stripped the birds of their original habitat in the process the potential for humans to squeeze gulls out of any habitat is an issue for more than the birds it calls for reconsidering the way that we are exploiting space and what we expect wildlife to do in response sotillo says in other words our relationship with gulls is confrontational and not just in the way they steal our fries
by kris pastoriza of easton 127 countries have committed to becoming net zero by 2050 or some convenient date far enough in the future to obscure that we all are doing almost nothing now to reduce our energy use or co2 production indepth your inbox get unbiased nonprofit watchdog news sent directly to your inbox only bhutan and suriname have achieved net zero protected areas are at the core of bhutan s national carbon neutral strategy bhutan s constitution now demands that a minimum of 60 per cent of the country s total land area remains under forest cover for all time currently 81 per cent of bhutan is under forest cover and more than half the country is protected as national parks nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries all connected by a network of biological corridors 1 suriname has claimed a net negative carbon economy since at least 2014 this is in large part because dense forests cover over 93 of the country most of the rainforest is still in pristine condition however it is being threatened by gold mining and logging companies 2 suriname s population density is 4 people per km2 bhutan has 20 people per km2 and the u s has 36 people per km2 in bhutan the per capita yearly production of co2 in 2019 was 2 24 tons in suriname 4 48 tons in the u s 16 tons in the u s the federal government owns 30 of u s lands but only 18 of this land is protected as wilderness with only 3 protected as wilderness in the lower 48 states 30 wilderness is recommended as the minimum for ecological sustainability 3 to halt and reverse our destruction of the earth the international union for the conservation of nature the world s most influential conservation congress passed resolutions on 9 10 21 calling for 80 percent of the amazon and 30 percent of earth s surface land and sea to be designated protected areas recommendations by the international union for the conservation of nature have in the past served as the backbone for un treaties and conventions 4 ecologist edward o wilson in his 2016 book half earth stated that only by committing half of the planet s surface to nature can we hope to save the immensity of life forms that compose it while forests are not the only carbon sinks bhutan and suriname point to the necessity of low per capita energy consumption severely limited logging and grazing and the difficulty first world countries with little wilderness dense populations and high energy consumption have in reaching net zero without extreme radical reductions in population and consumption combined with protection of our forests rangelands and other natural carbon sinks like peatlands and soils net zero appears impossible to achieve few of us who have them are willing to live without what we consider our entitlements fossil fueled cheap food unlimited fossil fuel use and travel whatever we can afford to buy as many children as we want as much electricity oil and water as we can afford cheap disposal of trash and cheap goods large houses and medical care in an effort to glimpse the magnitude of the challenges we face in achieving net zero co2 production let s assume that individuals were living at net zero in the u s in the year 1800 at that time it is estimated that per capita co2 production in the u s was 04 metric tons per year by 2019 per capita co2 production had increased to 16 metric tons per year thus u s per capita production of co2 would have to be reduced to 1 400 of 2019 levels for the current u s co2 production to equal that of 1800 the u s population increased from an estimated 4 304 480 non indigenous people 600 000 indigenous people 893 041 enslaved afro americans and 108 395 free people of color in 1800 6m total population to 331 500 000 people in 2021 5 5a 5b to compensate for this increase in population the u s per capita production of co2 would have to be reduced to 1 55th of 2019 levels with our per capita co2 production 400 times larger and our population 55 times larger than they were in 1800 the average person in the u s would have to produce 1 22 000th of the c02 they produced in 2019 for the u s to reach net zero we would then have to reduce our co2 production again as retribution for our energy consumption over the past 100 years which has been grossly in excess of that consumed by the majority of the rest of the world world citizens would have to produce 1 932th of their present per capita co2 production to reach net zero the other greenhouse gasses nitrous oxide methane and halocarbons have not been included in these calculations we also must assume that the carbon sequestration capacity of the world has decreased since the 1800s because of deforestation loss of old growth forests degradation of soils the amazon becoming a net emitter the permafrost and glaciers melting and the capacity of the ocean to absorb carbon having been greatly reduced the majority of the forests that were sequestering carbon in 1800 have been lost or damaged it is estimated that earth s current total vegetation biomass is half of potential biomass stocks prior to human perturbation mainly through forest loss and there is very little old growth forest left the forest service says that less than 7 percent of u s forests are over 100 years old if left un cut northeast secondary forests have the potential to increase biological carbon sequestration between 2 3 and 4 2 fold 6 6a rangelands in the west have been severely degraded by government subsidized grazing for invasive species cows and sheep and the slaughter of native species especially apex predators these policies have caused extensive degradation of these ecosystems and decreased their capacity to sequester co2 6b carbon stored in soils has decreased 7 the ocean may be close to its capacity for absorbing carbon and this absorption has acidified it with damaging results to coral reefs 8 given the co2 already emitted and feedback loops we also have to ask if net zero is enough and whether a negative co2 balance is necessary to prevent runaway heating 8a plans for green energy electrifying everything and building back better will create large amounts of co2 and even if we electrify everything those things will wear out and most people primarily first world people and the rich will demand replacements cars tractors and other agricultural machinery stoves washers dryers water pumps hospitals medical equipment roads airplanes houses computers the grid batteries phones these plans are driven by the corporations that control our political institutions amoral and with a sole dedication to profit they are devoid of any reason to plan far enough ahead to prevent the demise of organized life as we know it fossil fuel corporations produced accurate predictions of the course of global warming 30 years ago their response was to spend millions convincing the public that the data was unclear and did not warrant action they did not spend those 30 years developing viable mechanical carbon capture technology that would get us to negative emissions these corporations are now lobbying for millions in government welfare to subsidize their work on this technology which will not get us to net zero by 2050 or avert the immediate need for radical reductions in consumption and radical increases in land protection when cultural collapse reaches a more critical state they will be ready to profit from disaster capitalism thus the current plan is to overshoot not meet our goals and then to make up for it later with mechanical carbon capture that will remove enough co2 from power plants and the atmosphere to create negative co2 emissions whether this is possible and what will happen in the meantime to most of humanity and the planet famine refugees floods pandemics violence feedback cycles fascism cults cultural and environmental collapse species extinction runaway warming is not of concern to those in power 9 without negative emissions emissions would have to basically drop off a cliff starting today 2018 10 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change or ipcc the emissions reduction pathway with the best chance of keeping warming at or below 1 5 c makes limited to no use of engineered carbon capture technologies this pathway involves a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels along with limited carbon removal by natural sources such as reforestation and enhanced soil carbon uptake the ipcc points to uncertainty in the future deployment of ccs and cautions against reliance on the technology given concerns about storage safety and cost and the non negligible risk of carbon dioxide leakage from geological storage and the carbon dioxide transport infrastructure 11 ccs carbon capture and storage a person in the u s who has no car doesn t fly lives off the electric grid

consumes the small amount of goods consistent with an income of less than 20 000 a year would produce approximately 3 tons of co2 a year this is clearly nowhere near the 00073 tons that is our yearly per capita co2 allotment given the complete failure of governments to enact the restrictions on our consumption that are necessary in order to avoid catastrophic warming it is no surprise that we are now headed toward 2 7 degrees warming 12 13 it is clear that our culture politicians and corporations cannot be counted on to acknowledge and respond rationally to the pre apocalyptic situation in

unidentified reporter 2 forty three products are on the list it includes bourbons champagne hennessy and patron chang purchase limits are also newly in place at costco soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 3 no more stocking up on toilet paper cleaning supplies and other items at costco chang and unlike the start of the pandemic it s not because people are panic buying soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 3 it s because of supply chain issues overseas chang many more companies are dealing with the same thing soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 4 supply chain delays unidentified reporter 5 and product shortages unidentified reporter 6 for all types of goods chang nike is warning of delays through next year home depot and ikea are literally chartering their own shipping vessels to move product faster and even though it s still september soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 7 tis the season for holiday panic global supply chain delays are threatening to disrupt shipments chang retail experts on network tv are already saying stuff like this about the holiday shopping season soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 8 there isn t a lot of inventory so if you the longer you wait the more of a premium you re going to pay on not just shipping but also the price of those items chang so yeah shipping delays are one big part of the problem right now another is labor domestically there have been shortages of truck drivers warehouse workers and dockworkers internationally covid spikes have hobbled factories in places like vietnam indonesia and malaysia this global shortage of labor is also not going away anytime soon i spoke to an economist at the university of michigan betsey stevenson she s a former member of president obama s white house council of economic advisers about why this labor shortage is going to continue for a while all right so betsey stevenson before we even talk about how jobs and the supply chain are connected can i just ask you have you even started your holiday shopping because i sure haven t betsey stevenson oh well i actually have been pushing my children to give me their lists for what they might want and i have chang laughter stevenson i have actually already bought a few things for the holidays chang wow look at you ok so you re totally on top of it stevenson i m very worried you know my kids notoriously tell me on like december 15 what they want for the holidays and then i m like in a mad scramble and i ve told them this year that they will get donations to charity only laughter stevenson and i was like and you will love them they will be great donations to charity for you this year chang laughter stevenson but if you actually want a present for yourself let me start thinking about what you want now chang that is very impressive but i just want to ask you why are we even at this point like you know we all remember how hard it was to get clorox wipes masks toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic but it s been more than 18 months the supply chain is still out of whack why are we even talking about starting holiday shopping now in what september as soon as pumpkin spice hits the shelves what is going on with the supply chain stevenson well you know i love that you started with last year s problems because i think you want to think about there being three issues with the supply chain one can be that we re changing what we consume last year we all discovered a brand new love of hand sanitizer and clorox wipes and they just couldn t keep up with that newfound demand that quickly chang yeah stevenson but you know they ve learned and there s a lot of new companies making hand sanitizer same thing with masks you know we all discovered a brand new love of masks and they had to companies had to change what they were producing in order to meet all these shifts in demand that occurred because our preferences have changed in order to fight covid the way we re living our lives what we want is different the second reason it s what economists might call a bank run right you fear that everybody else is going to go ahead and take their money out of the bank what we saw last year was a toilet paper run you feared that everybody else was going to buy toilet paper and there d be none left for you chang so you would stock up stevenson yeah your best response to your fear about what everybody else is going to do is going to be to go out there and buy toilet paper so when you think that other people are stocking up your best response is to stock up even if you don t believe that there s any actual real problems out there and so we see stores now that are like hey we ve been burned by this before and you know costco s already got the one toilet paper per person please sign up and that s just because they don t want these toilet paper runs which kind of create artificial problems because they re really just about people panicking now the third thing a lot of companies just can t run things the way they were being run prior to covid and it s important for us to realize that covid s affecting the entire world and most of what we want in life involves people doing something so there are entire factories shut down because too many people in the factory have covid for it to be able to operate there are people getting sick and dying and getting sick and dying is making it hard for them to produce the stuff they were producing before i think we get so focused on what covid means for us and the united states that we forget that there are people all over the globe who are sick and dying right now and because they re sick and dying they re not making computer chips or they re not making cars or they re not making clothes chang all right so yes deaths from covid are certainly a factor but this global shortage of labor there are other factors that have contributed to that right stevenson one thing to think about with covid and where are the workers and i think countries around the world are struggling with this is there s been also a reduction in movement of people so we don t have immigrants coming in doing some of the jobs that they used to do before in our country in other countries we don t we just don t have people traveling to where they might be able to make a great contribution but it s not obviously just immigration we re also seeing that job the characteristics of jobs have changed and those characteristics have maybe made the job more dangerous less pleasant that means people might not want to do that job anymore or they might be demanding higher pay in order to do that job and so we have a lot of reallocation going on in the labor market so people want to hire but people also want to change jobs quits are at an all time high right now people are quitting jobs chang yeah stevenson and job openings are also at an all time high chang yeah stevenson the great thing about there being so many openings out there is that means there s lots of opportunities for you as a worker so if your job got worse if there s more of a risk that you get sick if people are being ruder to you because you have to ask them to put on a mask in your store well you might just be looking for something else to do and we re seeing a lot of workers changing industries we re seeing a lot of them changing occupations they re looking for better opportunities and they re holding out for better wages and they can afford to hold out for better wages because there are so many opportunities out there but that holding on for what you want that s creating a slowdown of workers being allocated to new jobs chang walk me through how this simultaneous lack of a continuing supply of workers and the disruption to the global supply chain how those two things are connected stevenson well one issue is that we don t need workers in some places right now because we re not getting the goods in from abroad workers themselves are part of the supply chain and so they can be creating their own disruption maybe can t find enough workers to complete the job but maybe you re a construction site and you ve got the workers to lay the bricks but you don t have the bricks so you don t want to be hiring more workers because you can t even keep the ones that you have busy because you re not getting the supplies in and that s going to slow down your desire to hire because even though you got plenty of people wanting you to build for them you don t have the materials so you don t actually need the workers at the same time we have record job openings and record quits so there s just a lot of turmoil in the labor market right now and turmoil in the product market and i think that it s also the case that customers are changing what they want to buy and they re still trying to figure some of that out chang so let me ask you there s a lot of churn in the job market as we were talking about as people are rethinking all of their options employers are dealing with instability because of covid what do you think what is it going to take for people to get back to work stevenson i think partially we don t know what the new normal is going to be we do have to decide how it is that we want to live and that may mean some people work less that may mean some people retire earlier than they would have without the pandemic and they re not going to unretire but maybe the other people are just in the process of changing jobs we re going to come out of this perhaps more productive with people in better jobs with higher job satisfaction chang well how long do you think it will take for all the things you just described to settle and for people to start working stevenson really no one can answer the question of how long it s going to take because we don t know the path of covid yet but i think we ll have come to a place where we have ongoing economic growth where our labor force participation rate has recovered and we have you know a lot millions of more people in the labor force than we have today but there is another path that s a path where we don t make a lot more progress with the vaccination rate because we don t make a lot more progress with the vaccination rate a more deadly variant of covid erupts that causes us to have you know more slowdowns if not shutdowns but slowdowns and we definitely saw the economy slow down with the delta variant and if we continue to have those slowdowns then i think we ve what we ve learned is a pandemic that changes what we do for a year for 18 months ultimately changes what we want so not only can i not tell you what the path looks like but i don t even know what the end point is if we re on a path with a new more deadly variant of covid on the horizon chang i don t even want to imagine that darker path betsey stevenson is a professor at the university of michigan and former member of president obama s white house council of economic advisers thank you very much for joining us today stevenson it was a pleasure talking with you soundbite of aeroc s blue eyed bitter transcript provided by npr

menafn baystreet ca false positives scare highlights need for changes to covid 19 testing processes vancouver usa news group a round of false positive test results caused a stir on the popular tv show the view recently and highlighted flaws in current covid 19 testing protocols in the aftermath of us president joe biden s pushing of mandatory vaccination testing in the workplace more problems have arisen such as expensive testing costs and rampant supply shortages false positives such as those from the two hosts of the view can be quite costly and are becoming increasingly likely with false positive rates as high as 16 7 the market is being tasked with addressing this issues with a variety of innovative diagnostic options coming from developers and producers such as biovaxys technology corp cse biov otcqb bvaxf becton dickinson and company nyse bdx qiagen n v nyse qgen abbott laboratories nyse abt and quest diagnostics incorporated nyse dgx a promising new test from biovaxys technology corp cse biov otcqb bvaxf is currently being tested touted as the world s first low cost disposable diagnostic to identify a t cell immune response to the presence of sars cov 2 data from the use of this form of testing suggests it may even be more accurate than current methods the test called covidth screens for a t cell mediated immune response to sars cov 2 instead of just for fragments of the virus itself it s based on delayed type hypersensitivity dth technology and is currently being developed with the assistance of large corporations including 63 billion chinese biomanufacturing partners wuxi biologics and contract research services provider inotiv inc which has a market capitalization of 795 million in its july 2021 written response to biovaxys on the company s request for a pre ind type b review of covidth as a diagnostic for evaluating t cell immune response to sars cov 2 the us fda indicated that animal toxicity studies for covidth were not required and that the company could start its clinical development program with a combined phase i ii study despite animal testing being discretionary biovaxys announced its started its planned in vivo animal toxicology study of covidth in parallel with the preparation of an ind submission assisting with the process is inotiv inc who is evaluating the safety tolerability and toxicity of the purified recombinant sars cov 2 s protein provided by wuxi biologics that is a principal constituent of covidth in an intradermal research models based on the millions of people who have received covid 19 vaccines that are based on in vivo cellular expression of sars cov 2 s spike protein as well as the human dth studies we are confident that the toxicology study with inotiv of the s protein will likewise confirm the safety profile of covidth said biovaxys president and chief operating officer ken kovan using a personal smartphone to conduct covid 19 testing is on its way as the fda granted an emergency use application eua to becton dickinson and company nyse bdx or bd for its bd veritortm at home covid 19 test the first at home covid 19 rapid antigen test to use computer vision technology in a smartphone to interpret and provide digital display of testing results the rise in covid 19 cases from the delta variant has increased the demand for at home testing and the bd veritor

capitalize and launch more products to detect everyday infections so far qiagen s net profit of 250m in the first six months of 2021 has been almost double that of the same period in 2020 when covid 19 testing was still limited completely changed the paradigm for a company like ours thierry bernard chief executive told the financial times the shift exploded the value of qiagen which saw multibillion takeover attempts from majors in the industry last year similar demand growth has been witnessed by abbott laboratories nyse abt especially for its binaxnow tests which spokesperson for the company john koval claims are seeing unprecedented demand today there are tens of millions of binaxnow tests in various settings and supply chains koval said in an email we re working with our customers to ensure tests get to where they re most needed and we re ramping back up as we did last year there will be some supply constraints over the coming weeks as increased capacity comes online perhaps even bigger new for abbott was the report from reuters that the us government is set to purchase more than half a billion dollars worth of rapid coronavirus tests for point of care situations such as nursing homes and other high risk populations after initiating a dull 2021 outlook back in july quest diagnostics incorporated nyse dgx updated its outlook based on surging demand for covid 19 tests earlier in september the company significantly raised its full year projection there is simply nowhere near enough supply of poc or otc tests pcr tests could be used for regular screening but come with logistical and cost hurdles today to meet the demand of the u s government 280 million tests employers likely millions of tests per week schools traditional healthcare settings and retail demand the company wrote in the update as per the increase the update included a prediction of full year net revenues ranging 9 84 10 09 billion indicating a 4 3 6 9 improvement from 2020 much of this comes from a new assumption of average volumes of at least 40 000 molecular tests daily for the second half of the year doubling upon the previous guidance of 20 000 according to a new global diagnostic enzyme market report the market is expected to grow from 3 23 billion in 2020 to 3 53 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 9 3 this market is now expected to reach 4 44

the federal fiscal year ends this week and once again congress is scrambling to get its act together and as the prospect of government shutdown looms so does the wilder prospect of the government running out of cash and defaulting on its debt as always political differences and partisan wars make the money process difficult but two key elements of procedure also feature in the showdown raising the stakes and defining the battlefield one is the debt limit the other are the senate rules that allow the minority party to stop legislation cold the two are intertwined at this moment because the debt limit suspended three times during the trump administration has passed its latest suspension date the treasury department has for weeks been using extraordinary measures to cover the checks it writes and also honor bonds that come due without a green light from congress to borrow more money the treasury will be unable to continue this stopgap accounting next month that means checks you might be expecting from the government would bounce and the u s would be in default on its obligations for the first time in its history the financial consequences both short term and long could be severe and getting that done in the usual fashion has been thrown into question with republican threats to filibuster the debt limit suspension democrats are seeking in the senate curiously both these potentially crucial elements became ensconced in congressional practice in a single year a century ago a year that changed the country in many ways cloture s origin story in 1917 the country was confronting momentous issues of war conscription prohibition and votes for women all at once but the premier preoccupation was with war the year began with germany escalating to unrestricted submarine warfare against u s shipping to great britain congress moved to arm merchant ships against these attacks but the bill died in the senate after a filibuster by a dozen senators who saw it as a backdoor u s entry into the war they blocked a vote in the waning days of a congressional session and the bill died when the session ended at the time there was no procedure for cutting off such an extended debate which had been a senator s right since the early 1800s the weapon existed but was rarely used reserved for paramount issues such as creating a national bank or limiting slavery arming the merchant ships seemed to be just such an issue to the filibustering group whom president woodrow wilson immediately condemned as a little band of willful men wilson called a special session and a manifesto supporting his bill and denouncing the anti war senators was signed by 75 senators on top of that the senate adopted a rule that established cloture for the first time allowing a supermajority to cut off debate and force a vote the rule was adopted after six hours of debate by a vote of 76 to 3 war fever brought more change that lopsided vote expressed the war fever gripping much of the country in march 1917 most americans had been opposed to involvement in the war that convulsed europe beginning in 1914 wilson had campaigned in 1916 on the slogan he kept us out of war now wilson was not only for arming merchant vessels he also was moving toward an outright declaration of war one big reason was a telegram that had been disclosed purporting to reveal a german plot to get mexico to make war on the united states the reward for mexico was supposed to have been the return of the territory that had become texas new mexico and arizona this so called zimmermann telegram did not transform american attitudes as violently as the japanese attack on pearl harbor would in 1941 and the terror attacks of sept 11 would again in 2001 but it moved the country and it moved the congress ap ap president woodrow wilson delivers a speech to a joint session of congress in april 1917 requesting a declaration of war against germany wilson got his declaration of war in april 1917 congress began considering a draft to bulk up the peacetime army and a 4 billion appropriation to bolster all the armed services as quickly as possible congress passed the war revenue act raising income and corporation taxes a new tax on inheritances and an excess profits tax and higher taxes on tobacco and a host of amusements and other luxury items but tax money comes in gradually and much more money was needed right away in the month congress declared war it also passed the first liberty bond act to provide the initial billions in financing in september it passed a second such act this time including a limit on the overall indebtedness of the u s at 15 billion the idea was to make the debt more palatable by keeping a lid on it at least theoretically congress added the debt limit by statute it is not a constitutional amendment that means it could be altered or done away with at any time by the passage of another statute and indeed that original limit would have to be raised in the course of the war which eventually involved more than 20 billion in five bond issues before and after the fighting ended this can also be seen as a nod to fiscal conservatives at the time and to those elements of the nation s population either opposed to the war or ambivalent at best americans with german backgrounds were distressed and in many cases persecuted and many americans with irish heritage were incensed by great britain s suppression of ireland s bid for independence in the easter rising of 1916 the debt limit has often been circumvented but never abolished the debt limit language also acted to ease the process of issuing new debt which had previously been done through short term instruments that were neither efficient nor sufficient for the fiscal task of a modern war as longtime congress scholars thomas e mann and norman j ornstein wrote in 2012 the drive to enable congress to issue longer term debt instruments even for specific appropriations both lowered interest costs and made the borrowing easier for the treasury department mann and ornstein noted that the limit had long since become vestigial especially after congress consolidated federal borrowing in the late 1930s anticipating the arrival of world war ii for most of the 20th century congress simply raised the debt limit to whatever was needed to accommodate the budgets already enacted from 1979 to 1994 this was accomplished in the adoption of the annual budget resolution it should surprise no one that the limit has been raised or suspended nearly 100 times since its creation more than 80 times between 1960 and 2017 and three times during the presidency of donald trump with republicans in control of the senate u s debt grew by 7 trillion in the trump years there have been problems from time to time particularly when democratic presidents sought to raise or suspend the limit when annual budget deficits were rising republicans in the house dug in on this battleground in 2011 under president barack obama insisting he make deep cuts in federal spending a deal was negotiated but the specter of default haunted washington for some while thereafter defaulting on these obligations would raise the cost of borrowing for the government severely impact the u s economy and likely create upheaval in the world s financial markets wrote richard a arenberg in his textbook titled congressional procedure adding that the near miss in 2011 led to a downgrade in the nation s credit rating by standard poor s which derided political brinksmanship as the debt limit is statutory it could be eliminated just the way it has so often been raised or suspended but such a vote has not happened perhaps because politically speaking it has seemed even riskier than voting to raise or suspend it cloture has also become a fixture and has shaped senate behavior the threshold for cloture was initially set at two thirds the same required for a constitutional amendment it was not as insuperable a barrier in that era as it would later become as there was considerable crossover between the parties on certain issues in that same year for example the senate would muster two thirds for the 18th amendment prohibition and come within one vote of doing the same for women s suffrage votes for women the 19th amendment got through in 1919 in later generations especially after world war ii the filibuster became closely associated with opposition to civil rights bills southern democrats used it against anti lynching laws and repeated attempts to break down segregation it took the postwar civil rights movement and decades of effort to get two thirds for the civil rights act in 1964 the following year the voting rights act was passed without a filibuster and 10 years later the senate lowered the cloture requirement to three fifths the requirement is still three fifths or 60 votes in our time but lowering the requirement only made the filibuster tactic seem less extreme allowing filibusters to be virtual with no all night floor sessions needed made it all the more attractive a standard tool in a senator s toolbox so while a typical two year congress once had a handful of filibusters that required cloture votes the majority leader now files cloture petitions on literally scores of measures every year that is why it takes 60 votes in the senate has become a litany and bringing over 10 members of the other party across the aisle on something important to their leadership is regarded as all but impossible copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

ailsa chang host in pennsylvania they are rationing booze soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 1 if you go to a state store you may only be allowed to buy two bottles of your favorite alcohol chang the state liquor board says with supplies running so short they had to create purchase limits for individuals and businesses on certain brands soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 2 forty three products are on the list it includes bourbons champagne hennessy and patron chang purchase limits are also newly in place at costco soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 3 no more stocking up on toilet paper cleaning supplies and other items at costco chang and unlike the start of the pandemic it s not because people are panic buying soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 3 it s because of supply chain issues overseas chang many more companies are dealing with the same thing soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 4 supply chain delays unidentified reporter 5 and product shortages unidentified reporter 6 for all types of goods chang nike is warning of delays through next year home depot and ikea are literally chartering their own shipping vessels to move product faster and even though it s still september soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 7 tis the season for holiday panic global supply chain delays are threatening to disrupt shipments chang retail experts on network tv are already saying stuff like this about the holiday shopping season soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter 8 there isn t a lot of inventory so if you the longer you wait the more of a premium you re going to pay on not just shipping but also the price of those items chang so yeah shipping delays are one big part of the problem right now another is labor domestically there have been shortages of truck drivers warehouse workers and dockworkers internationally covid spikes have hobbled factories in places like vietnam indonesia and malaysia this global shortage of labor is also not going away anytime soon i spoke to an economist at the university of michigan betsey stevenson she s a former member of president obama s white house council of economic advisers about why this labor shortage is going to continue for a while all right so betsey stevenson before we even talk about how jobs and the supply chain are connected can i just ask you have you even started your holiday shopping because i sure haven t betsey stevenson oh well i actually have been pushing my children to give me their lists for what they might want and i have chang laughter stevenson i have actually already bought a few things for the holidays chang wow look at you ok so you re totally on top of it stevenson i m very worried you know my kids notoriously tell me on like december 15 what they want for the holidays and then i m like in a mad scramble and i ve told them this year that they will get donations to charity only laughter stevenson and i was like and you will love them they will be great donations to charity for you this year chang laughter stevenson but if you actually want a present for yourself let me start thinking about what you want now chang that is very impressive but i just want to ask you why are we even at this point like you know we all remember how hard it was to get clorox wipes masks toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic but it s been more than 18 months the supply chain is still out of whack why are we even talking about starting holiday shopping now in what september as soon as pumpkin spice hits the shelves what is going on with the supply chain stevenson well you know i love that you started with last year s problems because i think you want to think about there being three issues with the supply chain one can be that we re changing what we consume last year we all discovered a brand new love of hand sanitizer and clorox wipes and they just couldn t keep up with that newfound demand that quickly chang yeah stevenson but you know they ve learned and there s a lot of new companies making hand sanitizer same thing with masks you know we all discovered a brand new love of masks and they had to companies had to change what they were producing in order to meet all these shifts in demand that occurred because our preferences have changed in order to fight covid the way we re living our lives what we want is different the second reason it s what economists might call a bank run right you fear that everybody else is going to go ahead and take their money out of the bank what we saw last year was a toilet paper run you feared that everybody else was going to buy toilet paper and there d be none left for you chang so you would stock up stevenson yeah your best response to your fear about what everybody else is going to do is going to be to go out there and buy toilet paper so when you think that other people are stocking up your best response is to stock up even if you don t believe that there s any actual real problems out there and so we see stores now that are like hey we ve been burned by this before and you know costco s already got the one toilet paper per person please sign up and that s just because they don t want these toilet paper runs which kind of create artificial problems because they re really just about people panicking now the third thing a lot of companies just can t run things the way they were being run prior to covid and it s important for us to realize that covid s affecting the entire world and most of what we want in life involves people doing something so there are entire factories shut down because too many people in the factory have covid for it to be able to operate there are people getting sick and dying and getting sick and dying is making it hard for them to produce the stuff they were producing before i think we get so focused on what covid means for us and the united states that we forget that there are people all over the globe who are sick and dying right now and because they re sick and dying they re not making computer chips or they re not making cars or they re not making clothes chang all right so yes deaths from covid are certainly a factor but this global shortage of labor there are other factors that have contributed to that right stevenson one thing to think about with covid and where are the workers and i think countries around the world are struggling with this is there s been also a reduction in movement of people so we don t have immigrants coming in doing some of the jobs that they used to do before in our country in other countries we don t we just don t have people traveling to where they might be able to make a great contribution but it s not obviously just immigration we re also seeing that job the characteristics of jobs have changed and those characteristics have maybe made the job more dangerous less pleasant that means people might not want to do that job anymore or they might be demanding higher pay in order to do that job and so we have a lot of reallocation going on in the labor market so people want to hire but people also want to change jobs quits are at an all time high right now people are quitting jobs chang yeah stevenson and job openings are also at an all time high chang yeah stevenson the great thing about there being so many openings out there is that means there s lots of opportunities for you as a worker so if your job got worse if there s more of a risk that you get sick if people are being ruder to you because you have to ask them to put on a mask in your store well you might just be looking for something else to do and we re seeing a lot of workers changing industries we re seeing a lot of them changing occupations they re looking for better opportunities and they re holding out for better wages and they can afford to hold out for better wages because there are so many opportunities out there but that holding on for what you want that s creating a slowdown of workers being allocated to new jobs chang walk me through how this simultaneous lack of a continuing supply of workers and the disruption to the global supply chain how those two things are connected stevenson well one issue is that we don t need workers in some places right now because we re not getting the goods in from abroad workers themselves are part of the supply chain and so they can be creating their own disruption maybe can t find enough workers to complete the job but maybe you re a construction site and you ve got the workers to lay the bricks but you don t have the bricks so you don t want to be hiring more workers because you can t even keep the ones that you have busy because you re not getting the supplies in and that s going to slow down your desire to hire because even though you got plenty of people wanting you to build for them you don t have the materials so you don t actually need the workers at the same time we have record job openings and record quits so there s just a lot of turmoil in the labor market right now and turmoil in the product market and i think that it s also the case that customers are changing what they want to buy and they re still trying to figure some of that out chang so let me ask you there s a lot of churn in the job market as we were talking about as people are rethinking all of their options employers are dealing with instability because of covid what do you think what is it going to take for people to get back to work stevenson i think partially we don t know what the new normal is going to be we do have to decide how it is that we want to live and that may mean some people work less that may mean some people retire earlier than they would have without the pandemic and they re not going to unretire but maybe the other people are just in the process of changing jobs we re going to come out of this perhaps more productive with people in better jobs with higher job satisfaction chang well how long do you think it will take for all the things you just described to settle and for people to start working stevenson really no one can answer the question of how long it s going to take because we don t know the path of covid yet but i think we ll have come to a place where we have ongoing economic growth where our labor force participation rate has recovered and we have you know a lot millions of more people in the labor force than we have today but there is another path that s a path where we don t make a lot more progress with the vaccination rate because we don t make a lot more progress with the vaccination rate a more deadly variant of covid erupts that causes us to have you know more slowdowns if not shutdowns but slowdowns and we definitely saw the economy slow down with the delta variant and if we continue to have those slowdowns then i think we ve what we ve learned is a pandemic that changes what we do for a year for 18 months ultimately changes what we want so not only can i not tell you what the path looks like but i don t even know what the end point is if we re on a path with a new more deadly variant of covid on the horizon chang i don t even want to imagine that darker path betsey stevenson is a professor at the university of michigan and former member of president obama s white house council of economic advisers thank you very much for joining us today stevenson it was a pleasure talking with you soundbite of aeroc s blue eyed bitter transcript provided by npr
