by just about any metric chelsea houska is inarguably the most successful of all the teen moms chelsea was the most popular cast member during her time on the show and now she s getting ready to reach a whole new level of fame chelsea and husband cole deboer will soon star in their own hgtv show most reality stars dream of one day leveling up to a more legitimate media career but few actually pull off the feat chelsea houska endured years of abuse at the hands of adam lind her situation turned around when she met cole deboer but has chelsea s new career gone to her head or more accurately her face that s the question on the minds of many fans this week thanks to chelsea s latest instagram story she shot the video during a return trip from south dakota s black hills region where she and cole had just embarked on yet another business venture chelsea houska has been living her best life lately and apparently a lot of her fans have a problem with that i m just excited so i had to share chelsea told her audience this morning we signed papers for and officially closed on our first investment property now the video could have sparked a conversation about the ethics of investment properties as well off folks supplementing their income by buying up residential real estate is one of the reasons we have a housing crisis in this country but that s not the world s sexiest topic so on reddit and elsewhere the conversation mostly centered around what appear to be recent changes in chelsea s appearance chelsea kardashian one redditor remarked according to uk tabloid the sun it s khelsea kardashian another added she sounds just like this lady parodying kylie all the kardashians a third chimed in seemingly suggesting that chelsea has adopted the kard clan s socal accent chelsea may have received some face and lip fillers but by the standards of mtv reality stars the work she s had done is pretty minimal but we suppose she should probably expect more of this sort of criticism as her stock continues to rise chelsea houska recently shared some pics of her home and her family unfortunately the response she received online was rather mixed chelsea and cole quit teen mom in 2020 and fans were baffled by the couple s decision to walk away from such a lucrative gig it wasn t until much later that the deboers shared the news of their hgtv gig these days the couple is under greater scrutiny than ever as they prepare to introduce themselves to a whole new audience best marriage on reality tv chelsea houska and cole are so smitten with each other of course with more fans come more haters and these days reddit users are picking apart chelsea and cole s relationship like never before does anyone else feel like their love is forced anytime i see videos or photos of them i just don t see or feel the chemistry i am also looking at them through a screen so that could be it lol one commenter recently wrote it s not real lol that s why another added chelsea houska shared this photo in honor of her husband and their fourth wedding anniversary i think there s chemistry i think they also put on a show for the camera a third chimed in i always felt cole was set up by teen mom they didn t really meet at a gas station a fourth opined yes chelsea is setting the world on fire these days but all that success has led to much harsher criticism

although it stands little chance of passing the senate it s the first house vote on assault weapons since 1994 washington cn on the last day before august recess the house passed legislation that would ban assault style guns a move that comes on the heels of several brutal mass shootings the bill passed the chamber by a margin of 217 213 with two republicans voting in favor of the ban and five democrats breaking with their party to oppose the bill it s the first house vote on assault weapons since 1994 when congress passed a bill that outlawed high powered assault rifles that ban expired in 2004 and efforts since then to regulate and ban the firearms have repeatedly failed the legislation would ban the sale or production of semi automatic rifles and shotguns that have at least one military style feature such as a grenade launcher a pistol grip or a fixed magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition bump stocks which can be attached to firearms to speed up the rate of fire as well as high capacity ammunition feeding devices and magazines are also outlawed under the bill people who already legally own assault style weapons would not be affected by the ban which would only apply to future gun sales and gun sellers would be required to conduct background checks before selling or transferring semi automatic weapons that were legally owned prior to the legislation s enactment the legislation faces little chance in the 50 50 senate and it barely squeaked its way through the house but it still marked a win for democrats who have faced increasing pressure to act on gun control in the wake of recent devastating mass shootings ar 15 style guns were used by the shooter who murdered 10 people at a grocery store in buffalo new york and the shooter who gunned down 19 children at an elementary school in uvalde texas earlier this summer democratic representative david cicilline of rhode island who sponsored the ban said semi automatic firearms like the ar 15 are weapons of war the military features banned by this bill are added to make these guns more accurate more controllable or concealable and more deadly enabling killers to murder as many people as possible as quickly as possible these weapons have no place in our communities they turn our streets our schools our grocery stores our movie theaters and hospitals into bloody battlefield scenes and they kill our children our friends and neighbors and the police officers trying to protect them cicilline said on the house floor friday an investigation by the house committee on oversight and reform earlier this week revealed that in the past decade gunmakers have made more than 1 billion from the sales of ar 15 style guns two major gun manufacturers daniel defense and sturm ruger co saw their revenue from the weapons triple in just the past three years according to the committee s report all those who have had the privilege of serving in these hallowed halls take a solemn oath to the american people at the heart of our oaths is our duty to protect and defend protect and defend the constitution and the american people with this legislation we honor this foremost responsibility speaker of the house nancy pelosi said on the house floor several republican lawmakers including representative jim jordan of ohio condemned the assault weapons ban claiming it violated the second amendment they re taking away firearms used for self defense by law abiding americans this bill is wrong jordan said on the house floor friday gop representative chip roy of texas called the legislation unconstitutional and tyrannical my colleagues will most assuredly target citizens to take their guns roy said although the legislation does not apply to assault style weapon that are already legally owned last month both chambers of congress passed the first major gun safety legislation in 30 years on a bipartisan basis the bill provided millions of dollars for mental health programs expanded background checks for gun purchasers under the age of 21 and aimed to close the boyfriend loophole by including dating partners in a federal law that bans people convicted of domestic violence against a spouse or living partner from purchasing a firearm
do you own a popular stock trading at its high while the overall market is in a downturn here s what you should do what are the most popular fish in the ocean starfish what are the most popular stocks on the tsx energy stocks a year back everyone was going crazy over tech even warren buffett couldn t ignore energy buffett invested in suncor energy tsx su nyse su and dominion energy transmission in 2021 today the popularity of energy stocks is through the roof and no one is bothered about tech popularity is good as it increases demand for stocks and their price but as always the euphoria ain t going to last as it is driven more by investor sentiment than fundamentals the curious case of popular stocks let s take the case of cineplex tsx cgx and blackberry tsx bb nyse bb in early 2021 the trend in meme stocks gained popularity when redditors used a trading strategy called short selling to make quick money from stocks by taking a significant short position in other words hedge funds were bearish on these stocks and sold them intending to buy them at a lower price in the future and pocket the gains redditors promoted these stocks on social media by showing on their trading screens how a young trader could buy a yacht trading on meme stocks many young traders and investors hopped onto the bandwagon over fomo fear of missing out they bought cineplex and blackberry at inflated prices driven up by hype and they are still holding these stocks in hopes of selling them at least at the cost they bought them at but with inflation at 8 1 in june you are losing a lot more let s take an example joe purchased blackberry stock for 14 in march 2021 to make quick money he did have a few chances to sell the stock at breakeven but he passed on them in hopes of selling it at 20 that never happened as 14 was an inflated price and 20 is a price blackberry could reach when it secures significant market share the stock kept falling and joe is now sitting on a 44 loss his 500 investment in blackberry is now 280 after factoring in 8 inflation the loss has increased to 52 as the purchasing power of 280 has reduced to 240 how to trade popular stocks the above case is of an average joe who burnt cash in fomo trades and exited the stock market never to trade again the truth about stock market investing is it is boring the real value lies in stocks that are not popular or heavily promoted you may hold a stock that suddenly becomes popular that is the time to book some profit instead of buying it for instance a year back suncor energy was an eyesore for investors as it cut dividends and swung into losses because of an oversupply of oil that was the time to buy suncor you may look at the valuation and see a 1 27x price to sales ratio for a company with 55 revenue growth and think it is an undervalued stock but the trick with valuation is you can t see the figure in isolation suncor is a cyclical stock and this revenue growth is just temporary because of inflated oil prices due to the global energy crisis suncor energy stock at a crossroads the oil price has rallied to us 100 a barrel since russia invaded ukraine russia is the second largest oil producer ahead of saudi arabia and behind the united states russia and saudi arabia have a cost advantage over western countries as they can produce oil at a cheaper rate a global recession could suddenly reduce oil demand and trigger a price war negatively impacting suncor stock the fear of a recession has already pulled it down 20 from its high it is difficult to say when the price war will hit suncor stock is popular at the moment you may be bullish on it like the market but one has to be fearful when everyone is greedy so consider whether you should book your profit before suncor falls to its average price of 30 from its current inflated price of over 40

washington the u s house of representatives on friday passed a ban on semi automatic firearms the weapons used in multiple mass shootings during the last three months on a near party line vote with the 217 213 vote the bill h r 1808 will head to the evenly divided senate but it s unlikely to advance there as the ban would need all democrats on board plus 10 republicans to get past a filibuster sen chuck schumer the senate majority leader has not announced if he plans to bring the weapons ban to the floor for a vote each year more children die from gun violence than any other cause house speaker nancy pelosi said on the house floor our nation has watched unspeakable horror as assault weapons have been used in massacre after massacre all but five democrats backed the ban only two republicans voted in favor brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania and chris jacobs of new york the five democrats that split with their party and opposed the ban were reps jared golden of maine kurt schrader of oregon ron kind of wisconsin and henry cuellar and vicente gonzalez of texas the push for banning semi automatic firearms came after they were used in mass shootings in uvalde texas where 19 children and two teachers were murdered and in buffalo new york where a white supremacist murdered 10 black people at a grocery store a semi automatic weapon also was used in a july fourth shooting in highland park illinois where seven people were killed these weapons have no place in our communities there are more mass shootings than days in the year this is a uniquely american problem rep david ciciliine of rhode island the sponsor of the bill rep david cicilline a rhode island democrat said that movie theaters places of worship schools hospitals and grocery stores have become bloody battlefield scenes these weapons have no place in our communities he said there are more mass shootings than days in the year this is a uniquely american problem this year alone there have been 372 mass shootings according to the gun violence archive police funding bills the assault weapons ban was originally set to be passed alongside several bills that would provide funding for local police departments but progressive democrats raised concerns and pushed for more accountability measures in the police legislation i have heard from the civil rights community and i have strong concerns with two policing bills we may consider this week rep andy levin a michigan democrat wrote on twitter we should not advance them unless they include robust accountability oversight provisions in line with those in the george floyd justice in policing act rep josh gottheimer a new jersey democrat is the lead sponsor of a bill that would authorize a 50 million grant each year for a justice department program to assist small local police departments another bill would reauthorize a grant program to hire and increase the pay of local police rep val demings a florida democrat and former orlando police chief who is running for republican sen marco rubio s senate seat sponsored a bill to provide 100 million per year in grants to help police agencies solve violent crimes the initiatives come as democratic leadership has tried to push back on being seen as a party that wants to defund the police a slogan many members have disavowed as well as biden republicans have been branding democrats as not supportive enough of police in advance of the midterm elections during a weekly press conference friday pelosi speaking to the concerns of progressives said the police bill was not funding without accountability on the house floor she said that after the august recess democrats will pass the police and public safety set of bills weapons ban the u s house judiciary committee passed the weapons ban out of its committee last week on a party line vote the bill bans all semi automatic rifles that can have a detachable magazine and have a military feature such as a pistol grip and a detachable stock or grenade launcher among other features it also bans all semi automatic rifles that have a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds the bill if enacted into law would not ban current semi automatic weapons that people own meaning current firearm owners would have their weapons grandfathered in house republicans opposing the bill argued that the bill would take away semi automatic weapons from current owners but democrats said that is not correct because they would be covered under the grandfather clause during debate on the house floor rep guy reschenthaler a pennsylvania republican said the bill was unconstitutional calling it a gun grab law abiding americans use firearms every day he said rep deborah ross a north carolina democrat denied that people would lose their guns as many republicans continued to say it simply prevents future sales of assault rifles she said adding that the weapons are not designed for recreation they re designed for combat rep jim jordan an ohio republican also accused democrats of coming for your guns rep lauren boebert a colorado republican tweeted about the ban calling the house vote on it an emergency democrats are actually attempting to ban guns that are in common use by millions and millions of americans she said in a video emergency a massive gun grab is underway here at the capitol pic twitter com u0iaqcav1j rep lauren boebert repboebert july 29 2022 white house support the white house issued a statement on friday in support of the bill 40 000 americans die from gunshot wounds every year and guns have become the top killer of children in the united states according to the statement as president biden has repeatedly called for we must do more to stop this gun violence and save lives house democrats have held numerous hearings about gun violence in america most recently this week when house oversight and reform investigated the profits that gun manufacturers made off semiautomatic weapons ceos from two gun manufacturers stated at the hearing that they played no role in mass shootings that used their products the passage of the bill follows another gun related bill that biden signed into law in late june following the mass shootings in texas and new york that bill the bipartisan safer communities act consists of eight provisions that bill provides 750 million for states to enact red flag laws which allow the courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others among other provisions provides a historic 11 billion in mental health services for schools and families and requires those under 21 who want to purchase a firearm to undergo a background check that takes into account a review of juvenile and mental health records among other things when biden was a member of the senate he backed a 10 year ban on assault weapons that was passed in 1994 but it lapsed a decade later and congress never renewed it research from a group of injury epidemiologists and trauma surgeons has shown that between 2004 and 2017 the last year of our analysis the average number of yearly deaths attributed to mass shootings was 25 compared with 5 3 during the 10 year tenure of the ban and 7 2 in the years leading up to the prohibition on assault weapons

file high gas prices are shown as a pedestrian waits to cross the street in los angeles june 16 2022 oil companies were swimming in record profits the last few months they were benefiting from high energy costs at a time when americans struggled to pay for gasoline food and other basic necessities ap photo jae c hong file new york ap oil companies swam in record profits over the last few months at a time when americans struggled to pay for gasoline food and other basic necessities on friday exxon mobil booked an unprecedented 17 85 billion profit for the second quarter and chevron made a record 11 62 billion the sky high profits come one day after the u k s shell shattered its own profit record soaring energy prices have rattled consumers and become a political flash point last month president joe biden said that exxon made more money than god this year consumers are facing high fuel prices not just at the pump but soaring energy prices are being baked into delivery costs which is driving up the cost of everything from apples to toilet paper the record profits marked a stunning turnaround from the early days of the covid 19 pandemic when cities were locked down and demand for fuels plummeted there were numerous bankruptcies and thousands of layoffs the industry has long gone through boom and bust cycles but due to the ongoing war russia waged on ukraine which resulted in less oil and gas on the market from russia as well as other global supply constraints high prices could linger for some time these dirty companies are raking in massive profits all while forcing us to pay more at the pump and causing the deaths of countless americans from extreme heat drought fires and choked lungs their corporate greed is literally killing us gavin newsom gavinnewsom july 29 2022 it s devastating said mark wolfe executive director of the national energy assistance directors association who added that high energy prices hit low income families and frontline workers the hardest you live on a tight budget and this is an extra 40 to 50 per week wolfe wants the federal government to tax energy companies and redistribute some of those profits back to the families who are struggling inflation is already changing where americans go and what they eat it s also changing the way they consume energy two thirds of americans changed their driving habits and lifestyle with the vast majority choosing to drive less or combine errands said aaa spokesman andrew gross among those surveyed by aaa 2 said they bought an electric vehicle since march he said they have really altered their lifestyles to cope with these high prices gross said exxon based in irving texas increased its oil and gas production as crude prices hovered above 100 a barrel revenue at exxon skyrocketed to 115 68 billion up from 67 74 billion during the same quarter last year natural gas and liquefied natural gas lng prices are also elevated due to russia s invasion of ukraine and ensuing sanctions against russia a major supplier of natural gas many european nations have been scrambling for alternatives to russian natural gas and have been competing for boatloads of lng driving up prices for natural gas both globally and in the u s inflation in europe has also been surging including soaring costs for energy surging prices have been a boon for investors including energy executives who receive a large share of compensation through company stock exxon earned 4 21 per share exceeding analyst expectations of 4 02 per share according to analysts polled by factset chevron earned 5 95 per share exceeding analyst expectations of 5 16 per share exxon ceo darren woods attributed the company s success to its investments in oil and gas fields in guyana and the permian basin as well as its investments in liquefied natural gas which has been in high demand globally given the long investment cycle times growing supply will not happen overnight said woods in a conference call friday gasoline prices rose particularly quickly during the quarter due to limited global supply the high cost of oil and because there are fewer refineries operating in the u s than before the pandemic exxon plans to increase refining capacity by about 250 000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023 by expanding its beaumont refinery that represents the industry s largest single capacity addition in the u s since 2012 the company said to alleviate europe s energy crisis exxon sees potential for fracking and unconventional gas in germany and there s an opportunity where certainly exxonmobil could play a key role woods said exxon also plans to increase its exports of lng to europe golden pass its lng export facility under construction in port arthur texas will increase lng exports from the gulf coast by 20 when it starts up in 2024 he said bringing more lng supplies to help offset some of the russian gas going into europe will be another really critical step forward in diversification of supplies for europe woods said climate scientists and residents who live near gulf coast lng export facilities warn that expanding fossil fuel infrastructure could exacerbate disasters caused by climate change exxon expects to increase oil equivalent production in the permian basin by 25 this year compared to 2021 and to eliminate routine flaring in the permian by the end

by richard cowan washington reuters the u s house of representatives on friday passed legislation banning assault style rifles that have been used in mass shootings sending it to the senate where it faces likely defeat by a mostly partisan vote of 217 213 democrats won passage of the measure amid public anger over mass murders in which rapid fire ar 15 rifles were used to kill and wound school children and adults engaging in day to day activities they re easier for a teenager to get than to buy a beer democratic representative lloyd doggett said during debate we ve turned our churches our schools our shopping centers our entertainment venues almost any place into a battleground with one massacre after another he added democrats have been trying for years to renew a federal ban on the weapon which was first imposed in 1994 and expired in 2004 the ban resulted in a significant decrease in mass shootings according to a 2021 study by northwestern nasdaq university feinberg school of medicine republicans have resisted accusing democrats of attacking the 2nd amendment to the u s constitution which grants the right to keep and bear arms democrats have argued that is not a blanket prohibition on the control of some guns and their enhancements assault style rifles are lightweight semi automatic weapons popular among hunters in the united states they also are capable of causing severe damage to humans when they tear through organs bones and muscle in rapid fire there can be no greater responsibility than to do all we can to ensure the safety of our families our children our homes our communities and our nation u s president joe biden a democrat said on friday urging the senate to back the measure republican representative guy reschenthaler accused democrats of a never ending attack on americans second amendment rights once again we re considering legislation that would do nothing more than penalize law abiding citizens while doing absolutely nothing about the root cause of gun violence he said many republicans say providing additional federal funding to treat mental illnesses would be a more effective way of reducing mass shootings shifting sentiment with public opinion moving in favor of some new gun controls congress one month ago approved a bipartisan bill that biden signed into law containing modest safety measures it included tougher background checks before gun sales can be transacted with a particular eye toward keeping weapons out of the hands of people convicted of domestic violence or significant crimes as juveniles it marked the first time in three decades that congress succeeded in passing a significant gun control bill the most recent in a string of mass shootings with ar 15s included 10 killed and three wounded at a buffalo new york supermarket 19 children and two teachers murdered at a uvalde texas elementary school and seven killed at a july 4 holiday parade in highland park illinois democrats vowed however to keep pushing for additional controls earlier this week house oversight committee democrats questioned top executives of two u s gunmakers sturm ruger co inc rgr n and daniel defense llc in a hearing that centered on marketing of assault style rifles to young men seeking to emulate soldiers on battlefields the 100 member senate is divided 50 50 between republicans and democrats who control the chamber because democratic vice president kamala harris is its ceremonial president and has the power to break tie votes but senate rules require that most legislation needs the support of at least 60 senators to advance meaning that republicans can block a bill from even being debated during the june push for passage of the bipartisan bill there were not enough votes among republicans to raise the age for buying an assault rifle to 21 from 18 much less ban the weapon

you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors why do mortgage rates fluctuate here are some of the most common reasons why mortgage rates move frequently employment patterns the employment rate is an indicator of demand for mortgages when more people are unemployed fewer people will be looking to get a mortgage and buy a home and that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is the united states central bank but it doesn t actually set mortgage rates rather multiple things the fed does influence mortgage rates for example while mortgage rates don t mirror the fed funds rate the rate banks apply when borrowing lending money to each other overnight they do tend to follow it if that rate rises mortgage rates typically rise in tandem global economy global banking systems and economies are closely interconnected when economies in other parts of the world especially europe and asia experience a downturn it affects investors and financial institutions in the united states and when foreign economies are doing well

offset by a reduction in fdic assessment expense by 149 thousand compared to second quarter 2021 noninterest expenses increased 4 salary and benefits and occupancy and equipment were relatively flat

the federal government s refusal to recognize the costs of legal migration is a boomer approach to immigration policy said rep matt gaetz r fl the immigration problem is not just the illegal immigration gaetz told breitbart news it s the legal immigration where you now have a system where we tell these young people go get your stem degree go learn how to code and then they do that they accrue massive amounts of college debt and then we bring in somebody from india who is able to do the job for 50 000 or 60 000 bucks a year on some work visa big tech scoops all those up and it deprives a lot of americans of jobs so we have to think about immigration not just at the broken border i think that s almost like a very boomer approach to the broader immigration challenge we have that informs on both legal and illegal immigration gaetz s comments are interesting because they might show some gop leaders even former president donald trump are willing to challenge the legal migration policies that have allowed coastal investors to import their own foreign workforces some gop leaders notably rep jim banks r in have already drafted proposals to level the free market for labor in the united states the post 1990 visa worker policies have tilted the national economy in favor of california and new york and it has also tilted the labor market against american college graduates the visa worker rules have shut many americans out of good fortune 500 careers because they have allowed ceos to keep a huge foreign labor force in many vital jobs these foreign workers perhaps 1 5 million workers now hold many important jobs such as search engine designers at google content screeners at twitter news editors at facebook engineering jobs at intel and research jobs at qualcomm those no rights foreign visa workers are preferred by ceos because they are cheaper compliant and cannot quit to create innovative companies these visa workers are imported via the h 1b opt tn j 1 h4ead o 1 and e 2 visa programs many additional foreigners illegally work in the hidden pyramids of fortune 500 subcontractors after illegally overstaying their visas forging documents and arriving on b 1 b 2 non work visas the federal government makes very little effort to reduce fraud and often encourages foreigners to take these vital jobs congress s decision to let the coastal investors have their own labor pipeline also ensured that the high tech economy was built in california washington state and a few other locations investors now face little pressure to hire heartland americans or to create satellite offices in ohio indiana wisconsin arizona pennsylvania maine etc because they can hire their new workers by sending a bus down to lax airport during his term in office trump was slow to reform the white collar migration policies such as the h 1b visa program his deputies did launch useful reforms in his last year but those reforms were not anchored by law or regulation and were quickly washed away by president joe biden s pro migration deputies that failure to reform the white collar programs likely cost trump much support among white collar suburban voters in turn that loss helped tip the election against him in pennsylvania wisconsin georgia and arizona this year heartland republican senators chiefly sen todd young r in blocked an investor backed democratic plan to dramatically expand the replacement of american graduates by foreign graduates extraction migration since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of legal and illegal migrants plus temporary visa workers from poor countries to serve as workers managers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this federal economic policy of extraction migration has skewed the free market in the united states by inflating the labor supply for the benefit of employers the inflationary policy makes it difficult for ordinary americans to get married advance in their careers raise families or buy homes extraction migration has also slowed innovation and shrunk americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force an economy built on extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it allows wealthy elites to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society the economic policy is backed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into a progressive directed empire of competitive resentful identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits poor foreigners and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors this migration policy also minimizes shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries business backed migration advocates hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding explanations and theatrical border security programs for example progressives claim that the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration is good for migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations the polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but they also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates the opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that american citizens owe to one another

you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors why do mortgage rates fluctuate here are some of the most common reasons why mortgage rates move frequently employment patterns the employment rate is an indicator of demand for mortgages when more people are unemployed fewer people will be looking to get a mortgage and buy a home and that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is the united states central bank but it doesn t actually set mortgage rates rather multiple things the fed does influence mortgage rates for example while mortgage rates don t mirror the fed funds rate the rate banks apply when borrowing lending money to each other overnight they do tend to follow it if that rate rises mortgage rates typically rise in tandem global economy global banking systems and economies are closely interconnected when economies in other parts of the world especially europe and asia experience a downturn it affects investors and financial institutions in the united states and when foreign economies are doing well

the federal government s refusal to recognize the costs of legal migration is a boomer approach to immigration policy said rep matt gaetz r fl the immigration problem is not just the illegal immigration gaetz told breitbart news it s the legal immigration where you now have a system where we tell these young people go get your stem degree go learn how to code and then they do that they accrue massive amounts of college debt and then we bring in somebody from india who is able to do the job for 50 000 or 60 000 bucks a year on some work visa big tech scoops all those up and it deprives a lot of americans of jobs so we have to think about immigration not just at the broken border i think that s almost like a very boomer approach to the broader immigration challenge we have that informs on both legal and illegal immigration gaetz s comments are interesting because they might show some gop leaders even former president donald trump are willing to challenge the legal migration policies that have allowed coastal investors to import their own foreign workforces some gop leaders notably rep jim banks r in have already drafted proposals to level the free market for labor in the united states the post 1990 visa worker policies have tilted the national economy in favor of california and new york and it has also tilted the labor market against american college graduates the visa worker rules have shut many americans out of good fortune 500 careers because they have allowed ceos to keep a huge foreign labor force in many vital jobs these foreign workers perhaps 1 5 million workers now hold many important jobs such as search engine designers at google content screeners at twitter news editors at facebook engineering jobs at intel and research jobs at qualcomm those no rights foreign visa workers are preferred by ceos because they are cheaper compliant and cannot quit to create innovative companies these visa workers are imported via the h 1b opt tn j 1 h4ead o 1 and e 2 visa programs many additional foreigners illegally work in the hidden pyramids of fortune 500 subcontractors after illegally overstaying their visas forging documents and arriving on b 1 b 2 non work visas the federal government makes very little effort to reduce fraud and often encourages foreigners to take these vital jobs congress s decision to let the coastal investors have their own labor pipeline also ensured that the high tech economy was built in california washington state and a few other locations investors now face little pressure to hire heartland americans or to create satellite offices in ohio indiana wisconsin arizona pennsylvania maine etc because they can hire their new workers by sending a bus down to lax airport during his term in office trump was slow to reform the white collar migration policies such as the h 1b visa program his deputies did launch useful reforms in his last year but those reforms were not anchored by law or regulation and were quickly washed away by president joe biden s pro migration deputies that failure to reform the white collar programs likely cost trump much support among white collar suburban voters in turn that loss helped tip the election against him in pennsylvania wisconsin georgia and arizona this year heartland republican senators chiefly sen todd young r in blocked an investor backed democratic plan to dramatically expand the replacement of american graduates by foreign graduates extraction migration since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of legal and illegal migrants plus temporary visa workers from poor countries to serve as workers managers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this federal economic policy of extraction migration has skewed the free market in the united states by inflating the labor supply for the benefit of employers the inflationary policy makes it difficult for ordinary americans to get married advance in their careers raise families or buy homes extraction migration has also slowed innovation and shrunk americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force an economy built on extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it allows wealthy elites to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society the economic policy is backed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into a progressive directed empire of competitive resentful identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits poor foreigners and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors this migration policy also minimizes shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries business backed migration advocates hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding explanations and theatrical border security programs for example progressives claim that the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration is good for migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations the polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but they also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates the opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that american citizens owe to one another

the house gop leadership has released a brief and vague two page policy platform on border security for the 2022 election after more than a year of inaction titled house republicans we must secure the southern border the low drama paper ignores the voter mobilizing economic impact of legal and illegal migration and was released on a friday before the weekend but the platform does include significant promises of 2023 legislation to reform current laws on asylum parole and other high profile issues outside the narrow issue of border control it is 1 000 percent better than it was going to be said rosemary jenks the government relations director for numbersusa she told breitbart news republican leadership realized that they needed to combine the judiciary and homeland security jurisdictions and to include meaningful reforms that will close the loopholes in the law that the biden administration is exploiting to drive the mass illegal migration it is worth noting that the framework contains most of the demands from our broad coalition effort said a statement from rj hauman government relations at the federation for american immigration reform when the 118th congress opens with a new house majority it will be in large part because americans rejected the biden administration s purposeful dismantling of our nation s borders as well as speaker pelosi s amnesty first legislative agenda house republicans will have a mandate to immediately legislate unflinchingly and this framework from the american security task force is a great first step we thank republican leaders for listening to our expertise and insight and stand ready to work with them on turning this into legislative text the coalition effort cited by hauman refers to the consensus document presented in may to 150 gop legislators the legislators included rep kevin mccarthy r ca rep jim jordan r oh and rep jim banks r in however the gop s promised legislation will likely be vetoed by president joe biden even if gets through the senate said jenks but the battle will help educate the gop legislators their staffers and the voters so setting the issue up for the 2024 presidential election she said the likely presidential veto also means that the gop legislators must include useful language in the 2024 appropriations bill when it is drafted in 2023 she added it s going to be absolutely critical for the appropriations committee to be good on this issue next year because obviously this is not going to be signed into law so we re going to be relying on appropriators to use the power of the purse to force the biden administration to take actions that he clearly does not want to take like detaining illegal aliens removing illegal aliens and removing criminal aliens i am somewhat optimistic because there will be a lot of pressure from republicans on the appropriators to address some of these issues and to do it in in creative ways you can t just throw money at the biden administration and expect them to do what they re told they re not going to do it so you have to have creative ways with carrots and sticks to essentially force them to do what they don t want to do for many years gop leaders have been reluctant to talk about how both legal and illegal immigration skew the national economy in favor of coastal investors they instead hide from that huge problem by diverting voters attention to the problems of border chaos illegal migration drugs crime and even the claim of terrorists that reluctance to talk about immigration in large part is driven by the closed door clout of the gop s corporate donors chiefly at the congressional leadership fund for example the fund provided 262 000 to gop candidate mayra flores in texas she was quickly bundled into backing a green card giveaway during one of her first votes the gop s donors oppose effective border controls because they profit from any legal or illegal inflow of workers consumers and renters that inflow tilts the economy away from ordinary americans toward coastal investors the corporate donors clout is amplified because the gop has not created a way for small dollar donors to fully fund populist candidates the new southern border campaign document includes a toothless agenda for the homeland security committee that short passive voice and ineffective section was drafted over the last year by outgoing rep john katko r ny who was a business backed pro migration establishment legislator katko gave up his congressional job because new york democrats used their extra political power from immigrant voters to add more democrats to his home district the katko section includes a promise to fund the border wall even though biden s deputies refuse the spending the funding that they already have the katko section also promises to clear the carrizo cane and salt cedar these invasive species along the rio grande river impede cbp s activities along the border the non native plant is also an obstacle for first responders and should be eradicated the donor backed leadership picked gop members who drafted the carrizo cane section included rep mario diaz balart r fl rep ralph norman r sc rep carlos gimenez r fl rep andrew clyde r ga rep greg steube r fl rep chip roy r tx rep tony gonzales r tx rep john rutherford r fl rep steven palazzo r ms rep warren davidson r oh rep greg pence r in rep nicole malliotakis r ny rep troy nehls r tx rep brian babin r tx and rep dan meuser r pa the second section part of the election platform is the responsibility of the house judiciary committee whose leading republican is rep jim jordan r oh the judiciary section promises useful legislation that would expand authorities like title 42 to address the fentanyl crisis and the unprecedented increase of illegal border crossings under current law title 42 public health authorities can only be exercised to limit the spread of a communicable disease such as covid 19 however as the country faces a mounting public health crisis from illicit narcotics coming across the southern border we must ensure dhs has the authority to immediately expel illegal aliens to gain operational control of the border and for department of health and human services hhs to suspend the entry of people or property in order to mitigate the flow of fentanyl and other lethal drugs into american communities regain operational control of the southern border over the past 18 months the biden administration has lost operational control of the southern border by refusing to enforce common sense laws and practices to maintain order and protect the wellbeing of americans and legal immigrants this has only empowered and enriched criminal drug cartels who must be confronted and defeated with the full force of the u s government house republicans propose the following steps that should be taken to regain control migrant protection protocols mpp require implementation of an mpp that ends the biden administration s lax border enforcement and restores order at the southern border end catch and release fix the flores settlement to enable dhs to keep children and their parents together while their immigration cases are pending strengthen the asylum process change asylum laws to protect legitimate claims and prevent fraudulent claims strengthen the asylum process and ensure that those seeking asylum apply in a safe country through which they traveled instead of waiting to apply in the u s end the disparate treatment of unaccompanied alien children uacs reform the removal process

sale of our eagle ford asset and cpc curtailments impacting tco during april this was partially offset by shale and tight growth primarily in the permian in the permian we re delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon our development costs are down about 25 since 2019 and we expect to keep them flat this year by offsetting inflation with productivity improvements an example of simul frac where we performed completion activities on four wells at a time reducing cycle time by a quarter we continue to design construct and operate facilities to limit methane emissions two of our midland basin sites recently earned the highest ratings from project canary s independent certification program production is at record levels and growing in line with guidance with our royalty position providing a distinct financial advantage for our shareholders at tco the drilling program is complete and the final metering station is online we expect to complete construction by year end with remaining project activities primarily focused on systems completion commissioning and start up total project cost guidance is unchanged wpmp start up is expected in the second half of next year and fgp s expected timing remains first half of 2024 tco s operations continue to generate strong cash flow enabling a midyear dividend with project spend decreasing we re expecting higher dividends going forward in australia we shipped 87 lng cargoes from gorgon and wheatstone in the first half of this year up over 10 from last year our reliability benchmarks in the first quartile and we intend to stay there with an ongoing focus on operational excellence gorgon stage 2 the first backfill project is on track to deliver first gas in september our gulf of mexico projects are progressing well with ballymore receiving fid as a tieback to blind faith an example of leveraging our existing infrastructure to improve returns the anchor hull is currently sailing from korea and work on its top sides continues in texas lastly we recently signed agreements to export 4 million tons a year of lng from the u s gulf coast with 1 5 million tons a year expected to start in 2026 these agreements leverage our growing u s natural gas production and expand our value chains in atlantic basin markets now back to you pierre pierre breber chief financial officer thanks jay we closed the reg acquisition last month and integration is going very well we re pleased to welcome reg s talented employees to chevron and cj warner to our board our teams have already identified further commercial opportunities and we quickly acted to lower insurance and financing costs in may we launched our joint venture with bunge the jv is operating two existing crushers and evaluation work is underway to expand crush capacity and add pretreatment facilities in carbon capture and storage we closed on the expanded jv to develop the bayou bend ccs hub the lease held by the jv is in texas state waters near large industrial emitters and we believe it is the first u s offshore lease dedicated to ccs also we recently filed for a conditional use permit in kern county california to store co2 emissions from one of our cogeneration plants now looking ahead in the third quarter we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production in a number of locations in downstream planned turnarounds are primarily at our california refineries we do not expect significant dividends from tco or angola lng until the fourth quarter our full year guidance for affiliate dividends is unchanged with upside potential beyond the top of the range depending on commodity prices also we increased the top end of our share buyback guidance range to 15 billion per year and expect to be at that rate during the third quarter in closing we re executing our plans increasing investment to grow both traditional and new energy supplies and delivering value to our stakeholders although commodity markets may be volatile our actions are consistent through the cycle and focus on our objectives to deliver higher returns and lower carbon back to you roderick roderick green general manager investor relations that concludes our prepared remarks we are now ready to take your questions katie please open the line questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from devin mcdermott with morgan stanley devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst good morning thanks for taking my question so jay i wanted to congratulate you on the retirement plans and take advantage of having you here on the call my first one is on tco and it s great to see the project progress there and with the wpmp portion of the project largely complete i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the remaining milestones for that second phase fgp as you progress toward that first half 2024 start up jay johnson executive vice president upstream thank you devin for both the retirement wishes and the question but tco we ve been just steadily making progress here and we had a very strong period in the first half of this year we had the unrest in january of course and then the team responded well after that even with some of the omicron impacts as we are finishing construction we expect to finish construction on everything this year and be largely into the commissioning phase and this is largely putting together doing the pressure testing filling with fluids cleaning systems and preparing them for eventual start up the wpmp that we expect in the second half of next year will be around enabling us to boost the pressure from the field up to the facilities so we don t expect to see a material change in our production at that point in time but it enables us then to move into the phase of start up for fgp where we will start to see incremental production coming through the plant and some of the big milestones we ve already accomplished all 40 production wells are already now produced and completed and actually producing into the plant that helps us with the transition from the high pressure to the low pressure phase we ve got the injection wells already completed so we can begin the fgp start up field facilities are well underway in terms of the new gathering system we ll have about all the metering stations have to be converted to high pressure to low pressure they ll be done kind of one at a time so we can maintain production through that period so those are the you won t see a lot of outward signs other than progress on the commissioning the number of subsystems completed and that s really what we re moving into rather than percent complete we re 93 complete overall now what s going to be more important or just the rundown curves as we bring each system to completion devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst great thank you very helpful and great progress there and sticking with tco in that part of your portfolio there s been a lot of headlines around the cpc pipeline in recent weeks and months i just wondering if you could give us a status update on where things stand there and then also to the extent that there were to be any further disruptions to flows on that pipe can you talk a little bit about the impacts to operations for your base existing production in that area jay johnson executive vice president upstream the cpc continues to be an important export route for us it handles the majority of kazakh crude that s being exported to western markets and it represents an important supply to the world it s about 1 4 million barrels of oil a day coming through that the oil that we put into the line from kazakhstan carries a certificate of origin from kazakhstan and we ve done a lot of work in washington and brussels to make sure people understand the importance of the pipeline to world supplies and we ve seen the reliability overall still and the capacity to be able to maintain at the levels we need the interruptions that we ve seen have been managed we ve gotten through those and as we look forward we just continue to work with the kazakh government and with the international consortium that owns and operates the cpc pipeline to maintain this important source of or export route for the crude there are some alternate export routes being developed but cpc remains the primary and most important route for us devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst got it just to clarify at the moment operationally at normal nameplate and flow rates through the pipe jay johnson executive vice president upstream yeah we re at full capacity both at tco and through the cpc pipeline they actually work quite well with us when they do have to take the pipeline down for ongoing maintenance which all pipelines have to do from time to time they coordinate with the producers they re often coordinated with turnarounds that the producing facilities are undergoing so the recent downtime for cpc as they were dealing with some of the results of the survey work around the terminal was coordinated with the ncoc turnaround activities so that it didn t have any impact at all on tco s production devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst great thanks so much jay johnson executive vice president upstream thanks devin operator you re welcome we ll take our next question from neil mehta with goldman sachs neil mehta goldman sachs analyst hey good morning team jay thank you for all the insights over the years and wish you well in your retirement sir jay johnson executive vice president upstream thank you neil mehta goldman sachs analyst the first question is on capital returns and you guys raised the top end the buyback guidance here so just talk about the math that went into it and how you think about the optimal return of capital formation whether it is through buybacks or dividend growth pierre breber chief financial officer thanks neil it s pierre i ll take that i ll go through our financial priorities they ve been consistent for decades literally the first financial priority is to grow the dividend we ve done that for 35 consecutive years increased it 6 earlier this year it s up 20 since right before covid and it s doubled since 2010 the second is to invest and grow both traditional and new energy and you saw that our total investments first half of the year were up 80 versus a year ago the third is to maintain a strong balance sheet for the fifth consecutive quarter we paid down debt our net debt ratio is at 8 that s well below our mid cycle guidance of 20 to 25 and when we have cash in excess of those first three priorities we buy back shares and we intend to do it ratably over the cycle we repurchased shares 50 now last 19 years we bought back almost 60 billion during that time at an average price of around 90 a share very close to the weighted average price during that whole time and as you said we just increased the guidance to we just increased the top of the range of our guidance to 15 billion a year that represents about 1 of our shares each quarter the 15 billion annual rate is based on our current outlook it was tested against a number of scenarios the rate is consistent with our investor day upside leverage case which was a 75 flat nominal price over five years as we ve said with previous buyback rates we intend to maintain buybacks at this annual rate for a number of years across the commodity cycle as a reminder our net debt is well below our mid cycle guidance range so we ll continue buybacks even when the commodity cycle turns down and we ll lever back up our balance sheet closer to that 20 to 25 guidance range neil mehta goldman sachs analyst fair the follow up is just on the permian can you just talk about how you re thinking about the growth profile there relative to what you guided at the beginning of the year does the upward drift in commodity prices change the way you re thinking about prosecuting that asset jay johnson executive vice president upstream yep i ll start out with that and then pierre can finish if he s got any other thoughts the permian our approach to the permian as you know for many years has been to be very disciplined very focused on generating the returns and the efficiency that allow us to be profitable regardless of the prices and so we re not responding to short term price but we are increasing our activity levels since the turn down during covid and so we have seen our investment go up this year it s 1 billion higher than it was last year and we also see the number of wells that we re putting on production going up we expect to do over 200 this year and so we re looking for about a 15 increase in our permian production we ve increased two additional rigs in july so we re running now with a fleet of 10 rigs across the permian in the current time and we expect to maintain that through the second half but i ll remind you also one of our rigs today drills the equivalent of what two rigs could do in 2018 so using just rig counts is a little bit of you have to be careful because we re so much more efficient with our rigs and each frac crew today is also completing roughly double the work they were doing back in 2018 so we re much more efficient than we were just four years ago we expect to see our investment continue to grow we ve given you guidance of increasing our investment rate up to about 4 billion a year by 2024 and then i would expect to see it relatively flat after that as we just maintain an efficient operation across the permian we also have non operated activity and we currently have about 9 net rigs running on the non op side and so that also contributes significantly to our production profile our guidance remains unchanged we d expect to see about 1 2 million to 1 5 million barrels a day of production ultimately as our plateau but as we continue to gain insights and knowledge and as we look at our efficiencies as we look at our portfolio and world demand that can change as we go forward that s our guidance as we see it today and we ll continue to update you as we move forward in time pierre breber chief financial officer my only add is it s also among our most carbon efficient barrels in the portfolio and as jay has said it s a demonstration of our delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon thanks neil operator thank you we ll take our next question from jeanine wai with barclays jeanine wai barclays analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking our questions jay johnson executive vice president upstream morning jeanine wai barclays analyst jay we d also like to wish you well and thank you for all your time over the years and we ll stick to two upstream questions just so we can get to last in before you leave our first one is on lng this week there was an announcement that chevron along with a couple of other partners that you guys reached fid on development that will help boost angola lng plant volumes so can you talk about how you re viewing expansion opportunities in angola and also hit on equatorial guinea where you also have kind of an equity position that feeds an lng plant there and is there a preference on how your involvement evolves with lng plants because you have some ownership some equity ownership but we also know that you had a cheniere agreement that you announced recently that was more just on the marketing front so just wondering how you re seeing your role there on new opportunities jay johnson executive vice president upstream that was pretty good jeanine i think you got three questions in there and i m going to try and merge through those jeanine wai barclays analyst oh no that s just one jay johnson executive vice president upstream i know i m allowed to do that i m the upstream guy look on the lng in angola you re right we just took fid in the new gas consortium there are two primary sources of gas for angola lng traditionally it was built for the associated gas that s produced along with the oil resources in angola and that s been the main source of gas for angola lng up to this point and we continue to develop new oil resources with our 20 year extension just secured really good terms on both the oil and the gas it encourages investment in that country there s a lot of oil still in block 0 so that continues unabated and actually the investment will move forward the non associated gas in other words drilling and developing reservoirs that are gas only is a new investment mode and we re doing that through the consortium you mentioned and that s designed to be supplemental gas so that we can keep the angola lng facilities full and so the ongoing effort to keep that plant running it s really economic because it builds on existing infrastructure that s already been built the investments have already been made and importantly it s supplying needed lng into the european market and also gives us exposure to that atlantic basin so that s been a good project for us and we re pleased to take that in eg again we have exposure now to the atlantic basin through that project we continue to produce there there s not much more i can say other than that s also been a profitable area for us and it came to us through the noble acquisition so it was kind of one of those more hidden jewels we talk about eastern med we talk about the dj basin in particular but eg is supplying a very good return to us through those gas and lng facilities in terms of our focus on ownership versus commercial we re really pretty agnostic we re looking for the returns and the scale that we can build out of the business we re looking for multiple points of supply so that we can maintain an active and profitable portfolio and so where we can do commercial deals and not have to use capital but to really be able to leverage other facilities that s always a nice way for us to go and i m pleased to get that exposure out of the gulf coast into both european and potentially asian markets it gives us an access for a lot of our produced gas in north america to access those markets rather than just u s but where it makes sense we ll also make investments as we have in other places and own the facilities or run them through joint venture facilities or non operated facilities we really look at what gives us the best to generate the returns we re looking for jeanine wai barclays analyst all right thank you we won t sneak in our unrelated follow up since that was a very fulsome response thank you jay johnson executive vice president upstream ok thanks jeanine pierre breber chief financial officer thanks jeanine operator we ll take our next question from doug leggate with bank of america doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you 41 years in one place jay that s pretty impressive congratulations jay johnson executive vice president upstream thank you doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst i wonder if i could take maybe two questions for you actually maybe pierre might prefer the second one i want to go to the permian first you have about half year production operated and half non operated can you pass between the inflationary pressures between your operated and non operated from what you re seeing currently jay johnson executive vice president upstream it s difficult for me to really do that definitively what i can say though is i think we have a competitive advantage in the permian we have a couple of things working in our favor we maintain a global supply chain and we re able to tap suppliers of both equipment and materials goods and services over a much broader range than maybe some of our competitors we also do multiyear contracts and other mechanisms commercially that allow us to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we see today and then of course our focus on driving for improved productivity improved efficiency has really helped us continue to counter the inflationary pressures i think the other area that we have a distinct advantage is we ve been building out our infrastructure in the permian and so just as a proof point the last 800 wells over the last five years to produce those 800 wells we had to build 40 central tank batteries as we look forward the next 800 wells we only need to build an additional four central tank batteries so while others are having to invest in this high inflationary period we re largely using infrastructure that was built over the past five years with very small incremental surface facilities required and i think that s going to be hard for others to match doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst so that s a very clear answer thank you pierre i don t know quite hard to ask this question i m going to try and get a party and a part of you perhaps i ll be respectful mike was interviewed recently talking about the tightness in the global oil market i think you said something like i know to put words in his mouth but any weakness in oil prices is going to be fleeting because of the underinvestment and you guys obviously have stepped up your spending from covid levels but you re still well below pre covid levels 16 through 19 let s say with your balance sheet where it is in the depth of opportunities that you obviously have that you re not funding how should we think about your continued commitment to the current capex level or do we see chevron reengage in organic growth at some point pierre breber chief financial officer you should think that there s no change in our guidance there s our 2022 capital is on track it s likely to end up below our 15 billion budget we ve been ramping up during the course of the first half of the year and i think you ll see us higher in the second half of the year but likely end the year below our 15 billion budget our guidance that we shared at our march investor day is 15 billion to 17 billion of organic capital investments through 2026 our budget this year is around 15 billion so we have 2 billion of room to increase activity and investment within the guidance and then as jay just described our major capital project in kazakhstan is winding down it will decrease spending by about 1 billion and that opens up another 1 billion so we have we will increase investment in activity next year i expect that we re doing that work right now we ll share the details in december when it s finalized and approved by the board but we ll increase it within the guidance and that guidance enables us to sustain and grow the upstream business as we ve talked about 3 compounded annual growth rate between now and 2026 add to our refinery capacity we bought a refinery in pasadena texas in 2019 kept all of our u s refineries through covid and are making investment in that pasadena refinery that was just recently fid ed and of course all the activities we re doing to grow new energies we can do all of that within the guidance and as we recognize jay one of the things he deserves a lot of credit for is our upstream business is much more capital efficient than it s ever been and has a mindset of how do we deliver business results with less capital and if we do that there s more free cash flow for shareholders operator thank you we ll take our next question from john royall with j p morgan john royall j p morgan analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question can you talk about your growth in the gulf of mexico in the upstream you re leaning in there with number of brownfield projects so can you just speak broadly on how you view on within your portfolio and how the returns look on those bolt ons relative to your other options globally in the upstream and then what does the service inflation picture look like in that part of your system relative to say the permian jay johnson executive vice president upstream thank you john i ll start this and let pierre add in but we re really quite pleased with the portfolio we maintain in the gulf of mexico it s a good area of exploration for us and it has some of the lowest carbon intensity in the world it s about 6 kilograms of equivalent per barrel produced so on a world scale and even our company scale which is already top quartile it s right at the bottom end of that range so this is a great area to develop for future production and carbon efficiency when we look at the queue of projects we have we ve got the anchor project that is expecting to have first oil in 2024 we ve got whale is coming through we expect in 2024 we ve been expanding our existing facilities we re starting up the waterflood at st malo which is part of the jack st malo complex we ve installed our multiphase pumps and are commissioning those that s going to be an important milestone technologically and our ability to step out further and further we just took fid at ballymore and ballymore is an interesting one because it was a nice size discovery but we could really capitalize and get a much higher return by taking three wells back to a host facility at blind faith and be able to develop that so we re pleased to be able to see that higher return coming from blind faith and it also helps our existing production at blind faith as we continue to work forward i think we re going to see growth in our gulf of mexico production but it s going to be important that we continue to be able to lease and acquire additional acreage in that basin along with others because there s still i think room for continual exploration and tie back to this great chain of infrastructure that we have be able to produce this lower carbon fuel pierre breber chief financial officer only add is our rigs were largely contracted when rates are lower so clearly offshore rigs have increased but we re largely contracted at prior rates thanks john john royall j p morgan analyst thank you yes so on the downstream i just had a question on particularly california just kind of your go forward views there product balance is not quite as tight as they are in other parts of the country but then we re seeing some capacity come out due to rd conversions there and so just looking for maybe your medium term view on refining and california specifically pierre breber chief financial officer on the downstream side we had a strong quarter well good execution reliable operations high refinery utilization and i m talking generally now u s west coast and gulf coast good cost control and we re able to capture the margins in the marketplace we had a slight benefit in the second quarter because the richmond turnaround was deferred so it was a little bit less of an impact than what we had guided to on the first quarter call and timing effects really weren t a driver right timing is more of the absence of timing effects that you saw in terms of these markets they re volatile right now i mean we ve seen margins come off from where they were before in the second quarter we saw a demand response on gasoline probably around the mid single digits across the u s a little bit higher on the west coast a little bit lower in the gulf coast i didn t really see much on the diesel side and jet is really tied to the recovery of travel so we ll just see where the market takes us whether it s west coast or gulf coast we re focused on safe reliable operations continuing to have good cost control and delivering products that our customers are demanding thanks john operator thank you we ll take our next question from jason gabelman with cowen jason gabelman cowen and company analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question i have one on the upstream portfolio and then one on the financials on the upstream can you just talk about your other gas opportunities that you have available in the queue specifically i m thinking about the eastern med i know you re delineating some acreage there and it seems like there s a lot of gas available to exploit and then also i believe you have a haynesville position i m not sure if that s in the money or not that you re looking at and then i ll ask my follow up after thanks jay johnson executive vice president upstream thank you we have a lot of gas opportunities and we ve got a lot of infrastructure to build those opportunities on which is really important because it gives us an advantage from a return standpoint in the eastern med which i ll add is one of the lowest carbon intensity areas from a scope 1 and scope 2 we re at two kilograms of carbon equivalent per barrel produced we have of course supplied a lot of gas into the israeli market and that opportunity continues to grow as coal is displaced we also take that gas into jordan for conversion to electric power and now we re taking it into egypt work and supply both domestic needs in egypt but also potentially access some of the ullage that exists in the lng facilities that are already existing in egypt we re considering floating lng as well as you know there are very benign conditions med ocean conditions in the mediterranean that lend themselves to floating lng so it represents a viable option for us developing additional gas capacity at leviathan and tamar is well within the scope of those projects and would allow us to access these additional marketing opportunities through the lng and the flexibility that provides we continue to have some upside potential in additional fields through eg and then we ve got access as you pointed out in the united states we are ramping up our drilling activity in haynesville and we expect to see rigs there starting later this year they ll be working in that area it was very profitable even at the low prices it s profitable now so again our focus is going to be on discipline on continuing to drive for those efficiencies but we really are excited to get haynesville underway and add that to our portfolio in that part of the country thank you jason gabelman cowen and company analyst great thanks and my follow up is just on the share count i believe it went up again this quarter despite the buyback and it s gone up since the buyback started i think if you back out the shares issued for noble it s been flattish so can you just discuss exactly what s going on there and your expectations for their share count moving forward with the higher buyback but also at a higher share price thanks pierre breber chief financial officer yes the share count is going down and will go down what you see in the earnings press release is a weighted average during the course of the quarter not necessarily the end of the quarter so you ll see in our q that the share count at the end of second quarter is in fact lower than the first quarter which you d expect as we bought back 2 5 billion shares and issued 0 8 the first quarter we had this very large issuance for our employees and retirees exercising stock options and so we started the year with a lower share count issued those for our employee retiree stock options therefore started second quarter at a higher rate and then worked our way down so the math does work it is going down it s you have to look at end of quarter to end of quarter but what you see in terms of earnings per share it s an average over the quarter and it s kind of a quirk that second quarter average was higher than the first quarter but just the nature of the pattern during the quarter share counts are going down thanks jason operator thank you we ll take our next question from manav gupta with credit suisse manav gupta credit suisse analyst thank you guys my first question here is i wanted to take expertise from jay again this was a heavy turnaround quarter for you but even then some of the things where you were turning around were very high margin barrels for you so whether it was tco angola or wheatstone and help us understand like in terms of opportunity cost if this volume was somewhere in the lower margin business versus some of your higher margin business because you re trying to say upstream results were good but they could have been even better because some of the higher margin barrels were actually in a turnaround jay johnson executive vice president upstream i appreciate the question one of the things that s really important to us is that we operate safely and reliably and so we look and we schedule our turnarounds and they re predominantly to ensure asset integrity and ongoing reliable performance and when we schedule those we don t like to shift those because of market conditions and so we tend to want to execute those on time what s important is that we execute them within the time frames that we expected so that our production is in accordance with our planning and both wheatstone and angola lng were done really really well i was proud of our teams they went in they did the turnaround this means now in australia all five trains have been through the first round of turnarounds and so that s an important milestone an important accomplishment this work that we do while it may seem like we re giving up some opportunities in the near term it allows us to continue to drive higher and higher reliability which means our overall production will be higher and our costs will be lower and our safety will be higher and so that s really how we think about this manav gupta credit suisse analyst thank you and i have a quick policy question about a month and a half ago things got a little heated between the oil companies and the white house but as we understand when the actual executive meetings happen between you guys and all the others and the secretary of energy those are pretty cordial and you guys are looking for solutions out there help us understand what happened in the meeting with energy secretary and how did those go pierre breber chief financial officer manav we won t comment on the specifics of our engagements i think you re right that we re it s constructive and productive i ll point out our u s oil and gas production in the first half of the year was up 7 versus last year our u s refined product sales up 10 versus last year the administration wants energy supplies to increase we re doing that our investment globally up 80 first half of the year if you look at the u s more than double when you include reg so chevron is growing energy supply increasing investment and we re engaging constructively with congress and this administration thanks manav operator thank you we ll take our next question from biraj borkhataria with rbc biraj borkhataria rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my questions just one for me on australia i mean there s gas shortages in many geographies in europe in particular but there s been some talk about or noise around that in australia i wanted to understand whether we should expect any export issues at gorgon and wheatstone are you in discussions with the government around proportion of gas going to domestic market versus what s being exported or anything like that so any color would be great thank you jay johnson executive vice president upstream thanks biraj the shortages that you ve heard about in australia are all on the east coast and there are no pipelines connecting the west coast and the east coast so actually the only way that we could supply any gas to the east coast of australia is in the form of lng so we are under long term contract with customers throughout asia we also sell into the spot markets with those facilities we have interest in northwest shelf as well as of course wheatstone and gorgon the western australian market is well supplied it s a part of our agreements for that supply and so there really are no issues i don t see any impact to our export capabilities in australia biraj borkhataria rbc capital markets analyst ok understood and just a follow up on the same topic a couple of years ago i think i had a conversation with pierre around the potential for increasing nameplate capacity at gorgon and wheatstone over time and as you go through the various debottlenecking exercises are you able to provide an update on whether that s still in the works where you are and what kind of time line that would be on if that s possible jay johnson executive vice president upstream yes we continue to focus on incremental capacity increases at both gorgon and wheatstone and that can happen through expansion of debottlenecking where we actually expand the capacity of the facilities but importantly it also happens as we increase the reliability of facilities and their utilization is higher if you just look at this year we ve supplied 87 cargoes as i said that s up 10 on production from last year even with the turnaround that we had so you can see the improvement happening there we have seen capacity increases at both wheatstone and gordon and i would expect those to continue as we move forward operator thank you we ll take our next question from sam margolin with wolfe research sam margolin wolfe research analyst hi good morning jay johnson executive vice president upstream good morning sam margolin wolfe research analyst i wanted to revisit the lng topic and maybe specifically to the permian because there s just a lot of resource in the permian that s not commercial and that s that includes different zones of what you re already developing plus areas that are not on your development calendar in the near term and lng didn t historically help with that because it s expensive but obviously things have changed now and so i just love your perspective on what happens to your permian resource or your overall opportunity there or the duration of it in an environment where you can add some extra capital or even commit to a spread but monetize gas for a double digit price jay johnson executive vice president upstream look i would characterize it what determines our pace of activity in the permian is a balance on what we can accomplish efficiently we have a factory model all the way from land acquisition we do deals all the time to fill in the checkerboards and ensure an efficient development plan as an example just since 2017 we ve executed over 260 transactions that have added 3 500 long laterals that s allowed us to drive for this efficiency and the higher returns our activity levels really aren t determined by how much we can export from the united states all these projects that we have would be economic at much lower prices so it s really not the price that s unlocking the permian it s developing the infrastructure for export from the basin into the markets that we supply both domestic and international so it s all done in a coordinated fashion we do it so we stay within the capability of the organization to execute efficiently and safely and that s really what drives the permian so it s nice to have access to these additional markets and the optionality they provide we have an advantage in working closely with our midstream group who has great capability both again for the domestic offtake and setting up potential for international export but it s really not what i would view as the limiting factor on our pace we determine that based on our overall balance of free cash flow the returns and our resource and reserve replenishment sam margolin wolfe research analyst ok thank you and then i mean maybe just to follow up like are there any ancillary factors that might be a consideration like an opportunity to fit another ccus project on a facility or what it might contribute to like a flaring mitigation effort or anything besides just like you said a price signal jay johnson executive vice president upstream as pierre said earlier the permian actually has very good carbon intensity on a scope 1 and 2 basis we re at 15 kilograms of co2 across the basin we re now benchmarking our facilities and achieving certification of platinum status on most facilities with project canary which then provides independent third party certification of our methane emissions and the performance that we have been talking about we are working with both our chevron technology ventures which is our venture capital arm and our new energies segment on the carbon capture and sequestration and carbon capture in particular is critically important for not just us but the world and so we have three pilots going on at san joaquin valley operations to capture the co2 that s coming off of our cogen units there and then of course we re gaining experience at gorgon and in canada where we learn more and more about what it takes to effectively and efficiently sequester co2 into storage so these are all going on the beauty of having a portfolio like we do is we can put these pilot projects and we can put these demonstration projects wherever it makes the most sense both from a regulatory fiscal and return standpoint and develop these technologies that we re all going to need going forward pierre breber chief financial officer thanks sam operator thank you we ll take our next question from irene himona with societe generale irene himona societe generale analyst thank you good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter i wanted to ask first of all about what you re seeing on the ground in terms of any signs of persistent demand destruction at retail but also at industrial customer level please pierre breber chief financial officer irene i said it very quickly earlier i mean we ve seen i would call it demand response to higher prices that in the second quarter was about in the mid single digits in the u s on gasoline again a little higher on the west coast a little lower on the u s gulf coast and i think we ve seen some recovery since because prices have come off so we ll see where our third quarter ends up on diesel it s very hard to see not price sensitive it s tied to commercial industrial activity maybe a little bit of a response at retail diesel and then jet is largely tied to the recovery in air travel i think people are wanting to get out and see people in places asia where we also have retail is a little more variable because there s been still covid restrictions and so it s hard to kind of see the data i mean what s interesting is there s obviously concerns around the recession in terms of tailwinds we still have very low unemployment and we have a consumer that wants to spend money to go out and do things they haven t been able to do for a couple of years when prices were higher in the second quarter they made some choices and if you look at that demand response on gasoline that s in line or even higher than some past recession so it s not clear i guess what i d say is demand i think will be much more recession resilient going forward just because we ve seen a little bit of that response in the second quarter and again diesel will be tied to underlying commercial activity and i think jet will really depend on if the airlines can get all the flights scheduled and have pilots and all the rest and some of the challenges that have been happening over there so that s a little bit of a sense of the demand we saw a response second quarter seeing some of it come back here early third quarter and we ll just see where it goes from here irene himona societe generale analyst thank you pierre for my follow up and as you mentioned you re launching some new carbon capture projects i wanted to go back to australia and ask if you can possibly talk around the recent performance at the gorgon carbon capture project is utilization improving and is there any read through perhaps on the technical side from that project to the ones you re launching now jay johnson executive vice president upstream thanks irene at gorgon we ve now stored successfully about 6 6 million tons of co2 into that reservoir the ironically the biggest issue we re having currently is just the ability to remove water at a sufficient rate from the storage reservoir to create the space for the co2 to enter we ve already demonstrated the capacity and capability to inject full co2 rates into that reservoir but the water that we re producing has some solids in it and some other contaminants ironically oil and gas because it s an oil and gas basin and we need the surface facilities that can just remove those before that water is injected into a third reservoir these are not new or particularly high technology challenges at all it s what we deal with in everyday life around the world so it s just it s compounded a little bit because gordon sequestration is in a class a nature reserve so it s a very cumbersome process to approve additional facilities and additional wells but these problems are solvable and they do not represent in my view any kind of a restriction on the viability of carbon sequestration as a means of storing co2 for long periods what i would expect is that and we said this before as we learn as we go through this what it s teaching us is that there are uncertainty ranges on any reservoir whether you re producing from it or injecting into it and having sufficient contingencies and mitigation depending on where you find yourself in those uncertainty ranges when you actually put the facility into operation is important and we ll need to keep these in mind as we develop sequestration projects around the world so the science is good the technology works it s just the basic issues that we face on reservoirs around the world that we now need to overcome operator thank you we ll take our next question from paul cheng with scotiabank paul cheng scotiabank analyst hey guys good morning and jay may i add my congratulation and thank you for the help over the years we appreciate it jay johnson executive vice president upstream thanks paul paul cheng scotiabank analyst two questions first you touched on the inflation in different parts of your business but can you give an over or given your footprint can you give us an overall view that what is sure on expectation on the inflation for next year i know it s still early for your budget but are we talking about 10 15 some of your largest suppliers seems to suggest that everything is all used up in terms of manpower and equipment so i don t know whether that you agree with that assessment and if you can tell us that where you see along the supply chain is the biggest maybe pass upon and where that you see the least inflationary pressure so that s the first question the second question on mexico and brazil you guys entered i think a couple of years ago and had some back over there but i haven t heard you guys talk too much about those so where those rank within your portfolio today and what is the next step in those thank you pierre breber chief financial officer thanks paul i ll take the first and then i ll hand it to jay on the second on the onshore u s we ve seen cost inflation this year in the single digits we ve been able to mitigate a part of that through good planning smart procurement and good relationships with suppliers and as jay pointed out we ve been able to also get more efficient with our drilling and completion operations which also partially offsets it outside of the u s we re seeing much more modest inflation and we talked about our gulf of mexico offshore rigs which are contracted at a time when the rig rates were lower as we re looking toward 2023 we re doing that work right now we re confident that we ll be able to secure all the goods and services that were needed for our program again our program will be a higher activity program next year and that includes the permian and we ll share estimates of what we re seeing in terms of cogs inflation when we disclosed our capex budget in december we re just in the middle of that work right now i feel very good that we ll have all the goods and services that we need and we re finalizing our plans jay jay johnson executive vice president upstream yes thanks and paul in terms of mexico and brazil we have not had exploration significant discoveries there we are turning our attention i would say toward egypt where we have a very nice exploration position we re shooting seismic these are in areas that have been unexplored before because they ve been in restricted areas and now available to us as well as in suriname so as we do in exploration we re always going through and looking for the next opportunities but i would say our focus primarily is shifting now toward egypt and suriname thanks for the question operator thank you we ll take our last question from ryan todd with piper sandler ryan todd piper sandler analyst yeah thanks maybe first one on the biofuel side closed both the regi and the bunge deals within that business can you talk a little more about what you re seeing in those markets and whether you can elaborate at all about the broad types of commercial opportunities that you see that you mentioned in your prepared remarks pierre breber chief financial officer thanks ryan we re really excited to welcome reg s people to chevron and cj warner to our board she s already participated in our first board meeting is fantastic has great knowledge of traditional and new energy businesses and it s just a great add to our board as i said we ve had some sort of early wins i won t get into the details of the commercial opportunities but what we saw in the combination the strength that reg has in terms of feedstock acquisition primarily of waste oils and then combining that with our retail and marketing footprint and just bringing two great teams together we re seeing as you d expect one plus one is more than two we ve got our renewable fuels business headquartered in names iowa and we re very excited about it we closed in mid june just a comment on the accounting there were no results in our second quarter results because we chose a convenience day of june 30th so all you ll see and all you saw in our earnings release and you ll see in the q is just the purchase accounting starting in third quarter then we ll see reg in our results reg had a good second quarter margins have been bouncing around but the results are largely in line with expectations and geismar continues on track and same thing with bunge operating two crushers very excited to be part of that invested in jointly which is a crop that won t compete with food so lots of work in this space as we work to get our renewable fuels capability up to 100 000 barrels a day still working still on track to convert a diesel hydrotreater at el segundo to have renewable fuel capability and work across other parts of chevron systems so the combination of reg our bunge joint venture and our own assets along with our customer relationships we re all putting that together to have what we think will be a very successful viable renewable fuels business ryan todd piper sandler analyst thanks pierre maybe the final one for jay congrats on the retirement i wanted to kind of a higher level question on upstream project development and technology and there s been a pretty significant shift over the last five to 10 years and the way that you ve approached project development more standardization oftentimes smaller and more capital efficient style projects ballymore is a great example of this it s lowered the cost of supply a lot especially in the deepwater as you pass the baton and look forward kind of into the next 10 years are there are there things that you can see on the horizon either strategically or technologies that may continue to drive changes in project development and technology that may drive things forward even further whether it s 20 000 kit in the deepwater sort of from flow line improvements and allow longer tiebacks and what could this mean for the future of your resource development portfolio jay johnson executive vice president upstream thanks for the question and it s pretty exciting i mean the one bad thing about retirement is you don t get to be part of the next steps and i m excited about them i would start by just saying i think we ve accomplished a mindset shift in chevron and this is throughout our workforce being very focused on returns not chasing a production target but continuing to run this as a business and thinking about the returns we can get scale is important but it s an outcome of the opportunity set that we have and the investments and capital that we choose to invest getting more focused the factory model has been really important to us and ironically the started where we drilled lots of wells in places like and san joaquin we ve now successfully transferred that into our unconventional plays in permian in the dj in duvernay in argentina and now we re actually taking that factory model into places like the gulf of mexico where we do what we call urban planning and we try and have a steady progression of projects and we re developing the capability for further and further reach i mentioned earlier that jack st malo is now putting into service multiphase pumps and these multiphase pumps sit on the sea floor but they allow us to reach 30 40 and even maybe 50 miles out from a host facility which really gives us great capacity to make even smaller accumulation economic and give us the returns we re looking for while extending the life of these major hubs i think the gulf of mexico will continue to be an important proving ground for some of these technologies that can then be exported around the world so our focus on standardization our focus on minimum viable facilities our focus on capital efficiency over just scale and npv all these together are resulting in and aligning with our technology center so that we continue to develop the technologies that are giving us the returns that we re going to need going forward and with the resource base that we have today and the team of people that we have in our technology groups and in our businesses i m really excited pierre breber chief financial officer hey ryan thanks for that question we will miss jay but his legacy will live on and you ll see it in the performance at the upstream has been delivering and will continue to deliver roderick green general manager investor

this is the final part of a four part article the other parts can be found here part 1 part 2 part 3 vi liberation the substitute proletariat in power when mao s communist party of the proletariat swept into the cities from 1947 1949 this would have been the opportune moment for the substitute proletariat to validate its claim to be the representative of the proletariat by inviting the actual proletariat to become the masters of the country that ccp propaganda claimed they were after abandoning the urban proletariat in 1927 the returning party trumpeted extravagent pro labor rhetoric and widely advertised their new democracy as being under the leadership of the proletariat official pronouncements hailed the workers as the masters of the country guojia de zhuren the leading class lingdao jieji and said that they should rightfully take charge dangjia zuozhu the substitute proletariat confronts the actual proletariat many workers and unions took those pledges seriously thus as mao s armies approached the cities here and there workers rose up against their capitalist bosses and took over their factories a reporter from the trotskyist journal the militant described what happened in april 1949 from a worker just escaped from jinan capital of the shandong province we learn of this horrible incident as the liberating army approached the workers in his factory instinctively understood that it was time to liberate themselves they drove out the boss and set up a factory committee to control production they were immediately visited by a stalinist political worker who demanded to know who was responsible for this action the workers replied that they had decided in common to liberate themselves he then insisted that the committeemen follow him to headquarters there they were chained together and led to a courtyard where they were massacred wholesale by a firing squad the factory was then returned to the frightened owner in another factory where a strike broke out for the simple economic demand of equal treatment the strike was brutally crushed by the stalinists and three strikers stood up before a firing squad in a third case an order was issued to the sun sun textile factory no 9 to dismantle and move to manchuria workers barricaded themselves in the plant to resist troops of the stalinist liberating army were sent to carry out the order a bloody clash ensued in which 10 workers were killed or wounded and three soldiers killed the workers failed to understand that the communist party s revolution was not for the proletariat it was a military conquest and capture of the country of by and for the substitute proletariat new class the communist party the class that led the revolution and seized power in the name of the proletariat was not interested in sharing power least of all with the workers so it took immediate steps to suppress labor militancy while permiting the capitalists to continue running their factories until those were nationalized in 1956 thus in february 1948 as his armies prepared to cross the yellow river mao declared that the party s policy in the newly liberated cities would be devoted to developing production promoting economic prosperity and benefiting both labor and capital as his armies captured the city of luoyang mao telegramed the luoyang front leaders to give them instruction on entering the city do not lightly advance slogans of raising wages and reducing working hours do not be in a hurry to organize people of the city to struggle for democratic reforms and improvements in livelihood before the fall of shanghai tianjin and other cities mao and general zhu de issued a proclamation stating in part it is hoped that workers and employees in all trades will continue to work and that business will operate as usual and obey orders of the pla and people s government in 1949 50 the government issued labor regulations that prohibited strikes and mandated mediation and arbitration by the government controlled labor bureau banning strikes violated the principles and propaganda of the ccp in its first decade the first manifesto of the ccp june 1922 included the demand freedom to strike as did subsequent editions the canton commune of 1927 called for the right to organize and strike but that was when the party was still a majority proletarian party our golden age our age of glory and splendor lies before us the program of the substitute proletariat mao did not think in terms of classes but of nations in his view china was a proletarian nation and he its heroic leader the force that will not stop that cannot be stopped its great savior great helmsman and red sun thus his first priority was to secure the dictatorship of the substitute proletariat construction of the totalitarian police state once the communists seized power they dispensed with the multi class new democracy they had been promising since the 1930s and installed a police state modeled on stalin s replete with military regimentation of the civilian population mass brainwashing secret police forced labor camps mass executions of real and imagined counterrevolutionaries invasive state control over private lives including housing jobs birth control children school curriculums etc and decades of crazed political campaigns one after another to crush all real or imagined opponents and to cow the general population into submission first up elimination of counterrevolutionaries who were those immediately after liberation the entire population were assigned class labels chengfen one of roughly 60 in all based on their family background education occupation prerevolutionary employment prior employment by the gmd or suspected sympathy with the gmd or western imperialists etc this information was noted in the new dossiers also copied from stalin which would follow a person for the rest of his or her life good classes included revolutionary cadres soldiers industrial workers and poor peasants middle dubious classes included petty bourgeois middle peasants and intellectuals bad classes included landlords rich peasants and capitalists but these were shortly collapsed into red vs black revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries what s more the labels were inherited in this way the children and their children have suffered discrimination and worse for the alleged crimes of their parents or grandparents down to this day the purpose of all this was to struggle against the counterrevolutionaries remold those who were salvageable and imprison or kill the rest the struggle against counterrevolutionaries got underway in the rural base areas occupied by the communists as the civil war began in earnest in 1946 mao directed cadres to launch all out class war in the countryside ccp work teams divided villagers into five classes landlords rich peasants middle peasants poor peasants and laborers mirroring stalin s system in the ussr the party determined that at least 10 percent of the rural population were landlords or rich peasants hence class enemies counterrevolutionaries but village realities defied such crude distinctions never mind that there were great regional and even local differences based on climate ecology crop patterns soil fertility proximity to urban centers local custom indebtedness subsidiary industries and other factors that contributed to the economic condition of individual farm families in some provinces such as shanxi shaanxi hebei shandong and henan peasant proprietors constituted two thirds of farm families around the great urban centers in the guangdong delta and yangtze deltas 85 95 percent of the farmers were tenants but most to absentee landlords who resided in the cities and those absentee owners were often collectives clans temples clubs etc rather than individuals so very often there were no landlords in the villages to struggle against in other areas seasonal farmwork was almost all done by hired labor but many laborers were often as not migrants not local villagers liu binyan the future renowned investigative journalist was a young party cadre working in land reform near harbin in 1947 where he both witnessed and participated in atrocities the leader of our team gave orders to tie up a landlord and beat him they tried to force him to confess that he had ties to local bandits and had hidden arms and ammunition the man denied everything and was beaten to a pulp it was the first time i had witnessed such a scene i could not interfere i could only look the other way the landlord was just a miserable wretch who owned about an acre of land but every village had its target of class struggle to arouse class consciousness and that landlord served the purpose he adds i felt quite ashamed i thought it was important to divide the land among the peasants but there were also landowners who had through a lifetime of hard work scrimped and saved to buy up small plots of land there were of course also loafers among the landless peasants none of this mattered to mao or to kang sheng liu shaoqi and deng xiaoping whom he had assigned to oversee the land reform campaigns in different regions kang demanded that every villager take a stand quotas were set for landlords and rich peasants to be found in every village and punished the accused were often dragged out onto a stage where they could be ferociously denounced by crowds of villagers beaten sometimes gruesomely tortured and often killed in struggle sessions xi zhongxun father of xi jingping reported the cruelties to mao in january 1948 people are drowned in vats of salt water some have boiling oil poured over their heads and burn to death liu shaoqi reported that when the masses fight they beat torture and kill people and right now it is out of control people were buried alive dismembered shot and strangled to death sometimes their bodies were hung from trees land reform turned into an orgy of violence across the countryside in preparing to launch land reform in the south in june 1950 mao declared that land reform is war the most hideous class war between peasants and landlords it is a battle to the death the party proceeded accordingly the reign of terror against local leaders in the south was accompanied by onerous grain requisitions that incited mass protests and rebellions against the communists famished peasants stormed government warehouses and transport boats to retrieve their grain some seized arms from local police hundreds of villages turned against the government by march 1950 internal documents reported that dozens of relatively large rebellions of a mass character had rocked hubei the rebellions were crushed with extensive loss of lives why all this violence and killings after all as frank dikötter points out land reform was carried out peacefully in post war japan south korea and even taiwan under chiang kai shek and no blood was shed in taiwan large landlords were compensated by the government with commodity certificates and stocks in state owned industries for their farms which were redistributed to the tillers land reform in north china had been carried out in the midst of civil war so some violence might have been expected but in the south where the campaign did not begin until june 1950 the war was over and yet mao s campaign was if anything even more violent even stalin who himself had massacred the kulaks in 1928 and sent two million to siberia cautioned mao in 1950 to pull back limit the struggle to landlords only and leave the economy of the rich peasants intact to help china s post war recovery mao wasn t listening dikötter argues that mao wanted traditional village leaders overthrown so that nothing would stand between the people and the party unlike the soviet union where the security organs had liquidated the kulaks mao wanted the villagers to do the job themselves by pitting a majority against a minority only by implicating the people in murder could they become permanently linked to the party everybody was to have blood on their hands through participation in mass rallies and denunciation meetings between 1947 and 1952 when land reform was shut down an estimated 1 5 2 million rural chinese had been killed the terror crushed open resistance but depressed agricultural production engineering human souls mao launched the first of his many terror campaigns in the cities with the thought reform campaign launched in october 1950 to wash the brains of the entire population the campaign began with the intellectuals first because of their suspect bourgeois and petty bourgeois backgrounds and their role in education culture and social development the party applied the same methods as in yan an teachers professors students scientists journalists and writers were all forced to submit to intensive indoctrination classes public examination of family histories self criticism confessions and self abasement to induce guilt and remorse until all resistance was crushed until they felt as if they were reborn and sincerely expressed their gratitude to the party for their redemption students were encouraged to draw a line between themselves and their parents for thousands the only way out was suicide student suicides happen incessantly internal documents reported in 1950 hu sidu son of hu shi a liberal leading light of the may fourth movement denounced his father calling him a public enemy of the people and an enemy of myself in 1957 hu sidu himself was labeled a rightist and driven to suicide the government hounded and persecuted non communist teachers artists and musicians even those who had been sympathetic to the party those who only had their careers destroyed got off easy hundreds of thousands were publicly denounced imprisoned and sent to labor camps teachers were arrested and killed professors committed suicide chinese and western books were incinerated dikötter writes that with the literary inquisition came a great burning of books in shanghai some 237 tons of books were reportedly destroyed in 1951 in the former treaty port shantou in may 1953 a giant bonfire lasting three days consumed 300 000 volumes representing vestiges of the feudal past western classical music was suppressed jazz was banned outright as degenerate decadent popular music was replaced with the hymn to chairman mao the favors of the communist party are too many to be told brother and sister plough the wasteland and similar hit tunes in the great terror of 1951 buddhism taoism catholicism protestantism and islam were suppressed monks beaten killed sent to reeducation camps and their books and institutions destroyed china s gulags chiang kai shek s china had nowhere near enough prisons to meet mao s needs so in the late nineteen forties and early fifties the government built new ones and established its own gulag archipelago of laodong gaizao or reform through labor camps laogai for short modeled on stalin s gulags there were somewhere between a thousand and fifteen hundred of them situated in every province millions were interned and put to forced labor in road building mining reservoir excavation and opening up new farmlands many were simply worked to death as the government explained except for those who must be exterminated physically due to political considerations human beings must be utilized as a productive force with submissiveness as the prerequisite laogai units force prisoners to labor the laogai s fundamental policy is forced labor is the means while thought reform is the basic aim unsurprisingly mao professed enthusiasm for the economic advantages of slave labor and called for more laogai the large number of people who are serving their sentences is an enormous source of labor they should be expanded wang bing s eight hour long film dead souls walks the viewer through former prison camp fields in gansu province turning over the exposed bleached bones and skulls of dead inmates and interviews dozens of elderly survivors of the more than a half million chinese intellectuals teachers critically thinking cadres and anyone deemed to have an independent mind who were imprisoned in the anti rightist campaign of 1957 most starving to death west north korea life outside the gulags in china in the 1950s was somewhat freer but day to day repression was intense every aspect of one s personal and work life was soon regulated by the state as capitalist enterprises were taken over all jobs were assigned by the government living quarters were likewise assigned free mobility was abolished as workers were tied their work units danwei which also provided housing food rations schooling medical care and so forth peasants were yoked to their farms by the hukou system that tied access to their food and clothing rations schooling medical care and so on to the farmer s place of residence the government nationalized all schools and colleges imposed its own maoist curriculum compulsory political education was introduced in all work units schools and government offices newspapers and other media were replaced with thought control and propaganda loudspeakers were installed indoors and out across the country to blast out orders propaganda and patriotic music work life and even leisure were regimented and militarized political meetings consumed so much time that teachers workers and staff suffered from extreme fatigue thought reform campaigns encouraged colleagues to denounce each other children to denounce their parents parents to denounce each other other family members and friends thus the shanghai liberation daily of june 22 1954 praised workers who reported suspicious acts amongst friends this shows that the political consciousness of the masses is being continuously raised the despised criticism self criticism sessions were extended to workplaces to deflect criticism from the government itself and instill fear and docility before the police state shortly after liberation mao announced his latest brilliant correct idea every mouth comes with two hands in other words the more people the more labor power the faster the economy will grow so the government s natalist policy banned abortion and by 1952 contraceptive devices disappeared from the market predictably the population exploded nearly doubling in a decade while industrial and agricultural productivity plummeted presenting deng xiaoping with the need in 1981 to come up with some new correct ideas capitalism plus forced abortions and the one child policy in short liberation turned the country into the largest open air minimum security prison camp on earth sprinkled with gulags where millions languished in far worse conditions think north korea which kim il sung modeled after mao s china that s what mao s china looked like as the bamboo curtain was drawn around the country in the early fifties its borders were sealed in mao s day the only way to get out of china was to swim to hong kong take a row boat or a secret trail in the 1950s and 60s more than million refugees did just that today after a few decades of comparative relaxation retro maoist xi jinping has revived the lockdown nation as well as systematic invasive police state control and manipulation of every aspect of chinese lives again weibo critics call xi s china west north korea xi s repression is driving another generation of chinese at least those with means to flee the country again they call this runxue or run philosophy researching how to run away from china many of those who can t find a way to escape describe themselves as the last generation because they re refusing to have children one weibo user under the hashtag thelastgeneration says not bringing children to this country this land will be the most charitable deed i could manage self reliant development by means of accumulation and its consequences mao s second priority was to industrialize china and overtake the us he was motivated to pursue this goal for two reasons first national chauvinism mao sought to surpass the west to reclaim china s rightful place as the premier civilization and culture of world history the natural leader of the world while winning ever lasting glory for the communist party regardless of the costs to china s masses speaking to the preparatory meeting for the ccp s eighth party congress 1956 58 mao said we are going to catch up with to the strongest capitalist nation on earth america america has 170 million people we have several times that number plentiful resources and a similar climate catching up is possible should we catch up of course we should or else what are you 600 million people doing are you asleep should you be sleeping or working if you can t catch up you don t deserve any glory and you don t deserve to be called mighty if in 50 or 60 years you still can t catch up with america what s the matter with you you deserve to have your membership in the human race revoked second imperialism mao and the party aimed not merely to industrialize but to do so as self sufficiently as possible to some extent self sufficiency was imposed on them by the trade blockade imposed by the united states in 1950 but it was also the preferred option for mao as with stalin and for the same reason china and russia were communist nations in a sea of global capitalism to maintain their independence and prevent the capitalists from taking over their economies they needed to be as self reliant as possible that s why mao pursued a near autarkic development strategy that s why deng xiaoping invited western investors to modernize his economy but limited their investments to certain sectors and banned them from the commanding heights of the economy further mao and stalin both understood that ultimately their only guarantee of security was to achieve economic and military superiority over the united states when the soviets lost their economic and arms race against the united states in the 1980s the soviet communist party collapsed in december 1991 and the soviet union disintegrated deng and his successors notably xi jinping have been determined to avoid that error that s why xi is suppressing the private sector pushing back against western demands to open new sectors for western investment and even driving many western companies out of china the bolsheviks understood that however fortunate their success in seizing power in 1917 they could not build socialism in largely pre industrial russia without massively exploiting the russian workers and peasants to extract the surpluses to pay for industrialization as the capitalists had exploited the proletariat of england and slaves of the colonies to accumulate the capital to industrialize england that s why they tried to help the german revolution in hopes that a socialist revolution in germany would enable them to hitch the russian train to the german locomotive as trotsky put it we place all our hopes upon the revolution igniting the european revolution if the rising of the peoples of europe does not crush imperialism we will be crushed that is certain when the european revolutions failed the bolsheviks were not overthrown but they were thrown back on their own resources with fatal consequences for millions of russian peasants whether such an internationalist strategy was feasible in the immediate post wwii era is an open question in fact the great wave of post war anti colonial revolutions was only then just beginning so who knows yet even if the prospects for world revolution were slim at that moment mao s party could have sat down with china s workers and peasants and put the question to them should we pursue high speed economic development that will necessitate great sacrifices from you probably for many decades in order to furnish the surpluses to underwrite high speed industrialization or should we pursue a bukharinist new economic policy nep strategy of development with tolerance for markets that would give us some growth while enabling you to avoid undue exploitation and gradually improve your living standards but the great savior dictator was a nationalist fiercely hostile to democracy as we ve seen and vaingloriously ambitious the great teacher also knew little about economics worse he ignored and criticized his own economic team of bo yibo chen yun li fuchun and deng zihui who knew something about economics and urged him to slow the pace of economic growth and adopt a kind of bukharinist nep even joe stalin warned him in september 1952 not to be rash but mao was having none of it he was philosophically an idealist and a voluntarist on june 15 1953 he told the politburo that the general line of the party for the transition period is basically to accomplish the industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce in ten to fifteen years or a little longer do not depart from this general line otherwise left or right mistakes will occur as always mao was full of himself and confident that he alone voiced the correct line but his idealist voluntarist fantasies could not overrule reality self industrialization could only be based on systematic ruthless and long term exploitation of china s workers and peasants as stalin had done in russia despite the strong strategic differences with stalin the ccp had nowhere else to turn and so looked to the soviet union for aid and modeled its own industrialization strategy after the russians industrial expansion had been predicated on three sources of finance soviet aid self accumulation out of industry and taxation of agriculture as it turned out soviet credits and technical assistance while critical to certain key industrial projects were far less than expected and they were loans not grants china s industrial sector provided roughly 50 of the state s budget revenues in those years but the industrial base was tiny so it alone could not provide much consequently mao s strategy of industrialization depended crucially on accelerating agricultural output over and above population growth and taxing the surpluses to support industry peasants resist surplus extraction those expected agricultural surpluses failed to materialize in the first place the extremely low productivity of chinese agriculture meant that by and large the massive surpluses needed for industrialization did not exist in the chinese countryside for example chinese per capita grain production in 1952 stood at less than half that of the soviets in 1928 220 vs 480 kilograms per annum this meant that there could be no question in china of a purely extractive solution to the grain crisis the party could not simply go and seize huge surpluses from rich peasants as stalin did in russia from 1928 secondly the new government lacked the industrial capacity to supply tractors and other industrial inputs to boost productivity thirdly it faced peasant resistance to state surplus extraction in short with respect to the peasantry the state was caught in a double bind it aimed to be developmental and extractive at once to industrialize to build steel plants to produce tractors and other machinery the state needed both to maximize agricultural output to skim off surpluses from agriculture to support industry and an industrial labor force so agricultural collectivization had a two fold aim to boost output through cooperative and economies of scale and to centralize surplus extraction by preventing peasant hoarding but taking away the peasants surpluses not only undermined their capacity to reinvest to expand output it threatened their very subsistence a policy that demanded sacrifices with little hope of gain in the near future would tend to provoke their resistance consequently each attempt by the state to step up taxation and collectivization was met the peasant opposition the first five year plan set targets for increased grain output of up to 6 5 per year 1953 57 but far from providing a surplus actual growth rates of around 1 7 to 2 0 barely kept pace with population growth similarly cotton production declined by 9 3 in 1954 low government set prices for these staples meant that the peasants had little incentive to produce them thus they tended to cut back on production and conserve their surpluses the output of farm subsidiary industries also stagnated or fell the government reported that between july 1954 and july 1956 17 million pigs were lost again the peasants preferred to slaughter their pigs rather than market them at low prices or turn them over to the collectives by the mid 1950 s the situation had reached crisis proportions there were increasingly sharp grain crises in 1953 1955 and 1956 resulting in widespread food shortages in the cities the lack of agricultural raw materials brought some industries such as textiles to a virtual standstill and undermined accumulation yet instead of backing off mao s response at every point was to accelerate collectivization to squeeze more surpluses out of the peasants during the 1950 s the state sponsored a series of so called socialist upsurges the 1950 52 land reform the 1952 53 mutual aid campaign the 1954 55 cooperativization campaign and the 1955 56 collectivization drive to each the peasants responded by cutting production slaughtering or neglecting their livestock felling orchards stopping fertilizer collection and fleeing the land for the cities each advance and the reaction forced the state to retreat at least partially and temporarily but with each next stage mao wrenched the screws tighter during the second phase in november 1953 the government imposed a state monopoly on grain to confiscate peasant surpluses whereas previously farmers could sell their surpluses on the market and pocket the profits under the new unified purchase and sale system farmers were allowed to consume only 13 16 kilos per head per month of their own grain a bit over half the required amount to provide 1 700 to 1 900 calories per day i e a less than subsistence diet in response across the country peasants protested shouting down with mao zedong eliminate the people s liberation army better rebel than die from starvation the state responded as usual with more violence in 1954 the government was taking more food from the peasants than ever before and as a result famine gripped large parts of the countryside and it was reported that desperate peasants were selling their children in january 1954 the central committee warned that peasants were being driven to starvation farmers were destroying their tools felling trees and slaughtering their livestock some openly rebelled as pitched battles were fought between villagers and the security forces in the early months of 1955 deng zihui then regional boss of south china who had calculated that the peasants had a third less food than before liberation starting letting some co operatives disband others in the leadership including deng xiaoping supported this relaxation mao initially acquiesced to this setback but soon renewed his attacks on negative attitudes toward collectivization in may he declared that middle peasant claims of hardship are all fake a common response to collectivization was to flee to the cities and in 1954 farmers were fleeing the countryside en masse but in june 1955 the maoists cut off that exit by extending the household registration system used in the cities since 1951 to the countryside on top of that food was rationed from 1955 and without a ration card which was valid only in one s official place of residence peasants who fled to the cities were denied food rations that effectively tied china s 120 million farm families to their land virtually as state serfs just as urban residence permits tied the workers to their danwei this was the fourth stage of collectivization in july mao pushed back at deng zili and deng xiaoping and called for a new campaign to accelerate the transition to socialism in just three years in prose reminiscent of his 1926 investigation in hunan he told the central committee a hurricane in the new socialist mass movement will soon sweep across the villages throughout the country but some of our comrades are tottering along like a woman with bound feet constantly complaining about the others too fast too fast no this is not the correct policy it is a wrong policy again the great helmsman insisted that he alone had the correct policy but 1957 was not 1927 in the mighty storm of the nineteen twenties the peasants were overthrowing their landlords and seizing the lands they farmed to improve their lot whereas in the 1950s mao s hurricane aimed to dispossess them expropriate the private property they had been granted by the same mao zedong in the land reforms of 1947 52 and collectivize not only their land but their means of production and even their housing despite his rhetoric mao knew very well that the peasants would not accept this dispossession voluntarily collectivization would thus require a new war this time against the peasants instead of landlords on august 15 1955 speaking before the assembled heads of all provinces and large cities mao condemned deng zihui s order to slow the pace of collectivization reiterating that a tottering pace in collectivization suits the rich peasants it conforms to the capitalist road socialism must have a dictatorship it will not work without it this is a war we are opening fire on peasants with private property counterrevolutionaries who should be sent to labour camps workers and economism peasant resistance to state surplus extraction was paralleled by productivity problems in industry and growing discontent from china s industrial workforce the development of workers opposition can be understood in terms of the revolution s failure to develop institutions of workers self rule in contrast to the revolution of 1925 27 when workers strike committees embryonic soviets took control of canton shanghai and other cities mao s government imposed a top down hierarchical factory management structure and absolute party dictatorship over society and the economy workers were shut out of decision making about economic policies how much for accumulation how much for improved living standards etc with no say in wages or conditions workers had little incentive to contribute thus the party sought to boost productivity by imposing harsh labor discipline and material incentives after banning independent unions and imposing compulsory arbitration rigid state labor codes enforced discipline with severe penalties for infractions a system of police records or labor books was instituted to restrict mobility and job entry and to prevent organized opposition whereas in the 1920 s the principal demands of the communist party had been the abolition of piecework and the institution of the eight hour day in the early 1950 s workdays were lengthened vacations cut and piecework expanded to one third of the workforce in 1952 and 42 by 1956 the state imposed speedups including shockwork campaigns and instituted sharply graded wage scales in state owned and private enterprises workers resisted actively and passively from the early 1950 s the chinese press complained repeatedly about slackened labor discipline chronic absenteeism go slow strikes and counter revolutionary sabotage in the factories and mines these escalated into widespread strike waves in 1955 57 workers who protested the speedup productivity drives or low wages were attacked by the party leadership for economism and syndicalism and told that they spoke merely from the standpoint of individual welfare and did not sufficiently recognize that the state must accumulate capital to strengthen its defense and develop its industry cadres and corruption from serving the people to serving themselves finally by the mid 1950 s mao s socialist construction project was running into difficulties from a third quarter from a loss of communist consciousness a loss of commitment to self discipline and self denial by the party cadre itself as mao complained in january 1957 they vie with each other not in plain living doing more work and having fewer comforts but for luxuries rank and status they scramble for fame and fortune and are interested only in personal gain such bourgeois tendencies also undermined production as he observed our experience is that the lordly behavior of the cadres makes workers unwilling to consciously observe and implement labour discipline cadre self interest and careerism also led to mismanagement of the economy the press complained constantly that many factory and mining managers and provincial cadre put their own interests above the needs of the state and the people sabotaging national planning and accumulation by resisting higher output quotas hoarding funds and supplies and feeding misinformation to the leadership back in the yan an days of war communism there were few possibilities for cadre self enrichment but given their monopoly of political power once the substitute proletariat assumed state power and gained control of the whole economy the cadres had access to the receipts from industry commerce and agricultural taxation after years of plain living and hard struggle they were looking to relax and consume arguably after decades of hardship and privation they were perhaps entitled to some improvements but in the midst of the poverty of china s masses they had in mao s words gone to heaven vii politics in command with the transition to socialism in jeopardy mao reasserted his youthful voluntarist faith in subjective consciousness mind over matter and the will of dedicated people to move mountains if china s masses could win the revolution against overwhelming material odds they could build both socialism and its prerequisites simultaneously flattered by the great success of the collectivization drive of 1955 56 as reported by his terrified underlings the great teacher penned fatuous revisions of marxism and gave himself up to delusions of imminent communist utopia not only was marx wrong but even lenin lenin said the more backward the country the more difficult its transition from capitalism to socialism now it seems that this way of speaking is incorrect as a matter of fact the more backward the economy the easier not the more difficult the transition from capitalism to socialism in his most delusional tract the russian populist inspired poor and blank essay published in june 1958 he explicitly rejected materialism and affirmed his messianic voluntarism in stark terms china s 600 million people have two remarkable peculiarities they are first of all poor and secondly blank that may seem like a bad thing but it is really a good thing poor people want change want to do things want revolution a clean sheet of paper has no blotches and so the newest and most beautiful pictures can be painted on it barracks communism and the militarization of labor what a fine model of barracks communism everything is here communal dining halls communal sleeping quarters accountants and offices regulating education production consumption in a word all social activity and at the head of everything stands ᴏᴜʀ ᴄᴏᴍᴍɪᴛᴛᴇᴇ nameless and unknown as supreme leader this is indeed the purest anti authoritarianism karl marx in the fall of winter of 1957 58 mao launched the great leap forward in a superhuman effort to break through the impasse and hurl the country into modernity in the space of a few years of intense exertion with mass mobilization intense effort and proletarian leadership mao asserted china could catch up with the industrialized countries in 15 years our revolutions are like battles after a victory we must at once put forward a new task and the new task was now the transition from socialism to communism on the promise of imminent abundance cadres herded hundreds of millions of peasants into huge communes designed to maximize labor and minimize consumption whereas in 1950 52 men put in about 119 and women about 70 full time labor days in agricultural field work per year excluding domestic labor and private plot sideline activities in 1958 59 some communes were requiring more than 330 days from men and 300 days for women on the promise that the commune free supply system would guarantee housing free meals in public mess halls provide nurseries and happiness homes for the aged peasants were required to turn over to the common ownership of the commune all privately owned plots of farmland and house sites and other means of production such as livestock tree holdings etc it was said that he adoption of the combined system of grain or meals supply and wage payment marks the beginning of the gradual transition to the stage of from each according to his ability to each according to his needs it ensures that everyone in the commune can equally eat his or her fill a great liberation no doubt but how could the peasants consumption increase when the whole point of the free supply system was to maximize accumulation at the expense of consumption as the people s daily of august 18 1958 described it grain can be saved on a planned basis everyone in the mess halls has a plan for grain consumption which is less for example yin fu yuan and his family formerly consumed eight catties and two taels of grain per day now in the mess hall they consume only seven catties consumption of firewood is also reduced enormous battalions of peasants were sent into the fields and engaged in round the clock shock work in a monumental effort to turn labor into capital the press reported that tens and hundreds of thousands of peasants fight for every single minute or second regardless of night or day rain or shine in hebei some 150 000 commune members continued working even on windy and snowy days eating and sleeping right in the field in henan people fought day and night shifting all the activities of life eating sleeping office conference and even nursery to the field in the battle for iron and steel peasants and workers in kirin province fought round the clock eating and sleeping beside the furnaces and in beijing too workers moved their bedding into the shops during the latter half of 1958 under the slogan not to leave the forefront before accomplishing the task and not to leave even when slightly wounded and so on as a henan party secretary described it the peasants were not equal to beasts of burden in the past but are the same as beasts of burden today yellow oxen are tied up in the house and human beings are harnessed in the field girls and women pull plows and harrows with their womb hanging down cooperation is transformed into the exploitation of human strength revolution is not a dinner party it was the same story in industry the abolition of piecework wage differentials material incentives and the like was in principle a step closer to communism as the people s daily editorialized on november 13 1958 during the great leap forward movement workers voluntarily abolish the piecework system and the extra pay for extra work system people now work not eight hours but ten hours even twelve hours if work requires they work throughout the night each one is not working for himself but for the whole nation and the future this kind of enthusiasm breaks down capitalist principles the remuneration system and the strife for personal gains it gives a big lift to the communist spirit the policy of the state was to hire five workers on three workers wages excessive increase in consumption and elevation of the wage level will run counter to the demand of the chinese people for fulfilling the prescribed historical task a ministry spokesman commented hence the necessity for austerity when did china s workers and peasants demand austerity demand to work throughout the night and on reduced rations who decided they should work themselves to death to fulfill mao s historical task of overtaking the united states in 15 years the ministry spokesman didn t say without modern industrial inputs the overdriving of people machinery and the land brought the economy to the brink of collapse by the spring of 1959 as grain ran out communal kitchens shut down people were forced to eat grass tree bark even each other cannibalism became widespread yet even as peasants starved cadres continued routinely to eat more than their share while people starved around them filling their own bellies gave them the strength to beat thousands of peasants to death in anti hoarding campaigns suicides soared when i read the horrific testimonies and official government reports quoted in jasper becker s hungry ghosts yang jisheng s tombstone and frank dikötter s mao s great famine even cynical as i am i can t understand how party cadres who fancied themselves communist revolutionaries could be so cruel savage and inhuman toward helpless people under their control during the great leap forward deliberately starving prisoners to save grain to add to already overfilled party cadre grainaries savagely beating starving peasants even skinning them alive for the crime of slaughtering livestock after the canteens ran out of grain burying people alive and deliberately freezing them to death smashing cooking pots in every household to prevent them from being used at home to cook grass soup and worse becker chapter 8 i could understand if this were genghis khan or medieval catholic inquisitors but communists yet this is what the substitute proletariat morphed into and not only in china in the end mao got neither accumulation nor communism he got economic collapse horrific famine and unparalleled barbarism somewhere between 30 and 50 million peasants starved to death between 1958 and 1962 either way by far the largest famine in history millions more perished in his gulags untold numbers committed suicide the great leap backward was mao s penultimate correct idea his ultimate correct idea the great proletarian cultural revolution aka ten years of madness took another two million lives witnessed even more extreme tortures even party condoned cannibalism in the name of class struggle wrecked the economy the country and permanently traumatized the entire population instead of overtaking the west china fell more decades behind deng xiaoping came up with new correct ideas first sell the 16 hour day labor of hundreds of millions of police state enforced union free epa free osha free niosh free civil rights free helpless and vulnerable migrant chinese workers to the western capitalists at the world s lowest wages the china price in order to squeeze surpluses out of them to modernize china s industry and catch up with the west second marketize ccp power so that communists beginning with his own children could get rich first third impose his one child policy with forced abortions fourth lock up democracy wall protestors wei jinsheng and others to stop the calls for a fifth modernization democracy fifth shoot the tiananmen protestors en masse and run them over with tanks à la stalin in hungary today retro maoist xi jinping has his own correct ideas enslave xinjiang muslims and tibetan buddhists in prison factories and erase their cultures and languages crush the hong kong democracy movement obliterate or partyize islam christianity and buddhism crush the private economy drive out western foreign liberal cultural influences in universities and society and lock up the entire populations of shanghai and other cities for months on end rather than accept the humiliation that his china made covid vaccines don t work very well and import vaccines that do work from the evil west but far and away his most catastrophic correct idea is his china dream plan to drive his economy at 6 8 per year until china overtakes the united states to become the world s leading superpower even if this requires burning enough coal oil and gas to doom life on earth in october 2019 climate scientists published research predicting that on present trends global warming is going to all but erase shanghai shenzhen and most of the world s great coastal cities by 2050 barely 28 years from now there won t be any great rejuvenation any golden age of glory and splendor for the communist party when china s glaciers evaporate when its rivers dry up when farming collapses across the north china plain when its coastal cities are flooded there will be industrial collapse ecological collapse famine and untold human suffering so much for the proletarian attitudes and values of the substitute proletariat little wonder that maoists like the monthly review editors and the qiao collecitve refuse to discuss the nature of china even a cursory review of the historical evidence debunks their delusionary maoist theory it s past time to bury maoism bury fidelismo bury all third worldist illusions in savior dictator substitute proletariats and reassert the primacy of the working class and the indispensability of mass democracy socialism is not about skyscrapers high speed trains blingfrastructure or xi s phony common prosperity let alone the crude barracks communism of mao zedong

house passes bill to ban assault weapons washington the house on friday passed a bill to ban assault weapons securing a significant victory for democrats following a spate of mass shootings across the country and marking the first time lawmakers have approved a prohibition on the popular firearms in more than two decades the legislation titled the assault weapons ban of 2022 cleared the chamber in a 217 213 vote speaker nancy pelosi d calif announced friday morning that the house would take up the legislation that afternoon scheduling the last minute vote days after she said the chamber would punt consideration of the legislation to next month democrats had planned to move the assault weapons ban with community safety legislation under one rule but ultimately decided to consider them separately after some liberals voiced concerns about a lack of accountability in the police measures the assault weapons ban legislation led by rep david cicilline d r i and co sponsored by 207 voting democrats specifically calls for prohibiting the sale manufacture transfer or import of various semiautomatic assault weapons semiautomatic pistols and semiautomatic shotguns depending on their features for example all semi automatic rifles that can accept detachable magazines and have a pistol grip a forward grip a grenade launcher a barrel shroud a threaded barrel or a folding telescoping or detachable stock are subject to the ban semiautomatic assault rifles with fixed magazines that can accept more than 15 rounds are subject to the ban would also be prohibited under the legislation except those with an attached tubular device that can only hold 22 caliber rimfire ammunition though it received bipartisan support in the house the legislation has little chance of progressing in the senate because of widespread republican opposition still house democrats had pressed leadership for the chance to vote on the measure to send a message that they are fighting for an issue that has increased in popularity in recent years former president clinton enacted an assault weapons ban in 1994 but it expired 10 years later and democrats have not had the support to pass another measure of its kind since the vote on an assault weapons ban is the latest firearm related legislation the house has passed following a string of mass shootings that have plagued the country last month the house and senate both cleared a gun safety bill in a bipartisan manner which president biden signed into law the measure enhanced background checks for gun purchasers ages 18 to 21 and established a federal offense for individuals obtaining firearms through straw purchases or trafficking among other provisions the bill marked the first time in almost three decades that congress had approved significant legislation to combat gun violence source the hill story date july 31 2022

by doug sandler cfa head of global strategy summary inflation concerns are driving markets and we are watching five data points for signs of improvement while a recession is likely we believe it will be mild due to consumer and business financial stability thus far the secular bull market that began in 2009 remains intact and may proceed in a similar fashion to the 1956 1966 period we are proud to release our july 2022 chart pack our visual quarterly designed to walk investors through our views on what s happening and why predictions about what may come next and positioning in our riverfront

the fed s response took center stage markets now fear inflation and recession the first quarter of 2022 was challenging for investors and the second quarter was no different at riverfront we believe maintaining a focus on long term plans is critical in these market environments investors that step out of the market or deviate too far from their long term plans could lose money we believe that our ability to make tactical shifts in positioning will be valuable as the market generally over reacts as it processes rate increases and federal reserve fed actions inflation signs of clouds clearing

washington the u s house of representatives on friday passed a ban on semi automatic firearms the weapons used in multiple mass shootings during the last three months on a near party line vote with the 217 213 vote the bill h r 1808 will head to the evenly divided senate but it s unlikely to advance there as the ban would need all democrats on board plus 10 republicans to get past a filibuster sen chuck schumer the senate majority leader has not announced if he plans to bring the weapons ban to the floor for a vote each year more children die from gun violence than any other cause house speaker nancy pelosi said on the house floor our nation has watched unspeakable horror as assault weapons have been used in massacre after massacre all but five democrats backed the ban only two republicans voted in favor brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania and chris jacobs of new york the five democrats that split with their party and opposed the ban were reps jared golden of maine kurt schrader of oregon ron kind of wisconsin and henry cuellar and vicente gonzalez of texas the push for banning semi automatic firearms came after they were used in mass shootings in uvalde texas where 19 children and two teachers were murdered and in buffalo new york where a white supremacist murdered 10 black people at a grocery store a semi automatic weapon also was used in a july fourth shooting in highland park illinois where seven people were killed the sponsor of the bill rep david cicilline a rhode island democrat said that movie theaters places of worship schools hospitals and grocery stores have become bloody battlefield scenes these weapons have no place in our communities he said there are more mass shootings than days in the year this is a uniquely american problem this year alone there have been 372 mass shootings according to the gun violence archive police funding bills the assault weapons ban was originally set to be passed alongside several bills that would provide funding for local police departments but progressive democrats raised concerns and pushed for more accountability measures in the police legislation i have heard from the civil rights community and i have strong concerns with two policing bills we may consider this week rep andy levin a michigan democrat wrote on twitter we should not advance them unless they include robust accountability oversight provisions in line with those in the george floyd justice in policing act rep josh gottheimer a new jersey democrat is the lead sponsor of a bill that would authorize a 50 million grant each year for a justice department program to assist small local police departments another bill would reauthorize a grant program to hire and increase the pay of local police rep val demings a florida democrat and former orlando police chief who is running for republican sen marco rubio s senate seat sponsored a bill to provide 100 million per year in grants to help police agencies solve violent crimes the initiatives come as democratic leadership has tried to push back on being seen as a party that wants to defund the police a slogan many members have disavowed as well as biden republicans have been branding democrats as not supportive enough of police in advance of the midterm elections during a weekly press conference friday pelosi speaking to the concerns of progressives said the police bill was not funding without accountability on the house floor she said that after the august recess democrats will pass the police and public safety set of bills weapons ban the u s house judiciary committee passed the weapons ban out of its committee last week on a party line vote the bill bans all semi automatic rifles that can have a detachable magazine and have a military feature such as a pistol grip and a detachable stock or grenade launcher among other features it also bans all semi automatic rifles that have a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds the bill if enacted into law would not ban current semi automatic weapons that people own meaning current firearm owners would have their weapons grandfathered in house republicans opposing the bill argued that the bill would take away semi automatic weapons from current owners but democrats said that is not correct because they would be covered under the grandfather clause during debate on the house floor rep guy reschenthaler a pennsylvania republican said the bill was unconstitutional calling it a gun grab law abiding americans use firearms every day he said rep deborah ross a north carolina democrat denied that people would lose their guns as many republicans continued to say it simply prevents future sales of assault rifles she said adding that the weapons are not designed for recreation they re designed for combat rep jim jordan an ohio republican also accused democrats of coming for your guns white house support the white house issued a statement on friday in support of the bill 40 000 americans die from gunshot wounds every year and guns have become the top killer of children in the united states according to the statement as president biden has repeatedly called for we must do more to stop this gun violence and save lives house democrats have held numerous hearings about gun violence in america most recently this week when house oversight and reform investigated the profits that gun manufacturers made off semiautomatic weapons ceos from two gun manufacturers stated at the hearing that they played no role in mass shootings that used their products the passage of the bill follows another gun related bill that biden signed into law in late june following the mass shootings in texas and new york that bill the bipartisan safer communities act consists of eight provisions that bill provides 750 million for states to enact red flag laws which allow the courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others among other provisions provides a historic 11 billion in mental health services for schools and families and requires those under 21 who want to purchase a firearm to undergo a background check that takes into account a review of juvenile and mental health records among other things when biden was a member of the senate he backed a 10 year ban on assault weapons that was passed in 1994 but it lapsed a decade later and congress never renewed it research from a group of injury epidemiologists and trauma surgeons has shown that between 2004 and 2017 the last year of our analysis the average number of yearly deaths attributed to mass shootings was 25 compared with 5 3 during the 10 year tenure of the ban and 7 2 in the years leading up to the prohibition on assault weapons

new you can now listen to fox news articles it didn t take long it took well about a year and a half for the biden administration to destroy the american economy and drive this nation into a recession now the biden administration won t admit that we re in a recession in fact they ve actually redefined the word recession just as they ve redefined the words democracy racism and woman but you don t need to know what the word is to know what is happening if you live here you see it every single day we re in a recession the economy has been shrinking all year real wages are at record lows and at the same time inflation is the highest it s been in the lifetime of most americans so call it whatever you want but it s a recession and it s scary and they re ignoring it we re going to spend the next hour investigating how exactly this happened how did they tank the economy so fast and what does it mean to get to the answers to those questions we re going to speak to people who have actual credibility on economics and that emphatically does not include our most highly credentialed economists people who like the public health experts we ve watched the last two and a half years have thoroughly beclowned and discredited themselves a year ago right about the time he told us that vaccines will absolutely prevent you from getting or transmitting covid joe biden was asked about hey what happens if we go into a recession in response as he invariably does joe biden invoked highly credentialed experts watch this claims of a biden comeback in the media the five responds president biden we also know that as our economy has come roaring back we see some price increases some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation but that s not our view our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we ve seen were expected and are expected to be temporary every word read off a teleprompter a decade from now we re going to see tape like that and think i cannot believe that man was the president of the united states but consider what his handlers wrote for him the experts biden was referring to are in fact some of the most well credentialed figures in all of academic economics in fact two months later in september of last year 17 winners of the nobel prize in economics signed a letter urging joe biden to spend as much money as possible and we re quoting the build back better package they wrote will transform the u s economy to be more efficient without presenting an inflationary threat so go ahead and spend more money create it out of thin air print it and there s no chance you ll get inflation winners of the nobel prize in economics said that if you took econ 101 you re laughing at that by the way it wasn t just them the chairman of the federal reserve jerome powell said the same thing the incoming data are very consistent with the view that inflation will move down toward our goals powell said it s like idiotic and it turned out not to be true now the remarkable thing the way you know this isn t simply incompetence they did this on purpose is what happened when these so called experts were exposed as frauds which they are not a single one of these eminent nobel prize winning economists ever apologized for the letter they wrote or even explained how they got it wrong they re still saying the same thing spend more money and it won t affect inflation because when you have much more of something it s worth the same biden admin quietly approves construction of u s mexico border wall near yuma arizona oh because supply and demand isn t real they re all saying this to the extent they re even paying attention most of them aren t they re way off into lifestyle liberal land like they all are they re worried about trans rights the st louis fed for example one of the most important financial institutions in the united state one of the banks that make up the central bank they ve been conducting studies about what about what monetary policy would be best to avoid complete economic collapse well you d think so that s their job but that s not what they ve been doing instead for the past month we re not making this up the st louis fed has been meditating on equity a term that no one can really define but clearly means your life mr and mrs american is about to get much worse so just as joe biden audibly took office equity is now the top priority of the federal reserve bank of st louis again books will be written about this years from now and no one believe it actually happened but it s real take a look at their website some of the top articles on the website on the blog of the st louis fed include racial and ethnic disparities in access to covid 19 relief covid 19 disruption by race ethnicity and geography the role of diversity in public institutions and reducing racial employment gaps for young adults without college education again this is not a syllabus from the sociology department at brandeis this is the fed these are the people in charge of our monetary policy who are supposed to be keeping america from collapsing but they re ignoring their actual job in favor of pretending that they re professors at brandeis china accuses white house of lying about biden bringing up genocide forced labor with xi it s lunatic and they re still talking this way in april well after it was very clear inflation was not transitory janet yellen the treasury secretary former head of the fed someone who should be charged for what she did to the u s economy gave a speech not about the u s economy she s the treasury secretary no but about climate change and why climate change is more important than saving the united states we re quoting we must redouble our efforts to decarbonize our economies yellen said at an address at the atlantic council keep in mind janet yellen doesn t know anything about climate she can t drive a standard transmission she knows nothing about the material world but there she is spouting off on climate change and decarbonizing reading every stupid faddish talking point the atlantic council audience wanted to hear about and she s still doing it we re in a slow down she said on sunday and it s not affecting too many sectors of the economy says janet yellen watch janet yellen this is not an economy that s in recession but we re in a period of transition in which growth is slowing and that s necessary and appropriate and we need to be growing at a steady and sustainable pace so there is a slowdown and businesses can see that and that s appropriate given that people now have jobs and we have a strong labor market but you don t see any of the signs now a recession is a broad based contraction that affects many sectors of the economy we just don t have that treasury sec janet yellen acknowledges economic slowdown but downplays recession fears okay let s be clear janet yellen is a completely incompetent affirmative action hire who did profound generational damage to the united states during her time running the fed now she s doing the same while running the treasury department and yet no one ever calls her on it the things she says don t make sense she can t even predict inflation when every single other person in the country knew it was coming based on the federal government s spending patterns keep spending money that s what she s still saying everyone in the biden administration is saying that in may the head of usaid samantha power she s back declared that worldwide fertilizer shortage is actually a good thing starvation is a good thing because that means fewer carbon emissions never let a crisis go to waste she said she actually said that new york times column claims we are not in a recession news on inflation is encouraging inside the white house no one s even pretending to care as the u s economy falls apart they re not worried about the oil supply in fact they re selling our oil to our main global rival china they re not worried about the stock market they couldn t tell you what s up or down they cannot even define a recession the one thing they re sure of is everything s fine except for the trans community which is suffering under your bigotry here s our press secretary karine jean pierre and nothing has changed on how we see the stock market we do not that s not something that we keep an eye on every day reporter what is the latest update the white house has received on the current formula situation across the country karine jean pierre let me see if i have anything new for you on that the home depot co founder stands by recession label the economy is receding reporter does the president mind that some of this oil that was meant to ease the pain for consumers is headed overseas karine jean pierre i have not seen that report so i would honestly have to go look into it and see what the truth is in that statement that you just laid out and see exactly what s happening i just have not seen that report reporter is he adamant that there is not going to be recession karine jean pierre i mean it s not our definition right we re talking about a definition from nber reporter and what is exactly the white house s definition of a recession karine jean pierre again we don t we don t i m not going to define it from here kilmeade roasts biden for remarks on inflation recession how can he say this with a straight face we re not going to define a recession we re not going to acknowledge it s even happening and so they re not and no one s forcing them to that s what they re saying this is untenable unless you re an utterly partisan economist you have to acknowledge what s happening but those highly credentialed are not acknowledging it they re blaming putin they re blaming january 6 and of course on the basic point of whether the economy is in trouble there are very few people left to deny it gayle king cbs july 19 the threat of an economic downturn is shaking up consumers and small business owners a recent survey taken by goldman sachs found 93 93 of small businesses fear a recession larry summers cnn july 24 i think there s a very high likelihood of recession when we ve been in this kind of situation before recession has essentially always followed paul krugman msnbc july 21 we did in fact end up with what is clearly an overheated economy and the effect of that overheating on inflation was bigger than this past experience would have led us to believe nouriel roubini bloomberg july 25 i think there are many reasons why we re going to have a severe recession and a severe debt and financial crisis debt ratios are historically high click here to get the fox news app so if larry summers who literally blamed the insurrection on january 6 for inflation and paul krugman who s been wrong about everything humiliates himself weekly in the new york times if they re admitting that actually the economy is in trouble then there s really no denying it you can t deny it we ve reached the limit of denial take a look at this chart notice that right before the 2008 recession the consumer price index was surging just as it is now prices went up until the crash so they always crash why does that happen what happens for a simple reason goods become too expensive for people to buy and then gdp collapses the imf is sending out warning signals as well they now predict a global recession as soon as next year what happens then

is being recorded i will now turn the call over to chuck shaffer president and ceo of seacoast bank mr shaffer you may begin chuck shaffer thank you vanessa and thank you all for joining us this morning as we provide our comments we will reference the second quarter 2022 earnings slide deck which you can find at seacoastbanking com joining me this morning is tracey dexter chief financial officer and michael young treasurer and director of investor relations let me start by thanking the seacoast team for their continued focus and dedication to building the most competitive banking franchise in florida they ve done an outstanding job integrating sabal palm bank and business bank of florida enabling us to enter the highly attractive dynamic sarasota market and continuing to grow our presence in brevard county looking ahead we expect to close both the apollo and drummond transactions in october and are well prepared with a proven playbook to integrate apollo in the fourth quarter of this year and drummond in the first quarter of 2023 as we ve mentioned we completed our digital banking conversion in the first quarter and the feedback from customers has been tremendous this important project is a further extension of how we ve lowered our cost to serve while enhancing our customers experience an important indicator of success is the significant reduction in inbound calls to our call centers as customers engage with our new digital banking features our commercial banking transformation continues with further additions of high quality banking talent from larger organizations seacoast s client centered culture has quickly made us the home of choice for talented bankers looking for a more culturally aligned organization complementing these efforts we are launching a revamp of our treasury business to support growth into middle market operating companies by attracting talented bankers acquisitions and through de novo expansion we will expanded the company into the fast growing florida markets of naples jacksonville sarasota miami gainesville and ocala by the end of this year florida remains a robust dynamic banking market and we added an updated slide in the deck providing additional evidence of the wealth migration to florida post pandemic florida exceeded every state in the nation in attracting affluent wealthy individuals and corporations during the last two years adding materially to the state s gdp signifying its strength the state of florida announced the budget surplus of 21 8 billion for the fiscal year 2021 2022 and refunded excess tax collections to corporations turning to our results the seacoast team delivered another outstanding quarter of earnings generating 46 4 million pretax pre provision earnings up 11 from the prior quarter driven by improved operating leverage further the team achieved 7 loan growth in annualized loan growth and 8 annualized loan growth in non interest bearing demand deposits we saw excellent expansion in the net interest margin which excluding ppp and accretion on acquired loans increased 19 basis points from the prior quarter and as a whole all of our key shareholder metrics improved with the adjusted efficiency ratio down two percentage points to 53 and the adjusted return on tangible equity up to 13 97 while carrying and 9 74 tangible common equity ratio during the quarter the acl coverage ratio remained nearly flat at 1 39 and considering the loss absorption included in the purchase accounting marks the company reserved a 1 71 coverage rate considering this credit backstop the high quality of the customer franchise and our strictly underwritten credit portfolio we are operating with one of the most robust balance sheets in our peer group we continue to take a conservative approach to reserving for the allowance for credit losses underwriting and capital and lastly i ll point out that our credit metrics remain impressively strong classified and criticized assets continue to decline yhe company recorded net recoveries for the quarter non performing assets declined quarter over quarter and past dues remain stable in summary our quarterly performance and strategic highlights demonstrate the strength of the franchise and the quality of the agile innovative team we ve built here at seacoast we are focused on building the most competitive banking organization in florida by creating highly valuable statewide brand and generating a high quality customer portfolio and what is arguably the best banking market in the united states we will be disciplined and focused in growing and serving high value lower risk customer segments and markets while delivering strong risk adjusted returns to our shareholders i ll turn the call over to tracey to walk through our financial results tracey dexter thanks jeff good morning everyone let s begin with highlight for our second quarter results on slide five the net interest margin expanded 13 basis points to 3 38 and on the core basis expanded 19 basis points to 3 24 adjusted pretax pre provision net revenue was 46 4 million an increase of 11 compared to the prior quarter and an increase of 23 compared to the prior year quarter the result of higher net interest income driven by expanding margin increasing non interest income and a reduction in non interest expense with the increase in rates during the quarter new purchases of securities and loan origination supported higher loan and securities yields and our cost of deposits remains at six basis points organic loan growth was strong this quarter at an annualized rate of 7 despite elevated payoffs when compared to the prior quarter with our continued investment in experienced bankers and the expanded footprint we re well positioned for growth and during the quarter commercial originations are up 139 year over year credit risk metrics continue to improve with charge off non accrual and criticized loan ratios all lower compared to the previous quarter tangible book value per share ended the period at 16 66 excluding the year to date decrease in fair value of available for sale debt securities tangible book value per share would have been 18 55 or an increase of 9 year over year given our higher capital ratios we chose to maintain the majority of our securities portfolio in afs which impacted tangible book value per share but provide sales optionality in future periods with the continued success of our balanced growth strategy and pure leading capital levels we were pleased to deliver an increase to the dividend in the second quarter and we ll continue to revisit the dividend payout ratio periodically i ll also highlight that since the beginning of 2022 we ve executed on significant market expansion we closed on the acquisition of sabal palm bank in sarasota and business bank of florida in melbourne in early january additionally we opened the naples branch with a market president and full team and a jacksonville commercial lending office with a market president and five new north florida bankers in march we announced the upcoming acquisition of apollo bank in miami and in may we announced the upcoming acquisition of drummond community bank in the north florida market including gainesville and ocala this expansion across some of florida s most attractive msas is building both franchise value and scarcity value over the long term moving to net interest income and margin on slide six net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 5 1 million or 7 compared to the prior quarter with both higher balances and higher yields on loans and securities these increases were partially offset by lower ppp fee accretion with only 17 million in ppp loans remaining excluding ppp and accretion on acquired loans which introduced significant variability net interest margin expanded 19 basis points from 3 05 to 3 24 securities portfolio yields increased 30 basis points to 1 98 and core loan yields increased 10 basis points to 4 10 the cost of deposits remained flat to the prior quarter at only six basis points looking ahead we expect net interest income and margin to increase as our asset sensitive position with significant core deposit funding and ample liquidity will benefit from higher rates we continue to expect that each 25 basis point rate hike on a static balance sheet would be beneficial in a range of five to six basis points to net interest margin assuming the forward curve as of the first week in july which included an additional 50 basis point rate hike in september we expect an increase of approximately 5 million to net interest income in the third quarter with the core nim excluding purchase accounting accretion expanding to around 3 50 moving to slide seven adjusted non interest income was 17 3 million an increase of 1 4 million from the previous quarter and an increase of 1 9 million from the prior year quarter service charges on deposits increased 0 6 million to 3 4 million reflecting higher demand account balances and changes in monthly maintenance and atm fees partially offset by slightly lower overdraft fees in the third quarter changes we re making to reduce overdraft fees will take effect with an estimated impact of 1 5 million annually wealth management performed well during the quarter overcoming broad based market valuation declines with revenues 4 higher sequentially and 16 higher compared to the same quarter last year mortgage banking fees are lower reflecting the continued impact of rising rates and limited housing inventory on saleable loan production other income in the second quarter includes higher loan swap fees and an increase in production and resulting gains on saleable sba loans looking ahead we continue to focus on growing our broad base of revenue sources and expect third quarter non interest income in a range from 17 million to 17 5 million this assumes mortgage banking fees continue to remain challenged and it includes one month impact from changes being made to the company s overdraft policy moving to slide eight adjusted non interest expense for the second quarter was 51 7 million when excluding gains on the sale of reo that figure would be 52 6 million at the lower end of the range of guidance we provided last quarter excluding the impact of merger related costs in each period salaries and benefits increased 0 9 million as we continue to add talent and support growth initiatives smaller increases in marketing occupancy and data and other expenses were offset by decreases in legal fees looking ahead we expect to maintain our expense discipline while continuing investments to support growth we expect third quarter expenses excluding the amortization of intangible assets to be in the range of 53 million to 54 million with the planned increase resulting from continued investments in talent and scaling the business turning to slide nine the efficiency ratio has improved from the prior quarter including on an adjusted basis and we expect continued results in the low 50s for the remainder of the year turning to slide 10 highlighting the continued diversity of our exposure and our disciplined approach to managing concentrations the distribution of loans by category remained stable compared to the prior quarter construction and commercial real estate concentrations remain well below regulatory guidelines and well below those of the peer group and the average commercial loan size remains low at 558 000 turning to slide 11 loans net of ppp increased 112 million or 7 on an annualized basis coming off a record high pipeline in the first quarter we delivered record originations of 462 million in commercial prepayments were notably higher in the second quarter totaling 348 million compared to 244 million in the first quarter and compared to an average 286 million per quarter in 2021 if not for the 103 million increase in prepayments compared to the prior quarter loan growth would have been over 13 annualized looking to the third quarter we expect loan growth to continue with an annualized growth rate in the high single digits the commercial pipeline at june 30th is lower than at march 31st reflecting the impact of higher rates on loan demand however as long term rates have fallen the pipeline has recovered providing us confidence in our third quarter guidance loan yields will continue to benefit from the higher rate environment and what we anticipate will be slower prepayments and better new add on yields through last week new ad rates in july has moved up to around 460 using the forward curve as of the first week in july we expect core yields to expand to the low 430s in the third quarter of 2022 as a reminder this excludes purchase accounting accretion turning to slide 12 for the securities portfolio we continue to invest excess liquidity at a moderate pace in the investment securities portfolio with net additions of 142 million and have meaningful additional liquidity for loan production and strategic purchases at higher rates additions this quarter were primarily agency cmos with an average duration of 3 3 a new add on yield during the quarter average 3 31 positively impacted by recent steepness in the front end of the curve through last week securities purchase add on rates in july have improved to approximately 4 in october with the closing of the apollo and drummond transactions we will acquire cash and the securities portfolios our deal models contemplated selling and reinvesting those funds and we will begin our deployment strategy for investing those funds beginning in the third quarter we will steadily pace our investments expecting net growth in the portfolio by the end of the third quarter of approximately 200 million to 250 million turning to slide 13 we maintain a strong liquidity position and ample cash to deploy into rising rates our cash and cash equivalents to total assets at the end of the quarter was 8 3 and combined with securities with 32 while the loan to deposit ratio remains lower than the historical norm at 71 turning to slide 14 illustrating seacoast s historical deposit beta seacoast s long standing relationship and high proportion of transaction accounts translates to a historically low beta in the last full rising rate cycle from the third quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2019 the deposit beta was 28 each cycle is different but we do have an even more favorable deposit mix today than in the past with 39 non interest bearing versus less than 32 back in 2015 and 64 transaction accounts compared to 54 at the start of the last cycle that evolution supports our expectation that deposit costs will remain low and that rate increases will continue to be beneficial to the nim when compared to the prior cycle we exhibit a comparatively higher liquidity position lower loan to deposit ratio and better deposit mix while we have not increased deposit pricing to date in this cycle we expect the competitive environment to become increasingly dynamic we have a very strong deposit base and expect that we will continue to outperform our peers on deposit betas in the coming quarters turning to slide 15 at quarter end deposits outstanding were 9 2 billion a decrease of 55 million quarter over quarter with non interest bearing demand deposits growing at an annualized rate of 8 during the quarter offset by declines in money market and cd accounts transaction accounts represent 64 of total deposits and have grown 6 on an annualized basis thus far in july we ve begun to see more requests for exception pricing and we continue to manage this on an exception basis moving to slide 16 the allowance for credit losses increased during the quarter by 0 9 million through an overall 90 8 million keeping pace with loan growth while maintaining coverage nearly flat to last quarter at 1 39 we remain watchful of inflationary pressures and are carefully considering the impact of higher rates on the economy though our credit metrics remain very strong and continue to improve in addition to the allowance the total purchase discount remaining on bank acquisitions is 21 4 million which will be earned as an adjustment to yield over the life of those loans we will continue to take a conservative approach to provisioning when combining both the allowance for credit losses and the purchase discount remaining we re operating from a more conservative position than our peers set on to credit metrics on slide 17 we re seeing sustained positive trends with a net recovery position during the quarter and non performing loans decreasing to 0 4 of total loans the percentage of criticized loans to risk based capital moved lower this quarter and again allowance coverage is near flat to last quarter at 1 39 we continue to assess the environment and the factors that might affect loan performance and will retain a conservative posture in our outlook and estimate turning to slide 18 our capital position continues to be very strong tangible book value per share is 16 66 a decline from last quarter that s attributed solely to the decline in accumulated other comprehensive income the result of recording unrealized losses in the securities portfolio the ratio of tangible calm equity to tangible assets was 9 7 also impacted by the change in aoci from securities despite the decline this tce to ta ratio remains among the highest in our peer group regulatory capital ratios were not affected by changes in securities valuations and were flat to prior quarter return on tangible common equity was higher in the second quarter on both a gaap and adjusted basis with the second quarter benefiting from higher net interest income and the first quarter negatively impacted by the day one provision of 5 1 million on loans acquired from sabal palm and business bank of florida and finally on slide 19 a longer term look at tangible book value per share demonstrates our sustainability to generate value for shareholders over the last five years we ve achieved a compound annual growth rate of 9 positioned on a foundation of strong liquidity and capital from which we ll continue to optimize the opportunities of a strong florida economy and continue to execute on our strategic growth initiatives we look forward to your questions chuck i ll turn the call back to you chuck shaffer all right vanessa i think we re ready for q a question and answer session operator thank you we will now begin our question and answer session our first question is from will jones with kbw your line is open will jones hey great good morning chuck shaffer good morning will jones hey so just wanted to start on the growth guidance i know you re still expecting high single digit growth which i think is consistent with where you ve been in the past two quarters tracey i know you alluded to pipelines being lower at the end of the quarter but have recovered since then could you just give us a little context on where they are today in relation to the record level you saw in the first quarter and then how do you pay off forward looking payoffs play into your future growth guidance chuck shaffer yes i ll take that one the i would say when you look at the pipeline we measured in both early stage and late stage but if you look at the overall pipeline it s back up about where it was at the end of the prior quarter and if you really look at the quarter we had a number of sort of higher payoffs that were somewhat idiosyncratic and were related to products being sold and businesses being liquidated so we expect the payoffs to come back down and be more normalized in line with with where it was previously and we think loan production looks about stable it s not up just modestly in the coming quarter so overall very much feel very confident in the high single digit number for the coming quarter will jones okay very helpful thank you and then on the expense guide i know there s so many moving pieces in there with the sabal and fbb coming on beginning of the year and then you ll have the apollo and drummond at the end of the year but can you just remind us where you are in relation to cost savings on sabal and fbb today and then how should we expect the cadence of cost savings to play out with apollo and drummond closing into the year and i think you said you re converting apollo in the fourth quarter and then drummond in the first quarter of 2023 just a little bit of help around there would be great tracey dexter sure yes when it comes to cost out on the acquisitions that closed at the beginning of the year we had anticipated 60 of the cost out on the sabal palm bank in 2022 and that s certainly on track so really all the cost outs now that the bank has been integrated and converted are in place and so third quarter going forward anticipate that and of course for fbb really the large majority of the cost outs have already taken effect even in the second quarter chuck shaffer and if you looked forward to drummond and apollo apollo we expect to close both transactions the first week of october we will close and convert apollo in the first week and we will convert drummond right around mid first quarter and i would expect the apollo cost outs to come through kind of in the by the end of the fourth quarter so sort of full impact first quarter and then have the full impact of the drummond cost outs from the second quarter on out for the remainder of the year in 2023 will jones okay that s great thanks for that chuck and then just lastly for me i know it s challenging just with valuation but do you guys ever have any internal discussion over jumping into the buyback i know you guys may have had some modest degree of activity in the past but you still have just tons of excess capitals is there any conversations you guys ever have about engaging the buyback chuck shaffer the way we think about the buyback is we think about in terms of an earn back just like a transaction and our preference sort of in a capital sort of highest to lowest use the highest use being organic and m a is sort of our primary use of capital and then sort of thirdly there would be dividends and fourth would be the buyback we would buy back shares if the earn back came in to our level that we felt comfortable with but we think right now the best use is definitely organic and m a and potentially further increases in the dividend over time will jones got it makes sense thank you guys appreciate the questions chuck shaffer thank you will operator our next question is from eric spector with raymond james eric spector hey how s it going guys chuck shaffer good morning eric eric spector just want to follow up on capital obviously you guys have two deals going and markets increasingly uncertain just curious how you think about m a from here and are we going to focus on digesting these recent deals or do you feel comfortable considering m a going forward chuck shaffer sure thanks eric i d say as we said on the last call we ve only wanted to have two deals in application we ve now gotten apollo all the way through both approvals with the occ and the fed drummond is in approval with the occ and the fed currently i would say that we would look at something if it made sense we would want to make sure that from a pricing perspective the we contemplated sort of downside risks and still got reasonable earn backs and solid accretion out of the deal and we would look at a deal if it came along and i would say deal conversations remain as active as they have been previously we ve really seen no slowdown in the amount of conversations across the state eric spector okay great thanks and then wanted to touch on the treasury management build out to support the middle market expansion and the new hires i m just curious where you are in that build out your thoughts on moving upstream and plans for doing so are there any verticals you re more focused on and just kind of generally how that s gone so far chuck shaffer yes at a high level as we continue to bring in some really high quality banking and credit talent across the organization we re having the opportunity to compete in sort of the lower end of the middle market and it s obviously a part of the market where most of the regional national banks compete because of the value that s there there s a high quality relationships bring in deposits credit facilities wealth management other treasury fee income it s a space we ve wanted to compete in for some time and as we ve grown larger and as the balance sheet has gotten bigger and the quality of the talents come in it s allowed us to open those doors in a more rapid fashion and so if we built that up we re building out a team across the state of what i would consider sort of the best of the best treasury folks they ll be able to go in and really win deals quickly and win deals impressively and it s been a focus of ours as we continue to become even more and more competitive on the commercial banking side to compete there so we re making investments both in talent primarily but also technology over time and it is a focus of ours operator your line is still open sir do you have further questions eric spector hey sorry i was on mute one last question just wanted to touch on the funding side obviously you ve gained more than your fair share of deposits over the past few years is there some seasonality in the quarter just curious how you think about deposit flows and migration within the book going forward as you low cost deposit franchise chuck shaffer couple of comments when you look back at the prior quarter we did a fair amount of work looking at what the outflows were and it was primarily tax payments and in particular we had one large customer that had an incredibly successful year that they d sent out 190 million for to the irs so that was worked through the numbers i would say looking back at the prior quarter rate pressure really wasn t an issue we are starting to see more asks from our clients around rate we ll continue to manage it carefully defensively sort of on an exception basis and manage it over time and for the first time in a couple of years we are seeing in a season we did sort of in 2020 and 2021 our northern migration state and florida and this year we did see some folks go back and so our local small businesses have seen some deposit balances come down but i do expect that to return but the bulk of what went out in q1 was or in q2 sorry was tax payments eric spector great that s it for me thank you chuck shaffer thanks eric operator our next question comes from steve moss with b riley steve moss hi good morning chuck shaffer hey steve steve moss maybe chuck just starting with the loan pipeline kind of curious what is within the mix especially on the commercial side and kind of what are your thoughts on commercial real estate lending these days chuck shaffer it s running roughly 60 cre 40 c i is about the mix i would say when we saw rates get up in the 3 50 ish range on the long end we were absolutely pushing lower leverage in the commercial real estate and to some extent probably had a few clients go financing elsewhere which we re totally fine with we continue to navigate it carefully i would say we are stressing rates up pretty materially in those deals to make sure we get leverage correct and i d say that s kind of our key focus business to make sure that if we re going to do a deal it s got the right leverage in it and we continue to be i would say conservative on amortization periods and interest only periods there s a lot of pressure in the market to go longer on periods longer on i o periods and we continue to be defensive there and but we will look at deals we re still very active but we importantly want them underwritten to our sort of conservative approach steve moss okay appreciate the color there and then tracey on the five to six basis point margin guide per 25 bps i m just kind of wondering what you re using for a deposit beta in that math tracey dexter yes they deposit beta does start to move a bit but really just tracking somewhat similar to the last cycle it ll remain quite low and below the peer group steve moss okay so still close to zero in the first hikes with these five or six basis points basically tracey dexter okay steve moss maybe 10 something in that range maybe tracey dexter that s right sorry steve yes steve moss okay and then in terms of just on the pipeline of new hires and maybe just a little bit more on the middle market initiative chuck just kind of how many people do you think you could be bringing on later this year and maybe how many could be tied to the middle market build out here chuck shaffer yes i d say roughly we probably have plans to add another 15 plus bankers between now and the end of the year we were only going to hire if we find the right talented individuals that fit in the culture have the relationships in the marketplace and are focused on the type of business we want to do but yes we still have plan to continue to build out the team we still and importantly are seeing a lot of demand for folks that want to jump on board and be part of us so we ve kind of moved from a period maybe 24 months ago 18 months ago where we were out hunting and to a point now where we re still doing that but we re seeing a lot of inbound too which is fantastic i can t explain how beneficial that is so the flywheel is turning and i would say a third if not half of those are kind of more upstream bankers that are coming out a larger regional and national banks in fact i d say all of our hires particularly in last quarter out of larger regional national banks that have the ability to handle bigger c i clients and so a lot of high quality talent come in the organization very pleased with it we built out the credit team to support that and brought in a lot of experienced credit folks for some bigger organization so we continue to build into being a midsize bank which i m very pleased with progress steve moss all right great thank you very much for all the color good quarter chuck shaffer thanks steve operator our next question comes from steve scouten with piper sandler steve scouten hey good morning everyone chuck shaffer hey steve how are you steve scouten good good question i guess first on the loan loss reserve and just kind of how you re handling the modeling there any changes to any of your waiting to various scenarios within that this quarter how are you kind of preparing for what may or may not be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy and how you think about tracey dexter yes thanks i ll take that so we kept the allowance coverage essentially flat 1 39 and our primary economic forecast scenario is moody s baseline the baseline had somewhat mixed indications throughout there were obviously expectations of inflation so global uncertainty kind of tamping consumer confidence and the outlook for economic expansion but as we look at activity in our markets we really do see indications of strength we do think it s prudent with continuing elevated uncertainties and just the fast pace of change and the macro environment that we keep those reserves at a level that kind of acknowledges that and the possibility that forecasted metrics may be different from the baseline scenario so we do have as a part of our qualitative framework tracking toward the s3 scenario which we revisit each quarter and kind of a standardized way so we did look more closely at the s3 scenario in this case and kept that coverage just about flat steve scouten okay helpful and is that was that based off their june or july model for this quarter and i guess it was june do you think you d see some uptick based on what you saw on the july numbers so far tracey dexter it s the one that was published in june and so as we look at what was published in july i think we feel good about the decisions we made for weighting of those scenarios in june steve scouten okay great very helpful tracey and then i guess kind of thinking back about loan growth and you guys have given some great color there and understand the growth would have been that kind of 13 plus ex the elevated pay downs but i m just kind of curious why you think your growth has been high single digit closer to 10 you ve had some of that be in the residential mortgage purchases i know we ve seen a lot of your peers grow it kind of astronomical rates this quarter so given the strength of your market the team built out to you guys that had all the things that are going right why do you think there s that delta between what some of your other peers might be seeing and what and what you re seeing is it just conservatism smaller loan sizes or is there anything else at play chuck shaffer yes just to clarify a little bit around the residential loans we didn t purchase anything it just we put more in a portfolio that came in through both our bank channel and our correspondent channel but i d say generally steve it gets back to the fact that we have not been a large commercial real estate lender and we re not a heavy spec lender and so i think you re seeing a lot of our peers do a couple things one their portfolio and significant portfolios of mortgages which sort of understand my challenge with that has been there s tremendous optionality in favor of the borrower unlike a commercial loan where you can get a prepayment penalty or a floor if rates fall which we ve already seen the three or the 10 year drop only almost 70 basis points you get another 50 you defer the cost all that comes back through and all of a sudden you not made any money on that mortgage and then if rates go up the mortgage extends and you re stuck with this long duration assets so we ve avoided that asset class in a material way into the portfolio and then the other piece is i think a lot of other banks in the marketplace particularly regional banks have bigger spec portfolios that are funding up through construction cycles and that s supporting growth that we just don t have the portfolio of we focused on stabilized income producing commercial real estate we do some spec but it tends to be very high quality spec and so i think that s why we stand out so if you want to kind of characterize it is running a conservative book that s what we do steve scouten yes no that s very helpful i mean do you think a lot of that is just positioning from what you guys learned from the last cycle and just hey things are great in florida but there s no reason to get out ahead of our skis and let s just kind of stay within the guardrail chuck shaffer yes i think we ll we ll always be there steve it s we ve built a series of guardrails around the bank we have a very strong portfolio and credit administration process and we run the bank for the long run and so we take relationships we take assets that we think will withstand the test of time and we look for strong balance sheets and well heeled borrowers and it s you can always go find commercial real estate it s always there and not to say that there isn t good commercial real estate because we certainly do plenty of it but it s we pick our spots carefully and we build the bank for to handle different cycles and i think that is all lessons from the past that are built into the fabric of the company and we really do think about things in terms of risk adjusted return we look for assets that we get good yield good relationships the depth of return on that asset and i think it shows up in the shareholder returns we deliver steve scouten yes i think that s fantastic sometimes you get further away from those events and people start to forget so it s encouraging that you guys are holding to that and then i guess the last thing for me would be just as you make this push in the middle market and i think average loan size you guys now do what like 558 000 maybe something like that do you think you ll start to see that average loan size move materially higher as you make some of these larger regional bank types of hires i guess maybe more weighted to the c i side of things chuck shaffer maybe modestly yes but that being said the way we built our internal hold limits we can handle clients up to 200 million 300 million revenues without any issue without sort of materially pushing it when you look at the capital ratios and you look at the ability to add that asset class in and add another set of diversity to the portfolio it s i think in the end it s adding actually more diversity into the book and so while the average loan size may go up modestly over time now we have a lot of loans so it ll take a long time to get that average up but it will probably move north from here that all being said we ll continue to very carefully manage our top 10 top 20 exposures and our top of the house exposures and manage our relationship limits appropriately and sell down where we need to and bind partners to take some of that asset and so we have always manage them steve steve scouten yes great that all make sense congrats on another great quarter guys chuck shaffer thank you operator thank you we have no further questions i will now turn the call back over to chuck shaffer for closing remarks chuck shaffer okay thank you thank you very much vanessa and thanks for all joining the call i think it was a great quarter another sort of indication of the strength we carry in the company and looking forward to talk to you all next quarter operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our conference we thank you for participating you may now disconnect

globally we safely produced 668 400 short tons in the second quarter and successfully completed our planned unit 7 production line annual maintenance we continue to focus on operational reliability and meeting production goals while maintaining safety as our highest priority second quarter sales were strong due largely to advantageous conditions in the export market where tight supply has kept prices elevated above historical levels we are carefully following markets both domestically and abroad and managing anticipated decreased growth rates particularly for sisecam s export markets while supply chain problems continues to create headwinds our goal is to drive the company with strong financials and prepare for possible economic turmoil with proper balance sheet management sales of 189 million in the second quarter translated into 31 million of net income and 40 million of adjusted ebitda high inflation expected recession or stagflation both domestically and abroad and the cost of freight have strained working capital to some extent with this in mind we continue to prioritize a healthy capital structure leverage ratio as well as a strong coverage ratio for our distributable cash we will maintain our focus on conservative cash flow management to better position the company to thwart any negative effects from increasing interest rates inflationary pressures and overall uncertainty in the broader economy and we are pleased with our current operational stability and commercial position i want to thank our committed employees for their efforts this year and am proud of

improving supply and demand fundamentals recognized for soda ash in the global market and particularly in asia the domestic average price also increased by 7 1 due to customer mix factoring in the

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we also present the non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus net interest expense income tax depreciation depletion and amortization equity based compensation expense and certain other expenses that are non cash charges or that we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations distributable cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda less net cash paid for interest maintenance capital expenditures and income taxes each as attributable to sisecam resources lp the partnership may fund expansion related capital expenditures with borrowings under existing credit facilities such that expansion related capital expenditures will have no impact on cash on hand or the calculation of cash available for distribution in certain instances the timing of the partnership s borrowings and or its cash management practices will result in a mismatch between the period of the borrowing and the period of the capital expenditure in those instances the partnership adjusts designated reserves as provided in the partnership agreement to take account of the timing difference accordingly expansion related capital expenditures have been excluded from the presentation of cash available for distribution distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances we define distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of distributable cash flow as of the end of the period to cash distributions payable with respect to such period adjusted ebitda is a non gaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess the partnership s operating performance and liquidity adjusted ebitda may provide an operating performance comparison to other publicly traded partnerships in our industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods adjusted ebitda may also be used to assess the partnership s liquidity including such things as the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our unitholders and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are non gaap supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess the partnership s liquidity including the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors in assessing our financial conditions results of operations and liquidity distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio provide useful information to investors in assessing our liquidity the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio is net cash provided by operating activities our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio should not be considered as alternatives to gaap net income operating income net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities investors should not consider adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may be defined differently by other companies including those in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility the table below presents a reconciliation of the gaap financial

washington the u s house of representatives on friday passed a ban on semi automatic firearms the weapons used in multiple mass shootings during the last three months on a near party line vote with the 217 213 vote the bill h r 1808 will head to the evenly divided senate but it s unlikely to advance there as the ban would need all democrats on board plus 10 republicans to get past a filibuster sen chuck schumer the senate majority leader has not announced if he plans to bring the weapons ban to the floor for a vote each year more children die from gun violence than any other cause house speaker nancy pelosi said on the house floor our nation has watched unspeakable horror as assault weapons have been used in massacre after massacre all but five democrats backed the ban only two republicans voted in favor brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania and chris jacobs of new york the five democrats that split with their party and opposed the ban were reps jared golden of maine kurt schrader of oregon ron kind of wisconsin and henry cuellar and vicente gonzalez of texas the push for banning semi automatic firearms came after they were used in mass shootings in uvalde texas where 19 children and two teachers were murdered and in buffalo new york where a white supremacist murdered 10 black people at a grocery store a semi automatic weapon also was used in a july fourth shooting in highland park illinois where seven people were killed the sponsor of the bill rep david cicilline a rhode island democrat said that movie theaters places of worship schools hospitals and grocery stores have become bloody battlefield scenes these weapons have no place in our communities he said there are more mass shootings than days in the year this is a uniquely american problem this year alone there have been 372 mass shootings according to the gun violence archive police funding bills the assault weapons ban was originally set to be passed alongside several bills that would provide funding for local police departments but progressive democrats raised concerns and pushed for more accountability measures in the police legislation i have heard from the civil rights community and i have strong concerns with two policing bills we may consider this week rep andy levin a michigan democrat wrote on twitter we should not advance them unless they include robust accountability oversight provisions in line with those in the george floyd justice in policing act rep josh gottheimer a new jersey democrat is the lead sponsor of a bill that would authorize a 50 million grant each year for a justice department program to assist small local police departments another bill would reauthorize a grant program to hire and increase the pay of local police rep val demings a florida democrat and former orlando police chief who is running for republican sen marco rubio s senate seat sponsored a bill to provide 100 million per year in grants to help police agencies solve violent crimes the initiatives come as democratic leadership has tried to push back on being seen as a party that wants to defund the police a slogan many members have disavowed as well as biden republicans have been branding democrats as not supportive enough of police in advance of the midterm elections during a weekly press conference friday pelosi speaking to the concerns of progressives said the police bill was not funding without accountability on the house floor she said that after the august recess democrats will pass the police and public safety set of bills weapons ban the u s house judiciary committee passed the weapons ban out of its committee last week on a party line vote the bill bans all semi automatic rifles that can have a detachable magazine and have a military feature such as a pistol grip and a detachable stock or grenade launcher among other features it also bans all semi automatic rifles that have a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds the bill if enacted into law would not ban current semi automatic weapons that people own meaning current firearm owners would have their weapons grandfathered in house republicans opposing the bill argued that the bill would take away semi automatic weapons from current owners but democrats said that is not correct because they would be covered under the grandfather clause during debate on the house floor rep guy reschenthaler a pennsylvania republican said the bill was unconstitutional calling it a gun grab law abiding americans use firearms every day he said rep deborah ross a north carolina democrat denied that people would lose their guns as many republicans continued to say it simply prevents future sales of assault rifles she said adding that the weapons are not designed for recreation they re designed for combat rep jim jordan an ohio republican also accused democrats of coming for your guns white house support the white house issued a statement on friday in support of the bill 40 000 americans die from gunshot wounds every year and guns have become the top killer of children in the united states according to the statement as president biden has repeatedly called for we must do more to stop this gun violence and save lives house democrats have held numerous hearings about gun violence in america most recently this week when house oversight and reform

soda ash markets globally we safely produced 668 400 short tons in the second quarter and successfully completed our planned unit 7 production line annual maintenance we continue to focus on operational reliability and meeting production goals while maintaining safety as our highest priority second quarter sales were strong due largely to advantageous conditions in the export market where tight supply has kept prices elevated above historical levels we are carefully following markets both domestically and abroad and managing anticipated decreased growth rates particularly for sisecam s export markets while supply chain problems continues to create headwinds our goal is to drive the company with strong financials and prepare for possible economic turmoil with proper balance sheet management sales of 189 million in the second quarter translated into 31 million of net income and 40 million of adjusted ebitda high inflation expected recession or stagflation both domestically and abroad and the cost of freight have strained working capital to some extent with this in mind we continue to prioritize a healthy capital structure leverage ratio as well as a strong coverage ratio for our distributable cash we will maintain our focus on conservative cash flow management to better position the company to thwart any negative effects from increasing interest rates inflationary pressures and overall uncertainty in the broader economy and we are pleased with our current operational stability and commercial position i want to thank our committed employees for their efforts

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we also present the non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus net interest expense income tax depreciation depletion and amortization equity based compensation expense and certain other expenses that are non cash charges or that we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations distributable cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda less net cash paid for interest maintenance capital expenditures and income taxes each as attributable to sisecam resources lp the partnership may fund expansion related capital expenditures with borrowings under existing credit facilities such that expansion related capital expenditures will have no impact on cash on hand or the calculation of cash available for distribution in certain instances the timing of the partnership s borrowings and or its cash management practices will result in a mismatch between the period of the borrowing and the period of the capital expenditure in those instances the partnership adjusts designated reserves as provided in the partnership agreement to take account of the timing difference accordingly expansion related capital expenditures have been excluded from the presentation of cash available for distribution distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances we define distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of distributable cash flow as of the end of the period to cash distributions payable with respect to such period adjusted ebitda is a non gaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess the partnership s operating performance and liquidity adjusted ebitda may provide an operating performance comparison to other publicly traded partnerships in our industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods adjusted ebitda may also be used to assess the partnership s liquidity including such things as the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our unitholders and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are non gaap supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess the partnership s liquidity including the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors in assessing our financial conditions results of operations and liquidity distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio provide useful information to investors in assessing our liquidity the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio is net cash provided by operating activities our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio should not be considered as alternatives to gaap net income operating income net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities investors should not consider adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda

last year there were 24 successful young this year just five while lower mainland eagle populations have suffered this year others have fared better like on vancouver island where this eagle nests near qualicum beach while lower mainland eagle populations have suffered this year others have fared better like on vancouver island where this eagle nests near qualicum beach advertisement there s an albatross around the neck of the local eagle population the numbers of eggs being laid and chicks surviving once hatched have sharply dropped this year eagle trackers and researchers haven t directly identified a cause but are concerned about the dramatic decline in survival rate on the north shore 31 chicks hatched in 2021 with 24 of them surviving the process of leaving the nest known as fledging according to sally mcdermott of north shore eagle network this year just 13 hatched and only five have fledged nearly an 80 per cent decrease in new eaglets a number of happenings over the past year could be at play last year s heat dome could have caused stress or even killed some of the birds and the devastating floods could have washed out some of the spawning salmon eagles rely on as a food source meanwhile a wave of avian flu has spread among wild and domestic birds across the province i would think this is a bit of a canary in a coal mine situation mcdermott said this is happening in real time right now and is quite dramatic that s why she s surprised the province hasn t been responding to calls to test dead chicks the provincial government doesn t seem to have the time or the funding to analyze these chicks said mcdermott who s been in contact with government officials via email that s been very disappointing in an email statement the ministry of environment said it s aware of the current situation biologists in the ministry of forests and canadian wildlife service are currently conducting nest surveys of a variety of avian species and collecting carcasses when encountered a spokesperson said we do not have the results of this effort at this time the ministry said it responds to and collects all bird carcasses possible for testing including young eagles during the peak of avian influenza we have prioritized testing of waterfowl eagles and other raptors the decline in new eagles extends beyond the north shore hancock wildlife foundation tracks over 400 pairs of nesting bald eagles in the lower fraser valley data from the organization show that in an active area in delta a network of 44 nests produces 44 young on average this year the nests produced just four young a drop of nearly 91 per cent another group of 22 nests in south surrey typically sees around 24 26 young this year only five have survived assuming all of them survive we re down to a very very low percentage of success ratio something we have never ever experienced before said david hancock an 85 year old researcher that started studying eagles as a teenager after bounties on bald eagles were scrapped and use of nasty pesticide ddt was banned the species has made a strong comeback over the last 50 years but hancock said 2022 s numbers are nowhere near enough to sustain the population he too is frustrated with the lack of testing of dead chicks with coronavirus surging every lab in north america is again tied up with bloody covid hancock said adding that priority is put on testing chickens which will hit b c s economy hard if they can t be exported earlier this year the province had analyzed a few birds detecting avian flu in some carcasses but more recently there have been very few birds analyzed he said in some of the nests his foundation tracks they ve observed nearly full grown dead chicks something that s hardly ever seen except in rare cases of sibling rivalry and the parents know there s something wrong because they ve gone and built other nests nearby for next year already hancock said eagles facing broader threat to food sources expert says while the lifelong researcher concedes disease and other weakness could be at fault there s a broader growing threat to these beloved raptors over the past five to 10 years hancock has noticed food sources for avian predators are diminishing worldwide so called scavenging predators hunt for part of the year for bald eagles that s in the nesting season when feeding their young but for the other half of the year they scavenge for dead food in both cases fish is the natural source either alive or dead after spawning while over fishing has greatly depleted the fish stock eagles rely on they ve found another reliable food source garbage there are over 100 garbage sites in the lower mainland this became a wonderful alternative food supply to salmon hancock continued when the salmon carcasses ran out earlier and earlier every year the eagles shifted to finding garbage and what ecologically minded practice has become increasingly popular in recent years composting we re taking all the compostables the protein and the vegetable matter and we re putting it into a green box hancock said and the result is there simply isn t the same amount of food left in this area that dearth affects both migrating birds and the nesting eagle populations and he believes we re beginning to see the consequences on the north shore there aren t any major waste sites to feed on but hancock speculates that these eagles are facing increased competition from hungry birds along the shorelines fortunately eagle chicks have been more successful this year in other areas of the province such as vancouver island and a number of the gulf islands but other countries like japan have grappled with diminishing eagle populations due to food scarcity and have begun measures to bring them back we re not looking at a simple story with a simple fix hancock said we ve taken away their goddamn salmon and we ve substituted garbage we ve now taken away the garbage this is a huge impact that most people have not yet tied together nlaba nsnews com twitter com nick_laba

one day at work michelle not her real name a former victoria s secret employee from a california store was helping this little old man he had a free coupon and his wife was like oh i want these panties she recalled to the daily beast and he was like describing them to me i was like ok and i brought them over to where the panties were he said i like your nipples they re so small i was like what did you just fucking say to me michelle said he was like oh i didn t i m like you can go fuck yourself and he s literally laughing to himself and talking to himself as he s walking out through the door i had only one person stand up for me and go after the customer which was the assistant store manager michelle said when other members of management heard about the situation i was referred to the employee dress code guide and told to always feel comfortable to go to a manager about problematic customers and that was it they didn t do enough and when they tried it was too little too late advertisement advertisement internal videos reveal how victoria s secret groomed teens this is just one account of the reality behind the fantasy that victoria s secret is a ladies paradise as former l brands ceo leslie wexner puts it in hulu s new documentary about the brand sales associates pounding the lacquered floors at one of victoria s secret s many retail locations in 2016 there were 1 177 in the united states alone work diligently to hit sales goals and satisfy customers however the daily beast has conducted interviews with several victoria s secret sales associates both former and current who assert that the fantasy is a day to day sham the associates whether they worked in north carolina or california new york city or suburban michigan described work conditions where a toxic atmosphere defined by sexual harassment from customers and insufficient intervention by managers was the norm in a public facing job customers behaving badly is always a possibility any hostess at a regularly packed restaurant could tell you that but at a lingerie business like victoria s secret the implication of a titillating sexually charged vibe means that sales associates are frequently harassed by men in the store who clearly have things in mind other than shopping advertisement advertisement i remember one guy was coming in and and the torso mannequins usually have bras and underwear on them laura skiles a former victoria s secret employee from california told the daily beast he was coming in and putting his finger underneath the underwear where the private parts of the mannequin would be i don t think i ever felt like i was in true danger but i definitely felt uncomfortable on a regular basis with interactions with male customers skiles said a lot of them were significantly older than us and i think they thought it was cute but we were just out of high school most of us or in our early twenties and we re trained to just be smiley and not told to stick up for ourselves photo illustrations by luis g rendon the daily beast getty skiles said she didn t think she or her coworkers ever spoke to management about the harassment we never really felt protected by management but we all looked out for each other advertisement advertisement the first time i had an encounter with a man trying to come onto me when i was working on the floor i d gone to my manager to say something and it was kind of like you re just going to have to put up with it and ignore it one woman who worked as a victoria s secret sales associate at a massachusetts mall as a teenager told the daily beast the guy must have come over on his lunch break or something because he was in a suit the former associate said of the incident he was like oh i m here shopping for my wife so we were just walking around and picking things out he said i d love to see this on you you should try it on for me i replied well you re shopping for your wife and he said oh i know but it would be great to see it on a model i said that s against store policy i could never do something like that and he was like oh come on it wouldn t hurt anybody it s not busy in here i said i still can t do that it s against the rules and he said ok that s fine then and was kind of annoyed that was the first and only time i had gone to management when a guy had made a creepy statement like that the associate said i was told to just let the customer say what they want and be like ok well i can t do that i never went to a manager again after that when it happened you just kind of had to fend for yourself alex a new york city fifth avenue victoria s secret employee recounted an experience her coworker had new york gets crazy there s a lot of mentally ill guys that do come in there was one guy who was screaming and sniffing the bras and underwear yelling at people my coworker told me that when she tried to tell the manager that she didn t feel safe they said oh just worry about filling the bag which means just pushing the products on more people and she s like but what about our safety they didn t offer anything for that advertisement advertisement i think sexual harassment is such a huge issue for the girls that work there a former fifth avenue employee who wished to remain anonymous said guys will come in hit on us and be like i think this looks super hot what s your breast size or they ll say this turns me on some guy came into the store and told my coworker at the front door you re giving me such a boner right now we have security at the door but security didn t kick the guy out she had to wait for the guy to leave and then make a report the anonymous fifth avenue employee said she didn t know how many of these reports were filed or how many just don t report because they figure it s just par for the course of working here there is no vs union the employee added and i m not sure if anyone ever reached out to a union i know i ve talked with my coworkers about it but i don t think any of us spoke to a union leader or anything the daily beast reached out to the retail wholesale and department store union for comment ming xi grace elizabeth cindy bruna gigi hadid kendall jenner and alexina graham walk the runway during the 2018 victoria s secret fashion show at pier 94 on november 8 2018 in new york city dimitrios kambouris getty images for victoria s secret the victoria s secret employee code of conduct reviewed by the daily beast states that we do not tolerate discrimination harassment or bullying examples of harassment or discrimination include giving unwanted sexual attention to others colleagues customers vendors and other business partners or third parties sexually explicit or suggestive comments or behavior and verbal non verbal visual or physical behavior that makes another person feel intimidated offended or uncomfortable advertisement advertisement this policy also applies to all customers vendors contractors business partners or potential business partners and other third parties when they are doing business with us or are on our premises and we expect and require that they will be treated with respect and that they will behave in ways that align with our culture of respect the code continues any customers vendors contractors or other business partners who believe they have been subjected to harassment discrimination or bullying should raise the incident to global ethics compliance or the ethics hotline the anonymous fifth avenue employee described a pretty strict dress code where girls have had to get a doctor s note in order to wear sneakers several employees said that their stores employed security guards but that the guards were generally more concerned with loss prevention than employee safety this combination of factors created an environment that many sales associates found chaotic and alarming i had just turned 19 when i started working at victoria s secret so there would be guys following me and they would literally have to hide me in the back of the store because you can t really kick someone out like that without causing a scene bunny a former sales associate from temecula california told the daily beast advertisement advertisement men would be like i m looking for something for my girlfriend or my wife and while they were doing that they would actively be flirting with me bunny added there was one time where a guy wrote his phone number on a perfume tester card he said yeah my baby mama kicked me out and then handed me his number i declined and he proceeded to attempt to persuade me so i went to the back of the store for a few minutes bunny said apparently he made a purchase and insisted to see me my manager asked him to leave and i stayed at the cash register for the rest of my shift for my safety thankfully that s as bad as it would get for me but the other problem were the shoe cleaner salespeople in the kiosk outside of the store they d harass us constantly even after being told to stop by managers and security that was a daily thing for the most part to ensure our safety we all left in groups at the end of the day there was this one guy who would always go in and smell all the underwear bee a former sales associate at a north carolina victoria s secret told the daily beast it was very creepy we had people have sex in the dressing room every now and then michelle told the daily beast one of my coworkers who was like a sister to me once had a guy who had been staring at her from across the way in the mall he ran inside the store and palmed her ass and was just like you re so beautiful she went to backhand him and it s like he had known it was coming he just bolted out the door she said i hate this this is not something you prepare for when you go to work advertisement advertisement i didn t ever really feel unsafe but i definitely was desensitized to sexual things a former victoria s secret worker from buffalo told the daily beast the safety and wellbeing of our associates and customers is our top priority and victoria s secret has a zero tolerance policy regarding any type of harassment or discrimination in our workplace victoria s secret told the daily beast in a statement in response to the experiences laid out in this article while we cannot control the actions or intentions of customers who enter our stores we are committed to protecting the health and safety of our associates we strive to create an environment where associates are safe and we encourage and expect them to speak up so every issue can be dealt

center which provides in the moment support to associates an extensive process for dealing with reports of incidents of harassment or discrimination creating a personalized protection plan for associates whose safety is threatened engaging mall security personnel or local law enforcement and deploying mental health professionals to stores where needed i couldn t believe the betrayal honestly for the buffalo worker and others the unwelcome attention on the part of customers was only one negative facet of their employment you would have to ask to go to the bathroom on the headset to leave your zone and then over the headset they d say didn t you already go recently and everyone can hear she recalled advertisement advertisement i was constantly dehydrated and hungry the buffalo worker claimed if i had snuck water on the floor made me go put it in the back i would hear the things that i was saying to customers all day long in my head while i was sleeping and when i woke up it wouldn t leave my head the buffalo worker added i even started to have to wear fake glasses that i would put on when i would go to work so that i could try to separate my personality because it became so encompassing she also started having panic attacks at work the buffalo worker found work elsewhere as a banker but the indignities of her old retail job still haunt her underwear is displayed in a window at a victoria s secret store on february 25 2021 in san francisco california justin sullivan getty images current and former employees also describe being driven to sell relentlessly by unsympathetic managers who also frequently required that staffers work late hours with no overtime and for low or minimum wages that rarely if ever increased advertisement advertisement i got into a car accident on my way home from work at victoria s secret the massachusetts former store worker told the daily beast we were there until like 2 a m because you had to make sure the store s clean before the next day it was winter and i was driving home and i ended up hitting a patch of black ice and my car spun out of control and i hit somebody s rock wall their property was up on a hill a little bit the worker said there was this rock wall and then a wooden fence above the rock wall so i hit that rock wall and their fence basically exploded she was terrified but unhurt her car s bumper though was ripped off in the accident the next morning she contacted her manager to call out from her scheduled shift the manager was really giving me a hard time the associate said she said well you have to come in here i was like i cannot come in my car s not safe to drive in this weather if i get into an accident with no bumper on my car i could hurt somebody and not just myself her manager was unmoved i think i was scheduled for maybe one more shift the associate said and then it was one of those you know you re iced out by your employer and not put on the schedule and then eventually you re just gone bee described being promised by management that she was being groomed for a management role herself bee says she was even encouraged to drop college courses and quit her other job at pacsun to dedicate more time to victoria s secret only for her store to be closed with no warning once we found out that the location was closing down the district manager just stopped communicating with all of us completely even the store manager bee told the daily beast they told us two days after christmas so they were like hey you have two weeks to find another job pretty much it was the most awful thing that has ever happened to me in a job i couldn t believe the betrayal honestly the managers were fine when i first started interviewing but on the day to day i found them pretty dismissive lauren a former victoria s secret employee from michigan told the daily beast lauren is a black woman and while she worked with three or four other black sales associates all the managers were white she told the daily beast in the back of your head you re wondering if that s the reason why you re not on the main floor or if that s the reason why they re dismissive of you they would schedule me first thing in the morning in the workout or the beauty section where no one would ever go lauren said in a follow up interview did this feel like a microaggression the trouble with racism is that you never really know lauren said you re never a hundred percent sure but they seem to almost always put me in that section it didn t seem like liked me very much compared to other coworkers lauren added they never offered any type of encouragement or even any conversation i can t even remember having a conversation with managers model adriana lima walks the runway at the 2013 victoria s secret fashion show at lexington avenue armory on november 13 2013 in new york city dimitrios kambouris getty images for victoria s secret nine of the 10 sales associates interviewed by the daily beast for this story also described feeling deeply uncomfortable with the company s credit card program which they were tasked with aggressively pitching to customers getting as many people to sign up for the card as possible became the most important job we had a former victoria s secret employee named laura from california said young teenagers many of whom had never had their own credit card before were encouraged to sign up for a victoria s secret credit card which came with interest rates of 20 to 30 percent and lines of credit that fluctuated unexpectedly several sales associates said employees said that it was a frequent occurrence that customers would return to victoria s secret soon after signing up for the card dismayed by the damage the program was doing to their credit it actually happened to my mother the anonymous former 5th avenue flagship employee told the daily beast she forgot to pay whatever 30 bill one day and this was with 20 percent or 30 percent apr or something crazy it just totally destroyed her credit victoria s secret is a toxic ex the brand s origin story is by now the stuff of retail legend in 1977 marketing professional roy raymond noticed how uncomfortable he felt shopping for lingerie for his wife in department stores and set out to launch a high end place that doesn t make you feel like a pervert as justin timberlake s character sean parker in the social network memorably put it in fact that description of the victoria s secret myth is so concise let s just stick with timberlake s aaron sorkin crafted summary raymond makes a half million dollars his first year starts a catalogue opens three more stores and after five years he sells the company to leslie wexner and the limited for 4 million happy ending right except two years later the company s worth 500 million and roy raymond jumps off the golden gate bridge there was no way raymond could have anticipated that in selling to wexner he d handed his life s work over to one of the most brilliant and ruthless marketing minds of the 20th century it would be many years later only after wexner s ties to convicted sex offender and billionaire wrangler jeffrey epstein came to light that the executive was finally forced to offload a majority stake of victoria s secret to a private equity firm in 2020 and the brand s golden age came to a sour end filipino model kelsey

november 8 2018 at pier 94 in new york city timothy a clary afp via getty images before the allegations that victoria s secret fostered a deeply misogynistic corporate environment before the reports of harassment and intimidation of the brand s exalted models before victoria s secret was lumped in with other popular brands blamed for promoting unattainable beauty standards in the early aughts for a time the underwear peddler could do no wrong by the 1990s victoria s secret was the biggest lingerie retailer in the united states with sales of 1 billion more wins followed the introduction of the victoria s secret fashion show a spectacle that dominated the public s imagination for many years before its 2019 cancellation and the establishment of the angels an elite roster of victoria s secret models whose presence as brand ambassadors became almost godlike the angels captured our imaginations directly anticipating the rise of the flawless social media influencer but in recent years epstein induced damage to the brand s image covid 19 store closures and an increase in cultural interest in body positivity rather than perfect bodies have knocked victoria s secret off its pedestal swerving away from its super sexy origins and towards the zeitgeist the brand announced a comfort line of intimates called love cloud earlier this year but the damage vs has sustained may be irreparable the brand s stock fell more than 20 percent over the previous six months cnbc reported in february and between 2019 and 2020 victoria s secret s revenue fell from 7 5 billion to 5 4 billion for some of the employees who spoke to the daily beast despite their negative in store experiences the air of fantasy that victoria s secret worked to cultivate can be difficult to shake off completely i had always wanted to work at victoria s secret ever since i was a teenager because i was obsessed with the brand and obsessed with the image of it amanda not her real name a former 5th avenue employee said i thought it was gonna be so much fun working there and it s not fun at all it s a hot mess years later for reasons she can t quite explain the buffalo worker still finds herself being pulled back i ll go into victoria s secret and observe the people selling things there and i want to offer advice to their management because i m that crazy about victoria s secret she said victoria s secret
