twitter has offered to pay 809 5m to settle a class action lawsuit filed in 2016 accusing it of misleading investors by falsely inflating its number of monthly active users the proposed settlement resolves all claims asserted against twitter and the other named defendants without any admission concession or finding of any fault liability or wrongdoing by the company or any defendant the web biz stated in an announcement twitter and the individual defendants continue to deny any wrongdoing or any other improper actions the micro blogging site said it is prepared to cough up the cash in the fourth quarter of 2021 according to a filing with america s financial watchdog the sec to put this in context twitter recorded a 1 13bn net loss in 2020 from revenues of 3 72bn the settlement thus represents about 80 days of annual sales doris shenwick a twitter shareholder sued the biz in federal district court in northern california on behalf of her fellow investors shenwick claimed executives at twitter told wall st analysts at an all day meeting in november 2014 that the social network s number of monthly active users maus was expected to jump to over 550 million in the intermediate term and over a billion over the longer term according to court documents when twitter announced its figures for its 2014 financial year in february 2015 bosses painted a rosy outlook for the company and said it expected to boost its popularity with new products and services in the near future at that time it said it had 288 million maus up 20 per cent year over year twitter also around that time stopped publishing certain metrics such as the number of timeline views making it difficult for investors to see how often users were actually visiting the site it s claimed for instance that twitter would send messages to dormant account holders to get them to log in just once and thus count as a monthly active user since 2018 the biz reports monetizable daily active users its stock price rose 17 per cent in one day to 48 01 after the annual results were revealed and sank following the next quarter its figures for q1 fy 2015 released at the end of april that year showed twitter maus had increased by only five per cent the stock price dropped by 18 per cent and another nine per cent the next day to 38 49 however the stock continued to trade at artificially inflated levels the lawsuit claimed because twitter assured investors that new initiatives to drive user growth and engagement were still in the early stages when the next financial report landed at the end of july twitter s stock price fell 15 per cent to 31 24 as the number of maus grew by only one per cent in other words growth was slowing or had stalled whereas the company earlier boasted maus were going to the moon or over a billion to be precise as a result of defendants false statements twitter common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the class period the lawsuit alleged and when the market realized the biz wasn t growing its audience as promised the company s stock was hammered by massive sales sending twitter s stock price down 40 per cent from its class period high of 52 87 per share on april 7 2015 and causing economic harm and damages to plaintiff and members of the class twitter was thus accused of making false and misleading statements by misrepresenting twitter s user engagement metrics and engaged in a scheme to deceive the market and breaking the securities exchange act of 1934 the lawsuit covers the events from february 2014 to july 2015 the hundreds of millions of dollars set to be paid by twitter will cover at least some of the money lost by investors from the tanked share price as well as lawyer fees a judge has to approve the settlement twitter declined to comment its share price today is funnily enough 60 95

democratic congressional leaders backed by the white house announced monday they would push ahead with a vote to fund the government and suspend the debt limit all but daring republicans who say they will vote againstit despite the risk of a fiscal crisis congress is rushing headlong into an all too familiar stalemate the federal government faces a shutdown if funding stops at the end of the fiscal year sept 30 at the same time the u s risks defaulting on its accumulated debt load if the borrowing limits are not waived or adjusted all this while democratic lawmakers are laboring to shoulder president joe biden s massive 3 5 trillion build back better agenda through the house and senate with stark opposition from republicans the american people expect our republican colleagues to live up to their responsibilities and make good on the debts they proudly helped incur wrote house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer in a joint statement get a weekly recap of the latest san francisco bay area housing news sign up for nbc bay area s housing deconstructed newsletter from the white house the president backed the congressional leaders plan to hold the votes this is a bipartisan responsibility just as it was under my predecessor biden said in a tweet blocking it would be inexcusable the magnitude of the challenges ahead and the speed required to accomplish the job are like nothing congress has faced in recent memory situating biden s entire domestic agenda and the political fate of his democratic party at a crucial moment as democrats charge ahead the republicans as the minority party in congress hoping to regain control in the next election in 2022 plan to sit back watching and waiting to see if biden and his allies can succeed against the odds or spectacularly fail senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he s not about to help pay off past debts when biden is about to pile on more with a reckless tax and spending package since democrats decided to go it alone they will not get senate republicans help with raising the debt limit i ve explained this clearly and consistently for over two months mcconnell said monday on the senate floor the vote this week on funding to keep the government running past sept 30 and allow more borrowing will force the political stalemate into the open the treasury department warned that it will soon run out of cash on hand and have to rely on incoming receipts to pay its obligations now at 28 4 trillion that could force the treasury to delay or miss payments a devastating situation doing so would likely precipitate a historic financial crisis wrote treasury secretary janet yellen in the wall street journal stocks on wall street closed sharply lower monday handing the s p 500 index its biggest drop in four months as worries about heavily indebted chinese real estate developers rippled across markets and investors have concerns that the u s federal reserve could signal that it s planning to pull back some of the support measures it s been giving markets and the economy once a routine matter lifting the debt ceiling has become a political weapon of choice for republicans in washington ever since the 2011 arrival of tea party lawmakers who refused to allow it at the time they argued against more spending and the standoff triggered a fiscal crisis echoing that strategy mcconnell is refusing to provide republican votes even though some gop senators might have a tough time voting no the package is expected to keep most spending at its current levels on a stopgap basis through the end of the year and include supplemental funds for the aftermath of hurricane ida and other natural disasters as well as money to help defray the evacuations from afghanistan tacking on legislative language to allow more borrowing would cover the nation s debt payments through 2022 republican sen john kennedy of louisiana whose state was battered by the hurricane and who is up for election next year said he will likely vote for it if the disaster relief portion is acceptable he added because my people desperately need the help when mcconnell was in control of the senate he relied on democratic votes to help raise the debt ceiling during the past administration and the democrats said they expect the same from him now it typically takes 60 votes to advance bills in what s now a divided 50 50 senate meaning at least 10 gop senators would be needed by withholding votes schumer said what republicans are doing is nothing short of a dine and dash of historic proportions meanwhile behind the scenes democrats are negotiating among themselves over biden s big 3 5 trillion package as the price tag likely slips to win over skeptical centrist lawmakers who view it as too much the size and scope of biden s build back better initiative cannot be overstated it touches almost all aspects of americans lives biden s plan aims to not just rebuild the country after the covid 19 crisis and economic fallout but begin to change longstanding federal spending patterns in ways that provide more services to more americans and attempt to level the growing income inequality that permeates the economy the proposal would impose tax hikes on corporations and wealthy americans earning beyond 400 000 a year and plow that money back into federal programs for young and old it would increase and expand government health education and family support programsfor households children and seniors and boost environmental infrastructure programs to fight climate change with republicans opposed in lockstep to biden s sweeping vision democrats have no votes to spare in the senate and just a few votes margin in the house pelosi has promised a sept 27 vote on a companion bill a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill of public works projects that enjoys widespread support from both parties in the senate though house republicans mostly oppose it even though that bipartisan bill should be an easy legislative lift it too faces a political obstacle course dozens of lawmakers in the congressional progressive caucus are expected to vote against it if it comes ahead of the broader biden package but centrists won t vote for the broader package unless they are assured the bipartisan bill will also be included

paul singer s elliott management has a fearsome reputation that has turned it into a 48 billion behemoth but the hype surrounding the firm doesn t match its results according to a new report by the communications workers of america and the soc investment group the soc investment group works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with the strategic organizing center a coalition of four unions representing more than four million members with more than 250 billion in assets under management not only is elliott s hedge fund an underperformer so are the companies that its activism targets the report claimed the cwa s report activist hedge fund risks to pension funds has a simple message to pension funds the negative long term effect elliott and other activist hedge funds have on public companies may dwarf any benefit pension funds receive as a limited partner in 2021 singer made institutional investor s coveted rich list earning 675 million in 2020 ranking 19th elliott s flagship fund earned more than 13 percent for the full year while the standard poor s 500 gained 18 4 percent during the same time period whatever singer s standing among hedge fund honchos the report noted that over the past several years elliott has underperformed both the s p 500 and a 60 40 blend of stock and bond investments as of march 31 over the prior 12 months elliott gained 14 78 percent net of fees while the s p 500 gained 56 35 percent and a 60 40 blend rose 31 67 percent the report said elliott has not provided superior risk adjusted returns and despite much marketing rhetoric has yielded absolute returns inferior to conventional investments according to the report over five years it said the annualized performance of elliott was 9 21 percent compared with a 16 30 annualized gain for the s p 500 and a 11 15 percent gain for the 60 40 blend like many other hedge funds elliott hasn t outperformed since the financial crisis to some extent that s because singer is risk averse and hedges everything elliott s volatility as the report noted is lower than even a 60 40 blend more to the point of the report however is that the cwa represents workers at at t which was the subject of an activist campaign by elliott starting in 2019 that has been accompanied by layoffs elliott is still an investor in at t the union is most interested in the effects on elliott s portfolio companies which it notes would affect the direct stock holdings of pension funds its research shows that elliott s activism produces a short term improvement by some measures but after a three year period following intervention elliott s portfolio companies total market return relative to risk revenue earnings leverage debt coverage and return on assets underperform an objectively identified set of control companies according to the report overall investors that hold onto a stock for three years after an elliott campaign will lose money with the most severe losses beginning after 24 months a few months beyond elliott s average investment holding of 1 8 years the study looked at several measurements and compared elliott s targets to similar companies finding that the targets grew more slowly were less profitable and took on more debt the elliott targets invested less in the business while allocating more resources to share buybacks and while other companies added jobs the targets of elliott had a decrease in employment the study showed we ve been aware of critiques of hedge funds impact on companies said hudson munoz cwa research analyst but it wasn t until the union learned of the academic work of mark desjardine assistant professor at penn state university s smeal college of business and rodolphe durand professor at hec paris that the cwa was able to do a rigorous analysis to prove the point the desjardine durand methodology uses a matching algorithm to identify companies with similar primary industries and operational performance trends to those that activist hedge funds have targeted but whether nor activist fund intervened the report explained the two union groups said they hired a consultant who uses the same approach to identify a control company for each of the 45 companies elliott targeted since 2010 however it did not include every activist campaign excluding companies like arconic dell technologies twitter and softbank the report looked at 20 measures of financial and operational performance from regulatory filings and proprietary databases it concluded that the underperformance by elliott targets is linked to a combination of increased debt reduced employment and wages reduced investment and increased share buybacks the cwa s partner in the paper the soc investment group also works with teamsters international the service employees international union and the united auto workers elliott declined to comment on the report but it did respond to an earlier blog post by desjardines and durand saying their criticisms of elliott target hess were flawed the assertions made by desjardine and durand regarding elliott s investment in hess are sloppy at best and intentionally misleading at worst the firm responded in its own blog post dated june 2020 the truth is that elliott s investment in hess is one of the best examples the authors could have found to demonstrate the benefits that equity activism can achieve as a result of elliott s long term involvement hess s performance inflected from perennial laggard to one of the industry s top performing companies the firm wrote in the blog and over the long run elliott has done exceptionally well the hedge fund firm has been in business for 45 years and has a 13 1 percent annualized return since inception compared with a 11 8 percent annualized return for the s p 500 according to elliott s second quarter letter to investors

bank stocks struggled monday as the yield on the 10 year u s treasury bill which is often a strong indicator of bank profits declined as a result of the broader market sell off what happened shares of many large bank stocks fell today along with the broader market sell off that saw the dow jones industrial average shed more than 600 points and the s p 500 index fall 1 7 shares of citigroup c 0 88 fell close to 4 while shares of bank of america bac 0 82 goldman sachs gs 0 82 and jpmorgan chase jpm 0 02 all dropped more than 3 today so what banks across the board are sliding today with the kbw nasdaq bank index which tracks the largest banks in the u s falling nearly 3 large banks are considered to be more stable so any kind of 3 or 4 move is significant the decline partly had to do with the broader market sell off which was stoked by fears surrounding the chinese real estate market and more specifically the large chinese property developer evergrande group which is facing billions in debt and potential default the scare sent investors leaving stocks and rushing into bonds when there is demand for bonds the price of bonds increases which inversely lowers the yield that those bonds pay out one of the biggest indicators of bank profits is the yield on longer term bonds such as the 10 year u s treasury bill which fell to around 1 31 today many bank loans are tied to yields on the five year and 10 year u s treasury bills so when the yields on those bonds fall so do most bank stocks seeing as most deposit costs at banks have bottomed at this point lower loan yields and the threat of loan yields staying lower for longer puts pressure on bank margins which in general is the difference between bank deposit costs and loan profits it s a little bit harder to tell why some banks are down more than others one potential reason could be individual bank exposure to china citigroup for instance is much more global and has some decent exposure the bank according to its recent quarterly filing has nearly 20 billion of assets in china which makes up about 1 1 of total loans at the bank bank of america also had about 14 billion of assets in china while jpmorgan also has nearly 20 billion of asset exposure in china i don t necessarily know if investors are basing their selling on banks with specific chinese exposure because the chinese real estate market is impacting the whole market but it s something to consider now what while it s been a tough day for the market and some are viewing evergrande as facing a similar situation as lehman brothers which infamously failed during the great recession i think it s probably too early to go into full panic mode just yet giles coghlan chief analyst at hycm told yahoo finance today that he believes it s very unlikely the chinese government will allow evergrande to fail stocks have been marching higher for a long time so i think markets are hypersensitive right now to any kind of bad news as a general market correction has been suspected for some time i still remain bullish on the long term outlook for banks right now bank stocks in my opinion benefited greatly from the pandemic and are in great shape to succeed when you consider that loan growth has been non existent for the last year banks have been adopting new technologies and interest rates will eventually march higher

the chain reaction may say more about the extreme altitude of global risk assets than it does about economic contagion a chinese property owner implodes and in short order the shares of american social media and auction companies are tumbling the chain reaction may say more about the extreme altitude of global risk assets than it does about economic contagion while it doesn t require excessive sleuthing to understand why commodity and banks are quaking in the vortex surrounding evergrande the link between the lender s travails and a stock like twitter inc or ebay inc are harder to see you ve got a whole basket of things to be concerned about throw this headline into the mix and that throws everything askew so there s going to be irrational de risking taking place that doesn t connect logically said art hogan chief strategist at national securities of the evergrande crisis does it make sense for technology stocks to be selling no but in a risk off scenario everything tends to be for sale even cryptocurrencies though there may not be an obvious connection between some u s tech stock and china that doesn t mean the selloff makes no sense sky high valuations have been bear fodder for months and federal reserve hawks are circling evergrande may seem like a flimsy rationale but monday s rout is similar in size to a half dozen other market plunges in 2021 that didn t require any news to ignite in fact investors took the opportunity to sell in a market that s been priced to perfection the russell 2000 index of smaller companies typically thought of as being more u s oriented and with less international exposure than the s p 500 led declines falling as much as 3 6 monday an index of regional banks stuffed with companies like bank of hawaii corp and pacwest bancorp lost 3 9 at one point the ishares msci emerging markets ex china etf which aims to excludes china fell more than 2 while twitter which is not directly accessible in the country lost more than 4 at one point and companies only operating in the u s like supermarket chain kroger co also dropped in other words lots of assets are getting embroiled in the selloff and i don t know that that s entirely appropriate said hogan still the word contagion is being thrown around due to evergrande s size the chinese real estate developer has about 300 billion worth of liabilities more than any other property developer in the world bloomberg has reported and it accounts for about 16 of outstanding notes in china s high yield dollar bond market though worries over the company s ability to service its debt have been percolating for weeks those concerns came into greater focus this week with some 83 5 million of interest on a five year dollar bond coming due thursday for the firm but

television with jonathan ferro for us it s much more of an underlying problem that is much more economic in nature and pervasive as opposed to something simply financial not all of monday s tumbles were without reason a goldman sachs basket of russell 1000 companies with the highest sales exposure to china fell as much as 3 3 during the session its worst day since mid may while another focused on stocks that are exposed heavily to supply chains in the country also tracked by the bank dropped 3 7 at its worst jerry braakman chief investment officer of first american trust in santa ana california said that it also makes sense that commodities like copper iron ore and crude oil would decline china is still a huge demand driver for basic commodities because they re doing all the manufacturing for us he said braakman also singled out some of the tech giants including apple inc and tesla inc with big china exposure apple in 2020 booked roughly 15 of its revenue in china a figure that clocked in at 21 for tesla according to data compiled by bloomberg to gene tannuzzo a portfolio manager at columbia threadneedle it s logical that names tied to china s property sector and related commodities would be hit so he and his team are watching slumping iron ore prices if other commodities follow it lower oil copper that is generally correlated with weaker returns for u s high yield and the latter still suggests risk of contagion is low he said everything is a little softer today but none of those charts look like iron ore yet wells fargo investment institute senior global market strategist sameer samana is also looking at high yield spreads for an inkling on whether a contagion is at hand to him the selloff in u s stocks is much more about extreme positioning and a relentless buy the dip mentality that may have cut into sidelined cash that s typically been used during drawdowns until high yield spreads in the u s widen further this should be viewed as an opportunity in u s equities he said

hamas has denounced the normalisation deals with israel because they are aimed at legitimatising the regime in the middle east and forging an alliance with tel aviv in a statement released last saturday evening the resistance movement described the so called abraham accords struck by the united arab emirates uae bahrain and several other arab countries with israel as very dangerous the agreements it said seek to assert the israeli regime s military political and economic hegemony over the region plunder its wealth marginalise the palestinian cause and isolate the palestinian nation from the rest of the arab and muslim world the movement warned that the normalisation agreements affect the aspirations of arab and muslim countries just as much as the palestinian people and jeopardise their national security bahrain s main opposition group al wefaq has also condemned the al khalifah regime s normalisation deal with israel as a crime and which does not reflect the will of the public hamas condemned the abraham accords as a zionist american project aimed at fomenting tensions between muslim and arab countries so as to sideline the middle east conflict and divert attention from the struggle against israel as the occupier of palestinian lands and the greatest threat to the region the agreements hamas said seek to exhaust the palestinian nation s resilience and marginalise palestinians and their resistance forces as well as anyone who supports them and stands with them they aim to give israel a free hand to advance its expansionist projects of expropriating palestinian lands judaising occupied east jerusalem al quds demolishing palestinian buildings and homes displacing palestinians and expanding settlements it said hamas also called on those countries that have signed these normalisation accords with israel to correct their wrong political approach and instead align themselves with the anti zionist ideals of the regional nations the movement finally called for a strong and effective strategy to confront all the projects aimed at liquidating the palestinian cause foremost among which are the so called abraham accords and the the deal of century crafted by former us president donald trump these normalisation deals were agreed when former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu signed them with emirati foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed al nahyan and bahrain s foreign minister abdullatif al zayani during an official ceremony hosted by trump at the white house on september 15 2020 in january 2001 sudan s ruling military junta also officially signed the abraham accords to normalise ties with israel then on december 10th last year the moroccan monarchy signed a deal brokered by the united states to normalise relations and israel has started up direct flights to marrakesh which have been loudly condemned by moroccan social media activists palestinians who are fighting against the occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and for their independent state with east jerusalem al quds as its capital condemn these normalisation deals as a betrayal of their cause meanwhile the united arab emirates uae has officially inaugurated its embassy in israel less than a year after the two sides agreed to establish formal relations under the us brokered deal the inauguration ceremony last wednesday was hosted by uae s ambassador to israel mohammad al khaja with the regime s president isaac herzog also in attendance the embassy is situated not in jerusalem but in the tel aviv stock exchange building also known as the bursa israel opened its embassy in the emirati capital in late june israeli foreign minister yair lapid inaugurated the israeli embassy in abu dhabi and the israeli consulate in dubai during a two day visit israel and the uae have signed a raft of deals in various areas ranging from tourism to aviation and financial services since they signed the normalisation agreement in august last year israeli ministers had previously visited the uae but lapid is the most senior israeli diplomat to have made the trip and the first to travel on an official mission the islamic jihad has denounced the uae for granting citizenship to 5 000 israelis in march a planned official visit by then israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to the uae was cancelled due to a dispute with jordan over the use of its airspace according to israeli officials a member of the palestinian fatah movement s central committee has condemned abu dhabi s crown prince mohammed bin zayed mbz as a traitor to the palestinian cause and demanded the united arab emirates be expelled from the arab league following their normalisation deal with israel abbas zaki warned if the uae s doors are opened to naturalise the zionists you will perish the people of the emirates are free and great and we do not attribute this betrayal to them because the only traitor is mohammed bin zayed zaki stated separately senior european ambassadors to israel including german and french officials boycotted an independence day ceremony on july 4th at the united states embassy in occupied jerusalem al quds according to a report by the jerusalem post the ambassadors decided not to attend the event because their countries consider jerusalem al quds to be an occupied city those who did take part in the ceremony reportedly included ambassadors from romania and the united kingdom as well as kosovo australia norway and canada trump sparked controversy by officially recognising jerusalem al quds as the israeli capital in december 2017 before moving the us embassy there from tel aviv in may 2018 guatemala and paraguay later followed in washington s footsteps but the latter reversed its decision after just four months israel lays claim to the entire city of jerusalem al quds but the international community views the city s eastern sector as occupied territory and palestinians claim it as the capital of their future state in a report last sunday the addameer prisoner support and human rights association said israeli forces have detained more than 100 palestinians since the daring jailbreak from the gilboa prison on september 6th the highly fortified maximum security jail is located in the northern part of the occupied territories and the six prisoners escaped through an underground tunnel which they dug with a spoon we have documented an average of 14 arrests per day in the occupied west bank since the men escaped milena ansari from addameer told al jazeera this does not include the palestinians arrested within israel israel launched a campaign of mass arrests and raids in the occupied cities of ramallah al khalil nablus and surrounding villages following the prison break a number of palestinian children were also swept up in the latest wave of arrests israeli forces in the occupied west bank have also arrested more relatives of the six palestinian escapees in the predawn hours of september 6th zakaria zubeidi a former commander of the al aqsa martyrs brigade in jenin and five islamic jihad members tunnelled their way out through their cell s drainage system and escaped from gilboa prison four of the islamic jihad members were serving life sentences while the fifth had been held without charge for two years under a so called administrative detention order according to israeli media over 4 500 palestinian political prisoners in israeli prisons then faced a repressive campaign by the tel aviv regime in the wake of the escape the israel prison service ips forced many palestinian prisoners into solitary confinement and restricted their access to essential services last saturday israeli media outlets reported that four of the escapees had been arrested in the northern part of the occupied territories following the arrests last week thousands of palestinians held protests across the occupied west bank in support of the six prisoners particularly those who d been recaptured the protests were held amid fears of an israeli retaliation that has already repressed hundreds of palestinian political prisoners the heroic jailbreak has come as a huge embarrassment to tel aviv and exposed fault lines in its much hyped security and intelligence apparatus the gilboa prison is one of the most highly fortified detention centres in israel the palestinian resistance groups and several political factions have warned israel against harming or endangering the life of any palestinian prisoner on sunday the israeli ministry of military affairs said that the two remaining palestinian prisoners had been apprehended early in the morning in the occupied west bank city of jenin it said the two palestinians were caught alive surrendering without resistance after troops encircled their building but palestinian media outlets said there were exchanges of gunfire during the pre dawn raid by israeli special forces palestine s wafa news agency reported on sunday that the israeli soldiers fired live bullets at protesters during the clashes which erupted in the neighbourhood following the raid injuring at least two who had to be hospitalised two other palestinians reportedly jenin residents were also arrested in the raid including a physically disabled man prison authorities keep palestinian inmates under deplorable conditions lacking proper hygienic standards the prisoners have also been subjected to systematic torture harassment and repression human rights organisations say israel violates all the rights and freedoms granted to prisoners by the fourth geneva convention there are reportedly more than 7 000 palestinians currently being held in israeli jails hundreds of them have been incarcerated under the practice of administrative detention where palestinians are held indefinitely without charge or trial endshamas has denounced the normalisation deals with israel because they are aimed at legitimatising the regime in the middle east and forging an alliance with tel aviv in a statement released last saturday evening the resistance movement described the so called abraham accords struck by the united arab emirates uae bahrain and several other arab countries with israel as very dangerous the agreements it said seek to assert the israeli regime s military political and economic hegemony over the region plunder its wealth marginalise the palestinian cause and isolate the palestinian nation from the rest of the arab and muslim world the movement warned that the normalisation agreements affect the aspirations of arab and muslim countries just as much as the palestinian people and jeopardise their national security bahrain s main opposition group al wefaq has also condemned the al khalifah regime s normalisation deal with israel as a crime and which does not reflect the will of the public hamas condemned the abraham accords as a zionist american project aimed at fomenting tensions between muslim and arab countries so as to sideline the middle east conflict and divert attention from the struggle against israel as the occupier of palestinian lands and the greatest threat to the region the agreements hamas said seek to exhaust the palestinian nation s resilience and marginalise palestinians and their resistance forces as well as anyone who supports them and stands with them they aim to give israel a free hand to advance its expansionist projects of expropriating palestinian lands judaising occupied east jerusalem al quds demolishing palestinian buildings and homes displacing palestinians and expanding settlements it said hamas also called on those countries that have signed these normalisation accords with israel to correct their wrong political approach and instead align themselves with the anti zionist ideals of the regional nations the movement finally called for a strong and effective strategy to confront all the projects aimed at liquidating the palestinian cause foremost among which are the so called abraham accords and the the deal of century crafted by former us president donald trump these normalisation deals were agreed when former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu signed them with emirati foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed al nahyan and bahrain s foreign minister abdullatif al zayani during an official ceremony hosted by trump at the white house on september 15 2020 in january 2001 sudan s ruling military junta also officially signed the abraham accords to normalise ties with israel then on december 10th last year the moroccan monarchy signed a deal brokered by the united states to normalise relations and israel has started up direct flights to marrakesh which have been loudly condemned by moroccan social media activists palestinians who are fighting against the occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and for their independent state with east jerusalem al quds as its capital condemn these normalisation deals as a betrayal of their cause meanwhile the united arab emirates uae has officially inaugurated its embassy in israel less than a year after the two sides agreed to establish formal relations under the us brokered deal the inauguration ceremony last wednesday was hosted by uae s ambassador to israel mohammad al khaja with the regime s president isaac herzog also in attendance the embassy is situated not in jerusalem but in the tel aviv stock exchange building also known as the bursa israel opened its embassy in the emirati capital in late june israeli foreign minister yair lapid inaugurated the israeli embassy in abu dhabi and the israeli consulate in dubai during a two day visit israel and the uae have signed a raft of deals in various areas ranging from tourism to aviation and financial services since they signed the normalisation agreement in august last year israeli ministers had previously visited the uae but lapid is the most senior israeli diplomat to have made the trip and the first to travel on an official mission the islamic jihad has denounced the uae for granting citizenship to 5 000 israelis in march a planned official visit by then israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to the uae was cancelled due to a dispute with jordan over the use of its airspace according to israeli officials a member of the palestinian fatah movement s central committee has condemned abu dhabi s crown prince mohammed bin zayed mbz as a traitor to the palestinian cause and demanded the united arab emirates be expelled from the arab league following their normalisation deal with israel abbas zaki warned if the uae s doors are opened to naturalise the zionists you will perish the people of the emirates are free and great and we do not attribute this betrayal to them because the only traitor is mohammed bin zayed zaki stated separately senior european ambassadors to israel including german and french officials boycotted an independence day ceremony on july 4th at the united states embassy in occupied jerusalem al quds according to a report by the jerusalem post the ambassadors decided not to attend the event because their countries consider jerusalem al quds to be an occupied city those who did take part in the ceremony reportedly included ambassadors from romania and the united kingdom as well as kosovo australia norway and canada trump sparked controversy by officially recognising jerusalem al quds as the israeli capital in december 2017 before moving the us embassy there from tel aviv in may 2018 guatemala and paraguay later followed in washington s footsteps but the latter reversed its decision after just four months israel lays claim to the entire city of jerusalem al quds but the international community views the city s eastern sector as occupied territory and palestinians claim it as the capital of their future state in a report last sunday the addameer prisoner support and human rights association said israeli forces have detained more than 100 palestinians since the daring jailbreak from the gilboa prison on september 6th the highly fortified maximum security jail is located in the northern part of the occupied territories and the six prisoners escaped through an underground tunnel which they dug with a spoon we have documented an average of 14 arrests per day in the occupied west bank since the men escaped milena ansari from addameer told al jazeera this does not include the palestinians arrested within israel israel launched a campaign of mass arrests and raids in the occupied cities of ramallah al khalil nablus and surrounding villages following the prison break a number of palestinian children were also swept up in the latest wave of arrests israeli forces in the occupied west bank have also arrested more relatives of the six palestinian escapees in the predawn hours of september 6th zakaria zubeidi a former commander of the al aqsa martyrs brigade in jenin and five islamic jihad members tunnelled their way out through their cell s drainage system and escaped from gilboa prison four of the islamic jihad members were serving life sentences while the fifth had been held without charge for two years under a so called administrative detention order according to israeli media over 4 500 palestinian political prisoners in israeli prisons then faced a repressive campaign by the tel aviv regime in the wake of the escape the israel prison service ips forced many palestinian prisoners into solitary confinement and restricted their access to essential services last saturday israeli media outlets reported that four of the escapees had been arrested in the northern part of the occupied territories following the arrests last week thousands of palestinians held protests across the occupied west bank in support of the six prisoners particularly those who d been recaptured the protests were held amid fears of an israeli retaliation that has already repressed hundreds of palestinian political prisoners the heroic jailbreak has come as a huge embarrassment to tel aviv and exposed fault lines in its much hyped security and intelligence apparatus the gilboa

treasury department officials say the federal government can continue operating without borrowing more money but only for a matter of weeks patrick semansky associated press when power in washington is split between democrats and republicans chances are good that lawmakers will reach an impasse over what once was a routine part of the budget process raising the federal debt limit we ve seen it in 1985 1995 a standoff that lasted into 1996 2002 2003 2011 2013 2014 and 2015 and it s happening again now the dispute this time isn t whether to raise the debt limit both sides agree that it must be done but how to do it senate republicans are insisting not only that democrats provide all the votes for the increase but also that they attach the increase to a budget reconciliation bill that bill which cannot be filibustered would expand social spending programs by 3 5 trillion over 10 years financed largely through tax increases on corporations and high income americans with control of the senate evenly divided republicans can block any attempt to increase the debt limit through a process other than reconciliation they used that power twice this week first by filibustering a house passed bill to suspend the debt limit through 2022 and fund the federal government into december 2021 then by preventing debate on a bill just to raise the debt limit advertisement advertisement democrats counter that the debt limit would need to be raised even if no new spending were approved increasing or suspending the debt limit does not increase government spending nor does it authorize spending for future budget proposals it simply allows treasury to pay for previously enacted expenditures treasury secretary janet l yellen wrote in a july 23 letter to congressional leaders the current level of debt reflects the cumulative effect of all prior spending and tax decisions which have been made by administrations and congresses of both parties over time the periodic squabbles over the debt limit start for different reasons but up to this point they ve all ended with congress agreeing to increase the limit before the treasury department ran completely out of money yet there s always the possibility that lawmakers will not reach an agreement in time forcing the treasury to leave some bills unpaid here s a quick guide to the issues and the stakes in the current fight what is the debt limit federal law puts a cap on the total amount of money the government may borrow from the public or from its own reserves such as the social security trust fund that s what is commonly known as the debt limit or the debt ceiling advertisement advertisement lawmakers have raised the debt limit repeatedly over the last century and in 2019 they suspended it entirely it kicked back in automatically on aug 1 forbidding the treasury to borrow any more than its outstanding debt at the time about 28 5 trillion according to the congressional budget office including 6 2 trillion in bonds held in the social security trust fund and other governmental reserves what if the debt limit isn t raised failing to lift the limit would force the federal government to renege on commitments it has already made simply because washington cannot maintain the status quo in federal programs without borrowing more money and going deeper into the red over the next few months the cbo estimated the treasury department expects to collect only 1 in tax revenue for every 2 it is bound by law to spend the recession triggered by the covid 19 pandemic is partly responsible for this budget gap as is the federal government s multitrillion dollar relief effort but the treasury s need to borrow also reflects decades of decisions by lawmakers and presidents of both parties on tax rates and benefit programs advertisement advertisement the treasury can meet the government s obligations for a while by relying on incoming tax revenue cash reserves and the extraordinary measures authorized by law such as delaying some payments to federal employees retirement accounts at some point however it won t have the funds needed to make a payment that was due whether it was paychecks for federal employees supplies for the military social security benefits reimbursements for doctors caring for medicaid and medicare patients or interest payments on treasury bills what would happen next is a bit of a mystery given that the federal government has never deliberately failed to make a payment the one thing that seems certain is that the ultra low interest rate the treasury pays on the bills notes bonds and other securities it sells to raise money a rate that reflects the securities status as the world s safest investments would go up we got a preview of this in 2011 when congress flirted with a default and the standard poor s credit rating agency downgraded u s debt according to the government accountability office the uncertainty caused by that brinksmanship made it more expensive for the treasury to borrow money costing taxpayers 1 3 billion that fiscal year an actual default would raise u s interest costs more dramatically financial experts say and the effects would quickly ripple throughout the country s economy because the interest rate on treasury securities serves as the benchmark for many other loans advertisement advertisement interest rates for state and local government corporate and consumer borrowing including home mortgage interest would all rise sharply timothy geithner then the obama administration s secretary of the treasury warned in a 2011 letter to congress equity prices and home values would decline reducing retirement savings and hurting the economic security of all americans leading to reductions in spending and investment which would cause job losses and business failures on a significant scale there would be consequences for the global financial system too in 2011 matthew zames an investment banker who chaired the treasury borrowing advisory committee said treasury securities were the world s most widely used collateral underpinning large parts of the financial markets around the world a default could trigger a wave of actions against borrowers who put up treasury securities as collateral leading to a debt sell off and a damaging reduction in the availability of credit zames said the potential result he said was another recession couldn t the treasury delay some payments some opponents of raising the debt limit argue that washington could avoid defaulting by using incoming tax revenue to cover interest payments on u s debt and postponing payments on other things there are at least two problems with the idea advertisement advertisement first wall street experts say the financial markets are likely to view the treasury s failure to make any payments as a default even if bondholders keep getting their money and second it s not at all clear that the treasury department has the legal authority to pick and choose which payments to make the gao has argued that there s nothing in the law that stops the treasury from prioritizing payments in a 1985 letter to the senate finance committee it tentatively concluded treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the united states according to a 2015 report from the congressional research service however the treasury department insists that it has no authority to treat some payments as more important than others even if it would be wise to do so instead the department contends it must pay the federal government s bills in the order they re received a second problem the report said is that the federal impoundment control act limits the administration s ability to delay or withhold spending that s been approved by congress prioritizing payments because of a debt limit impasse the report said could constitute the sort of action prohibited by the act which bars the administration from delaying or withholding spending for policy reasons advertisement advertisement a third issue is more practical as treasury officials have said several times over the years the department is not set up to pick and choose which obligations to pay instead its systems are designed to pay bills when they re presented so while it might be humane to prioritize retirement and disability checks for example or it might help avoid a global panic to prioritize payments on u s debt the treasury may not be able to do so what happens next the house narrowly passed a bill on sept 29 to suspend the debt limit until mid december 2022 with all but one vote in favor coming from democrats its prospects in the senate seem grim however given republicans insistence that the debt limit be raised as part of reconciliation republicans argue that the reconciliation bill offers democrats the simplest way to raise the debt limit and avert a default as direct as that path might seem however it includes some significant hurdles advertisement advertisement in particular schumer has said that there s not enough time left before a possible default to add the debt limit increase to the reconciliation bill currently progressive and moderate democrats are fighting over the size and content of the reconciliation proposal they re also engaged in an increasingly bitter tussle over whether to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill a top priority for moderates before the reconciliation bill moves at this point it s not clear that democrats can gather a majority behind the reconciliation proposal before the treasury hits the debt ceiling wall this story originally appeared in los angeles times

treasury department officials say the federal government can continue operating without borrowing more money but only for a matter of weeks when power in washington is split between democrats and republicans chances are good that lawmakers will reach an impasse over what once was a routine part of the budget process raising the federal debt limit we ve seen it in 1985 1995 a standoff that lasted into 1996 2002 2003 2011 2013 2014 and 2015 and it s happening again now the dispute this time isn t whether to raise the debt limit both sides agree that it must be done but how to do it senate republicans are insisting not only that democrats provide all the votes for the increase but also that they attach the increase to a budget reconciliation bill that bill which cannot be filibustered would expand social spending programs by 3 5 trillion over 10 years financed largely through tax increases on corporations and high income americans with control of the senate evenly divided republicans can block any attempt to increase the debt limit through a process other than reconciliation they used that power twice this week first by filibustering a house passed bill to suspend the debt limit through 2022 and fund the federal government into december 2021 then by preventing debate on a bill just to raise the debt limit advertisement democrats counter that the debt limit would need to be raised even if no new spending were approved increasing or suspending the debt limit does not increase government spending nor does it authorize spending for future budget proposals it simply allows treasury to pay for previously enacted expenditures treasury secretary janet l yellen wrote in a july 23 letter to congressional leaders the current level of debt reflects the cumulative effect of all prior spending and tax decisions which have been made by administrations and congresses of both parties over time the periodic squabbles over the debt limit start for different reasons but up to this point they ve all ended with congress agreeing to increase the limit before the treasury department ran completely out of money yet there s always the possibility that lawmakers will not reach an agreement in time forcing the treasury to leave some bills unpaid here s a quick guide to the issues and the stakes in the current fight what is the debt limit federal law puts a cap on the total amount of money the government may borrow from the public or from its own reserves such as the social security trust fund that s what is commonly known as the debt limit or the debt ceiling lawmakers have raised the debt limit repeatedly over the last century and in 2019 they suspended it entirely it kicked back in automatically on aug 1 forbidding the treasury to borrow any more than its outstanding debt at the time about 28 5 trillion according to the congressional budget office including 6 2 trillion in bonds held in the social security trust fund and other governmental reserves what if the debt limit isn t raised failing to lift the limit would force the federal government to renege on commitments it has already made simply because washington cannot maintain the status quo in federal programs without borrowing more money and going deeper into the red over the next few months the cbo estimated the treasury department expects to collect only 1 in tax revenue for every 2 it is bound by law to spend the recession triggered by the covid 19 pandemic is partly responsible for this budget gap as is the federal government s multitrillion dollar relief effort but the treasury s need to borrow also reflects decades of decisions by lawmakers and presidents of both parties on tax rates and benefit programs advertisement the treasury can meet the government s obligations for a while by relying on incoming tax revenue cash reserves and the extraordinary measures authorized by law such as delaying some payments to federal employees retirement accounts at some point however it won t have the funds needed to make a payment that was due whether it was paychecks for federal employees supplies for the military social security benefits reimbursements for doctors caring for medicaid and medicare patients or interest payments on treasury bills what would happen next is a bit of a mystery given that the federal government has never deliberately failed to make a payment the one thing that seems certain is that the ultra low interest rate the treasury pays on the bills notes bonds and other securities it sells to raise money a rate that reflects the securities status as the world s safest investments would go up we got a preview of this in 2011 when congress flirted with a default and the standard poor s credit rating agency downgraded u s debt according to the government accountability office the uncertainty caused by that brinksmanship made it more expensive for the treasury to borrow money costing taxpayers 1 3 billion that fiscal year an actual default would raise u s interest costs more dramatically financial experts say and the effects would quickly ripple throughout the country s economy because the interest rate on treasury securities serves as the benchmark for many other loans interest rates for state and local government corporate and consumer borrowing including home mortgage interest would all rise sharply timothy geithner then the obama administration s secretary of the treasury warned in a 2011 letter to congress equity prices and home values would decline reducing retirement savings and hurting the economic security of all americans leading to reductions in spending and investment which would cause job losses and business failures on a significant scale there would be consequences for the global financial system too in 2011 matthew zames an investment banker who chaired the treasury borrowing advisory committee said treasury securities were the world s most widely used collateral underpinning large parts of the financial markets around the world a default could trigger a wave of actions against borrowers who put up treasury securities as collateral leading to a debt sell off and a damaging reduction in the availability of credit zames said the potential result he said was another recession advertisement couldn t the treasury delay some payments some opponents of raising the debt limit argue that washington could avoid defaulting by using incoming tax revenue to cover interest payments on u s debt and postponing payments on other things there are at least two problems with the idea first wall street experts say the financial markets are likely to view the treasury s failure to make any payments as a default even if bondholders keep getting their money and second it s not at all clear that the treasury department has the legal authority to pick and choose which payments to make the gao has argued that there s nothing in the law that stops the treasury from prioritizing payments in a 1985 letter to the senate finance committee it tentatively concluded treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the united states according to a 2015 report from the congressional research service however the treasury department insists that it has no authority to treat some payments as more important than others even if it would be wise to do so instead the department contends it must pay the federal government s bills in the order they re received a second problem the report said is that the federal impoundment control act limits the administration s ability to delay or withhold spending that s been approved by congress prioritizing payments because of a debt limit impasse the report said could constitute the sort of action prohibited by the act which bars the administration from delaying or withholding spending for policy reasons a third issue is more practical as treasury officials have said several times over the years the department is not set up to pick and choose which obligations to pay instead its systems are designed to pay bills when they re presented so while it might be humane to prioritize retirement and disability checks for example or it might help avoid a global panic to prioritize payments on u s debt the treasury may not be able to do so advertisement politics after a summer of criticism political pressure on kamala harris eases for now politics is a strange business all the attention paid to kabul and the coronavirus has taken some of the pressure off vice president kamala harris who spent the early part of the summer taking heat over the large increase of migrants heading to the u s mexico border what happens next the house narrowly passed a bill on sept 29 to suspend the debt limit until mid december 2022 with all but one vote in favor coming from democrats its prospects in the senate seem grim however given republicans insistence that the debt limit be raised as part of reconciliation republicans argue that the reconciliation bill offers democrats the simplest way to raise the debt limit and avert a default as direct as that path might seem however it includes some significant hurdles in particular schumer has said that there s not enough time left before a possible default to add the debt limit increase to the reconciliation bill currently progressive and moderate democrats are fighting over the size and content of the reconciliation proposal they re also engaged in an increasingly bitter tussle over whether to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill a top priority for moderates before the reconciliation bill moves at this point it s not clear that democrats can gather a majority behind the reconciliation proposal before the treasury hits the debt ceiling wall

ronald d white los angeles times brian bonilla was riding his handmade titanium bike recently when he glimpsed dozens of giant cargo ships anchored outside the los angeles and long beach california ports waiting for a chance to dock and unload their goods typically only a handful of ships might be forced to wait like that or they wouldn t have to wait at all bonilla works for the cub house a san marino bike shop making sure new bikes are properly adjusted for their riders he knew that the floating traffic jam was a sign that the cub house and every other u s bike shop might be waiting a long while for goods they hoped to be selling for the holidays what we are trying to prep for right now at the store is christmas time bonilla said usually during christmas time kids bikes essentially sell themselves but at the moment we re trying to figure out how we re going to get the kids bikes available for us although it s only september this is the all important shipping season for products headed to u s merchants holiday shopping displays toys electronics sporting goods and ugly christmas sweaters normally the global supply chain of international goods movement is like a light switch on a wall it just works the products consumers want are available no one thinks about how no one thinks about the light switch until it doesn t work and right now the global supply chain isn t working challenges it s been snarled by a host of factors the pandemic booming consumer demand raging storms shortages of cargo ships and containers as well as a lack of people willing to drive trucks or stock shelves in warehouses and retail stores for the wages offered that has led to a sense of urgency uncharacteristic for this time of year a number of leaders with a broad range of economic expertise have a message for consumers get your holiday shopping done right now come the traditional buying surge time when the weather turns a bit colder it may be too late because retailer inventory will be thin be prepared to accept your second or even third choice look for local or u s items make your own gifts if you wait be prepared to wait some more some products originally planned for the holiday season probably won t arrive until sometime in 2022 there s no certainty that if your child or the children in america are looking for a particular toy that it will be around ed desmond an executive vice president at the toy association trade group said at a news conference last week what we might see is a lack of a variety spending boost stuck at home and flush with stimulus payments u s consumers began spending with enthusiasm last year and haven t stopped there were plenty of shipping nightmares last holiday season and experts fear that will repeat this year in june the national retail federation bumped up its estimate for 2021 retail sales predicting growth of 10 5 to 13 5 to more than 4 44 trillion in 2021 that was substantially higher than the 6 5 to 8 2 growth that the trade group predicted in february even the ports of los angeles and long beach which make up the fastest seaport complex in the u s and move more cargo in a month than many ports handle all year can t work fast enough the neighboring ports which last year handled nearly a third of u s imported products are moving record numbers of steel cargo containers most from china and other asian countries we re getting into the full peak season said gene seroka executive director of the nation s largest seaport the port of los angeles every node of this supply chain is maxed out backlogs a record 89 cargo ships were anchored or drifting offshore one afternoon last week waiting to enter the l a and long beach ports to be unloaded according to the marine exchange vessel traffic service seroka described cargo containers piled up on the docks by the thousands waiting for a ride on the short railroad line within the ports that takes the steel boxes to their next trip by transcontinental rail others are driven by trucks to warehouses before they head to retailer shelves but railroads also are reporting backlogs which add to product delays and trucking companies say they don t have enough drivers warehouses and retailers also complain that they can t get enough workers some items are slower to get into the transportation network because the pandemic has disrupted operations at some asian factories and seaports in june a covid 19 outbreak shut part of the yantian port in china one of the world s busiest it has since reopened and when the items get to the docks there aren t enough cargo ships or containers because companies mothballed ships last year to save money early in the pandemic lockdown when consumers weren t spending said keith jelinek managing director at the global consulting firm berkeley research group in emeryville calif now that we have a lot of demand we have fewer ships he said costs soaring that means shipping prices have soared the price to move a cargo container across the pacific ocean is now about 10 000 to 15 000 up from 2 700 to 2 900 a year ago jelinek said those costs have helped feed rising consumer prices the labor department said in august that consumer prices jumped 0 5 from june to july the smallest increase since february prices jumped 5 4 compared with a year earlier as cargo movement is stalled by ship port truck and rail problems the effects will vary across the nation said james zahn deputy editor of the toy book a leading trade publication for the toy industry this is something we haven t really seen in the toy industry before and that s regional outages on specific items zahn said something might be plentiful in one state or even one city in the next one over the shelves are completely bare because of how it s filtered out within this strange distribution cycle as a dad with two little girls i know what it s like to be chasing things if you go to amazon you ll start noticing that the delivery dates are actually further out than they usually are so shop early yes you ve got to be checking out independent toy stores that are staffed by folks that actually know toys and if we come down to a point where something hot might be sold out those folks can easily recommend another great toy for the kids that you re shopping for at the cub house supply shortages pushed owners sean talkington and carla alcibar to start the store s own brand called beach club the store s staff has built 45 bikes using some of the last shipments of parts and components received before the pandemic the problem returns however when their current supply sells out

media can be a lucrative business for those with big follower counts and the prowess to push customers toward financial products creators can get paid anywhere from 100 to 1 500 for a swipe up advertisement on their instagram stories to 1 000 to 10 000 for a single post on their feed according to figures from brian hanly ceo of bullish studio a talent agency for influencers on tiktok the cost of one post can range from 2 500 to 20 000 depending on the video s virality and the creator s follower count to get there creators have to develop a certain persona and on fintok and its instagram counterpart there s enough variety for everyone creators from a variety of ages backgrounds and ethnicities offer advice about how to open a roth ira how to invest in real estate how trading options makes more sense if you compare it to buying makeup or how to use astrology to predict the price of bitcoin take sacks aka mrs dow jones the influencer with 215 000 instagram followers she explains compound interest by comparing it to billie eilish s fame or bitcoin to jennifer lopez and ben affleck s rekindled romance sacks 30 began her career in comedy working for tv host david letterman and saturday night live producer lorne michaels learning about money was a struggle for sacks but one way to make it more relatable for her was to compare it to pop culture and celebrity gossip on that premise she launched mrs dow jones in 2017 and her following has since flourished i created what i needed and other people needed it too if you re following me you like pop culture so we have that shared language said sacks if you can understand the human relationship between two celebrities then you can understand any financial concept four years after launching mrs dow jones sacks has signed with a talent agency and has built a team of people including an assistant and a manager to help her negotiate six figure deals with brands she started partnering with wealthfront two years ago she s a financial popstar when have you heard that take on anything said wauck of wealthfront the way that she relates everything to pop culture is just so genius sacks is also taking advantage of the recent demand for personal finance content by providing a course on her website finance is cool on monday her followers will be able to purchase a 115 course designed to teach them how to manage their money among other pop culture references in the course sacks used the characters from the tv show friends to guide her followers through building an emergency fund other people s money while social media is allowing companies to reach young customers faster than ever they need to ensure against working with internet stars who are fast and loose with information there s so much room for growth said hanly there s not enough financial creators out there to basically take on the amount of opportunity that s coming in and there s not nearly enough high quality preaching the good word financial creators personal finance content on social media has gone viral for offering questionable even flat out wrong advice while get rich quick schemes have attempted to lure in novice investors that s taken many forms including videos on how to become a millionaire by selling dog beds on amazon through dropshipping how using a debit card makes you financially irresponsible how to make a lot of money day trading on foreign exchanges or what stocks to buy and when to buy them that s why tiktok tightened its rules in may the social media company said it would take action against content creators who post sponsored videos for financial services and products without clear labels companies can still pay financial influencers for posts but the new restrictions are meant to ensure that creators are transparent when disclosing commercial links since then betterment said it moved all of the content from its tiktok influencers over to instagram and instagram reels hankwitz has not re entered into an agreement with betterment for tiktok videos since wealthfront said it was optimizing other channels like youtube and instagram and instead was mostly relying on tiktok s paid advertising platform rather than posts through influencers fighting misinformation with compliance as fraudulent content and misinformation run rampant and unchecked financial corporations looking for quality creators are putting in place hefty vetting processes betterment s compliance and legal teams perform detailed reviews of their social media partners scripts influencers will then shoot the video and send it back to compliance for a second review wealthfront said that it does extensive background checks on the influencers that get selected to partner with them before signing any contracts it also includes stipulations in the contracts that allow wealthfront to cancel if certain terms are violated by the creators the main law that governs financial influencers is the investment advisers act of 1940 which specifies what qualifies as investment advice and who must register with state and federal regulators in order to provide it but there s one exemption that reduces the risk to influencers according to joshua escalante troesh a registered financial advisor and founder of purposeful strategic partners unregistered individuals can dispense financial advice if they do so through a publication of regular and general circulation that legal exemption is where a lot of people are hanging their hats on until a court case happens it s hard to say one way or another he said ultimately it will be the sec or a state going after an influencer for harming citizens in a court case that will determine whether they qualify for an exemption or not still anyone who is harmed by financial advice online could sue in civil court escalante troesh said but whether a punishment is warranted would vary based on the regulators of the case and the state that they are located the prevalence of personal misinformation that exists on tiktok and the demand for solid finance advice are what vivian tu 27 a former stock trader at j p morgan believes made her account yourrichbff blow up as soon as she launched it she published her first video on jan 1 telling tiktokers that if they were looking for an account that would help them learn honest financial literacy tips hers was it overnight her video got 1 million views and within a week she d amassed 170 000 followers it wasn t long before financial institutions took notice wealthfront credit karma fintron invest insurify and tastyworks are among her approximately 10 sponsors she has more than half a million followers on tiktok and gets paid anywhere from 3 000 to 4 000 per post for someone with a full time job it s a huge commitment she said outside of her current full time day job she spends anywhere from 10 to 15 hours per week managing her account it was very out of the norm some people make videos for months and don t have this kind of scale tu said it was around the time folks were getting stimulus checks people were thinking about money more so than usual and i think people were also very sick of seeing a lot of misinformation still on her tiktok bio page she cautions that her videos are not financial advice nothing i say should be taken as prescriptive direction tu said personal finance is never one size fits all for everyone

timing the port authority was scheduled to vote on the plan monday afternoon but jack hedge the executive director of utah inland port authority called it off just before the meeting was supposed to begin at this time as executive director i ve chosen to delay the vote in an attempt to bring this public infrastructure district discussion back to merit arguments and not further fuel the political fires hedge said in a statement the decision to postpone the vote happened as a group of about two dozen protesters lined up outside of the authority s headquarters located at the 111 main building in downtown salt lake city the protesters holding signs reading repeal the port and slc taxpayers don t want to pay for a polluting port cheered as deeda seed an organizer for stop the polluting port coalition informed them that the meeting was canceled the fight is not over but i think all of you thank you for coming you ve made a difference she told the crowd around her members of stop the polluting port coalition holds signs outside the offices of the utah inland port authority in salt lake city on monday sept 20 2021 protesting the port authority s planned vote to adopt a public infrastructure district shafkat anowar deseret news the utah inland port authority plan itself which was first revealed on sept 8 calls for bonds to finance large public infrastructure projects hedge explained in that meeting that they would seek to fill existing gaps in utah s importing and exporting logistics system that includes rail improvements a transloading facility and an alternative energy refueling station but the logistics of the plan garnered questions from city leaders salt lake city mayor erin mendenhall and salt lake city council chairwoman amy fowler co signed a letter dated thursday directed at hedge and jill flygare the port authority s chief operating officer asking them to delay the monday vote until their questions could be answered we have serious concerns about the speed and lack of detailed information with which the uipa board is being asked to approve the creation of a public infrastructure district and the issuance of up to 150 million in debt to be repaid by tax increment that would typically be controlled and appropriated by salt lake city s elected officials as property tax revenue the letter states mendenhall and fowler pointed out that the interest rate for the debt could be up to 8 5 which means it would cost taxpayers 255 million over a 35 year term of the loan they said that rate is more than three times the interest rate salt lake city received when issuing municipal bonds without a defined list of the projects that will be funded through the pid salt lake city is concerned about whether it will ultimately be required to own and maintain this infrastructure they added in a statement issued monday mendenhall said she is pleased that the port authority agreed to delay the vote we appreciate having additional time to understand the implications of this proposal and look forward to more questions being answered in the days and weeks ahead she said seed credits the delay to a mixture of public outrage and the salt lake letter she said she s pleasantly surprised with the delay adding it was the first time the port authority has ever responded to concerns over their plans members of stop the polluting port coalition holds signs outside the offices of the utah inland port authority in salt lake city on monday sept 20 2021 protesting the port authority s planned vote to adopt a public infrastructure district shafkat anowar deseret news throughout the course of the 25 minute protest members of stop the polluting port coalition spoke out against the future of the state s inland port they asserted that it is too expensive and will only worsen the state s air quality which is already a concern there are very legitimate questions that have not been answered at all about this and it s good that they responded and are postponing the vote seed said although they can vote at any time what we want to see is a full explanation of how they intend to use this money and the public has not had that information nor has the city for that matter that needs to happen they need to be more transparent about what they intend to do meanwhile in addition to postponing a vote on the bond hedge and flygare penned a response to salt lake leaders monday in it they explained that the plan fits well within the law and that some of the projects proposed actually aren t planned for salt lake city for instance the alternative fueling facility is proposed to be located in west valley city they also clarified that the current law allows the port authority the ability to issue public infrastructure districts as municipalities can do in both cases landowner consent is required in order to impose a pid property tax the consent of the landowner taxpayer is also required they wrote adding that port authority public infrastructure districts are different because they are a separate governmental entity with its own board once created while they didn t refute the 8 5 interest rate claim they also argued that the current interest rates are the lowest they have been in over three decades that s why they wanted to speed up the timing of the bond neither slc nor any person can guarantee that the interest rates will remain low if the funding is delayed hedge and flygare wrote the proposed resolutions do not require the issuance of any bonds by uipa but do initiate a calendar runway to the potential issuance of the bonds while rates remain at historical lows the port authority didn t provide a new date for when the bond will be voted on seed said she would welcome any efforts by the agency to be more transparent about projects including the proposed bond she said that the port authority has operated behind closed doors since its inception in 2018 when we ask for information we don t get it she said we want information so that a human health risk assessment can be conducted you know help us understand the health impacts of it i ve been in public policy for like 30 years this is the worst example i ve ever seen of public policymaking it s terrible frankly she s hopeful that monday s postponed vote will end up as a turning point in her concerns with the agency

updated september 20 2021 at 5 56 pm et stock markets from hong kong to new york were hit by a major sell off on monday as a massive chinese real estate conglomerate called china evergrande group faces a potentially devastating debt default the dow jones industrial average slumped 614 points its worst performance in about two months after earlier falling more than 900 points the s p 500 and nasdaq also fell sharply posting their worst daily percentage falls since mid may the evergrande group owes roughly 300 billion and investors fear a default could destabilize the financial system in china one of the world s top economies the worries about evergrande come at a delicate time for wall street which has gone from a record setting run earlier this year to hefty falls this month investors are facing a growing list of worries from the delta variant to a potential debt default by the u s government here at home here are three things to know about the stock market so what s going on with evergrande evergrande is one of china s biggest property developers and it s in big trouble in a stock filing this month evergrande said flat out that there is no guarantee that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations so far evergrande s efforts to offload office buildings and attract new investors haven t helped and the company has hired a team of outside advisers but a big question is how the chinese government will intervene if at all china has been growing increasingly concerned about debt levels in the country especially in its overheated property sector a default would raise concerns about the stability of china s financial system and some investors worry about contagion when fear tied to a major event spreads noel celis afp via getty images afp via getty images the china evergrande group headquarters in shenzhen in southeastern china a default would raise concerns about the stability of china s financial system weren t things already rough on wall street yes they were the dow jones has declined in each of the three previous weeks a rarity in a year marked by a string of record highs september is traditionally a tough month for markets this year there are several factors weighing down on stocks the delta variant is a top concern as it continues to spread across the country threatening the economic recovery already airlines are saying they are seeing more cancellations and fewer bookings the uncertainty raises the stakes for the federal reserve which meets on tuesday and wednesday fed chairman jerome powell has said the central bank plans to start removing some of the massive market support it s currently providing to markets a process known as the bond taper that support has come in the form of purchases of 120 billion in government bonds and mortgage backed securities each month and there are also worries about a debt default by the u s government treasury secretary janet yellen has said the u s could run out of money to pay its bills in october if congress does not raise the debt ceiling something that is far from certain at a time when democrats have only a razor thin majority in an op ed in the wall street journal yellen warned a debt default would lead to a widespread economic catastrophe greg nash pool via ap pool via ap treasury secretary janet yellen testifies before a senate appropriations subcommittee on capitol hill in june yellen is warning of a potential economic catastrophe if congress does not raise the debt ceiling so what happens next halfway through september all three major indexes have declined trading on wall street is likely to remain volatile as investors proceed with caution they ll pay close attention to the fed s plans and they ll watch what is happening in china and economic data will continue to be important perhaps the most important factor will be what happens with the delta variant which has led many companies to push back return to work dates wall street forecasters are already paring back their expectations for gains this year and many are predicting a short term pullback that said markets have suffered bouts of uncertainty since the pandemic began and they ve eventually regained their footing to continue a march toward new record highs copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

it s been giving markets and the economy the s p 500 fell 75 26 points or 1 7 to 4 357 73 it s biggest drop since may at one point the benchmark index was down 2 9 the biggest decline since last october the s p 500 was coming off two weeks of losses and is on track for its first monthly decline since january the s p 500 has gone an unusually long time without a pullback of 5 or more the dow

dropped 3 3 for its biggest loss since july european markets fell about 2 what s happened here is that the list of risks has finally become too big to ignore said michael arone chief investment strategist at state street global advisors there s just a lot of uncertainty at a seasonally challenging time for markets related articles no recycling symbols on plastics do not mean an item can always be recycled the worries over chinese property developers and debt have recently centered on evergrande one of china s biggest real estate developers which looks like it may be unable to repay its debts the fear is that a potential collapse there could send a chain reaction through the chinese property development industry and spill over into the broader financial system similar to how the failure of lehman brothers inflamed the 2008 financial crisis and great recession those property companies have been big drivers of the chinese economy which is the world s second largest if they fail to make good on their debts the heavy losses taken by investors who hold their bonds would raise worries about their financial strength those bondholders could also be forced to sell other unrelated investments to raise cash which could hurt prices in seemingly unrelated markets it s a product of how tightly connected global markets have become and it s a concept the financial world calls contagion many analysts say they expect china s government to prevent such a scenario and that this does not look like a lehman type moment nevertheless any hint of uncertainty may be enough to upset wall street after the s p 500 has glided higher in almost uninterrupted fashion since october besides evergrande several other worries have been lurking underneath the stock market s mostly calm surface in addition to the fed possibly announcing that it s letting off the accelerator on its support for the economy congress may opt for a destructive game of chicken before allowing the u s treasury to borrow more money and the covid 19 pandemic continues to weigh on the global economy regardless of what the biggest cause for monday s market swoon was some analysts said such a decline was due the s p 500 hasn t had even a 5 drop from a peak since october and the nearly unstoppable rise has left stocks looking more expensive and with less room for error all the concerns have pushed some on wall street to predict upcoming drops for stocks morgan stanley strategists said monday that conditions may be ripening to cause a fall of 20 or more for the s p 500 they pointed to weakening confidence among shoppers the potential for higher taxes plus inflation to eat into corporate profits and other signs that the economy s growth may slow sharply even if the economy can avoid that worse than expected slowdown morgan stanley s michael wilson said stocks could nevertheless drop about 10 as the fed pares back on its support for markets the fed is due to deliver its latest economic and interest rate policy update on wednesday earlier this month stifel strategist barry bannister said he expects a drop of 10 to 15 for the s p 500 in the final three months of the year he cited the

hong kong bloomberg how far will chinese president xi jinping go with his crackdown on china s real estate sector the question has suddenly become an urgent one on trading desks around the world after months of treating the crisis at indebted developer china evergrande group as largely contained global investors on monday sept 20 rushed to price in the risk that mr xi will miscalculate as he tries to curb china s property market excesses without derailing the economy the resulting market turbulence may add pressure on chinese leaders to tap the brakes on policy tightening or at least take steps to limit the fallout goldman sachs group analysts called for the authorities to send a clearer message on how they plan to stop evergrande from causing significant spillovers to the broader economy citigroup said officials may commit a policy error of over tightening economists at societe generale assign a 30 per cent probability to a hard landing even though most people don t expect evergrande to collapse all of a sudden the silence and a lack of major actions from policy makers is making everyone panic said mr shuang ding chief economist for greater china and north asia at standard chartered in hong kong i expect china to at least offer some verbal support soon to stabilise sentiment the sell off on monday left few risky assets untouched hong kong s hang seng index tumbled more than 3 per cent led by real estate companies equity benchmarks in germany and italy lost more than 2 per cent while the s p 500 index fell 1 7 per cent for its biggest drop in four months the average price of junk rated united states dollar notes from chinese borrowers slid the most in about a year a nearly 12 per cent intraday slump in iron ore futures made matters worse as did holiday closures in many asian markets the chinese authorities who recently hired advisers to look into evergrande have provided no public assurances that there is a state led plan to resolve the crisis official media commentary has largely avoided the subject apart from a tabloid that said evergrande was an isolated case and called out western outlets for bashing the chinese economy there has been no clear evidence of state funds stepping into the domestic stock market like they did in march the response so far has been largely limited to the people s bank of china which injected a net 90 billion yuan us 18 8 billion into the banking system on friday it added another 100 billion yuan on saturday evergrande has around us 300 billion s 405 6 billion worth of liabilities more than any other property developer in the world it is a whale in china s high yield dollar bond market accounting for about 16 per cent of outstanding notes some us 83 5 million of interest on a five year dollar bond comes due on thursday and failure to pay within 30 days may constitute a default evergrande also needs to pay a 232 million yuan coupon on an onshore bond the same day evergrande s shares lost as much as 19 per cent on monday briefly taking its market value to the lowest on record the stock closed 10 per cent lower with policymakers showing no signs of wavering on property market deleveraging the latest headlines regarding evergrande likely suggest that housing activity may deteriorate further in the absence of the government providing a clear path toward an eventual resolution goldman economists led by dr hui shan wrote in a sunday note with more than 200 offshore and almost 2 000 onshore subsidiaries evergrande has about two trillion yuan in assets equivalent to 2 per cent of china s gross domestic product according to goldman sachs calculations a messy spillover into an already slowing housing market could be costly with real estate accounting for 40 per cent of household assets in china data last week showed home sales by value slumped 20 per cent last month from a year earlier the biggest drop since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic early last year the authorities appear determined to push ahead with their campaign to deleverage as well as cool the property market mr guo shuqing the chief banking regulator last year identified banks excessive exposure to the property market as the biggest risk facing the financial system the challenge for officials is how far to go before their tough measures threaten to create the kind of financial instability that they are trying to avoid regulators are increasing efforts to tame land and home prices that have fueled china s property industry and much of its economic growth china has in recent months tightened mortgage approvals and raised rates for first time buyers introduced rental controls in cities and suspended some centralised land sales chinese banks are being told to lower their lending to home buyers and officials in may revived the idea of a national property tax the government last year drafted what are known as three red lines debt metrics that developers will have to meet if they want to borrow more china will do what it takes to ease the impact said saxo bank head of equity strategy peter garnry for china it is about structuring the right communication and make the right plan for how real estate should look like under the new policy direction when that is done they will move quickly and in great size

markets are a means not an end access to investing therefore is a means to achieving an outcome the debate around payment for order flow seems to have lost that critical point centering on whether the increased access to free trading for retail investors is worth the money wholesalers earn to execute their orders this debate is misguided pointing fingers at retail brokers or market makers that turn a profit ignores the more substantive issues plaguing retail investors many people in this country want some version of the same thing financial security and stability in the future this need takes every possible shape and form across the socioeconomic spectrum a fortunate group roughly 25 of americans generate retail stock market trades to help realize their financial goals while access alone does not increase your likelihood of a desired return it s an important step but that step isn t without a cost mazi bahadori as the sec considers where to focus its time and energy on this issue we as an industry need to examine retail investors objectives and the foundations of order flow payments that provides critical insight into where attention should be paid to actually protect retail investors in the history of capital markets there have always been intermediaries wholesalers who pay for order flow are just one of many however insofar as the end investor is concerned the focus should be on whether there s a benefit to using a go between wholesalers add value to retail investors by producing price improvement for their orders the investor gets a better price for their order than what they would get from a national exchange you can certainly have a philosophical debate over who gets the difference and many argue that all price improvement should go to the investor and not even a fraction of a penny should go to the retail broker selling order flow that s a worthwhile debate but once investors realize that if they received all of the price improvement available brokers would need to start charging commissions again the debate ends take the following example an investor uses a broker that sends orders to a wholesaler to buy 10 shares of apple the bid is 150 25 and a wholesaler is offering 150 10 the investor is getting 15 cents of price improvement per share or a total savings of 1 50 the retail broker that routed the order to the wholesaler also gets a few pennies for that flow alternatively the investor could forgo any price improvement pay the bid and send the broker a commission given the history of retail brokers that commission is almost always going to exceed the price improvement obtained so the investor winds up paying more what would an investor rather do most reasonable people would opt for a wholesaler with order flow payments to get price improvement and avoid a commission proponents of increased regulations are pushing for a ban on payments and caps on commissions we could take that approach but we generally don t demand cost saving pass throughs as a regulatory schema and there s a far better way to solve this let the market sort out who best takes care of their customers again if access to investing were the only goal we d probably already have a winner in the market but it isn t and as a new generation of investors eventually experiences an inevitable bear market they ll learn that going it alone not consulting with a professional and trading on reddit and tiktok tips isn t how they ll realize their financial goals when that happens many investors will find a new home for financial advice one that s far less concerned with methods and more focused on objectives the debate on order flow payments will be old news and we ll probably end up debating fiduciary standards again while wholesalers claim to have delivered over 3 6 billion in price improvements to investors in 2020 they also earned billions of dollars of revenue in the process and certain retail brokers do a lousy job explaining their process of internalization so it s natural that this generates some regulatory interest but here are some troubling statistics that the sec doesn t appear to be paying attention to only 39 of americans could afford a 1 000 emergency expense and 44 of americans don t own a single stock etf or mutual fund most of those investors who access the market don t consult with a professional advisor before investing of those who use a financial advisor most are uncertain if their advisor is a fiduciary or not there are significant problems preventing investors from achieving better outcomes unfortunately restructuring how brokers internalize orders and use wholesalers wouldn t even make the top 50 list of priorities that can help bridge that gap the sec could do far better to focus on brokers obligations to their clients investor education in understanding the fiduciary standard revisions to reg bi that apply a useful standard of care to self directed investing the list goes on but we ll first need to return to basic principles acknowledging that markets are a means not an end investor outcomes not investor activity are where regulators can be most helpful in the spirit of full

photo taken on september 7 shows a view of the china national convention center in beijng capital of china xinhua the chinese government holds no intentions of taking a passive approach should leaders in washington london and brussels choose to pursue china containment and economic decoupling strategies for the moment anti china sentiments have risen at alarming levels in australia united states canada united kingdom and european union accordingly thereâ s chatter among investment bankers in new york london and elsewhere that stock exchanges outside of asia could block ipoâ s initial public offerings registrations from companies based in chinaâ s mainland the us sec securities and exchange commission has already imposed strict scrutiny over the applications of ipos from chinese companies and donâ t be surprised if washington places added pressure on other international stock exchanges to follow up on similar procedures the us government believes they have the upper hand to force beijing to bow down to their wishes but thatâ s unlikely the chinese governmentâ s response is to boost its domestic financial industries encourage chinese publicly shared companies listed in us stock markets to return to re listing on the bourses of hong kong shanghai and shenzhen and thereâ s a new twist chinese president xi jinping delivered a keynote address at ciftis china international fair for trade in services on september 2 in beijing and he announced plans for the opening up of the beijing stock exchange he assured the public that china will deepen reforms in the financial services sector while the new stock exchange will serve as an alternative finance mechanism for chinaâ s small and medium sized enterprises smes the beijing stock exchange will be dubbed â new third board â which is an upgrade from a market entity currently known as the â national equities exchange quotationsâ neeq diving into deeper details chinaâ s mainland two major stock exchanges such as chinext in shenzhen that was launched in 2009 and shanghai based star board in 2018 also promote smes for public listings they are similar to nasdaq a stock exchange for over the counter publicly traded companies that are heavily weighted with science and hi tech companies sci tech firms are considered high risk as the startups are routinely low on capitalization at the beginning while many of them go bankrupt for failing to generate sufficient revenues accordingly the china securities regulatory commission csrc had required high market capitalization and revenues for companies to qualify for ipos listed on the bourses of shanghai and shenzhen the requirements are stringent so beijing has tried to make it easier for companies to get listed with star but there had been unexpected delays and challenges that ensued hence the beijing stock exchange opening up is expected to introduce 66 â selectâ stocks listed on the neeq for public trading which include the companies speedbird a metal sheet manufacturer tongyi aerospace a specialized rubber products maker and zhulaoliu a packaged food firm according to cnbc the beijing stock exchange has already announced a gathering for public comments that will continue until september 22 to address operationsâ rules as well as the procedures for listing trading and membership management on the new bourse as of sept 3 cgtn reports the beijing stock exchange has completed its registration with capital â 1 billion yuan 155 million according to the national enterprise credit information public system the neeq serves as the sole shareholder the beijing municipal administration for market regulations granted approval for the â third new board â nonetheless bse stocks can only originate from companies listed on the neeq for 12 months and there are price target restrictions and holdings limits price movements are not restricted on first day of trading but they can be suspended for 10 minutes during market hours if the price rises by over 30 percent or drops 60 percent after the stockâ s first trading day daily price movements canâ t exceed 30 percent up or down and if so trading restricted that day in regards to ipo pricing the target price can be no less than 80 percent of the market price after an investor purchase the stocks they cannot sell it until at least six months later in other words the beijing stock exchange will not act similar to other stock exchanges where traders can buy and sell the same shares within seconds or minutes photo taken on august 24 2020 shows the shenzhen stock exchange in shenzhen south chinaâ s guangdong province xinhua easier for smes despite the strict trading rules president xi has offered words of praise â we will continue to support the innovation driven development of small and medium sized enterprises smes by deepening the reform of the new third board national equities exchange and quotations and setting up a beijing stock exchange as the primary platform serving innovation oriented smes â cao yanghui director of nanhua futures research institute a brokerage based in hanghzhou explained to cnbc that the announcement of the beijing stock exchange demonstrates how china is â proceeding at a relatively fast paceâ to revamp chinaâ s ipo registrations to make it easier for smes to go public â if everyone felt previously that the ipo registration system was rather distant then it may now be close at hand â cao added when speaking with cnbc the wall street bank morgan stanley delivered a positive statement as well in a note posted by one of its equities analysts katherine liu â we see beijing exchange as positioned to support mid small sized firms and as a hub where the best of those firms can go to list on shanghai and shenzhen exchanges â it should be noted that companies expected to join the â third new boardâ will not be smes that are science or hi tech oriented they will be more focused on services and supply chains the diplomat magazine speculates that the beijing stock exchange would replicate germanyâ s mittelstand â rhineland capitalism which favors networks of highly specialized firms contributing to global supply chains of world leading advanced industrial products additionally smes that are private enterprises have long struggled to receive loans and generous financing from chinaâ s state owned banks meanwhile the csrc described the beijing stock exchange as a â major strategic developmentâ to promote high quality development of chinaâ s capital markets as reported by quartz china is taking the right steps here a man takes photos of a big screen displaying stock prices at the listing ceremony of the first batch of registration based initial public offerings ipos of enterprises debuted on the chinext board at shenzhen stock exchange in shenzhen south chinaâ s guangdong province august 24 2020 xinhua going into overdrive china is playing it smart with plans for the beijing stock exchange chinaâ s smes will benefit greatly from the project the stock markets in the us and europe have been very influential over the capital markets but new global trends are emerging more fortunes

updated september 20 2021 at 5 56 pm et stock markets from hong kong to new york were hit by a major sell off on monday as a massive chinese real estate conglomerate called china evergrande group faces a potentially devastating debt default the dow jones industrial average slumped 614 points its worst performance in about two months after earlier falling more than 900 points the s p 500 and nasdaq also fell sharply posting their worst daily percentage falls since mid may the evergrande group owes roughly 300 billion and investors fear a default could destabilize the financial system in china one of the world s top economies the worries about evergrande come at a delicate time for wall street which has gone from a record setting run earlier this year to hefty falls this month investors are facing a growing list of worries from the delta variant to a potential debt default by the u s government here at home here are three things to know about the stock market so what s going on with evergrande evergrande is one of china s biggest property developers and it s in big trouble in a stock filing this month evergrande said flat out that there is no guarantee that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations so far evergrande s efforts to offload office buildings and attract new investors haven t helped and the company has hired a team of outside advisers but a big question is how the chinese government will intervene if at all china has been growing increasingly concerned about debt levels in the country especially in its overheated property sector a default would raise concerns about the stability of china s financial system and some investors worry about contagion when fear tied to a major event spreads noel celis afp via getty images afp via getty images the china evergrande group headquarters in shenzhen in southeastern china a default would raise concerns about the stability of china s financial system weren t things already rough on wall street yes they were the dow jones has declined in each of the three previous weeks a rarity in a year marked by a string of record highs september is traditionally a tough month for markets this year there are several factors weighing down on stocks the delta variant is a top concern as it continues to spread across the country threatening the economic recovery already airlines are saying they are seeing more cancellations and fewer bookings the uncertainty raises the stakes for the federal reserve which meets on tuesday and wednesday fed chairman jerome powell has said the central bank plans to start removing some of the massive market support it s currently providing to markets a process known as the bond taper that support has come in the form of purchases of 120 billion in government bonds and mortgage backed securities each month and there are also worries about a debt default by the u s government treasury secretary janet yellen has said the u s could run out of money to pay its bills in october if congress does not raise the debt ceiling something that is far from certain at a time when democrats have only a razor thin majority in an op ed in the wall street journal yellen warned a debt default would lead to a widespread economic catastrophe greg nash pool via ap pool via ap treasury secretary janet yellen testifies before a senate appropriations subcommittee on capitol hill in june yellen is warning of a potential economic catastrophe if congress does not raise the debt ceiling so what happens next halfway through september all three major indexes have declined trading on wall street is likely to remain volatile as investors proceed with caution they ll pay close attention to the fed s plans and they ll watch what is happening in china and economic data will continue to be important perhaps the most important factor will be what happens with the delta variant which has led many companies to push back return to work dates wall street forecasters are already paring back their expectations for gains this year and many are predicting a short term pullback that said markets have suffered bouts of uncertainty since the pandemic began and they ve eventually regained their footing to continue a march toward new record highs copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

many economists think the fed will formally announce a pullback in november in response to a steady recovery from the pandemic recession and an acceleration in inflation that has raised widespread concerns this week s fed policy meeting could lay the groundwork for that announcement when their meeting ends wednesday fed officials are set to keep their short term benchmark interest rate which affects many consumer and business loans near zero they are also likely maintain their 120 billion in monthly bond purchases which are intended to hold down long term loan rates in december the fed said it would continue those purchases until the economy had made substantial further progress toward its goals of maximum employment and annual inflation averaging 2 percent over time in a speech last month fed chair jerome powell said such progress had already been met for inflation with prices having spiked this year amid shortages of manufactured goods and components from cars and computer chips to paint and building materials powell also said clear progress had been achieved in job growth and that if hiring remained healthy it could be appropriate to start reducing the bond purchases this year a surprisingly weak august jobs report made it less likely that the fed would formally announce a reduction in september and more likely it would do so in november or december the central bank could signal in a statement it will release after its meeting ends wednesday that it plans to soon announce a reduction in the pace of its bond purchases and powell could reinforce that message in a news conference to follow a dud of an october jobs report could change these plans said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan chase and a former fed staffer but it would probably take something quite bad to knock them off track now the fed on wednesday will also update its quarterly projections for growth unemployment and inflation through 2024 it will also provide a forecast for how its benchmark rate will change into 2024 in their previous such estimate in june fed officials collectively forecast that they would begin raising their key short term rate in 2023 this week it s possible that the updated forecast will predict the first rate hike by the end of 2022 the fed s rate forecasts are unlikely to prove accurate particularly for 2024 but they can provide insights into how quickly policymakers think they will need to raise rates in coming years at his news conference powell will face a delicate task he will try to signal that the fed will soon begin withdrawing its economic stimulus while simultaneously reassuring investors consumers and business leaders that it won t move so fast as to derail the recovery from the recession and powell will surely stress that a move to pare or taper its bond purchases doesn t mean the fed will soon begin raising its benchmark rate a step that would have a bigger impact on the economy over time he has has to strike a fine balance between continuing to be accommodative while inching toward the exit said priya misra head of global rates strategy at td securities one way to reassure investors would be to signal a relatively slow pace of tapering the fed is now buying 80 billion in treasurys and 40 billion in mortgage bonds each month many economists expect it to reduce the treasury purchases by 10 billion a month and mortgage backed bonds by 5 billion that would mean the taper would take about eight months to complete but some presidents of regional fed banks worry that current high levels of inflation will persist well into 2022 and are pushing for the taper to finish by the middle of next year so the fed could start raising rates in the second half of 2022 these officials include james bullard of the st louis fed and raphael bostic of the atlanta fed and fed vice chair richard clarida a close powell ally surprised many observers last month by suggesting that the fed s goals of maximum employment and 2 percent annual inflation could be met by the end of 2022 a sign that clarida could support a rate hike then if this week s updated forecasts envision an initial rate hike sometime next year that would mean a rate hike would quickly follow tapering and would suggest that the fed is worried about excessive inflation the last time the fed started reducing bond purchases was in december 2013 after the great recession it took 10 months to taper those purchases the fed then didn t raise its short term rate until more than a year later in december 2015 a quick taper and a rate hike in 2022 would be a more aggressive timetable than financial markets now expect david wilcox a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a former director of research at the fed said that even though higher inflation could persist longer than the fed may have initially expected it could still fade as the economy normalizes without requiring higher interest rates holding back may be the right answer he said john williams president of the new york fed suggested last week that the fed won t raise rates until it s reached its goal of maximum employment though the fed hasn t defined that goal it is likely an unemployment rate below 4 percent the jobless rate was 5 2 percent in august there is still a long way to go williams said

many economists think the fed will formally announce a pullback in november in response to a steady recovery from the pandemic recession and an acceleration in inflation that has raised widespread concerns this week s fed policy meeting could lay the groundwork for that announcement when their meeting ends wednesday fed officials are set to keep their short term benchmark interest rate which affects many consumer and business loans near zero they are also likely maintain their 120 billion in monthly bond purchases which are intended to hold down long term loan rates in december the fed said it would continue those purchases until the economy had made substantial further progress toward its goals of maximum employment and annual inflation averaging 2 percent over time in a speech last month fed chair jerome powell said such progress had already been met for inflation with prices having spiked this year amid shortages of manufactured goods and components from cars and computer chips to paint and building materials powell also said clear progress had been achieved in job growth and that if hiring remained healthy it could be appropriate to start reducing the bond purchases this year a surprisingly weak august jobs report made it less likely that the fed would formally announce a reduction in september and more likely it would do so in november or december the central bank could signal in a statement it will release after its meeting ends wednesday that it plans to soon announce a reduction in the pace of its bond purchases and powell could reinforce that message in a news conference to follow a dud of an october jobs report could change these plans said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan chase and a former fed staffer but it would probably take something quite bad to knock them off track now the fed on wednesday will also update its quarterly projections for growth unemployment and inflation through 2024 it will also provide a forecast for how its benchmark rate will change into 2024 in their previous such estimate in june fed officials collectively forecast that they would begin raising their key short term rate in 2023 this week it s possible that the updated forecast will predict the first rate hike by the end of 2022 the fed s rate forecasts are unlikely to prove accurate particularly for 2024 but they can provide insights into how quickly policymakers think they will need to raise rates in coming years at his news conference powell will face a delicate task he will try to signal that the fed will soon begin withdrawing its economic stimulus while simultaneously reassuring investors consumers and business leaders that it won t move so fast as to derail the recovery from the recession and powell will surely stress that a move to pare or taper its bond purchases doesn t mean the fed will soon begin raising its benchmark rate a step that would have a bigger impact on the economy over time he has has to strike a fine balance between continuing to be accommodative while inching toward the exit said priya misra head of global rates strategy at td securities one way to reassure investors would be to signal a relatively slow pace of tapering the fed is now buying 80 billion in treasurys and 40 billion in mortgage bonds each month many economists expect it to reduce the treasury purchases by 10 billion a month and mortgage backed bonds by 5 billion that would mean the taper would take about eight months to complete but some presidents of regional fed banks worry that current high levels of inflation will persist well into 2022 and are pushing for the taper to finish by the middle of next year so the fed could start raising rates in the second half of 2022 these officials include james bullard of the st louis fed and raphael bostic of the atlanta fed and fed vice chair richard clarida a close powell ally surprised many observers last month by suggesting that the fed s goals of maximum employment and 2 percent annual inflation could be met by the end of 2022 a sign that clarida could support a rate hike then if this week s updated forecasts envision an initial rate hike sometime next year that would mean a rate hike would quickly follow tapering and would suggest that the fed is worried about excessive inflation the last time the fed started reducing bond purchases was in december 2013 after the great recession it took 10 months to taper those purchases the fed then didn t raise its short term rate until more than a year later in december 2015 a quick taper and a rate hike in 2022 would be a more aggressive timetable than financial markets now expect david wilcox a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a former director of research at the fed said that even though higher inflation could persist longer than the fed may have initially expected it could still fade as the economy normalizes without requiring higher interest rates holding back may be the right answer he said john williams president of the new york fed suggested last week that the fed won t raise rates until it s reached its goal of maximum employment though the fed hasn t defined that goal it is likely an unemployment rate below 4 percent the jobless rate was 5 2 percent in august there is still a long way to go williams said
do you want to fully understand and maximize your employee stock purchase plan at work here are twelve tips to help you get there 1 what is an employee stock purchase plan an employee stock purchase plan espp is a benefit offered by several large companies such as hilton disney or apple it allows you as an employee to buy company stock at a discounted price you can usually purchase espp plan stock worth 1 to 15 of your salary up to the 25 000 irs limit per calendar year if you participate your employer will deduct your contribution directly from your paycheck your employer will then purchase the company stock for you typically at the end of a 6 month period you will usually get an email from human resources twice a year asking if you d like to participate and whether you d like to change your contribution amount 2 what are the benefits of an employee stock purchase plan an employee stock purchase plan allows you to buy company stock at a bargain price discounts usually range from 5 to 15 for example if you work and participate in hilton s espp you can buy hilton stock at a 15 discount if hilton s stock is trading at 130 share they ll buy it at 110 50 share for you if you decide to sell it immediately you get a profit the difference between your purchase price and the trading or selling price in this scenario if you decided to buy 20 000 worth of hilton stock via their employee stock purchase plan program with a 15 discount you would have made a 3 000 profit it s like free money if you play it right it gets even better most espp plans have a lookback provision this allows you to buy the stock either at the purchase date price or the price when the espp plan was offered whichever is lower so using the above example if hilton s stock price was 110 share when the espp plan was offered to you the discount can be applied on the 110 share instead of 130 share trading price which significantly increases your discount 3 do you pay taxes on an employee stock purchase plan no taxes are due when you buy the company stock under an employee stock purchase plan when you sell the stock you pay either ordinary income or capital gains tax on the gain and you pay ordinary income tax on the discount if you sell the stock immediately after it was purchased you will have to pay ordinary income taxes on your gain profit based on your federal income tax bracket if your tax bracket is 24 then you have to pay 24 taxes on your profit your profit is the difference between the price you sold the stock for and the price you bought it for in our above example if you bought 100 shares of hilton stock via its espp plan at 110 share 11 000 cost and sold it immediately for 130 share 13 000 value then your profit is 2 000 if you re in the 24 tax bracket you owe uncle sam 480 if you live in a state with state income taxes then you also have to pay state income taxes on that profit if you sell the stock after holding it for at least one year the taxation of employee stock purchase plans gets favorable but complicated instead of paying an ordinary income tax rate you pay the lower long term capital gains rate which is 15 for most americans you also need to sell it at least two years after the espp offering period began to get this favorable tax treatment remember that human resources email using our above example let s say what are your taxes on this employee stock purchase plan example ordinary income taxes with an espp you pay ordinary income taxes on the discount portion of the purchase compute the difference between either hilton stock price at offering 130 share or when they purchased it for you 140 share whichever is lower 130 share and the price you bought it 110 5 19 50 share discount if you bought 100 shares then your ordinary income profit is 1 950 if you re in the 24 federal income tax bracket then your ordinary income taxes on this sale is 468 capital gains taxes remember that most espp plans have a lookback provision which allows you to buy the stock either at purchase date price or the price when the espp plan was offered in our example the offering price 130 share is lower than the trading price 140 share so the discount will be applied at the offering price compute the difference between the price you sold it for 170 share and the offering price 130 share 40 share profit since you bought 100 shares your capital gains profit is 4 000 if your capital gains tax rate is 15 then your capital gains taxes on this sale is 600 total taxes due on this employee stock purchase trade 468 of ordinary income taxes and 600 of capital gains taxes 1 068 if you did not hold the stock for at least a year after selling it your total taxes all ordinary income taxes would be 1 428 170 share less 110 5 share 59 50 share times 100 shares times 24 tax rate you saved about 25 in taxes in a qualified sale espp long term capital gains makes a difference if you sold the stock for a loss you can declare that capital loss in schedule d social security and medicare taxes do not apply for espp plans in summary are employee stock purchase plans taxable after you sell the stock yes you ll have to pay ordinary income tax and capital gains tax on the price gain depending on how long you held it plus ordinary income taxes on the discount 4 is espp reported on w2 in the year you sell your espp shares your employer may report your ordinary income profit on your w 2 this is equivalent to your purchase price discount you have to look closely at your w2 if your ordinary income profit was not reported you still will have to report that on your 1040 as other income visit to find out the answers to the other 7 questions about employee stock purchase plans

the food emergency in sri lanka explained a video explainer on the economic crisis in sri lanka leading to speculations of a food shortage in the country sri lanka s government declared an economic emergency on august 30 2021 amid rising food prices a depreciating currency and rapidly depleting forex reserves president gotabaya rajapaksa has appointed major general n d s p niwunhella as the commissioner general of essential services to coordinate and ensure that people have access to essential supplies why is sri lanka s economy in trouble a number of factors have led to the current economic crisis in sri lanka including the tourism industry being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic the forex reserves dropping from over 7 5 billion in 2019 to around 2 8 billion in july this year the supply of foreign exchange drying up and the value of the sri lankan rupee depreciating by around 8 so far this year the amount of money that sri lankans have to shell out to purchase the foreign exchange necessary to import goods has risen the country depends heavily on imports to meet even its basic food supplies so the price of food items has risen in tandem with the depreciating rupee what does a food emergency mean the emergency regulations allow the government to provide food items and other essentials at fixed prices by buying up stock from traders the capping of food prices can lead to severe shortages as demand exceeds supply at the price fixed by the government when supplies are seized from traders there is lesser incentive for them to bring in fresh supplies to the market this can lead to a further drop in supplies and even higher prices for essential goods further the decision of the sri lankan central bank to ban forward contracts and the spot trading of rupees at above 200 rupees to an american dollar may affect essential supplies is there a food shortage while the sri lankan government has denied reports of a food shortage there is fear of one people have already had to queue up to buy essential goods the fear of a possible food shortage also stems from the rajapaksa administration s decision in april to ban import of chemical fertilizers and adopting an organic only approach farmers who resisted the move have warned that the dramatic overnight shift to organic fertilizers could impact production severely producers of tea have warned of a 50 drop in production meanwhile many especially daily wage earners and low income families are complaining about being unable to afford and in many cases access essentials such as milk sugar and rice during the current lockdown prices of essential commodities including rice dhal bread sugar vegetables fish have risen several times during the pandemic and more rapidly in recent weeks

it is possible to be fat but fit people simply need to focus on exercise rather than dieting to live longer experts now claim researchers who reviewed existing studies said that when it came to trying to get healthy and cutting the risk of dying early increasing exercise and improving fitness was more effective than shedding flab numerous studies have shown how people around the world have been trying to lose weight over the past 40 years and yet obesity has continued to rise it is possible to be fat but fit people simply need to focus on exercise rather than dieting to live longer experts now claim stock image professor glenn gaesser from the college of health solutions at arizona state university and associate professor siddhartha angadi from the school of education and human development at the university of virginia believe this would also cut the health risks associated with so called yo yo dieting in which people lose weight only to gain it again in repeating cycles they said a weight centric approach to obesity treatment and prevention has been largely ineffective moreover repeated weight loss efforts may contribute to weight gain and is undoubtedly associated with the high prevalence of weight cycling yo yo dieting which is associated with significant health risks many obesity related health conditions are more likely attributable to low physical activity and cardio respiratory fitness rather than obesity per se the researchers said that adopting what they called a weight neutral approach did not mean weight loss should be categorically discouraged they added but shifting the focus away from weight loss as the primary goal and instead focusing on increasing physical activity to improve cardio respiratory fitness may be prudent for treating obesity related health conditions researchers who reviewed existing studies said that when it came to trying to get healthy and cutting the risk of dying early increasing exercise and improving fitness was more effective than shedding flab stock image their claims appear to contradict a study published this summer by glasgow university researchers who tracked 381 263 adults over 11 years they concluded it was not possible to be fat but fit a misleading phrase that doctors should stop using those who were metabolically healthy but obese were 22 per cent more likely to die than those of a normal weight they were also 18 per cent more likely to have a heart attack or stroke 76 per cent more likely to develop heart failure and four times more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes however writing in the journal iscience professor gaesser said fat can be fit and fit healthy bodies come in all shapes and sizes in a weight obsessed culture it may be challenging for programmes that are not focused on weight loss to gain traction we re not necessarily against weight loss we just think it shouldn t be the primary criterion for judging the success of a lifestyle intervention programme

investors are concerned the u s federal reserve could signal that it s planning to pull back some of the support measures it s been giving the economy new york stocks on wall street closed sharply lower monday mirroring losses overseas and handing the s p 500 index its biggest drop in four months worries about heavily indebted chinese real estate developers and the damage they could do to investors worldwide if they default rippled across markets investors are also concerned that the u s federal reserve could signal this week that it s planning to pull back some of the support measures it s been giving markets and the economy the s p 500 fell 75 26 points or 1 7 to 4 357 73 it s biggest drop since may at one point the benchmark index was down 2 9 the biggest decline since last october the s p 500 was coming off two weeks of losses and is on track for its first monthly decline since january the s p 500 has gone an unusually long time without a pullback of 5 or more the dow jones industrial average fell 614 41 points or 1 8 to 33 970 47 the blue chip index was briefly down 971 points the nasdaq fell 330 06 points or 2 2 to 14 713 90 the hang seng hong kong s main index dropped 3 3 for its biggest loss since july european markets fell about 2 what s happened here is that the list of risks has finally become too big to ignore said michael arone chief investment strategist at state street global advisors there s just a lot of uncertainty at a seasonally challenging time for markets the worries over chinese property developers and debt have recently centered on evergrande one of china s biggest real estate developers which looks like it may be unable to repay its debts the fear is that a potential collapse there could send a chain reaction through the chinese property development industry and spill over into the broader financial system similar to how the failure of lehman brothers inflamed the 2008 financial crisis and great recession those property companies have been big drivers of the chinese economy which is the world s second largest if they fail to make good on their debts the heavy losses taken by investors who hold their bonds would raise worries about their financial strength those bondholders could also be forced to sell other unrelated investments to raise cash which could hurt prices in seemingly unrelated markets it s a product of how tightly connected global markets have become and it s a concept the financial world calls contagion many analysts say they expect china s government to prevent such a scenario and that this does not look like a lehman type moment nevertheless any hint of uncertainty may be enough to upset wall street after the s p 500 has glided higher in almost uninterrupted fashion since october besides evergrande several other worries have been lurking underneath the stock market s mostly calm surface in addition to the fed possibly announcing that it s letting off the accelerator on its support for the economy congress may opt for a destructive game of chicken before allowing the u s treasury to borrow more money and the covid 19 pandemic continues to weigh on the global economy regardless of what the biggest cause for monday s market swoon was some analysts said such a decline was due the s p 500 hasn t had even a 5 drop from a peak since october and the nearly unstoppable rise has left stocks looking more expensive and with less room for error all the concerns have pushed some on wall street to predict upcoming drops for stocks morgan stanley strategists said monday that conditions may be ripening to cause a fall of 20 or more for the s p 500 they pointed to weakening confidence among shoppers the potential for higher taxes plus inflation to eat into corporate profits and other signs that the economy s growth may slow sharply even if the economy can avoid that worse than expected slowdown morgan stanley s michael wilson said stocks could nevertheless drop about 10 as the fed pares back on its support for markets the fed is due to deliver its latest economic and interest rate policy update on wednesday earlier this month stifel strategist barry bannister said he expects a drop of 10 to 15 for the s p 500 in the final three months of the year he cited the fed s tapering of its support among other factors so did bank of america strategist

file in this sept 8 2021 file photo speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif meets with reporters to discuss president joe biden s domestic agenda including passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill and pushing through a democrats only expansion of the social safety net the at the capitol in washington ap photo j scott applewhite file washington democratic congressional leaders backed by the white house announced monday they would push ahead with a vote to fund the government and suspend the debt limit all but daring republicans who say they will vote against it despite the risk of a fiscal crisis congress is rushing headlong into an all too familiar stalemate the federal government faces a shutdown if funding stops at the end of the fiscal year sept 30 at the same time the u s risks defaulting on its accumulated debt load if the borrowing limits are not waived or adjusted recommended videos all this while democratic lawmakers are laboring to shoulder president joe biden s massive 3 5 trillion build back better agenda through the house and senate with stark opposition from republicans the american people expect our republican colleagues to live up to their responsibilities and make good on the debts they proudly helped incur wrote house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer in a joint statement from the white house the president backed the congressional leaders plan to hold the votes this is a bipartisan responsibility just as it was under my predecessor biden said in a tweet blocking it would be inexcusable the magnitude of the challenges ahead and the speed required to accomplish the job are like nothing congress has faced in recent memory situating biden s entire domestic agenda and the political fate of his democratic party at a crucial moment as democrats charge ahead the republicans as the minority party in congress hoping to regain control in the next election in 2022 plan to sit back watching and waiting to see if biden and his allies can succeed against the odds or spectacularly fail senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he s not about to help pay off past debts when biden is about to pile on more with a reckless tax and spending package since democrats decided to go it alone they will not get senate republicans help with raising the debt limit i ve explained this clearly and consistently for over two months mcconnell said monday on the senate floor the vote this week on funding to keep the government running past sept 30 and allow more borrowing will force the political stalemate into the open the treasury department warned that it will soon run out of cash on hand and have to rely on incoming receipts to pay its obligations now at 28 4 trillion that could force the treasury to delay or miss payments a devastating situation doing so would likely precipitate a historic financial crisis wrote treasury secretary janet yellen in the wall street journal stocks on wall street closed sharply lower monday handing the s p 500 index its biggest drop in four months as worries about heavily indebted chinese real estate developers rippled across markets and investors have concerns that the u s federal reserve could signal that it s planning to pull back some of the support measures it s been giving markets and the economy once a routine matter lifting the debt ceiling has become a political weapon of choice for republicans in washington ever since the 2011 arrival of tea party lawmakers who refused to allow it at the time they argued against more spending and the standoff triggered a fiscal crisis echoing that strategy mcconnell is refusing to provide republican votes even though some gop senators might have a tough time voting no the package is expected to keep most spending at its current levels on a stopgap basis through the end of the year and include supplemental funds for the aftermath of hurricane ida and other natural disasters as well as money to help defray the evacuations from afghanistan tacking on legislative language to allow more borrowing would cover the nation s debt payments through 2022 republican sen john kennedy of louisiana whose state was battered by the hurricane and who is up for election next year said he will likely vote for it if the disaster relief portion is acceptable he added because my people desperately need the help when mcconnell was in control of the senate he relied on democratic votes to help raise the debt ceiling during the past administration and the democrats said they expect the same from him now it typically takes 60 votes to advance bills in what s now a divided 50 50 senate meaning at least 10 gop senators would be needed by withholding votes schumer said what republicans are doing is nothing short of a dine and dash of historic proportions meanwhile behind the scenes democrats are negotiating among themselves over biden s big 3 5 trillion package as the price tag likely slips to win over skeptical centrist lawmakers who view it as too much the size and scope of biden s build back better initiative cannot be overstated it touches almost all aspects of americans lives biden s plan aims to not just rebuild the country after the covid 19 crisis and economic fallout but begin to change longstanding federal spending patterns in ways that provide more services to more americans and attempt to level the growing income inequality that permeates the economy the proposal would impose tax hikes on corporations and wealthy americans earning beyond 400 000 a year and plow that money back into federal programs for young and old it would increase and expand government health education and family support programs for households children and seniors and boost environmental infrastructure programs to fight climate change with republicans opposed in lockstep to biden s sweeping vision democrats have no votes to spare in the senate and just a few votes margin in the house pelosi has promised a sept 27 vote on a companion bill a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill of public works projects that enjoys widespread support from both parties in the senate though house republicans mostly oppose it even though that bipartisan bill should be an easy legislative lift it too faces a political obstacle course dozens of lawmakers in the congressional progressive caucus are expected to vote against it if it comes ahead of the broader biden package but centrists won t vote for the broader package unless they are assured the bipartisan bill will also be included
