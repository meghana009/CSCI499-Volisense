petrol prices are inexorably sneaking up on 2 a litre if you fill your car with premium fuel you may have already experienced the curious mathematical phenomenon of watching the dollar dial spin twice as fast as the litres dial paying for fuel is an exercise in powerlessness we do not control the global oil price which is driven by factors far beyond australia s control image petrolspy com au but as they say it is an ill wind that blows nobody good some people are loving the current elevated oil prices exxonmobil stock price is up a hefty 25 this year with the big texas based oil firm reporting a whopping profit of us 8 9 billion 12 3 billion in the three months of october november and december 2021 high oil prices are pure upside for oil companies their costs of production barely change and when prices rise say due to geopolitical instability or production limits set by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec they pocket the difference exxonmobil ceo darren woods said the company was working to grow shareholder value we ve made great progress in 2021 and our forward plans position us to lead in cash flow and earnings growth operating performance and the energy transition he said you might wonder if an oil company really wants to be leading an energy transition when oil prices are so high sticking with oil is lucrative for them changing is risky but oil companies don t only lead they also follow for consumers high fuel prices make an energy transition even more urgent pain at the pump long behind us is the brief period in 2020 when oil price rises went negative in us markets and australian petrol fell below 1 per litre prices until december 2021 unleaded octane 91 dark line is quarterly average image abs high petrol prices are here and they are hurting they were the single biggest contributor to australia s rising consumer price index in december 2021 and prices seem to have risen further since petrol prices are likely to become an election issue petrol prices are at record highs putting a major squeeze on family budgets across the country and the morrison government isn t doing a thing about it pic twitter com exviqynxoe anthony albanese albomp october 30 2021 what do voters do when they feel pain at the pump do they take out their anger on the incumbent do they get nervous and vote for a party with the supposed reputation for economic management or do they vote for a third party that has long been arguing for us to get off our fossil fuel addiction the answers to these questions are far from certain but you can expect to see a lot of politicians worrying about fuel prices in coming weeks a repeat of john howard s panicked freezing of fuel excise in 2001 is not out of the question australians use a lot of fuel so prices matter the next chart shows sales of petrol and diesel in australia over the past few years as you can see petrol sales dipped in the pandemic and have only barely recovered for diesel fuel though sales were relatively steady and are now higher than pre pandemic levels image australian petroleum statistics dec 2021 the primary reason diesel has grown is that it is used by machines not just by passenger vehicles sales of diesel vehicles have also been very strong our new national obsession with enormous four by four trucks has caused an increase in the sale numbers after several years of decline following the volkswagen emissions scandal around 99 of sedans are now powered by fuels other than diesel and so are 70 of suvs but about 95 of all light commercial vehicles are diesel powered that includes the most popular vehicle in the country the ford ranger which sold 46 000 units in australia last year about 60 more than the most popular small car the toyota corolla 29 000 units the rise of the small car is almost forgotten now it was a phenomenon of the 2010 2014 period when petrol prices hovered at then record levels of 1 40 1 50 l capital city averages the mazda 3 and the toyota corolla tussled for supremacy in a brief interlude between the primacy of the holden commodore and the eventual triumph of the toyota hilux the hilux became the most popular car after petrol prices fell again in 2015 although it has now been usurped by the ford ranger official fuel consumption 8 9l 100km compared to 5 5l 100km for a mazda 3 top dog doesn t stay top forever if petrol prices stay high our car fleet could react i don t think australia will go back to hatchbacks because the trend to suvs is so strong but we could move to smaller suvs like the two wheel drive rav4 which uses 6l 100km we will also likely see rising demand for vehicles powered by different energy sources altogether the hybrid rav4 has been selling like hotcakes with a long waiting list to buy one it gets 4 7l 100km ultimately the answer to high fuel prices will be getting off fossil fuels altogether electric vehicle sales in australia are so far quite pathetic less than 2 of all cars sold last year were pure electric two thirds of which were teslas the winning policy this election might be a big push to improve electric vehicle availability giving voters a vision of a future free from ever having to visit a petrol pump

president biden and his top aides unleashed a new volley of warnings thursday that the kremlin is preparing for a military invasion of neighboring ukraine perhaps in the next few days as the administration brushed aside russian protestations to the contrary the extraordinarily blunt comments from mr biden secretary of state antony blinken and other senior u s officials set off more fears of a shooting war in the heart of europe sent u s stocks plunging in value and seemed to leave only a small and shrinking window for a diplomatic way out of the conflict u s and nato officials again said they saw no signs on the ground of a promised russian pullback of some of the more than 130 000 troops that have methodically surrounded ukraine on three sides in recent weeks mr biden told reporters at the white house on thursday morning that the invasion threat remains very high because russia has moved more troops toward the border with ukraine instead of pulling them back every indication we have is they re prepared to go into ukraine attack ukraine mr biden said my sense is it will happen in the next several days the evidence on the ground is that russia is moving toward an imminent invasion this is a crucial moment said linda thomas greenfield u s ambassador to the united nations see also vp harris warns russia of severe consequences if it invades ukraine instead of pulling back its troops ships and heavy weaponry ringing ukraine the russian military has dispatched another 7 000 soldiers to the tense border area in recent days u s officials say the ukrainian government and russian backed separatist forces traded charges of shelling in the donbass area mr blinken and british prime minister boris johnson warned that the kremlin was poised to use that conflict as a false flag operation as a pretext for an invasion as russian officials decried what they called war hysteria from washington mr blinken used a hastily scheduled address to the u n security council on thursday morning to lay out what he said was the likely way moscow would use disinformation and other tricks to justify military action he said the administration felt compelled to speak out on the dangers even at the risk of being proved wrong let me be clear i am here today not to start a war but to prevent one mr blinken told the security council the information i ve presented here is validated by what we ve seen unfolding in plain sight before our eyes for months if russia doesn t invade ukraine then we will be relieved that russia changed course and proved our predictions wrong and we will gladly accept any criticism that anyone directs at us mr blinken warned that russia had multiple ways to fabricate an excuse for military action including the invented discovery of the mass grave a staged drone strike against civilians or a fake even a real attack using chemical weapons see also russia expels senior u s diplomat in moscow amid ukraine tensions mr blinken and defense secretary lloyd austin will huddle with their european allies and with ukrainian officials over the next few days at the annual munich security conference in germany vice president kamala harris is leading the u s delegation to the gathering which russian officials are boycotting this year it will be one of the most delicate and high profile assignments yet for ms harris who had relatively little foreign policy experience when mr biden chose her as his running mate in 2020 she is scheduled to meet with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg and with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy the key objective for her trip now is to focus on this fast changing evolving situation this tremendous challenge that we are facing now to make sure that we are fully aligned with our allies and partners and to make sure that we have sent a very clear message to russia a senior administration official said our preference is diplomacy and deterrence but if russia chooses aggression we are ready the u s is ready our allies are ready russian response in moscow the government of russian president vladimir putin released a lengthy written response to u s and nato proposals to end the crisis it said the western response effectively ignored russia s national security red lines the u s and its allies have rejected the kremlin s demands to bar ukraine permanently from nato and to pull back troops and weaponry broadly along russia s western borders the document defends russia s massive buildup of troops on ukraine s border ultimate demands to withdraw troops from certain areas on russian territory accompanied by threats of tougher sanctions are unacceptable and undermine the prospects for reaching real agreements the 10 page response read in the absence of the readiness of the american side to agree on firm legally binding guarantees to ensure our security from the united states and its allies russia will be forced to respond including through the implementation of military technical measures mr blinken said in his u n remarks that he had written a letter to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov asking for another face to face meeting in europe next week analysts say the biden administration has made a clear decision to effectively release all of its intelligence findings confirmed and speculative into the public debate in an effort to put the kremlin on the defensive and preempt possible strategies to shift the blame for the crisis to ukraine and nato mr austin appearing with nato s mr stoltenberg offered some of the signs pointing to a russian incursion including the troop and naval buildup the presence of more combat and support aircraft and even the stocking up of blood supplies near the front lines with ukraine you know i was a soldier myself not that long ago said mr austin a former army general and i know firsthand that you don t do these sorts of things for no reason and you certainly don t do them if you re getting ready to pack up and go home the strategy comes with some risks as mr blinken acknowledged russian officials have mocked repeated american predictions of imminent war and even mr zelenskyy has criticized the scare talk coming from washington he said it is undermining the confidence of ordinary ukrainians china which has moved closer to mr putin as the clash with the u s has escalated criticized the biden administration for hyping and sensationalizing the crisis disseminating disinformation and creating an air of tension is not conducive to resolving the ukraine issue foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin told a beijing briefing clamoring for bloc confrontation and wielding the big stick of sanctions will only impede dialogue and negotiation another front in the u s russia stare down opened thursday when the russian foreign ministry announced that it had ordered the deputy chief of mission for the u s embassy in moscow to leave the country russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said in a statement thursday afternoon that the expulsion of veteran diplomat bart gorman last week was retaliation for a demand that an unidentified russian diplomat leave washington and was not an escalation in the clash over ukraine the u s expulsion she said left the russian embassy severely understaffed this was done strictly in retaliation for the groundless expulsion of a minister counselor of our embassy in washington contrary to his senior diplomatic rank ms zakharova said in the statement posted on the ministry s website moreover the defiantly ignored our request for prolonging his stay at least until a substitute arrived a state department official called the move unprovoked we consider this an escalatory step and are considering our response a department spokesperson said dave boyer and mike glenn contributed to this article which is based in part on wire service reports david r sands can be reached at dsands washingtontimes

adjustments not related to current period earnings both of which are not reflective of the company s underlying operating performance and are excluded from adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 51 4 million 0 27 per share compared to 44 0 million 0 24 per share in the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher volumes of metal sold and lower share based compensation as a result of changes in dpm s share price partially offset by higher local currency operating expenses in bulgaria reflecting higher prices for electricity and direct materials and higher labour costs adjusted net earnings in 2021 were 202 0 million 1 09 per share compared to 188 4 million 1 04 per share in 2020 due primarily to higher realized gold and copper prices higher volumes of gold sold and lower share based compensation as a result of changes in dpm s share price partially offset by the planned maintenance shutdown at tsumeb in the first quarter of 2021 as well as unplanned maintenance downtime due to water leaks in the off gas system during the second half of 2021 higher local currency operating expenses in bulgaria reflecting higher prices for electricity and direct materials and higher labour costs a weaker u s dollar and higher royalties at ada tepe reflecting a higher profit based royalty rate adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter

ecri relies on early warning signals that catch turning points long before they are evident to laymen as they say in ice hockey you skate to where the puck is going not where it is either the fed will blink and give up on rate hikes or it will forge ahead until something breaks meaning a stock market crash or a recession or both he said warnings of an economic recession in the us are growing louder liquidity is drying up and the cost of borrowing has suddenly broken its moorings monetarists are edging towards the same conclusion by a different route for the last two years they have been the scourge of the new keynesian establishment and the major central banks they predicted correctly that inflation would approach double digits in the us uk and parts of europe as a mechanical consequence of extreme money creation 12 to 18 months earlier it was understandable that central banks cut rates to zero and financed budget deficits at the start of covid the system was under great stress but then they got the calibration all wrong and carried out asset purchases on a phenomenal scale the last round of qe in britain was simply stupid said professor tim congdon from the institute of international monetary research loading but today these same monetarists are voices of caution they warn that key measures of the money supply may soon be slowing too quickly to the point where the greater risk lies on the other side of the equation the centre for financial stability says the broadest measure in the us divisia m4 has slowed from a growth rate of 28 per cent to 5 2 per cent over the last year the previous excesses are fading away one should not misread the current surge in commodity prices chiefly an energy supply shock stemming from lack of investment over the last seven years energy spikes are not in themselves inflationary and can even be deflationary in western economies by acting as a tax on consumers raw material prices are in any case a lagging indicator they typically peak at the final stage of a boom when the fundamentals are already deflating beneath the surface

apparently a new authorization for its coronavirus vaccine wasn t positive enough news for the market what happened despite some good regulatory news for novavax nvax 3 74 the company s investors were a gloomy bunch on thursday the vaccine focused biotech won approval for its coronavirus jab in north america just not the largest market on the continent as a result its share price took a nearly 4 hit on the day so what this morning novavax announced that health canada that nation s healthcare industry regulator has authorized its nuvaxovid covid vaccine for people aged 18 and older the company didn t hesitate to mention that nuvaxovid is the first and so far only protein based vaccine to get such a nod in canada the most popular vaccines rely on training the body s mrna to do their work this move was entirely expected by both novavax and canadian authorities nuvaxovid has not only tested very well in clinical trials it has also been authorized or approved in numerous jurisdictions around the globe obviously anticipating authorization the company and the government signed an advance purchase agreement for 52 million doses of the vaccine back in january 2021 that agreement also provides an option for up to an additional 24 million doses we are proud that canada is part of the growing list of regions to authorize nuvaxovid and that canadians will have a protein based covid 19 vaccine option the company quoted its ceo stanley erck as saying now what canada s green light comes three days after singapore made a similar move with the jab granting it conditional marketing authorization it s been a week of double wins for novavax then as ever with the company and its jab though there s a real missing the boat sensation here first the current wave of the pandemic seems to be ebbing quickly with both cases and deaths dropping precipitously in many jurisdictions second nuvaxovid still hasn t won authorization or approval in the key north american market the u s of course most likely novavax will need to deliver more powerfully positive news to win back investor love
munich president biden and his top aides acknowledge they are risking american credibility as they constantly renew the alarm that russia is only several days away from triggering an unprovoked land war in europe that could kill tens of thousands of ukrainians in its opening hours and plunge the world back into something resembling the cold war but mr biden s aides say they are willing to take that risk they would rather be accused of hyperbole and fearmongering than be proven right they say if that s what it takes to deter russian president vladimir v putin from pursuing an invasion that they worry will not stop at ukraine s borders if russia doesn t invade ukraine then we will be relieved that russia changed course and proved our predictions wrong secretary of state antony j blinken said at the united nations security council on thursday morning in a speech that mr biden had asked him to give only hours before that would be a far better outcome than the course we are currently on and we will gladly accept any criticism that anyone directs at us i am here today not to start a war but to prevent one he declared an oblique reference to colin l powell s famous but false case also made to the united nations about why the united states and its allies had to disarm saddam hussein
takeaways responding to a decline in the london stock exchange s global market share of ipos and other fundraising a string of government commissioned reports prompted proposals to reform the u k s listing rules and other legal requirements the rules now make it more attractive to list spacs in london and companies with dual class share structures will be allowed to list on the premium segment the minimum free float requirement has also been lowered rules for secondary issuances are also being revisited so companies can raise new equity without cumbersome rights offerings made to all existing shareholders regulatory reforms aim to attract more listings to london following a year in which activity in the london primary equity markets was depressed by the pandemic global lockdowns and volatility the london stock exchange lse saw more ipos completed in the first quarter of 2021 than in the whole of 2020 by december 2021 the figure was around three times the previous 12 months a number of notable technology firms contributed to this wave including deliveroo at a 7 5 billion valuation darktrace 1 7 billion wise 7 95 billion and oxford nanopore technologies 3 38 billion nonetheless over time the u k has lost ground to other capital markets and its withdrawal from the european union eu has created uncertainty about london s future as a global financial center against this background in march 2021 lord jonathan hill published his review of the u k listing regime with recommendations for reforms that followed a report the month before by ron kalifa also commissioned by the u k treasury that put forth proposals to promote fintech according to those reviews london accounted for less than 5 of global ipos between 2015 and 2020 a 40 reduction since 2008 the new york stock exchange and nasdaq accounted for almost 39 in the same period lord hill s recommendations aimed at attracting more listings in london and making capital raisings easier quickly prompted three significant revisions to the rules in august 2021 the u k financial conduct authority fca amended the u k listing rules to accommodate special purpose acquisition companies spacs and in late november the first one listed on the lse in december 2021 the fca effected a major overhaul of the u k listing rules to permit dual class share structures dcss for new listings in the premium segment provided that 1 the structure survives for a maximum of five years and the extra weighted shares are only held by or on behalf of a director 2 the maximum weighted voting ratio is 20 1 and 3 weighted voting can only be exercised on removal of a director or after a change of control the third condition means that dcss can deter unwanted takeovers another major reform reduces the free float requirement from 25 to 10 listing rule changes are well received public responses to the fca s reforms have been generally positive overall allowing companies with dual class share structures to be listed on the premium segment is seen as making london more competitive as a listing venue by bringing its rules in line with global competitors new york has long permitted dcss and hong kong reversed its previous prohibition in 2018 helping attract a wave of chinese ipos technology and other high growth firms ought to welcome relaxation of the one share one vote principle on the premium segment because dcss effectively act as poison pills against unwanted takeovers at a critical stage in companies growth by maintaining control with founders thus dcss should not only attract new listings but help retain a deep roster of high quality issuers on the premium segment the reduction in free float requirements to 10 would have a similar effect and remove barriers for prospective issuers this reform is very significant because london s previous requirements limited many companies ability to list there lowering the threshold should give the lse a significant competitive advantage against european exchanges that retain a 25 minimum whether the eu matches london s change remains to be seen further rule changes expected for secondary issuances in 2022 the first half of 2022 will also bring the u k treasury s secondary capital raising review begun in october 2021 in response to lord hill s recommendation that secondary fundraising be made cheaper and faster proposals included a permanent increase in the preemption limit to 20 and facilitating equity capital raisings without the need for full rights offerings open to all existing shareholders which can be costly and time consuming and introduce uncertainty additionally the u k treasury s prospectus regime review proposed streamlining prospectuses for secondary issuances which would make it easier and more attractive for issuers to publish forward looking information such as profit forecasts how much will the changes alter the market the key question is whether market practices will follow these reforms in 2022 listing companies with dcss serves as an example the structure which has always been permitted for a standard listing was used in some notable 2021 ipos including deliveroo thg and wise however the market was not completely receptive it was reported in the financial press that some institutional investors did not participate in the deliveroo ipo because of its dcss and about a year after thg completed its initial public offering its founder announced that he would give up his special share rights in the wake of concerns about the company s corporate governance investor attitudes not the permissibility of dcss drove these events each company experienced unique circumstances but the market s skepticism about dcss reflected a common theme similarly any change to the preemption rights may encounter resistance they entitle existing shareholders to participate in new fundraisings so they are not diluted and have been described as sacrosanct thus even if preemption limits are made less restrictive market practice may not follow the big picture making london more competitive whether the upcoming reforms result in a boom in u k ipos or capital raisings remains to be seen the new rules concerning special purpose acquisition companies may have come at the tail end of the spac wave equity markets could be dampened in the near term by rising interest rates inflationary pressures and continuing uncertainty around the pandemic furthermore regulatory divergence between the u k and eu particularly regarding proposed changes to the prospectus rules may make it more difficult for u k issuers to raise capital from european investors in the coming years nevertheless the reforms should enable london to capitalize on future waves of market activity and better compete with other major financial centers moreover regulatory change may help shape investor attitudes make companies with dcss more attractive and even increase investor rights groups receptivity to lowering the preemption limits above all the rapid response to lord hill s review shows that u k authorities are committed to ensuring london remains a key financial center and that the u k regulatory environment stays nimble it is difficult to predict how quickly these reforms will bear fruit but they provide good reasons to be optimistic for the london market in the long run see hong kong encourages listings by foreign

ever heard the term dinobabies i am not making this term up you are not alone in your ignorance i had never heard the term until i read an article in the new york times about an age discrimination case against ibm in a raft of previously sealed documents now made public company executives disparaged older employee as dinobabies need for an emoji of a dinosaur in a diaper i don t know if the babies part of the term meant that the older workers were crybabies an example of infantilizing older workers i have some questions didn t anyone ever tell anyone at ibm or other companies for that matter that email are discoverable and often provide the smoking gun the ammunition to resolve a case to prevent reputational risk and save some bucks i guess not or they didn t attend any training because they didn t think that they needed it with so much training now online and compliance officers tracking everyone down to make sure employees at whatever level take the compliance training for their area they can hardly plead ignorance or wait maybe they should cringeworthy emails include two examples that the times article mentioned another email by a top executive appearing to refer to older workers mentions a plan to accelerate change by inviting the dinobabies new species to leave and make them an extinct species if you are wondering where the term came from now you know another one is especially offensive to older women workers which refers to ibm s dated maternal workforce an apparent allusion to older women and says this is what must change they really don t understand social or engagement not digital natives a real threat for us cringeworthy but no surprise even in the second decade of the 21st century these emails are not circumstantial evidence of wanting to cull older workers from the workforce these are direct evidence and as we all learned in law school while circumstantial evidence certainly is a fine way to prove facts direct evidence is like winning the super bowl of evidence yay rams a recent email from a 2l reinforces the notion of ageism in our profession attending law school after another career he commented finding work whether for summers or during the school year has been a major challenge and i ve been shocked call me naïve at the degree of ageism both covert and overt i ve experienced in the process the ageism hasn t come from his classmates or faculty but from prospective employers no surprise there all of us older workers understand at least the ones with any cognition that adding younger workers aka early professionals is essential to the continuation and growth of any and every business surely there must be more diplomatic ways of transitioning older workers in ways that allow them to retain their dignity and even their jobs in preretirement mode so that companies like ibm aren t caught with their smelly dinobaby diapers down and continuous training and reminders on the discoverability of emails wouldn t hurt however companies today don t make retirement attractive dependent on 401 k s and thus the whims of the stock market many older workers continue to work not because they want to but because they must given the demise of defined benefit pension plans what choices do they have except to continue working when they would prefer not to unless peeps have saved like squirrels do for winter is it time to look again at defined benefit plans in some fashion 50 or so years after they went the way of vcrs do law firms and corporate legal departments have dinobabies what are they doing about them how are they preparing for the next generation and the next after that but it s not just the biglaw firms and corporate departments what are solos doing what are the small firms doing so many details and everyone focuses on the here and now rather than the hereafter aren t there ways to collaborate on how best to transition other than rudely showing dinobabies the door please don t shove us out we can walk out on our own thank you very much to be fair ageism is not just a matter of older lawyers being affected although there s no age protection for those under 40 age discrimination is just as real for those peeps as well comments like you don t look old enough to be a lawyer who s been practicing for x years you don t have enough experience to argue this motion handle this trial bullying and intimidating newer lawyers happens far too often why not combine hard won wisdom of the dinobabies with the early professionals who are chomping at the bit to show what they can do infantilizing runs both ways sometimes you know when it s time to go when you have accomplished professionally all that you wanted to do tom brady other times it s illness weariness boredom or just the desire not to spend the rest of your days managing idiotic discovery requests repetitive motions to compel and smoking gun emails just because we re old doesn t mean we cannot still contribute conversely just

summary of 2021 trends themes and takeaways we are proud to present our sixth annual securities litigation year in review publication in which we analyze data for securities class actions filed nationally against publicly traded pharmaceutical biotechnology medical device and healthcare product and services companies collectively referred to herein as life sciences companies and summarize important decisions issued by courts in 2021 in key jurisdictions in these cases these cases are typically filed by shareholders on behalf of a putative class seeking to recover investment losses after a company s stock price drops following the disclosure of a setback or problem experienced by the company with respect to its drugs or products such as negative feedback from or action by fda clinical trial delays suspensions or terminations negative clinical data results adverse events experienced by patients or manufacturing problems plaintiffs typically assert claims under sections 10 b 20 a and rule 10b 5 of the securities exchange act of 1934 the 1934 act based upon allegedly false and misleading statements or omissions made by the company and its officers and or if the alleged misstatements or omissions are made in connection with a registered securities offering under sections 11 12 a 2 and 15 of the securities act of 1933 the 1933 act securities class action filings across all industries in 2021 for the first time in many years in 2021 the number of new securities class action filings in federal and state courts dropped precipitously falling from 333 actions in 2020 to 218 filings in 2021 a 35 drop and below the 1997 2020 average of 228 actions this decline was largely due to a dramatic drop 82 in m a related class action filings but was also due to a 17 decline in federal core class action filings alleging rule 10b 5 claims under the 1934 act given the enormous volume of special purpose acquisition company spac initial public offerings and transactions over the last two or so years core class action filings related to spacs not surprisingly increased more than sixfold from 2020 to 2021 as in 2020 there also were a significant number of class actions filings related to the covid 19 pandemic in 2021 i e filings against companies that were particularly impacted by the pandemic or companies involved in the development of products e g therapeutics vaccines and testing products to address covid 19 although the number of covid 19 related cases dropped significantly in the second half of 2021 after a substantial drop in 2020 the total number of 1933 act filings in connection with registered offerings further declined slightly 3 in 2021 the majority of these 1933 act filings 62 the highest percentage since 2014 and as compared to 37 in 20206 were exclusively filed in federal courts presumably due to exclusive federal forum selection provisions in corporate charters or bylaws many delaware corporations have implemented requiring 1933 act claims against them to be filed in federal courts the validity of which provisions have been upheld by the delaware supreme court and various other state courts since march 2020

you for inviting me especially since you mentioned people that i ve known for a long time randall wray both of us are now at the levy institute and working in other places and martin wolf i ve been friends with the reason that i m writing a new version of super imperialism is that i was asked to by china and i thought as long as they want to bring out a new translation and basically an update of the book i might as well do it in english too i bought the rights back from pluto and in about two or three months i will be reissuing the english language edition the context for de dollarization today by china russia and other countries is basically how do you make an alternative to an international financial order that really was designed from the beginning to benefit the united states in its own self interest this issue was discussed after wwi when the intergovernmental debt system broke down into allied debts and german reparations it was discussed again at the 1930s when the united states sort of scuttled the london economic conference of 1933 and it was especially discussed in 1945 in december in parliament in the house of commons the british parliamentarians were discussing do we want to accept the terms of the british loan which ended up being 3 75 billion usd written down from what keynes had wanted or do we want to go it alone it was the conservative pro empire members of parliament that wanted to reject the loan churchill wanted at least to abstain but there was no alternative in 1945 and again in 1971 when america moved off gold in every case the alternative seemed to be anarchy the u s strategy was to say either you accept u s rules that favored the united states in the beginning creditor rules but debtor rules after 1971 and essentially gave it control of the world economy or you go it alone and risk anarchy britain was not able to go it alone in 1945 i did not include the parliamentary discussion in the first version of super imperialism but i ve included that discussion in the new version because britain said very clearly the united states basically wants to absorb the british empire and the sterling area into the dollar area on its own terms and leave us almost broke what can we do about it both parties said we see that the united states is treating us its ally in wwii as a defeated party they came right out and said that but we don t have an alternative because we can t go alone we have to rely on the united states let me review what the u s strategy is and what s led to major changes over time dollar supremacy was established after world war i by america s creditor position something very novel happened after in every previous war for instance the napoleonic wars and the earlier wars england had been involved with the allies had forgiven all of their mutual debts at the end of the war there was something that the british called shared sacrifice and the idea was we re going to have a clean slate after the war this idea goes all the way back to babylonia in the second millennium bc throughout history there was a debt cancellation there was no carryover of war debts after victory was achieved because the idea was that if you leave war debts in place that s going to bankrupt the allies that you had during the war it s also going to bankrupt the defeated countries and leave them no choice except to fight back the laws of hammurabi showed this his whole dynasty showed this my book on forgive them their debt is a whole history of debt cancellations but the united states broke this practice after wwi and said the debts have to be paid the amazing thing is that europe went along with it it had a pro creditor ideology it believed in the sanctity of debt and was not going to question that because there was a guiding assumption which is erroneous that all debts somehow can be paid if only countries will either devalue or transform their economy or impose austerity keynes had a long debate with the anti german jacques rueff of france and the american swede bertil ohlin keynes explained that there was no way that debtor countries like the allies or germany could pay their debts to the creditor unless the creditor is willing to buy their exports to provide them with the foreign exchange to pay that debate obviously he won in reality but that assumption was rejected by the united states and continues to be rejected by the international monetary fund today the junk economics that was brought in after world war one to consolidate the american position was of course you can pay simply destroy your economy and let us take you over and sell out all of your industry and raw materials out to us and that will enable you to pay that s what the americans demanded it s what the creditor demand has always been essentially you have to be willing to destroy your economy in order to pay your debts keynes said this was crazy and he was right but europe went along with it and said yes we are willing to destroy our economies we are willing to create the resentment for world war ii rather than question the assumption that all the debts have to be paid what keynes pointed out was that there was a distinction between the budget problem in other words taxing the economy to raise a domestic fiscal surplus in german marks or british sterling and the transfer problem of paying foreign currency what happened was that the allies said if america is going to insist that we pay we re not going to wreck our economies we re going to make germany pay reparations as you all know the result was to bankrupt germany causing a hyperinflation there that was only solved by germany essentially borrowing the money from the united states german municipalities would borrow the money in dollars for local spending use the dollars to turn over to the reichsbank to pay the bank of england and the bank of france in turn to pay their dollar debts to the united states that was a circular flow it could only be kept going by the federal reserve making interest rates very low here in the united states to promote an outflow of foreign investment to germany but those low interest rates also created a stock market boom that crashed in 1929 in the end the inter ally debts had to be canceled there had to be a moratorium along with german reparations as the system broke down in 1931 there was an attempt to reconstruct the economy at the london economic conference of 1933 but roosevelt scuttled that and said we re going to go it alone the basic principle of american foreign policy is that no other country can tell us what to do we can tell other countries what to do but they cannot tell us what to do so we will not join any agreement in which we don t have a veto power that gives us control of the world bank and the international monetary fund or the veto power in the united nations and any international organization that the united states will join so the question is how could this supremacy be established all over again as world war ii came to a close in 1944 and 1945 america made plans for the postwar economy its guiding logic was that in order to have full employment in the united states we have to have an export based industry now that we ve destroyed germany and japan our major enemy is the united kingdom it became very clear that america s enemy immediately on the ending of world war ii was not russia or the soviet union but england it developed a strategy that was designed to essentially bankrupt england with the 1946 british loan to force england to accept to end imperial preference to break up its empire to make it free the about 10 billion pounds sterling to be used for spending not in england as blocked currency as the british board of trade expected but in the united states so england was stripped of all of the blocked currency stripped of the currency area stripped of its exclusive sterling area and thereby the empire then became absorbed into the dollar area the parliamentarians and members of the house of lords said we know that we re bankrupting britain but the alternative is to go it alone and we can t really make an alternative keynes said of course you could create your own currency and trading area with india canada and other countries but that would involve a great shrinking at the time they believed still that there had to be some means of settling international payments on creditor terms with gold the united states had most of the gold in 1945 the british understood very clearly that what seemed to be the gold exchange standard for countries that settled their balance of payments deficits in gold was really the dollar standard because the dollar was defined in terms of gold what seemed to be a gold standard was actually the dollar standard and in fact the arrangements that america created in 1945 were so one sided that by 1950 it had drawn another five billion dollars worth of monetary gold into the united states out of europe there was a refugee flight of gold in the 1930s that was followed by a post war flight out of europe british banks and the wealthiest classes began to move their money to the united states by the time of the korean war in 1950 and 1951 america s balance of payments deficit changed abruptly from 1951 through the 1960s and 1970s the entire u s balance of payments deficit was military at first this deficit was welcomed by europe and by other countries because finally the united states was providing the rest of the world with dollars that it needed to grow the dollar outflows became the basis of europe s central bank reserves along with gold some of the dollars were cashed into gold especially by france and by germany even more the u s balance of payments deficit was entirely due to america s military spending the u s private sector was exactly in balance all of the deficits were on government account and were entirely military american foreign aid actually made money in balance of payments terms in the 1960s when i was working at the chase manhattan bank every friday the federal reserve would publish statistics on the gold cover all of the paper currency in the united states had to be backed 25 percent by gold every friday we would look at what is the gold cover how much over the 25 percent does america have in free gold to sell to settle the military deficit from spending in southeast asia in the vietnam war and other military operations throughout the world it was obvious already in the mid 60s that the united states at some point would run out of gold if it continued its military spending that led chase manhattan s chairman of the board george champion to oppose the vietnam war saying was fiscally irresponsible it was the business community and the right wing in the united states that opposed america s foreign war not the labor movement the labor movement was for the war because it was causing inflation and helping wages rise the golden age of american labor was the 1960s and 1970s resulting from the balance of payments deficit it was the business community that opposed the war but not david rockefeller when he took over from george champion rockefeller wanted to do the right thing he sort of followed what the treasury asked chase to do and the other wall street leaders followed suit already in the mid 60s the united states faced the problem of how to avoid its balance of payments deficit the solution was to make america the haven for criminal capital in the world somebody from the state department joined chase manhattan and asked chase to set up enclave affiliates in the caribbean to essentially attract the criminal capital of the world as they explained it to me we want to be the new switzerland they said the most liquid people in the world are the criminal class the drug dealers we want the drug dealer money we want the criminal money because it s liquid they have nowhere to go let s make america safe for the flight capitalists for the kleptocrats for the crooked heads of states of the world for putting their money don t have them put them in switzerland to push up the swiss currency have them put it in the branches of wall street banks that then would take this money in the caribbean tax evasion and offshore banking center enclaves and then send the money to the head offices the federal reserve every three months would publish statistics on head office bank liabilities to their branches in the caribbean and panama and liberia and other countries that were used as tax avoidance centers we were following that quite closely despite trying such stratagems the united states went off gold in august 1971 at the time it worried about what on earth was going to happen are we going to lose the creditor position that has enabled us to dictate the trade rules and the financial rules and political diplomacy of the world when they went off gold the united states is still trying to force countries into the imf as a means of controlling them saying either you engage in a pro american war against labor and neoliberalism or the alternative is wreckage in 1972 a year after the united states went off gold my super imperialism was published its theme was that american diplomacy was in an even stronger position now that its deficit was not having to be paid with gold what were other countries to do how were foreign central banks going to hold their international reserves there was only one currency that they could hold and that was the u s dollar so the fear by wall street and the u s government that the dollar would be devalued as a result of its military spending didn t materialize because foreign central banks were in a quandary if they did not recycle the dollars that they received from america s balance of payments deficit their currencies would rise and that would hurt their export interests from the american point of view central banks recycled dollars into treasury bond holdings because foreign central banks at that time could only invest in official government securities they were not creating sovereign wealth funds america s balance of payments deficits thus financed its domestic budget deficits the response to my book on super imperialism was not primarily from the left but from the u s government especially the defense department i went to work for the hudson institute with herman kahn and immediately we got a contract from the defense department to explain to them how super imperialism was working i didn t want to call the book super imperialism i wanted to call it monetary imperialism but the publisher thought differently most of the copies were sold in washington to the defense department the state department and the cia and herman khan brought me numerous times down to the white house to discuss this the americans made it very clear that for instance when opec quadrupled its oil prices in 1973 and 1974 after america quadrupled its grain prices kissinger and the state department and treasury told them that they could charge whatever they wanted for the oil but whatever they charged they had to recycle into u s financial markets mainly into government bonds they also could buy u s stocks and u s corporate bonds but couldn t buy majority ownership of any big american industry america had to be in control of its industry the arab countries were told you can buy all the stocks you want through the stock market i think one of the saudi arabian kings bought a million shares of every company on the dow jones industrial average so you had a recycling the more dollars americans spent abroad on its military deficit the more money flowed into the bond market to finance america s budget deficit what the american government had achieved by its creditor status before 1971 it achieved by its debtor status after 1971 once again it told the rest of the world what s the alternative the alternative is anarchy essentially it used those threats president johnson insisted that europe give america special trade favoritism special advantages and the rest of the world felt that it had to go along to survive at the time there was a discussion concerning the advantages of gold herman khan was a monetary right winger and believed that gold should be reintroduced into the international monetary system he and i went down and gave a presentation to the u s treasury saying gold is a peaceful metal because it s a constraint on the balance of payments if countries had to pay their balance of payments deficit in gold they would not be able to afford the balance of payments costs of going to war that was pretty much accepted and that was why the united states basically responded that s why we re not going back to gold we want to be able to go to war and we want the only alternative to holding central bank reserve to be the united states dollar the united states also arranged the world bank and the international monetary fund to favor the u s economy in the world bank it would only make foreign currency loans to other countries it sent out missions to foreign countries to say what does the country need and almost every mission said what latin america africa and the near east need is not foreign currency they need domestic currency for agricultural development you had a latifundia problem in latin america the united nations came out with two wonderful reports on the need for land reform throughout the third world in order to grow domestic food but the world bank was set against other countries becoming food independent the most important heads of the world bank were former secretaries of defense like mcnamara and john mccloy you can look through who the heads were the americans said that any foreign country wanting to grow its own food instead of depending on u s grain exports was counted as an act of war and would be overthrown that was the explicit reason why the united states established military dictatorships and client oligarchies in latin america the world bank did promote plantation agriculture but the plantation agriculture was for tropical export crops to compete with other exporting countries to lower the price of export crops of tropical crops that could not be grown in the united states these countries were not supposed to grow their own food supply the world bank became a huge market for american firms to build dams etc i was told that the world bank person in charge of designing dams had been a chronic bed wetter as a child sort of acting it all out it also got countries into debt and once countries were in debt they were forced into the international monetary fund which said basically in order to pay your debts you have to engage in a vicious class war against labor you have to lower wages because it s the only variable in world trade there s a common world trade in raw materials all countries pay the same price for copper machinery and other materials there s a common world price for oil there s a common world price for capital goods the one variable in foreign trade is the price of labor so the imf said you ve got to prevent unionization you ve got to prevent any kind of pro labor reform your only way of paying debts is to polarize your economy and impoverish your labor force that is exactly what the opponents of keynes had urged in the 1920s and you saw the result in germany the same thing was imposed on the third world countries that is why until a few years ago all the countries of the world tried to get free of the imf s conditionalities the terms on which the imf would lend money you should essentially think of the imf as a small office in the basement of the pentagon deciding what countries to support and what countries are following policies that the united states does not want and therefore wants to wreck that explains why the imf will give loans to completely non creditworthy countries such as argentina under the dictators or the ukraine with no visible means of paying off the debt the loans to ukraine the loans to greece recently that ended up bankrupting it the loans yet again to argentina have demoralized the imf staff they complained that every forecast they make shows that the debts can t be paid but the imf continues to make them anyway the imf has become a pariah among competent financial analysts throughout the world the united states is still trying to force countries into the imf as a means of controlling them saying either you engage in a pro american war against labor and neoliberalism or the alternative is wreckage ironically what s changing all this is the united states cold war against russia and china the united states has begun to impose sanctions on the russian and other post soviet economies and on china this is driving them into a position where their only defense is to do what britain could not do in 1945 to create an alternative economic order with its own rules so for the last five years or so china russia and other countries are discussing how to de dollarize their economy what do they want to do they say the first thing we have to do is we don t want to hold our international reserves in loans to the u s government because that finances the united states military deficit building its 800 military bases all around us to try to threaten us militarily if we withdraw from this international financial system based on the u s dollar free lunch then dollars can t be spent ad infinitum without any constraint on military policies that we don t agree with right wing and anti labor policies that we don t agree with so we re going to take the lead in creating a new grouping china russia iran the shanghai cooperation organization members basically to do this they re trying to do what the world began to talk about doing in 1933 at the london economic conference how do we make a fair system what keynes outlined his plans for bretton woods in 1944 his alternative was the bancor he said there should be a central bank that can make loans creating fiat money to enable deficit countries to pay so that if they ran a balance of payments deficit they wouldn t have to impose austerity austerity and anti labor policies never enable a country to pay debts it makes them less able to pay and even more dependent on creditor countries so the chinese and russians are discussing today how do we create a currency a central bank that will help us actually develop we ll use international reserves to promote the industrialization and the upgrading of labor and public infrastructure investment instead of the u s demand to privatize infrastructure development and sell it off to foreign rent seekers what china and russia found out very quickly is what initially seemed to be an economic rivalry between america and china and other countries was not really an anti china rivalry as such it s a conflict of economic systems the conflict is between neoliberalism a financialized world order that wants to privatize all infrastructure and create monopoly rents for transportation education healthcare like what occurs in the united states and having these basic investments in the public domain to be subsidized and their services provided at minimum cost the question at issue is what kind of economy the world is going to have will it be a neoliberal economy a privatized economy reaganized thatcherized and financialized organized by central planning in wall street or is the government going to plan china and russia do not want a centrally planned economy anywhere near as centralized as the united states is promoting with wall street in the united states the center of economic planning has been shifted from washington to wall street financial institutions banks create credit not to create new means of production not to build new factories and plant and equipment but essentially to extend credit against assets already in place eighty percent of bank loans in the united states and in england are mortgage loans for real estate against real estate that s already in place i think three percent of mortgage loans are for new construction as long as these loans are already collateralized with promises to buy apartments etc so the question is what kind of financial system are you going to have to back up a central banking system and credit creation is credit going to be a public infrastructure enterprise as it is in china where the banks of china are able to decide who is going to get the loans a public bank is not going to make corporate takeover loans or loans to corporate raiders it s going to make loans to actually increase the tangible economy not to take it over and turn public infrastructure the education system healthcare transportation and communications into rent extraction we re having today finally a revival of the kind of debate that classical economics was all about in the 19th century adam smith john stuart mill down through marx and alfred marshall at issue was how to minimize unearned income as economic rent at that time the main form of economic rent they were trying to minimize was land rent the idea was to get rid of the hereditary landlord class which was treated as a form of overhead in today s economy the main rentiers are financial there s not a landlord class anymore because two thirds of americans own their own home on credit to be sure homeownership rates are higher in continental europe and england you don t have a hereditary landlord class living off land rent what you do have is a financial class that s emerged after world war i in a way that they have become the new central planners it s a new concentration of wealth engaging in a new kind of economic war not only against labor but against the government as well to appropriate the public domain by financializing it this is done by getting governments into debt and having them sell off the public infrastructure that s happening in america at the state and local level for indebted cities and states like new york how do china and russia avoid their economies becoming financialized how do they avoid a financialized economy from becoming a high cost economy and losing their international trade advantage what s at stake in de dollarization is how to create an alternative to a financialized dollarized economy one that is going to try to minimize the cost of living and minimize the cost of doing business instead of a high cost economy as is occurring in the united states the answer they have is that to some extent there s going to be gold as a means of settlement but most of all china russia iran and other countries are going to mutually hold each other s trading currencies they re replacing dollars with gold and with each other s currencies that essentially is the response that the world could have taken after world war one and didn t and could have taken after world war ii if it had followed keynes s policies finally with the help of donald trump isolating china and russia u s diplomacy is creating an independent bloc and helping them do what was unthinkable in the past oscar brisset great thank you very much we ve got some questions coming in to start off yesterday joe biden was inaugurated making him the 46th president of the united states what are your expectations regarding his stance on china we ve heard him talk a lot about democracy as a guiding foreign policy principle to distinguish between what is good and what is bad for the u s which measures are likely to be used to advance the usa s interests will it be tariffs sanctions or could we even see a military buildup and embargoes prof hudson the question is what are the u s interests again and again in the 1920s the 1930s and today the u s government interests were the opposite of u s industrial interests opposite of u s economic interests just because the biden administration has an emotional hatred of russia does not mean that it s in the u s interest the biden administration said on second thought we re not going to join the iran agreements because we re going to talk to israel first and blinken his neocon secretary of state said that we won t do anything without israel s approval regarding iran biden also said that the united states will not do anything about solving the world problem of global warming that the oil industry doesn t like because basically what s called the interest of the united states is that of his political campaign contributors so almost his first act was to approve more oil drilling here we have supreme court s citizens united ruling that lets campaign contributors dominate u s policy not the voters the american voters were not given a choice in this election biden did not do well in the early primaries and kamala harris got only one percent of the primary vote polls show that what american voters want is basically a bernie sanders type policy they want what you have in europe they want public healthcare universal healthcare they don t want to have to pay 18 percent of america s gdp for medical insurance and medical expenses because there s no way that american industry can compete in markets and american labor be employed in export industries having health care monopolies protected by successive administrations the american public didn t want the obama administration to evict 10 million american families and it looks like the biden administration is going to outdo obama biden basically says we re going to evict another 10 million american families what obama did i can do more many families have not been able to pay the rent or even pay the mortgage if they ve been unemployed or if their income is reduced because of the coronavirus there s going to be a huge wave of evictions in the united states that will be even larger than the obama evictions the obama evictions were targeted mainly against black and hispanics who were the victims of the junk mortgage loans biden has made a point of appointing many black women and men to administrative positions as a cover story for the fact that his policies are going to be just as viciously anti black and anti minority and anti hispanic as the obama administration s were they found that as long as you can have identity politics front and center you can do whatever you want economically to crush the people that you pretend to be representing in identity politics nobody can see really any way in which the american economy can recover the stock market can recover because the federal reserve credit and quantitative easing has been going into supporting stocks and bonds including junk bonds sheila bair wrote a wall street journaleditorial on that but the underlying economy is shrinking rapidly while the stock market s going up that s what the american economists call a k shaped recovery up for the one percent down for the 99 percent oscar brisset i m going to ask one more question on the china topic and then talk a bit more about historical things you mentioned china has been building up a network of support and trade deals to drive its expansion you mentioned some of the policies it s also been growing its presence in the u n system and even putting together alternative international organizations like the asian infrastructure investment bank is there a line that the u s would not tolerate china crossing after which the u s would start devoting much larger resources and spending to contain china or is the u s already at full power prof hudson the united states is muscle bound despite its huge military budget it can t field an army it has a foreign legion isis for instance is part of its foreign legion the european nato is part of its foreign legion but there s no way america can ever have a land war again so you can never invade and conquer a country with a military army all america has is the atom bomb and that s muscle bound it cannot go to wage any kind of war except atomic war there s nothing in between i think russia and china know that and russia at least has taken steps to protect itself and said if the united states wants atomic war we ll be wiped out but it ll be wiped out too and europe will be wiped out i think probably the first exchange would be to wipe out england and europe to say we don t want to go to war with you and really blow up the world america let s just show you what we can do let s blow up england and europe so at least you won t have your colonies there if america persisted it would be the end of the world will america really do that there was worry that donald trump would do that so he could go down in history as the man who destroyed civilization but i don t think other people are going to do that oscar brisset moving now into some of the historical things you mentioned for example in the 19th century the most powerful european empire was the british empire i am trying to see if there s a parallel between the uk and the american did the uk establish such currency dominance similar to the one the u s has today did it use similar methods to the u s to establish its dominance for example creating international organizations in which it had an institutional advantage or for example through the control of key energy deposits prof hudson england thought that it was establishing currency dominance with the sterling area in other words it would spend money abroad and other countries would save their money in sterling all during the 1930s the surpluses earned by india and by other members of the sterling area were basically kept in london paid to england but then england ran a deficit with the united states so ultimately the benefit of england s sterling area the financial benefit was all spent to the united states already in the 1930s you can look up the balance of payments articles on that in 1945 as i mentioned england thought we have 10 billion pounds of all the savings of argentina and india countries that have been providing the raw materials for the world war that we fought world war ii now there is going to be a demand for english exports and we can recover by employing our labor to make exports but the terms of america s british loan said no you have to open up the sterling area and let these countries cancel their contracts with england england had long four year and five year capital purchase contracts from india argentina they can cancel them all and buy from the united states england went along with that so the attempt to create a currency area was smashed by the united states ever since the 19th century america looked at england as the great rival not the soviet union the cold war in the 19th century was against england the fight for protectionism in the united states went so far as to create state colleges and universities that would teach an alternative to anglo centered free trade economics and anglophile moral philosophy there was a feeling in the late 19th century of america creating a new civilization and it would not be the religious based unscientific civilization of europe it would be a new secular civilization that feeling of a new civilization in america is what led americans to think we will never let other countries tell us what to do because they re part of the decadent old world and we re the new world we re going to make our own rules oscar brisset you also discussed bretton woods would it be beneficial to recreate very hypothetically a system similar to the bretton woods one today i think a key question that underlies that is does the country that runs such a system reap a benefit from running it or are they just constrained will there be an interest for china to set up such a system prof hudson they realize that they cannot set up any system in which the united states is a member because the united states will insist on veto power if it has veto power then they can t do the kind of economic system that i described bretton woods was designed one sidedly to give all the benefit to the united states and to make other countries dependent on the u s economy on u s exports largely of agriculture but also industry and also on the u s dollar obviously that s not going to be done the agreement that is being developed on an ad hoc spontaneous basis between china russia and neighboring countries is their own system of international payments that will be based on mutual benefit of holding of each other s currencies of preventing any payment surplus country and it could be china any payment surplus country ending up with so much credit in a creditor position vis a vis debtors the new system will not impoverish the debtors the imf system was designed to impoverish debtors the purpose of the imf was to make other countries so poor and dependent on the united states so they could never be militarily independent in the discussion of the british loan for instance in the 1930s the discussion in the london economic conference was yes we re bankrupting europe but if we give europe enough money to avoid austerity they re just going to spend the money on the military that was said by the americans in the state department and the white house again and again especially by raymond moley who was basically in charge of president roosevelt s foreign policy towards europe the question is how do you create an international financial system designed to promote prosperity not austerity the bretton woods is for austerity for everybody except the united states which will have a free ride forever the question that i m involved with in the work i m doing in china and with other countries is how to create a system based on prosperity instead of austerity with mutual support between creditors and debtors without the kind of financial antagonism that has been built in to the international financial system ever since world war i financial reform involves tax reform as well how do we end up taxing economic rent instead of letting the rentiers take over society that is what classical economics is all about how do we revive it oscar brisset final question these austerity and anti labor policies which the imf imposes on countries of the global south seem to be well known practices from before the imf was created from what you ve discussed did the imf invent anything new in addition in the 19th century was predatory lending something common or was direct invasion always the go to method for subjugating a territory prof hudson the 19th century was really the golden age of industrial capitalism countries wanted to invest to make a profit they didn t want to invest in dismantling an existing industry because there wasn t much industry to dismantle they wanted to make a profit by creating industry there was a lot of investment in infrastructure and it almost always lost money for instance there was recently a criticism of china saying doesn t china know that the panama canal went bankrupt again and again and that all the investments in canals and the railroads all went broke again and again of course china knows that the idea is that you make investments not to make a profit on a basic large infrastructure the 19th century was basically inter state lending inter governmental lending public sector lending that s where the money was made the late 20th century was one of financialization dismantling the industry that was already in place not lending to create industry to make a profit it s asset stripping not profit seeking oscar brisset thank you very much for joining us today our next event will be on february 4thand we look forward to

video inflation is rising at its fastest rate in 40 years david sekera with investment research firm morningstar and phillip braun with northwestern university s kellogg school of management join chicago tonight to look at the impact on consumers and the markets produced by paul caine thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors new york ap fueled by pay gains solid hiring and enhanced savings americans sharply ramped up their spending at retail stores last month in a sign that many consumers remain unfazed by rising inflation retail sales jumped 3 8 from december to january the commerce department said wednesday a much bigger increase than economists had expected though inflation helped boost that figure most of january s gain reflected more purchases not higher prices last month s increase was the largest since last march when most households received a final federal stimulus check of 1 400 the fact that consumer spending remains brisk even after government stimulus has faded enhanced unemployment aid ended in september suggests that americans pay is rising enough to drive a healthy pace of spending and economic growth still those trends could also further accelerate high inflation which has become the biggest threat to the economy and the reason the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates several times this year beginning in march consumers say they are worried about inflation but they continue to spend said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial job growth is strong wages are increasing and household wealth is way up thanks to rapidly rising home values and until recently stock prices retail sales rose solidly across the spectrum in january sales at general merchandise stores rose 3 6 and at department stores 9 2 purchases at furniture and home furnishings stores increased 7 2 online sales jumped 14 5 restaurants were an outlier in january sales fell 0 9 likely a reflection of many people refraining from dining out at a time when reported omicron infections were exploding gasoline sales fell 1 3 possibly a result of the cost and cases of omicron which rose in tandem according to ted rossman a senior industry analyst at bankrate com since the pandemic erupted two years ago spending has continued to be heavily weighted toward goods things that people can own but as covid 19 cases decline americans are expected to begin spending more on concerts movies and dinners out at the same time wednesday s retail report covers only about one third of overall consumer spending it doesn t include such services as haircuts hotel stays and plane tickets the new york clothing company untuckit has registered a rebound in recent weeks with more people preparing for an eventual return to the office said aaron sanandres the ceo and a co founder i am optimistic that this time there is a bit more momentum sanandres said the omicron variant that emerged in late november caused widespread worker shortages with many employees calling in sick yet the wave of the most recent variant appears to have been short lived reported infections began to decline by mid january as fast as they rose late last year cases have plunged from 436 000 a day two weeks ago to 136 000 monday what is rising is inflation reaching heights not seen in four decades the acceleration of prices has wiped out many pay raises and caused the fed to reverse course from its low interest rate policies and signal that it will steadily tighten credit this year to try to cool inflation january s robust increase in retail purchases followed gains in october and november before a sharp drop in december a month when sales are normally high by january despite surging inflation consumer prices soared 7 5 last month from 12 months earlier americans appeared ready to renew spending the strong january report comes as major retailers including walmart are slated to release their fiscal fourth quarter financial figures starting as early as thursday bryan eshelman a managing director in the retail practice at alixpartners believes the earnings reports which cover november through january will be strong as stores have been able to wield their pricing power but he questions whether consumers will continue to pay full price or go back to their old behaviors of waiting for a sale will retailers be willing to have the discipline to hold the line he asked the volatility in retail sales data is also emerging after the pandemic and related supply crunches drastically altered the behavior of americans particularly at the end of 2021 major retailers companies urged people to shop early to avoid shortages and americans did in huge numbers services spending at least in some sectors is rising along with goods purchases joseph aquino who runs a real estate services firm in new york says leasing activity for retail spaces is picking up recovering from a steep downturn in that sector still the sector s recovery has a long way to go rents on madison avenue had ranged from 1 500 to 1 800 a square foot before the pandemic aquino said now the same space is now going for between 600 to 800 per square foot there is a sense of optimism aquino said people are realizing that the virus is slowly dissipating thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors

continued to execute well against our long term strategic plan driving improved financial results and lasting operational benefits despite lingering challenges from the covid 19 pandemic labor shortages and rising inflation said john w casella chairman and ceo of casella waste systems inc as a result we increased revenues by 14 8 adjusted ebitda by 18 8 and adjusted free cash flow by 37 9 year over year in fiscal year 2021 these strong results are a result of the hard work dedication and adaptability of our team our asset positioning in the disposal capacity constrained northeast

sequentially as we advanced 4 3 solid waste pricing during the fourth quarter with strength in both collection and disposal lines of business we have launched a robust pricing program for 2022 with early data indicating further sequential improvements and limited roll backs inflation for certain costs categories edged up sequentially in the fourth quarter and our team continued to do an excellent job offsetting higher costs through key operating and technology initiatives including our route optimization program continued automation of our fleet real time data analytics and variable pricing programs such as our energy and environmental fees casella said excluding a 35 basis point negative headwind to margins from businesses acquired in fiscal year 2021 our margins were up in the fourth quarter with our pricing and efficiency programs effectively offsetting inflation we continue to execute well against our long term growth strategy as we acquired ten businesses with

in early fiscal year 2022 in the resource solutions business revenue growth of between 4 0 and 5 0 mainly driven by 3 0 growth from acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2021 and slightly higher volumes partially offset by lower recycling commodity prices capital expenditures of approximately 120 million which includes approximately 15 million of non recurring capital associated with

traditional stocks and bonds certificates of deposit growing a retirement plan or something a bit riskier is by following the advice of experts and financial advisors who have a good track record with investment strategies here are 20 areas to consider putting your money in invest in real estate gather your savings in a high yield savings account invest in the stock market start a blog use robo

open a roth ira consider worthy bonds join a lending club buy and sell items on ebay develop an affiliate marketing strategy try a rolling membership transfer pool collect dividends fund your retirement account 1 invest in real estate when it comes to investing for beginners with a goal of earning 1 000 a day this may seem like a lofty goal especially when it comes to real estate for example omer reiner a licensed realtor and president of florida cash home buyers had this to say first you need to understand that turning 100 into 1 000 requires a whopping 1 000 return even some of the world s most successful companies still take years to return 1 000 however that doesn t mean that it s not possible you just need to take much riskier bets 2 high yield savings accounts it may seem a bit safe but a high yield savings account is considered to be a high interest savings account and therefore could turn your 100 into 1 000 just by leaving it alone the interest earned is higher than the national average for a standard savings account and it is fdic insured you can find high yield savings accounts at most banks credit unions or financial institutions but online banks tend to have the best rates because they have lower overhead than other financial institutions so be sure to do your research when gathering up your savings to open an account 3 invest in the stock market right now there s an individual stock out there somewhere that will earn its investors 1 000 in the relatively near future all you have to do is guess which one it is and buy it at just the right time or you could take your 100 to where the casino wing of the stock market begins where options traders risk large scale losses in the pursuit of gargantuan gains instead of buying or selling securities like stocks options traders buy contracts that give them the right but not the obligation to buy or sell shares sometime in the future based on how they think the security will perform while this kind of investing can deliver bigger faster returns options trading is much more complex than buying and holding an etf and this high stakes corner of the stock market is notorious for handing out losses that compound at a terrifying pace stock options are very very risky but they allow you to turn a small amount of money into a lot said reiner mixing it up with your investments is a smart move by putting your money in different baskets like the steady earners of index funds or stocks that pay you back with dividends you reduce your risk of losing big plus knowing your stuff really pays off the more you learn about investing the better you can navigate the ups and downs making choices that fit both your dreams and your comfort with risk there s also something fulfilling about the way your money can grow over time thanks to compound interest even a little bit stashed away in a high yield savings account or bonds can balloon into something much bigger if you re patient and keep at it and don t forget about the benefits of using accounts like roth iras that come with tax advantages helping you keep more of your hard earned cash in your pocket 4 start a blog there is so much streaming content out there that finding the right television show movie or other content can be daunting you could dedicate a blog to guiding people to your favorite content and even do reviews it costs nothing to do so but if you find and grow a following you can make a lot of money you can monetize your site by running ads or featuring sponsored content for the material you were writing anyway if you are someone who loves to consume content you could easily turn this into a profitable business where you would only have to invest your time to make some money you could also start a blog about any of your interests to turn 100 into 1 000 easily 5 use robo advisors a robo advisor is an automated online investing platform digital platforms like these offer financial planning services based on algorithms using a robo advisor account allows the financial company to charge less and offer much lower investment minimums than a traditional financial advisor so it saves you money while making

senate passes stop gap funding bill to avoid government shutdown legislation now heads to biden for him to sign and keep government running until october the senate gave final approval thursday to legislation averting a weekend government shutdown final passage was by bipartisan 65 27 vote five more than the 60 votes needed the house easily approved the legislation last week with each party concluding that an election year shutdown would be politically damaging senators had faced a midnight friday deadline for passing the bill and sending it to president joe biden for signing into law before existing federal funds expire it s the third stop gap measure since last september which had already been approved by the house of representatives it gives congressional democrats and republicans until march 11 to reach a deal on a spending bill that would keep washington humming through september u s congress on thursday gave final approval of legislation funding the government through march 11 avoiding the embarrassing spectacle of federal agencies having to shut many of their operations amid the russia ukraine crisis the senate acted as a midnight friday deadline loomed when existing funds were set to expire for operating most of the federal government the temporary funding bill passed in a bipartisan vote of 65 27 five more than the 60 votes needed it now goes to president joe biden for signing into law the house easily approved the legislation last week each party had concluded that an election year shutdown would be politically damaging especially during a pandemic and a confrontation with russia over its possible invasion of ukraine the senate gave final approval thursday to legislation averting a weekend government shutdown sending president joe biden a measure designed to give bipartisan bargainers more time to reach an overdue deal financing federal agencies until fall final passage was by a bipartisan 65 27 vote five more than the 60 votes needed senators had faced a midnight friday deadline for passing the bill it was needed because congress so far has failed to pass any of the one dozen regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began october 1 a government shutdown would be useless senseless can you imagine how that would look to the russians senate appropriations committee chairman patrick leahy said during brief debate of the legislation this third stop gap measure since last september which the house of representatives passed on february 8 would give congressional democrats and republicans until march 11 to reach a deal on a massive spending bill to keep washington humming through september 30 the end of the current fiscal year the prolonged uncertainty over washington s finances for operations including many military programs comes at a time when russia has amassed around 150 000 troops at its border with ukraine stoking fears of a looming invasion that has rattled nato nations and financial markets the bill will be now sent to president joe biden for signing into law before existing federal funds expire house senate negotiations on a spending deal likely would appropriate around 1 5 trillion in discretionary funds for an array of government programs including those administered by the pentagon the environmental protection agency health and human services and other cabinet level departments failure to reach a deal by march 11 would leave congress with three options simply passing a bill extending current funding at levels approved by the former president donald trump s administration for the remainder of this fiscal year approving a fourth temporary funding bill in the hope that a grand deal still can be negotiated or letting funding lapse the latter would trigger widespread furloughs of federal workers shuttering many programs a long term extension of current funding would cause some pentagon layoffs for example and freeze national institutes of health funding for medical research at a time when the covid 19 pandemic rages on senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y tells reporters that the senate will get the work done to fund the government before the friday midnight deadline at the capitol earlier on thursday the last time congress failed to fund the government was in december 2018 when democrats balked at funding then president donald trump s u s mexico border wall following a record 35 day impasse trump found ways to partially circumvent congress but the so called wall never was completed amid skepticism over its effectiveness this time around republicans are insisting that overall spending be split evenly between defense and non defense programs democrats who narrowly control congress have been seeking slightly more spending in the non defense arena but if that top line number is set many disagreements would still have to be ironed out over individual programs senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky walks outside the chamber as he heads to meet with fellow republicans at the capitol in washington yet as with virtually all must pass bills politics hitched a ride before passage conservatives forced votes on amendments including on one of the year s hot button issues covid 19 vaccine mandates they were defeated mostly along party lines one by senator mike lee r utah and several colleagues would have blocked existing federal vaccine requirements for the military government employees and contractors and health care workers another by sen ted cruz r texas would have halted federal funds for school districts imposing their own vaccine requirements sen mike braun r ind proposed another requiring congress non binding federal budgets to balance within 10 years united democrats can defeat gop proposals in the 50 50 senate with vice president kamala harris tie breaking vote but with harris in europe and some democrats missing because of illness or ailing spouses democrats prevailed after several republicans also left for travel or to begin the chamber s recess a separate gop move to block federal spending on pipes used for crack faded away after the biden administration said it never planned to do that and would not the money is part of a program aimed at helping drug abusers avoid hurting themselves further advertisement amending the bill would have caused complications because the house is also gone for recess but would have had to pass the revamped version before sending it to biden
western media handed russia a minor pr victory by publishing reports which cited u s intelligence sources as saying ukraine would be invaded on february 16th only for the day to pass without incident state owned russian news agency tass reports russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova as sarcastically requesting that bloomberg the new york times and the sun media outlets publish the schedule for our upcoming invasions for the year to help her plan my vacation on telegram in response to multiple media reports suggesting that ukraine was to be invaded on february 16th previously zakharova had issued a less playful statement declaring that will go down in history as the day of the failure of western war propaganda humiliated and destroyed without firing a shot british news outlets came under particular criticism on a russian version of 60 minutes with hostess olga skabeeva mocking the day of no invasion of ukraine and showing decidedly uneventful footage from a livestream which had been set up by reuters in the ukrainian capital the sun in particular had quoted sources as saying ukraine would be hit by a massive missile blitz and invaded by some 200 000 troops sharing the claim on social media alongside dramatic footage of russian tanks artillery and warships on manoeuvres but no such invasion materialised us intelligence claims russia set to invade ukraine at 1am tomorrow with massive missile blitz and 200 000 troops pic twitter com wkwvlpuftt the sun thesun february 15 2022 ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky did at one point appear to confirm that e are told that february 16 will be the day of the attack in a statement seized upon by several western media outlets but a spokesman for the former comedian later clarified that he was simply making an ironic reference to the date that was spread by the media president zelensky has previously urged american and british officials to tone down their rhetoric concerning a supposedly imminent russian invasion noting that in his view ukraine has already been invaded with the annexation of crimea following the euromaidan coup of 2014 and warning that baseless talk of escalation will only create panic and damage the ukrainian economy ukraine s ambassador to the united kingdom vadym prystaiko echoed zelensky s sentiments after british defence secretary ben wallace suggested that efforts to solve the ukrainian crisis through diplomatic means had the whiff of munich about them such comparisons to pre war efforts to appease national socialist germany the ambassador said would needlessly offend our partners in the world and added that there was panic everywhere not just in people s minds but in financial markets hurting the ukrainian economy on sort of the same level as people leaving the embassy zakharova today we mark another day of the start of war with ukraine which did not happen again to the western media outlets regret no matter how hard they whip up the hysteria see for yourselves what the collective western media and officials words are worth pic twitter com m6iuapnusp mfa russia mfa_russia february 16 2022 follow jack montgomery on twitter jackbm ontgomery
a renewed iran nuclear deal agreement will cast the sellout biden administration as responsible for the resulting blood of americans israelis and iranians charged iranian advocacy group iranian americans for liberty ial in a recent statement declaring the bad deal for america another act of weakness on the part of the current administration in an exclusive statement made to breitbart news on thursday iranian americans for liberty ial executive director bryan e leib addressed the imminent prospect of an iranian nuclear deal between the united states and the islamic republic that is alleged to be nearing let us be clear any deal with the iranian regime is a bad deal for america our allies and most importantly the freedom seeking iranian people the statement reads former president donald trump is then praised for his proven ability to deal with the islamic regime president donald j trump knew best how to deal with the iranian regime he projected strength at every turn and through his maximum pressure maximum sanctions campaign he isolated the iranian regime and put their financial assets on life support it states the statement then contrasts that with the biden administration s weakness on iran in contrast every single action taken by the current administration since inauguration day has been to appease the mullahs in tehran from removing the islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc backed houthis off the state department s foreign terrorist organization fto list to lifting sanctions against americans with direct ties to the regime to demanding south korea unfreeze its assets to remaining silent when khamenei released a video depicting the assassination of president donald trump it s been one act of weakness after another it concludes with leib warning that in the event of a deal revival the current administration would forever be remembered for the harm it did shame on joe biden antony blinken robert malley wendy sherman and the entire team he said this administration will go down in the history books as the sellout administration and the blood of americans israelis and the iranian people will be on their hands furthermore all of the activists organizations and even the u s government funded voice of america hosts and journalists that supported the biden campaign will also go down in the history books as sellouts he added earlier this week following months of tense and stalled negotiations iran claimed an agreement to revive the nuclear deal was at hand though insisting sanctions be truly lifted during the vienna talks eu foreign policy chief josep borrell also expressed hopes of a renewed deal on monday stating he strongly believes an agreement is in sight however the regime remains committed to its ways last week iran issued a broad range of death threats against israel the u s and the u k on friday as the country paused to celebrate the peace and harmony embodied in the 43rd anniversary of the islamic revolution iran the largest state sponsor of terrorism worldwide claims its nuclear program is for energy purposes but world leaders including the six nations that joined the 2015 deal to limit iran s nuclear weapons capacity say enriching uranium may lead to iran s ability to quickly create a nuclear weapon the 2015 obama led nuclear deal deemed fatally flawed and highly one sided by many and from which then president donald trump withdrew in 2018 delineates an enrichment limit of 3 67 percent iran has been accused of violating the agreement as tehran produces more enriched uranium the international atomic energy agency told member nations in its confidential quarterly report in november that iran has an estimated stock of 39 pounds of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent fissile purity an increase of almost eight kilograms since august nevertheless current nuclear talks in vienna may see the united states and other world powers provide iran with economic sanctions relief in exchange

of approximately 900 miles last month rep mike gallagher r wi blasted the biden administration s attempt to pin its failures with iran on the previous administration while warning of the possibility

achievements in the middle east including bringing iran to its knees as he warned that the biden administration is seeking to reverse the historic progress we brought to the middle east the previous month rep mo brooks r al along with republican colleagues slammed president biden and his administration for displaying weakness in dealing with iran having inexplicably removed sanctions from iranian missile producers and for empowering terrorists in september iranian armed forces spokesman brigadier general abolfazl shekarchi affirmed the united states is the iranian republic s top enemy while describing his country s commitment to eliminate the jewish state

in a broad ranging series of panels and keynotes international leaders pledged everything from greater international cooperation to being nicer to each other in the office to improve global cyber posture at the 2022 munich cyber security conference the conference which took place digitally thursday featured talks and panel appearances from the u s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency director jen easterly u s deputy attorney general lisa monaco e u commission vice president margaritis schinas u k national cyber security centre ceo lindy cameron interpol secretary general jürgen stock and others schinas opened the hearing pledging the commission s willingness to collaborate on workplace and training initiatives promising to return to the 2023 hearing with details of whether or not the commission succeeded in its efforts we need to take cyber out of its tech silo and put it in the core of our security cyber is not an issue of industry it s an issue of society he said during her keynote easterly said that central to efforts to improve cybersecurity would be improving workplace culture within cisa and beyond doing so she said meant creating an inclusive environment for cyber professionals to join and creating greater accountability and understanding of security for employees in general easterly added that inclusivity efforts needed to go deeper than racial and gender equity to emerging domains like neurodiversity the u k s cameron backed easterly s plea for personal investment in security there s a real opportunity this year to take cybersecurity out of a technical conversation and into a political and strategic conversation that says actually this is something for everybody but it s not something to be scared of she said but the conference quickly moved from the workplace to the global several delegates mentioned the potential for spillover from the emerging crisis in ukraine monaco expressed skepticism russia would continue its recent push to prosecute cybercrime after years of harboring cybercriminals during a conflict provoking an american response noting that the timing of russia s enforcement actions were suspiciously aligned with its escalating war effort others including cisa chief of staff kiersten todt and president of the german federal office for information security bsi arne schönbohm worried that the cyberattacks initially posed against ukraine might overflow into the rest of the world as happened in the notpetya case we see that some conflicts outside of europe let s say let s put it that way can move towards europe and other actors by accident said schönbohm monaco made a flurry of announcements for the department of justice including a new cryptocurrency initiative at the fbi the first director of the cryptocurrency prosecutor unit at doj and an international liaison for cybercrime for more on that see our separate coverage of the announcements meanwhile interpol s stock called for codifying greater global cooperation in cybercrime investigations noting the cross jurisdictional problems with investigating and prosecuting crimes outside the scope of existing mutual legal assistance treaties law enforcement can only act if there is appropriate legislation and here again the situation varies vastly from country to country the pace at which the cybercriminal landscape is evolving can make it even more difficult for legislation to keep up he said he noted recent efforts at the u n to establish global norms and said that would be a good venue to add legal cooperation just as the crime is borderless so we must be prepared and so must be our response he said

ftse 100 loses 66 points claim and counter claims confuse the situation on the russian ukrainian border airline stocks friendless 4 50pm ftse 100 loses 66 points the uk s blue chip index ended the day at 7 537 points a 0 9 loss on the trading day as fears about the russia ukraine situation rattled investors financial markets took a turn for the worse after warnings from the us administration that there is evidence on the ground that russia is moving towards an imminent invasion of ukraine commented susannah streeter senior investment and markets analyst hargreaves lansdown reports of firing in a border region and accusations that moscow is orchestrating a false flag operation an intent to pin the blame for starting conflict on ukrainian forces has ratcheted up tensions and led to more investors seeking less risky positions 3 05pm ftse 100 rallies a little after sliding below 7 500 the ftse 100 briefly fell below 7 500 but has rallied a bit to 7 510 down 94 points 1 2 we ve seen another day of uncertainty and market declines on claims and counter claims between russia and nato about the size and movement of russian forces on the ukrainian border russia has continued to deny that it is increasing the size of its forces while reports of shelling and firing on a village in eastern ukraine by pro russian forces hasn t helped sentiment with pro russian forces blaming ukrainian forces said michael hewson at cmc markets this is likely to be the bigger concern for nato and the us if separatist forces try and goad ukrainian forces into a counter response thus creating an excuse for a russian incursion and for all hell to break loose it s therefore not surprising that against this backdrop we ve seen european markets come under pressure as the gains of wednesday disappear the bigger risk for markets is that president putin simply leaves the bulk of his forces on the border and simply plays a game of cat and mouse for the next few weeks and months he added the increased tension has seen british airways owner international consolidated airlines group lse iag sa down 4 4 at 165 78p take a bath while oil giants shell plc lse shel nyse shel euronext shell and

at 7 543 1 00pm out to lunch in the words of john lydon you ll always find me out to lunch at least that is the way it seems for the footsie london s index of blue chip stocks has barely moved over the lunchtime trading session down 45 points 0 6 at 7 559 it s been a rather strange week that started with warnings of an imminent invasion repeatedly denied by russia followed by claims of troops withdrawing following the completion of planned drills which has since been rejected by ukraine and nato who have instead insisted that numbers are rising not falling it s no wonder investors don t know which way to turn said craig erlam at oanda clearly tensions are going to remain until we see a confirmed and substantial reduction of troops at the border but rather than abandon risk as they did late last week and early this investors seem comfortable sitting on the fence of course that could change if we see any escalation or as we head into the weekend if we have no further clarity the west remains convinced that an invasion remains highly likely and that flare ups in eastern ukraine between russian backed separatists and ukrainian forces could be used to justify crossing the border whether the intelligence is trustworthy or hysteria as russia has labelled it will soon become clear but in the interim efforts towards a diplomatic solution continue which will keep investors on edge erlam said equities may be under a cloud but at least there is always gold the yellow metal is up us 23 1 2 at us 1 894 50 as risk averse investors seek the alleged safety of bullion the metal has found support from several major sources these include 1 heightened geopolitical risks and stock market volatility 2 falling real yields and more to the point 3 soaring inflation explained awad razaqzada a market analyst with thinkmarkets indeed the number one source of support for gold is rising price levels around the world as investors seek to protect their purchasing powers from being eroded by depreciating fiat currencies inflation has reached multi decade highs around the world and a record high in eurozone although soaring inflation has raised concerns about policy tightening from the fed and other major central banks this has been offset by the fact real yields haven fallen sharply boosting the appeal of non interest bearing assets like gold the real yield on the 10 year note is around 5 5 which has been derived from 2 nominal yield minus 7 5 cpi inflation this means that real yields will not move into the positive territory with a bit of policy tightening without a sharp fall in nominal inflation rate he added 11 50am us markets tipped to open lower us stocks are expected to open lower as conflicting reports emerge on the situation on the russia ukraine border with us officials dismissing earlier reports from russia s defence ministry that it had begun pulling back some of its troops after training exercises near the border futures for the dow jones industrial average declined 0 46 in thursday pre market trading while those for the broader s p 500 index fell 0 54 and the tech heavy nasdaq shed 0 7 stocks recovered some of their losses in late wednesday afternoon trading after minutes from the federal reserve s january meeting did not point at any hastened moves for interest rate hikes but affirmed to investors that the central bank will raise interest rates as early as next month earlier a white house official said russia s claim that it is moving troops away from the ukraine border was false saying thousands of additional troops have arrived in recent days at the close the dow was just 0 16 lower at 34 934 with the nasdaq down 0 11 at 14 124 while the s p 500 closed with a 4 point gain to 4 475 the good mood didn t last long as the us didn t let the tensions de escalate insisting that russia is certainly not pulling back its troops but is rather increasing its presence at the ukrainian border commented ipek ozkardeskaya senior analyst at swissquote the us warning hit the investor appetite at yesterday s session and reversed the earlier week gains in stock indices as a result the safe haven flows boosted gold again the price of an ounce is back above the 1 875 mark as crude oil is steady around 92 per barrel in london the ftse 100 is staying in that down roughly 45 points groove down er 45 points 0 6 at 7 558 footsie constituent aveva group lse avv plc fell in line with the wider index after it weak fiscal third quarter revenues in a trading statement although aveva saw a low single digit decline in its

rest of the year with the revenue outlook for the full year forecast to meet previous expectations he added 10 40am help to buy or help to sell between 1 july and 30 september 2021 7 270 properties were bought with an equity loan in the uk a decrease of 39 from the same period in 2019 the office for national statistics ons reported in a report on the government s help to buy scheme the ons said 346 656 properties were bought with an equity loan in the period from 1 april 2013 to 30 september 2021 the total value of these equity loans was 21 4bn while the value of the properties sold under the scheme was 96 4bn the number of completions dropped significantly when the initial lockdown restrictions were imposed due to the covid 19 pandemic the ons observed completions in may 2020 were down by 66 when compared to may 2019 following the removal of restrictions and the introduction of the stamp duty holiday in july 2020 completions increased with december 2020 having the highest number of completions for the entire scheme 35 higher than december 2019 following the introduction of the current help to buy scheme in april 2021 with eligibility restricted to first time buyers and new regional price caps completions have reduced in july 2021 completions were down by 44 compared to july 2019 it added figures for september show that the average price of a property bought through the help to buy isa scheme was 175 680 compared to an average first time buyer house price of 225 607 and a national average house price of 269 945 since then the national average has risen to a record high in december of 274 712 up 27 000 year on year no wonder some people refer to the scheme as help to sell the average first time property was sold for 228 627 sarah coles the senior personal finance analyst at hargreaves lansdown said runaway house prices risk overtaking the help to buy isa limits at times like this first time buyers need government schemes more than ever so it s a real kick in the teeth that many will get to the point of buying a property and discover they can t take advantage of the bonus she opined when the help to buy isa was launched in december 2015 the average price paid by a first time buyer was less than 175 000 so the limit of 250 000 and 450 000 in london gave buyers plenty of scope to find the home they wanted in the seven years since the average first time buyer price has risen more than a quarter to over 225 000 and the limits haven t moved an inch as a result we re getting perilously close to the day when nobody using the scheme can afford to buy an average starter home it means that people who started a help to buy isa in good faith back in 2015 could get to the point of purchase and realise they won t get the bonus they were expecting coles said perhaps undermining her assertion that first time buyers need government schemes more than ever purely by coincidence property listings website rightmove plc lse rmv was among the minority of

guidance this morning the pandemic provided a massive boost to sales of disinfectant products like dettol and lysol and as we emerge from the other side where those products rebase is being carefully watched so far it looks like behavioural shifts are sticky as dettol sales are coming down but stabilising well ahead of pre pandemic levels and lysol sales continue to grow said matt britzman at hargreaves lansdown as we ve seen across the broader industry inflation concerns are front and centre and prices will need to flex in the coming year to help offset that the strong brand presence of much of reckitt s range should help it navigate the inclement inflationary environment with customers likely to stay loyal to tried and trusted products even if they are forced to tighten their belts elsewhere the disposal of lower margin areas will certainly help with weathering that storm and with the underperforming chinese infant child nutrition business now behind them the outlook is starting to look brighter he added 8 30am traders keep one eye on ukraine mixed sessions on wall street and in asia made for a quiet start for the ftse 100 sentiment is finely poised after nato pushed back on

previous day five points lower at 7 603 78 overnight the dow jones and nasdaq declined 0 16 and 0 11 while the s p 500 index edged up 0 09 and the small cap russell 2000 finished up 0 14 stock markets reacted positively to minutes from the latest meeting of the federal reserve s policy committee which suggested there would be four interest rate hikes this year rather than the six or seven that some were predicting prior to the release of the fomc minutes investors were concerned that the fed would become more aggressive in order to control the highest inflation seen in nearly 40 years said market analyst naeem aslam at avatrade furthermore while it s widely accepted that us rates will rise in march markets are still split between whether the fed will move by 25 basis points or by 50bps nonetheless based on those minutes us markets took the positives from the fact that there wasn t a significant quorum of policymakers in favour of a 50bps rate rise closing well off their lows of the day said michael hewson at cmc markets the problem with that logic is that last night s minutes predate a host of economic reports that not only point to a stronger than expected us economy but also surging inflation we ve seen us payrolls come in much stronger than expected a better than expected q4 gdp report cpi inflation at a 40 year high and a strong retail sales report for january are investors really assuming that none of these economic reports has shifted the calculus towards any of those members changing their minds and deciding to lean towards 50bps if so this seems rather

considerably this year according to morgan stanley strategists this means accounting for some muni specific risks that could amplify price downside negative convexity as bonds shift from pricing to the call to pricing to maturity and the tax impact of the de minimis rule on bonds trading at too deep a discount to par they said they said the good news is that before these muni specific concerns saturate the market the yield curve must undergo a far greater rate hike than certain forecasts such as 10 year usts climbing to 2 30 by year end negative price convexity from extension and de minimis risks are key reasons why munis could underperform fixed income alternatives such as the largely non callable investment grade corporate bond market on rising rates given that about 70 of munis have a call option and 90 of those are currently pricing to the call they said however morgan stanley analysts said rates will need to increase another 60 to 100 basis points before these variables become a widespread threat to the market furthermore given our base case that 10 year usts yields only rise 30 basis points from here we see the most likely outcome as these special risks being relegated to smaller pockets of the market in 2022 they said even if there are no dangers particular to munis muni investors should have a portfolio plan that prepares for increasing rates rising rates are by

builders said supply shortages have delayed construction at a time when the supply of homes for sale remains subdued fueled by higher mortgage rates and construction costs declining housing affordability will continue to affect the home building market in 2022 said national association of home builders chief economist robert dietz while supply chain bottlenecks are easing for some industries the construction sector will continue to face delays said grant thornton economist yelena maleyev with building permits rising the pipeline for new construction remains firm but higher mortgage rates should cut demand for single family homes she said but long backlogs should blunt the blow of higher rates to construction activity that ironically makes the federal reserve s job of

elsewhere i always wanted to marry a farmer but that didn t happen the first time and i spent some time in america after we got back my marriage ended i met my current husband and we went from there with our small farm it is a bit more difficult to get in now most people might go to an agricultural college or get lucky and find a job somewhere that people will allow you to shadow and learn what is the biggest misconception that farmers are rich we ve only 62 acres and that s tiny in today s world of farming i think people tend to assume that if you re driving around in a big car you ve got a lot of money we ve got a land rover and that s because it s a work horse it pulls things you can t take a load of sheep pick up feed or take a cow to market in a mini you ve probably got healthy finances on paper but you re often cash poor in this industry there are a lot of plus points but there are worries about finances diseases and dogs coming through i don t mind that though i love working in nature and rearing the animals is there a particular type of person that suits the job i think you need to be a hard worker i m fairly strong and you wouldn t usually catch me wearing white trousers as they d just get covered in muck being resilient and adaptable helps too it can be a lonely life nowadays a lot of farmers can suffer from depression because years ago you d have six week holidays you d harvest your hay or straw with the help of your neighbours but now it s all done mechanically you re often in a tractor on your own and you don t see people very much it s just the way of life routes into farming university a foundation degree higher national diploma or degree in agriculture land management or farming typically you ll need two to three a levels or equivalent for a degree or one or two a levels for a foundation degree college a course at agricultural college such as a level 2 certificate in land based activities apprenticeship you could get farming experience through apprenticeships relevant to this role such as a level 2 general farm worker or a level 3 crop technician some gcses often including english and maths or equivalent are usually required for entry work experience you can gain valuable experience and move into farm management by working as a supervisor or assistant manager what are the biggest challenges you ve faced at work we have definitely had some very challenging moments we used to be a dairy farm and years ago we decided to build a big shed out the back it was so we could keep all the young stock together as tb was rife back then image source deborah daymond image caption deborah daymond and her husband rear dexter cows for beef on allercombe farm a few months into using it the animals started dropping weight drastically which we couldn t understand we ve always had amazing pedigree cows some mornings you would wake up and find animals dead we limped on but found out that a disease called schmallenberg had been carried over from europe by midges it crippled the milking side of things and the calving pattern it was financially so difficult and some of our cows had produced over 100 tonnes of milk each in their lifetime having to change to raising the dexters for beef producing other goods and now we do glamping holidays on site it s been a massive change from everything we ve known and i do miss seeing all that milk in big glass jars seeing what the cows achieved luckily we haven t been too affected by the pandemic or brexit because we are relatively small scale and sell directly to the public which i love farming by numbers 61 the proportion of british food produced on its farms â 120bn the value of the uk food and farming industry to the national economy 4 million jobs in the uk provided by the industry 30 000 kilometres of hedgerows planted or restored by british farmers what do you wish people knew about the job how much hard work goes into the produce and not to expect good food for nothing it s the same when it comes to a pair of shoes or a dress if you re buying a pack of burgers for a couple of pounds you have to ask what you are getting what kind of quality is this i think people need to start considering shopping local because it is going to become harder and harder to come by good food i love being at the market talking to people about where the food comes from locally and engaging with them watching their faces as they try the beef sausages or steak is amazing so many people say i ve not had beef like that in years but people need to look after the farmers too without them the countryside wouldn t look the same everyone loves to go out and spot lambs or take walks but without the farmers these areas wouldn t be looked after and there would be no food what are you most proud of i m proud of the fact we re bettering the dexter breed because they were on the rare breed list and they re a small animal commercially not particularly viable that s our aim and it s a big commitment mostly though that we re rearing something that is natural and reared on grass we re doing it in an honest way and people like to hear that

a mixture of growth and value could fuel your portfolio successful investing is partly just a waiting game that s why investing in an index fund is such an effective way of growing your money as the value of the market grows over time so will your shares however investing some of your money in individual stocks gives you the opportunity to see higher gains creating a well rounded portfolio of growth stocks and value stocks puts your money in the best position to grow safely and if you hold on for the next 20 years you re likely to be rewarded airbnb abnb 2 37 etsy etsy 0 48 and home depot hd 1 44 are three stocks i d buy and hold for the next 20 years 1 airbnb because travel is changing travel has more or less been the same for decades or longer back in the day it was the roadside inn and that morphed into the more sophisticated hotel business airbnb has shaken that up with its vacation rental platform and it s embracing the societal shift toward hybrid living 2020 was one of the worst years for the company but it rebounded last year to one of its best that s pretty impressive considering that travel is still restricted and it demonstrates how much potential the company has it uses the word adaptability pretty frequently and that s certainly been a huge element of its success it can go wherever its users do a reversal from traditional travel travelers used to only be able to go where hotels were airbnb changed that the 2021 fourth quarter was an appropriate finale to its comeback year revenue increased 78 year over year to 1 5 billion and gross booking value increased 91 even better it posted record net income of 55 million close to half of nights booked were for a week or longer and 20 were for a month or longer the company is moving fast to address these trends releasing a winter upgrade and sponsoring ceo brian chesky to live in airbnb rentals this year to get a hands on experience this adaptability is what makes airbnb so compelling as an investment yesterday it was cheaper than hotel travel today it s hybrid living tomorrow it could be something else and airbnb is likely to be able to meet new demand that s why investors can hold on to this stock for 20 years and expect high gains airbnb trades at a high 129 times forward one year earnings but there s a premium because of the stock s excellent prospects 2 etsy because shopping is changing e commerce is past the disruptor stage but winners are still taking spoils etsy is a niche e commerce site that s moved into the mainstream and is picking up tons of new customers as it rakes in revenue and profits etsy posted triple digit revenue increases at the beginning of the pandemic as customers discovered its handmade masks and as expected growth has decelerated but it s still strong with revenue increasing 18 year over year in the third quarter gross merchandise sales for active buyers increased 20 year over year and enthusiastic customers are a key to its future etsy is growing in other ways as well acquiring synergistic companies to widen its chances and solidify its place in e commerce growth isn t likely to jump back to last year s stellar numbers short of another global lockdown but double digit increases are definitely on the table management is making moves to keep it there introducing new features for a smoother shopping experience such as an upgraded mobile app and product finder it also does an excellent job homing in on what its customers like best and providing more and better for example its top selling category is housewares and home furnishings and it collaborates with designers and celebrities to offer exclusive product lines management expects revenue to increase 10 year over year at the midpoint in the fourth quarter when it reports this week shares trade at a relatively cheap for a growth stock 41 times trailing 12 month earnings and investors should expect to see this stock reward them over the next 20 years 3 home depot because some things don t change with all of the industries being disrupted some are less prone to drastic change home improvement is moving to digital like most other industries but by its nature which means large heavy objects and products that customers like to see and touch it s always going to have a strong physical element if anything home depot has taken the challenge and is disrupting itself shielding it from potential interlopers it was that initiative that several years ago disappointed investors since heavy omnichannel investments took a chunk off the bottom line not too long before the pandemic started but with its physical investments and digital strength due to those investments it was in an excellent position to serve its customers when they were social distancing and focusing on their homes now it s continuing to see the benefits sales increased 10 year over year in the 2021 third quarter and net income increased 20 to 4 1 billion or 3 92 in earnings per share the company continued to invest in its capabilities throughout the pandemic such as opening three new distribution centers in florida last year these strategic investments should power higher sales for many years home depot announced that ted decker will become ceo starting march 1 taking over from craig menear he s a company veteran who should keep up management s great work home depot also pays an above average dividend that yields 1 87 and shares trade at a low 23 times trailing 12 month earnings this is a rock solid value stock to hold for the next 20 years and beyond

unbacked crypto assets such as bitcoin ii stablecoins and iii decentralized finance and other crypto asset trading platforms the fsb reviewed the growth of the crypto asset market over the past few

operational risks iii susceptibility of stablecoins to sudden and disruptive runs on their reserves iv the increased use of leverage v the concentration of risk on a few large crypto asset trading platforms and vi the opacity and lack of regulatory oversight of the crypto sector the fsb identified a number of areas that warrant continued supervision and consideration for purposes of maintaining financial stability these include the increasing involvement of banks in the crypto asset eco system especially where activities give rise to balance sheet exposure to crypto assets not captured by or not in compliance with appropriate regulatory treatment loss of confidence in stablecoins and losses in crypto assets overall particularly where such assets are tied to leverage liquidity mismatch or interconnections with traditional financial markets regulatory arbitrage created by jurisdictional differences in the regulation of crypto asset markets and the increasing adoption of crypto assets

by anton zverev pavel polityuk and polina nikolskaya moscow kyiv donetsk reuters russia s vladimir putin has decided to invade ukraine within days u s president joe biden said on friday after separatists backed by moscow told civilians to leave breakaway regions on buses a move the west fears is part of a pretext for an attack in one of the worst post cold war crises russia wants to stop kyiv joining nato and accuses the west of hysteria saying it has no plans to invade while the united states and allies are adamant the military build up continues warning sirens blared in donetsk and luhansk on friday after rebel leaders there announced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people to russia we have reason to believe the russian forces are planning to and intend to attack ukraine in the coming week in the coming days biden told reporters at the white house adding that kyiv would be a target as of this moment i am convinced that he has made the decision late on friday ukraine s military intelligence said russian special forces had planted explosives at social infrastructure facilities in donetsk and it urged residents to stay at home the russian federal security service did not immediately reply to a request for comment citing correspondents on the ground russian news agencies later reported that two explosions hit luhansk one of the main cities in ukraine s breakaway people s republic of luhansk and a section of a gas pipeline in the area caught fire earlier separatist leaders in donetsk and luhansk issued video statements in which they announced the evacuations and accused ukraine of preparing to attack both regions soon an accusation kyiv said was false but at least one of the videos appeared to have been created on wednesday before the latest flare up in shelling began according to metadata embedded in the footage that raised suspicions among western analysts although it can be overwritten asked about the evacuations white house press secretary jen psaki said they were a good example of what washington fears we have long predicted for all of you that the russians would take part in pretexts or steps that would lay a predicate for either war or to create confusion or spread misinformation on the ground she told reporters hours after the evacuation announcement a jeep exploded outside a rebel government building in the city of donetsk reuters journalists saw the vehicle surrounded by shrapnel a wheel thrown away by the blast russian media said it belonged to a separatist official many families in the mostly russian speaking area have already been granted citizenship by moscow and within hours some were boarding buses at an evacuation point in donetsk where authorities said 700 000 people would leave irina lysanova 22 said she was packing to travel with her pensioner mother mama is a panicker she said her father konstantin 62 was not going this is my motherland he said the evacuation started after the conflict zone saw what sources described as the most intense artillery bombardment for years on friday ukraine was the most painful loss for russia of the 14 former republics under its control prior to the 1991 break up of the soviet union russian backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern ukraine in 2014 the same year that moscow annexed ukraine s crimea region kyiv says that more than 14 000 people have since died in the conflict in the east as the kremlin shows off its military capacity on several fronts putin was to supervise exercises of its strategic nuclear missile forces on saturday shooting everyone and everything russia has released footage to show it is withdrawing troops from the border but the united states instead believes there has been a ramp up to between 169 000 190 000 troops from 100 000 at the end of january new helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks armored personnel carriers and support equipment have deployed in russia near the border according to u s based maxar technologies nyse which tracks developments with satellite imagery the kremlin has tens of thousands of troops staging exercises in belarus north of ukraine that are due to end on sunday belarus leader alexander lukashenko met putin on friday saying beforehand the soldiers could stay as long as needed western countries fear a conflict on a scale unseen in europe at least since the yugoslav and chechen wars of the 1990s when hundreds of thousands died and millions fled the evacuation piled further pressure on russia s rouble currency and other assets a diplomatic source with years of experience of the conflict described friday s shelling as the most intense since major combat there ended with a 2015 ceasefire they are shooting everyone and everything german foreign minister annalena baerbock said she did not think a fully fledged invasion was the most likely scenario but that russia could carry out a coup in ukraine attack critical infrastructure or instigate violence it would blame on kyiv kyiv also said a full scale invasion was unlikely since toppling a pro russian president ukraine has staged joint military exercises with nato and taken delivery of weapons including u s javelin missiles and turkish drones putin says ukraine s growing ties with the alliance could make it a launchpad for missiles targeting russia as the crisis deepens the west is also weighing its non military options banning russia from the swift financial system is unlikely to be included in an initial sanctions package in the event of an invasion a white house official said on friday confirming a reuters report how allies should respond to aggressions beyond an all out invasion is far from agreed u s and european officials said amid differences within the eu those closest to russia such as hungary will be against any sanctions short of a military invasion according to one senior diplomat
