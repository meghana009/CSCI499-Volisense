twitter has officially sued elon musk for trying to bail from his 44 billion deal to buy the social media company on tuesday twitter board chairman bret taylor said the company filed the lawsuit in delaware s court of chancery to hold elon musk accountable to his contractual obligations according to cnbc twitter s lawsuit claims musk broke the binding merger agreement because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests the company s 62 page complaint adds having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the lawsuit is demanding the court force musk to complete the acquisition of the social media company which was originally announced in april musk and his entities should be enjoined from further breaches it adds the lawsuit also accuses musk of trying to ditch the deal because the value of his tesla stock has declined by more than 100 billion from its november 2021 peak so musk wants out rather than bear the cost of the market downturn as the merger agreement requires musk wants to shift it to twitter s stockholders twitter added this is in keeping with the tactics musk has deployed against twitter and its stockholders since earlier this year when he started amassing an undisclosed stake in the company and continued to grow his position without required notification it tracks the disdain he has shown for the company that one would have expected musk as its would be steward to protect but according to twitter the company designed the merger agreement with conditions to prevent musk from bailing musk s conduct simply confirms that he wants to escape the binding contract he freely signed and to damage twitter in the process the lawsuit adds so far musk hasn t responded to the lawsuit but last friday he decided to terminate the merger agreement on claims twitter failed to supply enough information about the number of spam and fake accounts on the social media platform in a tweet on sunday musk indicated he s ready to force twitter to prove its claim about the spam fake account numbers in court according to the new york times delaware s court of chancery has heard numerous corporate cases over the years including on mergers and acquisitions which is likely why twitter decided to file the lawsuit there
twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday to force him to complete the 44 billion acquisition of the social media company musk and twitter have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday he was backing off of his april agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the suit says twitter filed its lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there oh the irony lol musk tweeted after twitter filed the lawsuit without explanation advertisement the arguments and evidence laid out by twitter are very strong and compelling and likely to get a receptive ear in the delaware court which doesn t look kindly on sophisticated buyers backing off of deals said brian quinn a law professor at boston college they make a very strong argument that this is just buyer s remorse quinn said you have to eat your mistakes in the delaware chancery court that s going to work very favorably for twitter oh the irony lol elon musk elonmusk july 12 2022 musk alleged friday that twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts on its service twitter said last month that it was making available to musk a fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets the company has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5 of the accounts on the platform are fake musk is also alleging that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team twitter s suit repeatedly emphasizes musk s contemplation of starting a twitter competitor an alternative option he sometimes aired publicly and sometimes privately to twitter s executives and board members while the company has said it cooperated in providing the spam bot data he requested the lawsuit suggests there was concern that disclosing too much highly sensitive information could expose twitter to competitive harm if shared the biggest surprise for quinn was how much evidence twitter has for instance communications with musk about whether to retain or lay off employees as well as the billionaire s own public tweets to reject his arguments for backing out advertisement they are marshaling many of musk s own tweets to hoist him on his own petard he said when musk offered to buy the company and take it private in mid april the board initially tried to block him by deploying a financial maneuver that would have made the acquisition prohibitively expensive by april 25 though twitter had reconsidered the offer concluding that selling the company to musk for 54 20 a share was in the best interest of shareholders in a joint press release musk pledged to unlock the social media company s potential by loosening restrictions on speech and rooting out fake accounts but his confidence didn t last long tesla s stock musk s primary source of wealth plummeted amid a broader stock market selloff in may and musk soon seemed less enthusiastic about owning twitter twitter s suit calls musk s tactics a model of hypocrisy noting that he had emphasized plans to take twitter private in order to rid it of spam accounts once the market declined however twitter noted that musk shifted his narrative suddenly demanding verification that spam was not a serious problem on twitter s platform and claiming a burning need to conduct diligence he had expressly forsworn similarly the company charges that musk operated in bad faith accusing him of requesting company information in order to accuse twitter of providing misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors musk has been acting against this deal since the market started turning and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process the suit charges he has purported to put the deal on hold pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions breached his financing efforts obligations in the process violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status violated his non disparagement obligation misused confidential information and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition twitter s lawsuit alleges that the company has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of musk s contractual breaches that cast a pall over twitter and its business related headlines twitter shares plunge as it braces for messy legal battle with elon musk send questions comments to the editors previous next

amazon headed into its annual prime day sales event on tuesday much differently than how it entered the pandemic the company has long used the two day event one of its biggest all year to lure people to its prime membership for which amazon recently raised the price to 139 a year from 119 a year amazon doesn t disclose total prime day sales though research firm insider intelligence suggests sales could climb to about 7 76 billion in the u s alone or 16 8 percent over last year in part because of the event s mid july timing which compared to last year s june date would allow the company to capture more consumers doing back to school shopping amazon could use the boost amid a slowdown in overall online sales once the darling of the pandemic economy the company posted a rare quarterly loss in april as well as its slowest rate of revenue growth in nearly two decades at 7 percent inflation had added roughly 2 billion in costs amazon also acknowledged it had too many workers and expects its excess capacity from its massive warehouse expansion during the pandemic to total 10 billion in extra costs for the first half of this year it s causing pain at the moment and that pain is considerable said neil saunders the managing director of globaldata retail advertisement it s quite a reversal from the early days of the pandemic when the e commerce giant s profits soared as homebound shoppers turned to online shopping to avoid contracting the coronavirus the demand was so high that amazon nearly doubled its workforce in the last two years to more than 1 6 million people it also increased its warehouse capacity to match the avalanche of orders flooding its site by the end of 2021 amazon had leased and owned roughly 387 1 million square feet of space for its warehouses and data centers more than double what it reported in 2019 then the worst of the pandemic eased americans felt more comfortable leaving their homes and demand also slowed across the board the retail sector s online sales growth in the u s which spiked to 36 4 percent in 2020 returned to more normal growth in 2021 and 2022 clocking in at 17 8 percent and 9 4 percent respectively according to insider intelligence retail sales figures for june due to be released friday will shed more light on how e commerce is faring the most recent figures from may showed online sales falling 1 percent while overall retail sales declined 0 3 percent from april amid skyrocketing inflation this is a period of time when consumers are being much more frugal thinking about how they re spending and buying said david niekerk a former amazon vice president of human resources who oversaw operations that s having an impact on amazon brian olsavsky the company s chief financial officer has said many of amazon s warehouse expansion decisions were made as far back as two years ago limiting what the company can do to adjust midyear that said amazon will spend less on warehouse projects this year compared to last and transportation investments will be flat to slightly down advertisement saunders said the excess capacity is likely to be a short term problem for amazon which he points out has continued to take steps to grow its retail business and draw more sellers to its service in april it announced it will extend the benefits of a prime subscription to online stores beyond its own site a move that will allow merchants to tap into the company s vast fulfillment and delivery networks to fix its warehousing woes ceo andy jassy said in may the company was going to let some of its leases expire and defer construction on others amazon is also subleasing warehouses to cut costs preliminary data from the real estate marketplace provider costar group suggests the company is disproportionately shutting down its smaller facilities which tend to have fewer loading docks and parking and are less efficient to operate said adrian ponsen costar s u s director of industrial analytics still closures are already creating issues a handful of workers at an amazon delivery station in bellmawr new jersey recently walked off the job to protest transfers to other sites after amazon decided to shutter the facility paul blundell an amazon worker who led the walkout said some workers wanted to transfer to nearby facilities after being asked to go to sites as far as 20 miles away they also wanted a 1 hourly raise to make up for the disruption meanwhile the company says employees are being given the opportunity to transfer to other sites with better perks amazon signaled its other problem overstaffing emerged after onboarding new hires to fill in for workers who were sick when the omicron variant swept the nation last year but when the sick workers returned amazon had too many people adding roughly 2 billion in costs that s a far cry from last year when the company boosted pay to 18 to attract hourly workers in a tight labor market advertisement the issue might be solved naturally by the company s high attrition rate saunders said amazon is also likely to find use for the excess labor as the holidays approach and might be able to rein in the problem by not hiring new workers in locations where they re overstaffed however it happens analysts are closely watching how jassy will attempt to right the ship a few weeks ago he tapped doug herrington a 17 year amazon veteran to replace dave clark the former head of amazon s retail business who unexpectedly resigned last month after 23 years at the company amazon stock has tumbled this year dropping roughly 39 percent year to date and jassy is under the gun to bring back profitability nieker said he made a commitment to shareholders and others that he s going to really focus now on getting back to profitability in the company nieker said and a big part of that is the consumer business send questions comments to the editors previous next

twitter sues to force musk to complete his 44b acquisition the logo for twitter is displayed feb 8 2018 above a trading post on the floor of the new york stock exchange ap photo richard drew file ap twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday to force him to complete the 44 billion acquisition of the social media company musk and twitter have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday he was backing off of his april agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the suit says twitter filed its lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there oh the irony lol musk tweeted after twitter filed the lawsuit without explanation the arguments and evidence laid out by twitter are very strong and compelling and likely to get a receptive ear in the delaware court which doesn t look kindly on sophisticated buyers backing off of deals said brian quinn a law professor at boston college they make a very strong argument that this is just buyer s remorse quinn said you have to eat your mistakes in the delaware chancery court that s going to work very favorably for twitter musk alleged friday that twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts on its service twitter said last month that it was making available to musk a fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets the company has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5 of the accounts on the platform are fake musk is also alleging that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team twitter s suit repeatedly emphasizes musk s contemplation of starting a twitter competitor an alternative option he sometimes aired publicly and sometimes privately to twitter s executives and board members while the company has said it cooperated in providing the spam bot data he requested the lawsuit suggests there was concern that disclosing too much highly sensitive information could expose twitter to competitive harm if shared the biggest surprise for quinn was how much evidence twitter has for instance communications with musk about whether to retain or lay off employees as well as the billionaire s own public tweets to reject his arguments for backing out they are marshaling many of musk s own tweets to hoist him on his own petard he said when musk offered to buy the company and take it private in mid april the board initially tried to block him by deploying a financial maneuver that would have made the acquisition prohibitively expensive by april 25 though twitter had reconsidered the offer concluding that selling the company to musk for 54 20 a share was in the best interest of shareholders in a joint press release musk pledged to unlock the social media company s potential by loosening restrictions on speech and rooting out fake accounts but his confidence didn t last long tesla s stock musk s primary source of wealth plummeted amid a broader stock market selloff in may and musk soon seemed less enthusiastic about owning twitter twitter s suit calls musk s tactics a model of hypocrisy noting that he had emphasized plans to take twitter private in order to rid it of spam accounts once the market declined however twitter noted that musk shifted his narrative suddenly demanding verification that spam was not a serious problem on twitter s platform and claiming a burning need to conduct diligence he had expressly forsworn similarly the company charges that musk operated in bad faith accusing him of requesting company information in order to accuse twitter of providing misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors musk has been acting against this deal since the market started turning and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process the suit charges he has purported to put the deal on hold pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions breached his financing efforts obligations in the process violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status violated his non disparagement obligation misused confidential information and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition twitter s lawsuit alleges that the company has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of musk s contractual breaches that cast a pall over twitter and its business

as alliance member states work to make a difference in this war they also seek to learn its lessons in equipping themselves for future conflicts much that will matter in this new kind of war is old including the can do industrial responsiveness of world war ii much that matters is being re learned including the unending need for bureaucratic responsiveness in military procurement the lessons from four months of fighting provide ample guidance little hides for long the ukrainians are readily finding and killing anything that bunches up and lingers on the battlefield munitions matter only massively supplied artillery is allowing the russians any progress in eastern ukraine precision matters more large scale applications of anti tank and anti aircraft missiles have shown how armored vehicles and rotorcraft have become more vulnerable than in past wars range matters too drones and the newly arrived himars precision rockets are pushing back those russian guns and killing the gunners and their munitions dumps meanwhile russia is rapidly expending its weapons stocks and ukraine is rapidly expending those of nato some of whose member states now need to replenish their own supplies analysts should interpret these lessons judiciously as revealing yet another stage of a military technical evolution already underway for decades with important but measured changes ahead for armor and aviation to survive all that firepower troops may still want the protection and mobility of armored vehicles the tank s death has been exaggerated as the ukrainians are clamoring to the west for more to contain breakthroughs and amass firepower troops may still want the speed and reach of rotorcraft helicopters are still needed over the steppes so the americans are sending them even so the numbers of armored vehicles and aircraft lost have been impressive so adaptations are now necessary this dichotomy establishes a range of problems but with a common resolution if current armor and aircraft are at risk military forces can devise new operating concepts specifying and buying new systems to match alternatively military forces can continue to train and equip for combined arms warfare upgrading old systems with new subsystems to preserve their viability however to make a difference in a war already underway or in the next war once that is underway either approach requires industrial responsiveness get the latest sign up to receive regular emails and stay informed about cepa s work email δ experience dating to at least world war i indicates that designing and building wholly new tanks aircraft or worse ships takes years for the us over the past half century performance has gradually worsened today the pentagon s procurement systems seem to struggle with new start capabilities though they move more smoothly in peacetime with block upgrades and basic platform adaptations the primary problems have been a lengthening in pre contract award decision times and post award testing of prototypes in wartime the pentagon s people have sometimes lacked the passionate focus needed to respond to the emergent needs of the battlefield the consequence of their years long delay in buying off the shelf mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles was thousands of casualties industrial responsiveness thus requires improved procurement in the us the defense department has all the legal and regulatory structures necessary for quickly deciding what it wants it has its urgent and emergent requirements processes for quickly buying what it wants it has the so called middle tier and other acquisition authorities with the mrap the industry delivered when asked in ukraine the industry is eager to be asked again what defense may still lack is a focus in its workforce for utilizing these authorities to make the big requests for bold action even then the pentagon would need budgetary reform from congress buying the first thousand mraps required moving half a billion dollars inside the us marine corps but outside the annual funding cycle that required the attention of the service chief further progress eventually required the involvement of the secretary of defense such positive arbitrariness has worked at times and across borders but builds no institutional capacity for future success battle grade flexibility calls for bureau budgeting allocating funds broadly to management areas so that risk taking middle managers can employ administrative discretion as conditions change the american approach narrow and restrictive allocation through program budgeting does not work anywhere in the world it has been tried even so the flow of funding through the pentagon s planning programming budgeting and execution ppbe processes has not changed substantially in nearly 60 years change is officially under consideration through the ongoing work of the congressionally mandated ppbe commission nato can easily win the race for better weapons faster if government officials act with decision russia s weapons industry is headed for an all out crisis if it cannot steal enough sanctioned technology from abroad forget its military export

twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday to force him to complete the 44 billion acquisition of the social media company musk and twitter have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday he was backing off of his april agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the suit says twitter filed its lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there oh the irony lol musk tweeted after twitter filed the lawsuit without explanation advertisement the arguments and evidence laid out by twitter are very strong and compelling and likely to get a receptive ear in the delaware court which doesn t look kindly on sophisticated buyers backing off of deals said brian quinn a law professor at boston college they make a very strong argument that this is just buyer s remorse quinn said you have to eat your mistakes in the delaware chancery court that s going to work very favorably for twitter oh the irony lol elon musk elonmusk july 12 2022 musk alleged friday that twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts on its service twitter said last month that it was making available to musk a fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets the company has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5 of the accounts on the platform are fake musk is also alleging that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team twitter s suit repeatedly emphasizes musk s contemplation of starting a twitter competitor an alternative option he sometimes aired publicly and sometimes privately to twitter s executives and board members while the company has said it cooperated in providing the spam bot data he requested the lawsuit suggests there was concern that disclosing too much highly sensitive information could expose twitter to competitive harm if shared the biggest surprise for quinn was how much evidence twitter has for instance communications with musk about whether to retain or lay off employees as well as the billionaire s own public tweets to reject his arguments for backing out advertisement they are marshaling many of musk s own tweets to hoist him on his own petard he said when musk offered to buy the company and take it private in mid april the board initially tried to block him by deploying a financial maneuver that would have made the acquisition prohibitively expensive by april 25 though twitter had reconsidered the offer concluding that selling the company to musk for 54 20 a share was in the best interest of shareholders in a joint press release musk pledged to unlock the social media company s potential by loosening restrictions on speech and rooting out fake accounts but his confidence didn t last long tesla s stock musk s primary source of wealth plummeted amid a broader stock market selloff in may and musk soon seemed less enthusiastic about owning twitter twitter s suit calls musk s tactics a model of hypocrisy noting that he had emphasized plans to take twitter private in order to rid it of spam accounts once the market declined however twitter noted that musk shifted his narrative suddenly demanding verification that spam was not a serious problem on twitter s platform and claiming a burning need to conduct diligence he had expressly forsworn similarly the company charges that musk operated in bad faith accusing him of requesting company information in order to accuse twitter of providing misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors musk has been acting against this deal since the market started turning and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process the suit charges he has purported to put the deal on hold pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions breached his financing efforts obligations in the process violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status violated his non disparagement obligation misused confidential information and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition twitter s lawsuit alleges that the company has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of musk s contractual breaches that cast a pall over twitter and its business related headlines

laura kurella special to the journal although used in dried form since ancient times peas have been growing in american soil since 1493 thanks to christopher columbus and have been eaten in their fresh state since the sixteenth century personally peas were not a vegetable my mother liked so they didn t make an appearance until later in life and i was hesitant to try them even then honestly the only reason i gave it any thought was due to it being suggested by a dear girlfriend who worked tirelessly to convince me that fresh gourmet peas are fabulous she encouraged me to plant some because as she put it you don t know what you are missing so i did while waiting for them to grow i still harbored some misgivings so i decided to look them up to see if there was anything about them that makes them well worth eating i found that peas are indeed unique and they offer incredible amounts of protein in their little pods in fact a 100 calorie serving of peas which is about 3 4 cup provides more protein than a whole egg or a tablespoon of peanut butter coming to us in three general types english snow and snap peas offer us lots of options english peas or shelling peas as they are sometimes called are peas that are fully ripened within a fibrous pod that is then opened known as shelling to remove the peas so the tough pod can be discarded before cooking snow peas offer a super tender pod and is harvested when the peas inside the pod are still immature enabling the entire snow pea to be eaten whole after cooking and often stir fried snap peas offer the best of both worlds allowing for them to be harvested when the peas are still immature like snow peas as well as the option of eating them raw or cooked its edible pod makes the snap a more versatile pea enabling you to either pick when immature or leave it on the vine to form mature peas which then provides the option of shelling and eating like an english pea or cooking its mature but still tender pod with peas still intact in the end i carry a certain amount of regret for waiting so long to sink my teeth into a pea especially since i have developed quite a fondness for those in oh so young and tender pods oh my here now are some emerald studded treats that make it easy to add more peas and happiness to your life enjoy laura kurella is an award winning food columnist and recipe developer who loves to

gun makers and dealers in california will be required to block firearms sales to anyone they have reasonable cause to believe is at substantial risk of using a gun illegally or of harming themselves or others under a new law that gov gavin newsom announced tuesday that he had signed it s a subjective requirement that goes farther than current background checks or prohibitions on selling guns to people prohibited from owning them the regulation is part of the new law creating a good conduct code for gun makers and dealers that also allows anyone who suffers harm from violations to sue the bill was one of more than a dozen adding to california s already strict gun regulations that were sent to newsom a democrat by state lawmakers before they left for their monthlong summer recess the national rifle association said the requirements are vague and represent an attempt to hold gun dealers and makers liable for the actions of others the new law the group said seeks to frustrate law abiding gun owners with the goal of driving gun makers and dealers out of business with frivolous litigation the state s firearm industry standard of conduct starting in july 2023 will require those making importing or selling guns to take reasonable precautions to make sure the weapons don t fall into the wrong hands through sales or thefts that includes having reasonable controls to prevent sales to arms traffickers straw buyers those prohibited from owning guns and anyone deemed to be at substantial risk of using the gun improperly the law is patterned after a new york measure that took effect last year to skirt a 2005 federal law blocking most liability lawsuits against gun makers or dealers the new york measure declared such violations a public nuisance taking advantage of a federal exemption that allows lawsuits when gun makers break state or local laws regulating the sale and marketing of firearms delaware and new jersey just enacted similar laws and all contain provisions requiring firearms dealers to act responsibly said tanya schardt senior counsel and director of state and federal policy at the brady gun control advocacy organization that sought the laws there may be indicators or things that you see beyond just passing the background check that indicate to the dealer that they shouldn t sell the gun she said i would say the california law is more specific schardt said but substantively i think it creates the same set of requirements the same standards with regards to engaging in safe business practices it s not asking someone to be psychic she added but to take reasonable precautions in the same way that an automobile dealer could be liable for selling to a customer who is clearly drunk for instance it s not creating liability it s not expanding liability beyond what s reasonable which is really the same standard that every other industry is measured against she said a federal judge in may rejected a challenge to the new york law by gun manufacturers and sellers sam paredes executive director of gun owners of california expects the california law will be challenged on the argument that it violates the federal law the ability to be sued for doing something bad is already there he said noting that gun makers and dealers are liable for any illegal activity this is the anti gun side s way of looking for a deep pocket the law will allow the california attorney general city and county attorneys and victims of gun code of conduct violations to sue gun retailers or manufacturers for civil damages nearly every industry is held liable when their products case harm or injury all except one the gun industry newsom said in a video tuesday announcing that he had signed the bill on monday with the new law he said gun makers will finally be held to account for their role in this crisis california s law allows gun makers and dealers to also be sued for alleged violations of other laws including false advertising unfair competition or deceptive acts or practices hitting their bottom line may finally compel them to step up to reduce gun violence by preventing illegal sales and theft said the bill s author democratic assemblyman phil ting the law will also prohibit manufacturers and retailers from making importing or selling guns or related products that are abnormally dangerous and likely to create an unreasonable risk of harm that could include kits for building untraceable ghost guns bump stocks that increase the rate of fire for semi automatic weapons or bullet button assault weapons that allow for rapid reloading

by clare duffy cnn business twitter has sued billionaire elon musk in an effort to force him to follow through with his deal to buy the social media company the lawsuit filed in the delaware court of chancery on tuesday comes after musk said in a letter to twitter s top lawyer late friday that he wants to terminate the blockbuster 44 billion acquisition agreement musk s lawyer alleged in friday s letter that twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of the deal claiming the company has withheld data musk requested in order to evaluate the number of bots and spam accounts on the platform twitter s legal team hit back in a letter on monday calling musk s attempted termination invalid and wrongful claiming that musk himself had violated the agreement and demanding that he follow through with the deal in the complaint filed tuesday twitter s lawyers say they are seeking to prevent musk from further breaches of the agreement and to compel consummation of the merger upon satisfaction of the few outstanding conditions in april 2022 elon musk entered into a binding merger agreement with twitter promising to use his best efforts to get the deal done the complaint states now less than three months later musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests shortly after news of the suit was filed musk tweeted oh the irony lol musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnn the deal is now likely headed for a lengthy court battle to determine whether twitter can force musk to close the deal and become its owner or at least get him to pay the 1 billion set out as a breakup fee in the original agreement after initially saying he wanted to buy twitter to eradicate bots musk has in recent weeks expressed concerns without any apparent evidence that there are more bots on the platform than twitter has publicly reported some analysts however have suggested that musk simply wants an excuse to get out of a deal that now seems overpriced following the downturn in twitter shares and the overall tech market tesla shares which musk is relying on in part to finance the deal have also declined sharply since he agreed to the acquisition deal twitter said in its tuesday complaint that having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away it later adds that musk s attempts to exit the deal and his disparagement of twitter and its personnel expose twitter to adverse effects on its business operations employees and stock price indeed twitter s stock which regained around 4 on tuesday after falling sharply on monday is trading 34 below its price the day twitter and musk struck the deal and 37 below musk s offer price suggesting deep skepticism about the deal getting done at least at its original price the sale price in the agreement 54 20 per outstanding share represented a 38 premium over the stock price the day before musk revealed his stake in the company very little about the process of musk and twitter pursuing a deal has been typical by the standards of corporate mergers and acquisitions and tuesday s complaint seeking to enforce the agreement which is filled with references to tweets memes and one nod to the poop emoji highlights just how bizarre it has been the document references for example musk s tweets in the days leading up to the agreement in which he appeared to hint at launching a hostile takeover through a tender offer by tweeting love me tender and a blank followed by is the night it also pointed to a monday tweet by musk that included images of musk laughing and suggesting that if twitter sued him to enforce the deal it would have to reveal the data on bots he d been asking for in court for musk it would seem twitter the interests of its stockholders the transaction musk agreed to and the court process to enforce it all constitute an elaborate joke the complaint states in the filing twitter took issue with several of the ways in which musk has accused the company of violating the acquisition agreement including the claim in his friday letter that twitter breached the deal by letting go of two senior executives last month twitter claims musk wanted the merger agreement to state the company could not hire or fire employees at or above the level of vice president or above a presumptive violation of the ordinary course covenant without musk s consent twitter successfully struck that provision before signing the complaint states in conjunction with the complaint twitter filed a motion to expedite proceedings in the case requesting a four day trial on the dispute to be completed in september expedition is essential to permit twitter to secure the benefit of its bargain to address musk s continuing breaches and to protect twitter and its stockholders from the continuing market risk and operational harm resulting from musk s attempt to bully his way out of an airtight merger agreement the filing states the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
to recover healthy salmon populations one or more of the snake river dams must be breached in addition to other actions according to a new draft report released tuesday by federal officials the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which manages threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead prepared the draft report with input from the u s fish and wildlife service the nez perce tribe and the state of oregon which have been involved in ongoing litigation about the federal plan to operate the columbia river hydropower system salmon recovery depends on large scale actions according to the noaa report inaction will result in the catastrophic loss of the majority of columbia river basin salmon and steelhead stocks the noaa report shows what it will take to restore salmon to healthy and harvestable numbers said brenda mallory chairperson of the white house council on environmental quality business as usual will not restore the health and abundance of pacific northwest salmon we need a durable inclusive and regionally crafted long term strategy for the management of the columbia river basin mallory said in another report also released today federal officials from the bonneville power administration commissioned an independent analysis by the consulting firm e3 that looked at ways to offset any electricity generation from the four dams on the lower snake river the e3 report found it s possible to replace electricity generation as emerging technologies such as small modular nuclear reactors and floating offshore wind turbines become more commercially available replacing the electricity generation from the snake river dams could cost 11 2 billion to 19 6 billion which is similar to costs outlined in previous studies at the high end which officials deemed unrealistic that cost could reach 77 billion according to the report for ratepayers replacing the dams could mean 100 to 230 per year more in electricity costs in 2045 around an 8 to 18 increase in bills as the region continues to embrace the health and cost savings of a decarbonized power sector and to further enhance its supply of clean energy the e3 study can help inform long term planning decisions including to limit the impact to ratepayers said kathleen hogan u s department of energy principal deputy under secretary for infrastructure the biden administration did not endorse the actions outlined in either report however federal officials said the administration is considering the information in these reports as it assesses long term plans for the columbia river basin a first for recent administrations many groups that would like to see the dams removed said momentum appears closer to dam removal than it has over the last few decades for example washington gov jay inslee and u s sen patty murray both democrats are expected to release recommendations this month on what they think should happen with the dams according to a separate draft report issued in june that will guide murray and inslee s recommendations breaching the dams would be the best way to remove snake river salmon runs from the endangered species list and would best maintain treaty and trust obligations with tribes earlier u s rep mike simpson r idaho outlined ideas to remove the four dams in a 33 5 billion proposal that would have replaced the additional services the dams provide including irrigation for agriculture transportation and carbon free energy removing the dams would take an act of congress according to federal officials u s rep dan newhouse r wash has long advocated keeping the dams in place most recently leading members of the congressional western caucus on a tour of ice harbor dam near the tri cities newhouse represents an area that includes some of the snake river dams newhouse released a joint statement with fellow reps cathy mcmorris rodgers r wash jaime herrera beutler r wash cliff bentz r ore russ fulcher r idaho and matt rosendale r mont the statement sharply criticized the noaa and e3 reports noting the federal agency cherry picked talking points that would lead to dam breaching which the representatives wrote would negatively impact people in the northwest the biden administration is talking a big game on carbon goals while simultaneously engaging in actions to undermine valuable clean affordable and renewable power resources on the columbia river system thus compromising energy stability across the region according to the joint statement the first noaa report prioritized the recovery of each salmon stock listed under the endangered species act with the snake river spring summer chinook and steelhead at the top of the list in addition the report examined the outlook for each of the 16 stocks that historically spawned above bonneville dam calling the short term outlook for interior columbia basin stocks grim of the 16 historical salmon stocks in the columbia basin four are extinct seven are included in the endangered species list and one of the listed stocks is reliant on hatchery programs one stock fares better approaching historical numbers however according to the noaa report longer term outlooks provide a brighter spot because of increasingly effective stream and estuary rehabilitation programs large scale habitat improvement projects and hatchery and reintroduction efforts all optimism about future stock status must be tempered by the continued pressure from a changing climate and the ever expanding human footprint according to the noaa report as climate change worsens threatened and endangered salmon will face more risks according to the report which means opportunities to rebuild imperiled stocks will continue to diminish climate change will continue to increase droughts wildfires and vary river flows in the northwest according to the report in addition climate change will be less manageable in ocean conditions and marine environments where salmon spend a majority of their lifetimes the increasing role of deteriorating ocean or freshwater conditions from climate change on the health of the salmon and steelhead stocks does not diminish the importance or necessity of taking meaningful actions in areas society has direct influence over according to the noaa report in that light management actions should prioritize increasing salmon resiliency and adaptation to climate change according to the noaa report to do that society has direct influences over restoring properly functioning tributary habitats which can help salmon as snowpack diminishes and improving migration areas human influences degraded according to the noaa report we are at a crucial moment for salmon and steelhead in the columbia river basin when we re seeing the impacts of climate change on top of other stressors said janet coit assistant administrator for noaa fisheries while no single action will act as a silver bullet a diverse combination of management actions could help improve salmon and steelhead survival to reach healthy and harvestable stocks in the face of climate change according to the noaa report the report also looked at mid range goals of fish abundance set by the columbia regional partnership which decided that salmon populations in the columbia river basin needed to be higher than the threshold for endangered species act recovery goals instead the task force recommended fish stocks reach what it called healthy and harvestable numbers to achieve that goal according to the noaa report managers will need to take several actions including removing one or more of the four snake river dams reducing the number of predators restoring and protecting tributary and estuary habitats adding fish passage above chief joseph and grand coulee dams and reforming hatchey and harvest practices these actions are needed to provide the highest likelihood of reversing near term generational declines and toward rebuilding healthy and harvestable runs in the face of climate change according to the report in addition these actions which the noaa report noted science supports should be implemented as soon as possible trout unlimited which has argued to remove the dams said removing the dams could be transformative for fish and possibly help salmon even faster than the report indicated that s because breaching the snake river dams will help salmon and steelhead reach hundreds of miles of rivers and streams more quickly said rob masonis vice president for western conservation at trout unlimited this is the golden key that will unlock the benefits of other salmon recovery investments masonis said moreover on the heels of the noaa report nearly 70 oregon businesses sent a letter today to the state s elected officials asking to remove the dams and to invest in replacement infrastructure lukas angus of 7 waters sovereign foods llc and a nez perce tribal member said the dams are an affront to tribal sovereignty i have a cultural connection to the salmon as they are ones that sustain my people s existence and wellbeing my people also have traditions of trade and commerce that predate colonization and the dams that followed that continue to this day angus said in the e3 report also released today officials asked the consulting firm e3 to look at whether electricity generation from the lower snake river dams could be replaced critics of dam removal often raise concerns over replacing the carbon free generation from the dams according to the e3 report replacing that generation is costly but feasible especially if emerging technology including small modular nuclear reactors makes it to the market replacing the dams would require 2 300 to 4 300 megawatts generated by a variety of new resources according to the e3 report even with the dams in place the region will need these emerging technologies to meet clean energy standards and a growing need for power according to the e3 report how quickly these emerging technologies come online is uncertain according to the e3 report the cost of replacing the electricity generation from the dams estimated at 11 billion to 19 billion increases each year as renewable energy standards become more stringent according to the e3 report the e3 report analyzed several scenarios including when different types of generation could be available renewable energy advocates said a comprehensive energy replacement planning process would help develop these new technologies we can develop a portfolio of clean energy resources that replaces the output of the dams said nancy hirsh executive director of the nw energy coalition which has supported removing the dams however critics of dam removal said the region s energy supply shouldn t come down to technologies that aren t yet available we all want emerging technologies to be viable but we cannot bet our climate and the health and safety of our region on something that doesn t yet exist said kurt miller executive director of northwest riverpartners which has pushed for the dams to remain in place
washington demand for u s soybeans is falling as bumper crops in south america eat into u s export prospects the u s government said tuesday july 12 the large harvests in brazil and argentina also will cause u s processors to cut back on their expected pace of soy crushing as overseas buyers look for alternative suppliers to meet their soymeal needs the u s agriculture department said tuesday the bearish demand view pushed soybean futures to session lows with the most active contract trading down 4 3 around midday lower crop prices could help ease food costs that have been fueling inflation the negative ism is coming from the fact that usda is cutting demand back said jack scoville analyst with the price group usda lowered its outlook for soybean exports by 65 million bushels and its outlook for domestic crush by 10 million bushels in its monthly world agricultural supply and demand estimates report advertisement those moves combined with a cut to acreage made in june after farmers seeded fewer soy acres than planned in march led to a 2022 23 soybean harvest forecast of 4 505 million bushels and an ending stocks view of 230 million bushels analysts had been expecting stocks of 211 million and production of 4 532 billion soybean futures had rallied to near record highs in june as russia s invasion of ukraine upended global shipping flows but the surging prices sparked concerns about demand particularly as fears about a global recession grew and futures have since plunged back toward the same level they were trading at a year ago usda also raised its forecast for domestic corn production after factoring in the june acreage outlook that showed farmers were able to seed more of the grain they had planned in the spring despite rainy weather that delayed plantings corn production was pegged at 14 505 billion bushels 45 million bushels higher than usda s previous outlook based on an average yield of 177 bushels per acre analysts had been expecting the report to show a corn harvest of 14 520 billion bushels and a soybean harvest of 4 532 billion bushels the average market forecast for yields was 177 025 for corn and 51 5 for soybeans
a trader works on the floor of the new york stock exchange in new york on dec 13 2021 michael nagle bloomberg republican officials across the country tearing a page from the ongoing culture wars are launching a broad assault on the movement by big financial firms to use their economic power to curb climate change and address other politically sensitive national issues in recent years big finance companies have used their clout to advance causes that are popular among liberals the giant asset manager blackrock for instance has voted against the candidacies of hundreds of corporate board members over their lackluster records on climate issues and called climate change a defining factor in companies long term prospects jpmorgan chase the nation s largest bank has stopped lending to new coal mines or coal fired power plants even though the positions don t satisfy many left leaning activists gop officials are intensifying their counteroffensive attacking the campaigns often referred to as environmental social governance or esg by threatening to retaliate against financial firms for their positions on the climate and other issues including firearms sales blackrock is using its massive size to drive up the price of gas weaken national security all so blackrock s rich executives can feel better about themselves sen tom cotton r ark wrote on twitter last month the next congress is going to take on this collusive racket state officials are moving more swiftly this spring kentucky lawmakers voted to empower state officials to stop doing business with any firm that says it won t invest in fossil fuels the move drew praise from other republican officials although the state hasn t penalized a firm yet kentucky joins our growing coalition of states that have taken concrete steps to push back against the woke capitalists who are trying to destroy our energy industries west virginia treasurer riley moore said after kentucky adopted the legislation moore last month told six of the nation s largest financial institutions including jpmorgan chase blackrock and wells fargo that they might no longer be allowed to do business with the state of west virginia because of their positions on working with the fossil fuel industry texas has blocked a handful of financial firms including goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase from bond offerings over the banks reluctance to lend to certain gun manufacturers and fossil fuel developers including coal mines late last year louisiana treasurer john schroder barred jpmorgan chase from taking part in a 700 million bond offering because he said the bank s lending policies on firearms violated the second amendment peter bisbee executive director of the republican attorneys general association said the republicans were seeking to protect consumers from the collusion of these woke institutions who are jeopardizing the retirement accounts of millions of americans for the sake of pleasing woke environmental zealots while also creating dangerous instability within our financial markets the financial firms have defended their choices blackrock chief executive larry fink said in his annual letter that over the long term esg issues including climate change diversity and board effectiveness have real and quantifiable financial impacts but that blackrock does not pursue divestment from oil and gas companies as a policy jpmorgan chase told the texas attorney general that it would not finance the manufacture of military style weapons for civilian use regardless of a state s views and it said that it does not boycott energy companies but would make decisions on fossil fuel loans based on ordinary business reasons preventing big firms from doing business in gop states could come with a cost a new paper by university of pennsylvania wharton school professor daniel garrett and federal reserve board economist ivan ivanov argues that texas state entities will pay an additional 303 million to 532 million in interest costs on the 32 billion in borrowing during the first eight months following the passage of two laws last september government regulation limiting the adoption of esg distorts financial market outcomes the paper says in a may 13 letter to texas comptroller glenn hegar jpmorgan chase s general counsel stacey friedman said that the firm would not lend to greenfield coal mines new coal fired power plants or new oil and gas development in the arctic we also restrict activity with clients who derive the majority of their revenues from the extraction of coal and coal mining clients involved in mountaintop mining she wrote yet jpmorgan chase remains a large lender to energy companies in her letter friedman said that the bank s credit exposure to the oil and gas industry was 42 6 billion with an additional exposure of 33 2 billion in the utility sector in addition the bank had more than 100 billion in the finance and facilitation of clean energy projects but with hurricanes floods and rising temperatures in places such as texas some argue that big firms like blackrock or jpmorgan chase must assess and address climate risks if they are going to manage their financial risks one of the other things we re hearing is that the attorneys general are really betraying the gop s long standing belief in free markets said the rev kirsten snow spalding senior program director of ceres s investor network which advocates for shareholder resolutions it is no longer furthering free capitalism but stifling it it is interfering with free capital markets and those on the right are putting their thumbs on market investments conservatives disagree with some saying that big financial firms have so much power that they can t accurately reflect what the free market would favor in a june 29 letter to s p global ratings five kentucky officials objected to the agency s decision to use unnecessarily subjective esg tools in its new evaluations of the state sen dan sullivan r alaska said in an interview that the sheer power that is consolidated among the three firms blackrock vanguard and state street has caused the massive distortion in our public markets for years investors have been attracted to index and mutual funds at big firms because of their low fees and broad diversification those investors have mostly given the voting power of their shares to the big advisory firms shareholder activists have taken advantage of that urging the firms to throw their weight behind social and climate issues this year there were 226 climate related resolutions proposed by shareholders and opposed by management according to ceres according to morningstar a chicago based financial services firm even after a weak first quarter for stocks in general 343 billion was invested in sustainable funds but the esg trend is facing growing skepticism in congress sullivan has introduced legislation that would require investment advisers with more than 1 of a fund s shares to vote only upon the instruction of the fund s investors not at their own discretion the big three investment advisers blackrock vanguard and state street manage more than 20 trillion in combined assets and control around 25 of all votes cast at annual meetings they are the largest owners in approximately 90 of s p 500 companies and they control between 73 and 80 of the exchange traded fund etf market according to sullivan his bill has 10 co sponsors the gop is ginning up similar action nationwide the state financial officers foundation sfof a nonprofit that includes 27 republican state treasurers and auditors in 23 states was part of a successful effort this year to undercut sarah bloom raskin s nomination to the federal reserve raskin has already served on the fed board and was deputy treasury secretary under president barack obama but her views on measuring and accounting for climate change at the fed made her a target the foundation s website links to more than a dozen conservative groups including the american legislative exchange council alec sfof s five person advisory board includes adam andrzejewski who spoke at an alec conference in december and jonathan williams chief economist and executive vice president of policy at alec the group s biggest donors include the conservative consumers research as well as fidelity investments mastercard visa and others the foundation s chief executive derek kreifels said in an email that esg standards were designed to impose punishments or rewards on the basis of compliance to subjective criteria he said it was up to financial officers to make sure financial institutions and markets remain free of political agendas and avoiding investments that would harm their own state s financial well being the state financial officers foundation filed comments opposing a securities and exchange commission proposed rule that would require companies to disclose climate related information the foundation complained on june 27 that the rule was a violation of the first amendment because it required companies to say they regarded climate risks as worth mentioning this proposed rule is the biden administration s attempt to take power from the states by circumventing the democratic process and legislating through sec regulations john murante nebraska s treasurer and the foundation s chairman said in the filing beset by pressure blackrock has increasingly been offering clients the power to vote their own shares clients representing nearly half of blackrock s indexed equity assets globally will now be eligible for blackrock voting choice clients representing 25 of eligible index equity assets 530 billion out of 2 3 trillion had elected to participate in blackrock voting choice by early june the firm said blackrock says this isn t a response to republicans attacks it launched a more limited program last year and has been planning to expand it and blackrock which still has 70 people doing esg analysis and a fiduciary responsibility to vote in 1 300 index funds will still weigh in on shareholder votes but those who favor blackrock s greater activism are concerned blackrock last year voted 34 against management the year before 17 they were moving in a good direction in terms of risk reduction said andrew behar chief executive of as you sow a shareholder advocacy group he said the votes included climate resolutions political spending and racial justice now behar says blackrock seems to be reevaluating its approach it seems to me like blackrock is seeing voting as a liability behar said

for the headline cpi up from 8 6 in may despite big falls in commodity prices in the interim there are two reasons why inflation could yet be higher those commodity price falls are all well and good but their impact does not immediately flow through to consumer prices producers order their raw materials ahead manufacture their goods send them to distributors and then on the retailers and all of that takes time the other issue is rent despite us house prices beginning to ease rents have continued to rise steadily rents are one third of the cpi equation and while landlords are quick to put

molecular targeted treatments abstract no ep08 02 063 about nsclc egfr and met aberrations lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women accounting for about one fifth of all cancer deaths 1 more than a third of the world s lung cancer patients are in china 2 lung cancer is broadly split into nsclc and small cell lung cancer with 80 85 classified as nsclc 3 the majority of nsclc patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25 30 present with resectable disease at diagnosis 4 5 approximately 10 25 of nsclc patients in the u s and europe and 30 40 of patients in asia have egfr mutated nsclc 6 7 8 these patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with an egfr tki which blocks the cell signaling pathways that drive the growth of tumor cells 9 while an egfr tki can provide a durable survival benefit to most patients the majority will ultimately develop resistance to their first line treatment underscoring a great unmet need to tackle acquired resistance in this patient population 10 met is a tyrosine kinase receptor 11 aberration of met amplification or overexpression is present in both treatment naïve patients as well as being one of the primary mechanisms of acquired resistance to egfr tkis for metastatic egfr mutated nsclc 12 13 approximately 2 3 of nsclc patients have tumors with met exon 14 skipping alterations a targetable mutation in the met gene 14 among patients who experience disease progression post osimertinib treatment approximately 15 50 present with met aberration 15 16 17 18 19 the prevalence of met amplification and overexpression may differ depending on the sample type detection method and assay cut off used about savolitinib orpathys in china savolitinib is an oral potent and highly selective met tki that has demonstrated clinical activity in advanced solid tumors it blocks atypical activation of the met receptor tyrosine kinase pathway that occurs because of mutations such as exon 14 skipping alterations or other point mutations or gene amplification savolitinib is marketed in china under the brand name orpathys for the treatment of patients with nsclc with met exon 14 skipping alterations who have progressed following prior systemic therapy or are unable to receive chemotherapy it is currently under clinical development for multiple tumor types including lung kidney and gastric cancers as a single treatment and in combination with other medicines in 2011 following its discovery and initial development by hutchmed astrazeneca and hutchmed entered a global licensing and collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize savolitinib joint development of savolitinib in china is led by hutchmed while astrazeneca leads development outside of china hutchmed

independent data and safety monitoring committee recommends continuing study without sample size adjustment idsmc did not identify any safety concerns phase 2 study target enrollment achieved final data and communication expected in october 2023 conference call and webcast today at 2 00 p m pdt 5 00 p m edt south san francisco calif business wire atara biotherapeutics inc nasdaq atra a leader in t cell immunotherapy leveraging its novel allogeneic ebv t cell platform to develop transformative therapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases today announced completion of the planned interim analysis ia of the ata188 phase 2 randomized placebo controlled study embold in june 2022 the ia included review by the independent data and safety monitoring committee idsmc of the efficacy safety and biomarker data available at the data cut off based on which the idsmc recommended the study continue without sample size adjustment the ia s primary focus was on expanded disability status scale edss improvement at six months and overall safety and also included evaluation of edss beyond six months for patients with longer treatment duration as well as other available clinical data and magnetization transfer ratio mtr biomarker data the ia was also designed to assess if a sample size increase was needed based on a conditional power modeling approach the ia was planned to occur before enrolling patient 80 to enable an increased sample size if needed the main assessment at the embold ia was edss improvement at six months which in the 24 patient open label phase 1 study appeared to be predictive of confirmed edss improvement at 12 months the primary endpoint for the embold study at the time of the embold ia there were edss data on 34 patients evaluable at six months and 15 patients at 12 months across both placebo and active groups with 1 1 randomization based on the analysis of the embold data available at the time of the ia there was not a sufficient dataset to draw conclusions about the predictive value of six months edss improvement for 12 months edss improvement the idsmc believes the six month interim endpoint may be an inaccurate measure of the potential of this intervention in this condition the idsmc recommended continuing the study without sample size adjustment until the final analysis of the primary endpoint of confirmed edss improvement at 12 months following the embold ia we are proceeding with the idsmc s recommendation that the study continue to completion without sample size adjustment said jakob dupont m d head of global research development at atara after reviewing the clinical and safety data available at the data cut off the idsmc did not highlight any safety concerns in the ongoing study we are pleased to have completed the target enrollment for the embold study and look forward to sharing the topline results as planned at an appropriate forum in october 2023 after completing the ia in june the target enrollment of 80 patients was achieved total enrollment will be higher as patients that were already in screening through the end of june will be allowed to continue the enrollment process final read out of the study primary endpoint of confirmed edss improvement at 12 months is planned to occur in october 2023 we look forward to completing the embold study as we aspire to demonstrate a potentially transformative profile for ata188 in patients with progressive ms who have high unmet need and limited options said pascal touchon president and chief executive officer of atara conference

twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation against elon musk example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video san francisco twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday to force him to complete the 44 billion acquisition of the social media company musk and twitter have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday he was backing off of his april agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the suit says twitter filed its lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there as part of the april deal musk and twitter had agreed to pay each other a 1 billion breakup fee if either was responsible for the deal falling through the company could have pushed musk to pay the hefty fee but is going farther than that trying to force him to complete the full 44 billion purchase approved by the company s board oh the irony lol musk tweeted after twitter filed the lawsuit without explanation the arguments and evidence laid out by twitter are very strong and compelling and likely to get a receptive ear in the delaware court which doesn t look kindly on sophisticated buyers backing off of deals said brian quinn a law professor at boston college they make a very strong argument that this is just buyer s remorse quinn said you have to eat your mistakes in the delaware chancery court that s going to work very favorably for twitter musk alleged friday that twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts on its service twitter said last month that it was making available to musk a fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets the company has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5 of the accounts on the platform are fake musk is also alleging that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team twitter s suit repeatedly emphasizes musk s contemplation of starting a twitter competitor an alternative option he sometimes aired publicly and sometimes privately to twitter s executives and board members while the company has said it cooperated in providing the spam bot data he requested the lawsuit suggests there was concern that disclosing too much highly sensitive information could expose twitter to competitive harm if shared the biggest surprise for quinn was how much evidence twitter has for instance communications with musk about whether to retain or lay off employees as well as the billionaire s own public tweets to reject his arguments for backing out they are marshaling many of musk s own tweets to hoist him on his own petard he said when musk offered to buy the company and take it private in mid april the board initially tried to block him by deploying a financial maneuver that would have made the acquisition prohibitively expensive by april 25 though twitter had reconsidered the offer concluding that selling the company to musk for 54 20 a share was in the best interest of shareholders in a joint press release musk pledged to unlock the social media company s potential by loosening restrictions on speech and rooting out fake accounts but his confidence didn t last long tesla s stock musk s primary source of wealth plummeted amid a broader stock market selloff in may and musk soon seemed less enthusiastic about owning twitter twitter s suit calls musk s tactics a model of hypocrisy noting that he had emphasized plans to take twitter private in order to rid it of spam accounts once the market declined however twitter noted that musk shifted his narrative suddenly demanding verification that spam was not a serious problem on twitter s platform and claiming a burning need to conduct diligence he had expressly forsworn similarly the company charges that musk operated in bad faith accusing him of requesting company information in order to accuse twitter of providing misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors musk has been acting against this deal since the market started turning and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process the suit charges he has purported to put the deal on hold pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions breached his financing efforts obligations in the process violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status violated his non disparagement obligation misused confidential information and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition

on monday president joe biden commemorated the passage of a bill designed to reduce national gun violence by incentivizing states to pass stricter gun laws making it harder for people convicted of domestic violence to purchase a gun and tightening the review process for gun purchasers under the age of 21 what we re doing here today is real it s vivid it s relevant biden said it s proof that despite the naysayers we can make meaningful progress on dealing with gun violence you have to do more interrupted attendee manuel oliver whose son was killed in the 2018 mass shooting in parkland florida oliver later told the press that he was frustrated with the fanfare over limited legislation that would fail to eradicate the epidemic of gun violence a deadly problem felt nationwide and sure enough gun violence is everywhere in philadelphia where a shooter opened fire on the fourth of july the gunfire hardly made the news overshadowed by a deadly mass shooting the same day in highland park illinois no one died in the philadelphia shooting although two police officers said they sustained minor injuries for pennsylvania lawmakers it was one of many opportunities to lament gun crimes in philadelphia which saw a record number of homicides last year with 562 people killed but despite their rhetoric pennsylvania legislators have gone out of their way to avoid addressing the issue instead they re considering legislation that would weaken gun laws despite biden s state directed incentives republicans in control of both chambers of the pennsylvania general assembly have gutted a gun control bill inserting language that would allow people without permits to carry concealed weapons last year democratic gov tom wolf vetoed a bill with similar language at the same time they have advanced legislation to restrict the ability of philadelphia s district attorney larry krasner to prosecute certain gun crimes and crimes on public transit in june just seven months after krasner was reelected with 70 percent of the vote they launched an effort to impeach him if that fails another bill would limit him to two terms in office on friday more than 25 legal advocacy and criminal justice reform groups wrote an open letter to pennsylvania house leadership stating their opposition to the efforts to undermine krasner at this moment it is imperative that we do not waste time on a disingenuous endeavor to impeach a democratically elected district attorney the legislature has an opportunity to declare gun violence a public health crisis and move to enact legislation that addresses the structural and systemic inequities at the heart of that crisis the letter reads in fact at the very moment intentions to impeach were being announced the legislature voted down a slate of bills that sought to address gun violence the impeachment is a circus it s just an election year ploy the focus in harrisburg on krasner s office is an attack on democracy and the rights of black and brown voters in philadelphia said robert saleem holbrook a lecturer at the university of pennsylvania law school and the executive director of the abolitionist law center a public interest law firm that was one of the signatories on friday s letter the impeachment is a circus it s just an election year ploy holbrook said it s a way for republicans to try to galvanize their base to create an issue to bring their people out for the gubernatorial election i normally wouldn t give much stock to such a circus except for the fact that it s also about democracy and agency of black and brown philadelphians and philadelphians in general who in 2021 elected krasner overwhelmingly to a second term philadelphia is the only county in the state where a person risks catching a felony on an otherwise clean record for carrying a firearm without a license in other counties such an offense would generally be prosecuted as a misdemeanor krasner s office has dismissed some gun cases to avoid saddling people with felonies holbrook said they don t care about black and brown philadelphians holbrook said of the legislators fighting krasner if that was the case they would do more to stop straw purchases what they care about is turning philadelphia back into the mass incarceration machine of the state photo tom brenner for the washington post via getty images just days after three republican state representatives announced that they were seeking support for articles of impeachment against krasner two of those same republicans reps joshua kail and torren ecker voted in the pennsylvania house judiciary committee to gut a gun control bill and allow for the carrying of permitless and concealed handguns state rep todd stephens was the only republican to vote against gutting the measure a week later kail was the primary sponsor of a resolution to establish a committee to investigate krasner kail ecker and stephens were part of a bipartisan group of state representatives who voted to pass the resolution some republicans particularly in rural areas don t realize the impact of gun violence in their communities stephens told the intercept for a lot of my colleagues they don t see gun violence affecting their communities on a daily basis the way many others do he said i wish that there were a greater awareness about the gun deaths that are occurring in rural pennsylvania so that it might become a greater priority for those representatives representing those communities stephens added that he supports red flag laws as well as comprehensive and universal background checks i think there s a general misunderstanding about how gun violence impacts rural pennsylvania stephens said pointing out that suicides make up a majority of all gun deaths in the state and particularly in rural pennsylvania suicide is not something that s carried in the mainstream media it s not something that s readily discussed throughout our community while mass media and politicians focus on violence in urban centers murder rates have soared in rural america a study last summer showed that suicides in rural parts of pennsylvania were on the rise and that there were more handgun sales per every 1 000 residents in rural areas than in urban areas kail said that pennsylvania already has strict gun laws and you could pass all the laws you want but challenged with respect to philadelphia what good does a law do if you don t have district attorneys who are willing to enforce them asked about gun deaths in rural areas kail said that if there was a specific instance of a da in a rural area not enforcing laws on the books he d be happy to look into it but the lives that are being lost the situations have come out of philadelphia the recent moves are just the latest in a yearslong attempt by pennsylvania lawmakers to chip away at krasner s power in 2019 the general assembly quietly passed a bill to take away krasner s authority to prosecute certain firearms violations in the city and instead gave that ability to the state s attorney general democratic attorney general josh shapiro who is currently running for governor said he would support a repeal of the controversial law after pressure from advocates at that year s netroots nation conference in philadelphia the law was set to expire at the end of krasner s first term but the general assembly quickly took up an extension the trend isn t unique to pennsylvania federal lawmakers have also turned away from the gun crisis plaguing the country in favor of piecemeal legislation whose impacts amount to little more than posturing and pushing more funding toward police who have repeatedly failed to stop mass shootings and in some cases even made them worse national democrats need to win a senate seat in pennsylvania in november in order to have any chance to pass meaningful legislation before the end of biden s first term in office but lawmakers in the party aren t treating the remaining four months until the 2022 midterm elections with a commensurate sense of urgency said state rep elizabeth fiedler who represents south philadelphia fiedler is one of several progressive lawmakers elected in recent years who has come under attacks similar to those levied against krasner for her support for popular criminal justice reforms disappointment with biden at the national level is also prevalent at the state and local level fiedler said philadelphians were critical to helping biden win the state in 2020 four years after former president donald trump flipped pennsylvania red for the first time in three decades since then democrats across the state have lost control of the narrative and instead let it be dictated by republicans who in turn have used their control of the state legislature to target krasner and pass little else things that biden promised to those voters taxing the wealthy eliminating student loan debt and passing a robust agenda to combat the climate crisis have slid so far off the radar according to fiedler democrats in the state just voted to cut pennsylvania s corporate tax rate significantly over the next decade a policy that voters in the state overwhelmingly oppose a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by progressive officials just passed a major home repair assistance bill but party leaders continue to blame progressives for thinning margins in both

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation against elon musk san francisco twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday to force him to complete the 44 billion acquisition of the social media company musk and twitter have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday he was backing off of his april agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the suit says twitter filed its lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there as part of the april deal musk and twitter had agreed to pay each other a 1 billion breakup fee if either was responsible for the deal falling through the company could have pushed musk to pay the hefty fee but is going farther than that trying to force him to complete the full 44 billion purchase approved by the company s board oh the irony lol musk tweeted after twitter filed the lawsuit without explanation the arguments and evidence laid out by twitter are very strong and compelling and likely to get a receptive ear in the delaware court which doesn t look kindly on sophisticated buyers backing off of deals said brian quinn a law professor at boston college they make a very strong argument that this is just buyer s remorse quinn said you have to eat your mistakes in the delaware chancery court that s going to work very favorably for twitter musk alleged friday that twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts on its service twitter said last month that it was making available to musk a fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets the company has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5 of the accounts on the platform are fake musk is also alleging that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team twitter s suit repeatedly emphasizes musk s contemplation of starting a twitter competitor an alternative option he sometimes aired publicly and sometimes privately to twitter s executives and board members while the company has said it cooperated in providing the spam bot data he requested the lawsuit suggests there was concern that disclosing too much highly sensitive information could expose twitter to competitive harm if shared the biggest surprise for quinn was how much evidence twitter has for instance communications with musk about whether to retain or lay off employees as well as the billionaire s own public tweets to reject his arguments for backing out they are marshaling many of musk s own tweets to hoist him on his own petard he said when musk offered to buy the company and take it private in mid april the board initially tried to block him by deploying a financial maneuver that would have made the acquisition prohibitively expensive by april 25 though twitter had reconsidered the offer concluding that selling the company to musk for 54 20 a share was in the best interest of shareholders in a joint press release musk pledged to unlock the social media company s potential by loosening restrictions on speech and rooting out fake accounts but his confidence didn t last long tesla s stock musk s primary source of wealth plummeted amid a broader stock market selloff in may and musk soon seemed less enthusiastic about owning twitter twitter s suit calls musk s tactics a model of hypocrisy noting that he had emphasized plans to take twitter private in order to rid it of spam accounts once the market declined however twitter noted that musk shifted his narrative suddenly demanding verification that spam was not a serious problem on twitter s platform and claiming a burning need to conduct diligence he had expressly forsworn similarly the company charges that musk operated in bad faith accusing him of requesting company information in order to accuse twitter of providing misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors musk has been acting against this deal since the market started turning and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process the suit charges he has purported to put the deal on hold pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions breached his financing efforts obligations in the process violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status violated his non disparagement obligation misused confidential information and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition

bigstock photo update the washington state supreme court on wednesday agreed to hear the capital gains case on direct appeal the story has been updated to reflect the change the future of washington s capital gains tax is in the hands of washington state supreme court when july 8 passed last week so did the deadline for filing signatures on the more than three dozen ballot measures opposing the new tax none of the measures had sufficient signatures to qualify for the november ballot no one came in friday to file anything regarding the capital gains measures said charlie boisner the communications director for the washington secretary of state the issue he said won t be taken up by voters this year but the future of the tax targeting large stock sales for washington state residents approved by both the state legislature and the governor in 2021 remains unclear after gov jay inslee signed the measure into law its opponents successfully blocked it in douglas county court douglas county superior court judge brian huber sided with opponents of the new tax who argued it was an illegal income tax under the state constitution attorney general bob ferguson subsequently appealed the ruling directly to the state supreme court the state s highest court on wednesday agreed to bypass the lower appellate court and take on the case political consultant sandeep kaushik writing for post alley on tuesday said the failure of one of the ballot measure campaigns to repeal the law initiative 1929 could be the most meaningful and consequential political development in washington state this year capital gains opponents drawing from the ranks of the very wealthy and the venture capital community spent more than a year laying the groundwork for a repeal initiative that never ended up gathering a single signature kaushik wrote the statewide capital gains tax placed a 7 excise tax on the sale of stocks bonds and businesses the first tax of its type in state history the excise tax wasn t universally popular in the tech community because it sought to target and tax a common form of the industry s compensation stocks and stock options but the tax would apply only to capital gains of more than 250 000 and it would exempt many other potential capital gains including real estate land and structures retirement accounts livestock for farming or ranching and the sale of timber and timberlands among other exceptions the central issue for the court is the capital gains tax an income tax or a sales tax proponents of the tax said is not an income tax but instead an excise or sales tax that only is collected when a sufficient amount of stock is sold in nearly every state and within the irs capital gains are classified as income but washington is an outlier for one legal reason it s the only state in the nation that classifies income as real property this has thwarted any attempts at approving any form of income tax because all income taxes are therefore subject to the sharp constitutional restrictions on property taxes there are no such restrictions on sales or excise taxes

updated july 12 2022 at 6 48 pm et twitter has sued elon musk to compel him to buy the social media company for 44 billion a deal the world s richest person said last week he was calling off the lawsuit filed in delaware s court of chancery on tuesday accuses musk of hypocrisy and bad faith in breaching his contract with twitter it claims that musk used pretexts including a question about how many fake and spam accounts are on the platform as way to try to kill the acquisition after a market downturn made it look like he was getting a bad deal yet the suit points out he was under a legally binding contract musk wanted an escape but the merger agreement left him little room wrote attorney william savitt and other lawyers representing the social media company the lawsuit sets twitter and musk up for an expensive and high stakes battle in which a once reluctant seller will try to force the hand of a now unwilling buyer musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests twitter s lawyers allege in the suit musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away musk tweeted oh the irony lol shortly after the lawsuit was filed neither he nor his representatives responded to npr s request for comment under delaware law musk s legal team has 20 days to respond to the complaint twitter has proposed an expedited timetable however arguing that any delay would hurt the company lawyers with experience in the delaware court of chancery say musk winning will be an uphill battle experts say the case will likely hinge on proving that twitter was not forthcoming in the negotiations there is a body of caselaw in delaware that says buyers remorse does not allow a buyer to back out of a deal said daniel griffith a lawyer who has practiced in the court for 14 years this is a complicated case but at the end of the day the legal analysis won t be that sophisticated it s just whether there was what s called a material adverse change or not he said twitter musk got buyers remorse once tech stocks plunged the tesla and spacex ceo struck an agreement to buy twitter for 54 20 a share in late april after he became its largest shareholder he vowed to make the platform a bastion of unfettered free speech and clean up the long running issue of spam and automated bots but since then the mercurial billionaire has flipped he launched a fight with the company over the prevalence of fake accounts which he claims without offering evidence is higher than twitter lets on he s also aimed a near constant stream of criticism at the company including using his twitter feed to attack executives and complaining about its content moderation decisions and features under the deal there is a 1 billion fee if one party walks away under certain circumstances musk could try to accuse twitter of misrepresenting the number of bots on the platform as a way of avoiding that fee but legal experts say that argument is unlikely to prevail in court in other merger disputes that have landed in the delaware court parties have resolved their differences by renegotiating at a lower sale price twitter brushed off musk s arguments in its complaint according to the lawsuit once stock market conditions made the bid look less attractive and tesla shares musk s main source of wealth declined the billionaire iced out twitter executives disparaged the company and made public requests aimed at making the company appear as if it was being negligent twitter officials suspected musk was attempting to wiggle out of the agreement from the outset defendants information requests were designed to try to tank the deal musk s increasingly outlandish requests reflect not a genuine examination of twitter s processes but a litigation driven campaign to try to create a record of non cooperation on twitter s part the company s lawsuit says then there was a sudden departure on june 23 according to the suit musk informed twitter leadership that he was parting ways with one of his point people on the deal former intel ceo bob swan we are not on the same wavelength musk allegedly texted twitter management after that twitter attempted to reach musk s team officials from two banks advising the company goldman sachs and jp morgan also tried in vain to talk to swan s successor according to the suit twitter s team used a provision of the merger agreement to get an update on the status of musk s financing a day later the suit says musk texted twitter ceo parag agrawal and finance chief ned segal your lawyers are using these conversations to cause trouble musk allegedly wrote that needs to stop copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

a legal battle over elon musk s obligation to buy twitter could come to trial sooner rather than later at the delaware court of chancery cn twitter sued to force elon musk to follow through on a 44 billion deal to buy the company accusing the billionaire tesla founder of reneging on a binding agreement even as musk accuses the social media platform of withholding critical information about fake accounts in april 2022 elon musk entered into a binding merger agreement with twitter promising to use his best efforts to get the deal done now less than three months later musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests twitter says in the lawsuit it filed tuesday in the delaware court of chancery a specialized court for litigating corporate disputes having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away musk agreed to buy twitter in april for 54 20 per share a deal which would take the now publicly traded company private through its lawsuit twitter seeks to compel musk to close the deal brian j m quinn a professor at boston college law school who specializes in corporate law and mergers said musk s complaint is couched in the language of buyer s remorse this is a very familiar argument to the courts in delaware a buyer agrees to buy and decides he or she has overpaid and wants out courts are not amenable to buyers who take this position he said musk had been threatening to walk away since june when he accused the company of materially breaching its obligations under the agreement by refusing to provide him with information about fake accounts if twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates mr musk does not understand the company s reluctance to allow mr musk to independently evaluate those estimates his skadden arps attorneys said in a letter filed with the u s securities and exchange commission on june 6 twitter s lawsuit characterizes musk s exit strategy as both a model of hypocrisy and bad faith condemning him for demanding the platform turn over information about the number of spam bots only after the price of tesla stock nosedived twitter says musk was well aware of the bot problem telling board president bret taylor in a text message that a purge of fake users should be done after the company is taken private twitter also charges musk with insulting the company publicly in violation of a nondisparagement agreement presenting an array of the tweets where he accuses the company of inaccurately estimating that fewer than 5 of its accounts are fake the complaint also includes screen grabs of tweets where musk appears to taunt the company musk s conduct simply confirms that he wants to escape the binding contract he freely signed and to damage twitter in the process the company says quinn was partial to twitter s case obviously musk has not yet responded so we see only the facts presented by twitter but those facts are pretty compelling quinn said the thing that grabs the attention the most is that they use every single tweet they can to hoist him on his own petard he said musk could have had a stronger leg to stand on had he not waived due diligence he s the richest man in the world he has enough money he just doesn t want to spend it right now on this quinn said quinn said the delaware court of chancery in well versed in these kinds of cases where a buyer tries to back out of a deal once it appears less lucrative
twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation against elon musk example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video san francisco twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday to force him to complete the 44 billion acquisition of the social media company musk and twitter have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday he was backing off of his april agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit opens with a sharply worded accusation musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the suit says twitter filed its lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there as part of the april deal musk and twitter had agreed to pay each other a 1 billion breakup fee if either was responsible for the deal falling through the company could have pushed musk to pay the hefty fee but is going farther than that trying to force him to complete the full 44 billion purchase approved by the company s board oh the irony lol musk tweeted after twitter filed the lawsuit without explanation the arguments and evidence laid out by twitter are very strong and compelling and likely to get a receptive ear in the delaware court which doesn t look kindly on sophisticated buyers backing off of deals said brian quinn a law professor at boston college they make a very strong argument that this is just buyer s remorse quinn said you have to eat your mistakes in the delaware chancery court that s going to work very favorably for twitter musk alleged friday that twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts on its service twitter said last month that it was making available to musk a fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets the company has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5 of the accounts on the platform are fake musk is also alleging that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team twitter s suit repeatedly emphasizes musk s contemplation of starting a twitter competitor an alternative option he sometimes aired publicly and sometimes privately to twitter s executives and board members while the company has said it cooperated in providing the spam bot data he requested the lawsuit suggests there was concern that disclosing too much highly sensitive information could expose twitter to competitive harm if shared the biggest surprise for quinn was how much evidence twitter has for instance communications with musk about whether to retain or lay off employees as well as the billionaire s own public tweets to reject his arguments for backing out they are marshaling many of musk s own tweets to hoist him on his own petard he said when musk offered to buy the company and take it private in mid april the board initially tried to block him by deploying a financial maneuver that would have made the acquisition prohibitively expensive by april 25 though twitter had reconsidered the offer concluding that selling the company to musk for 54 20 a share was in the best interest of shareholders in a joint press release musk pledged to unlock the social media company s potential by loosening restrictions on speech and rooting out fake accounts but his confidence didn t last long tesla s stock musk s primary source of wealth plummeted amid a broader stock market selloff in may and musk soon seemed less enthusiastic about owning twitter twitter s suit calls musk s tactics a model of hypocrisy noting that he had emphasized plans to take twitter private in order to rid it of spam accounts once the market declined however twitter noted that musk shifted his narrative suddenly demanding verification that spam was not a serious problem on twitter s platform and claiming a burning need to conduct diligence he had expressly forsworn similarly the company charges that musk operated in bad faith accusing him of requesting company information in order to accuse twitter of providing misrepresentations about its business to regulators and investors musk has been acting against this deal since the market started turning and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process the suit charges he has purported to put the deal on hold pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions breached his financing efforts obligations in the process violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status violated his non disparagement obligation misused confidential information and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition
