if you re looking to score some weed and get high over the labour day long weekend in bc you might be in luck depending on where you live in the province earlier this week we learned that the bc general employees union and the bc public service agency had reached a tentative agreement putting a pause on weeks long job action that job action led to significant supply shortages for liquor stores and bc weed shops for days we visited a few shops and saw complete displays empty we also learned that hundreds had lost their jobs and many stores were forced to shut down at least temporarily while some of these jobs will likely be restored as supply continues to be replenished some wonder whether the job action may have had a long lasting impact on bc s cannabis industry bc weed stock over labour day weekend the good news is that weed stock over the labour day long weekend in bc might be replenished for parts of the province daily hive spoke with jaclynn pehota the executive director of the retail cannabis council of bc about supply worries for the long weekend initially it sounded like terrible news for weed consumers unfortunately based on what we are hearing for 90 of these shops the orders will not arrive in time for the long weekend the shops that are closed will remain that way and i know of another 40 stores that will be closing their doors until those orders arrive she said minutes later pehota told us that the council had received notice that the liquor distribution centre would be shipping over the weekend to certain stores in specific instances as a result it ll likely still be weeks before normal supply levels return but stores won t be completely dry this will reduce closures especially for the lower mainland she said in response to the notice based on our conversation with pehota it does seem like the lower mainland will be getting the bulk of the shipments long term impacts we were literally days away from a catastrophic loss of thousands of jobs full stop and we have yet to see any indication this government is aware of this fact or concerned about it said pehota all of the choices that led up to this disruption were active choices made by leaders and for the sake of our sector i hope that those choices start to reflect a meaningful understanding of both the challenges and potential of legal cannabis daily hive spoke to another professional in the cannabis industry who has years of experience working within it and living by the rules set by the bc government audrey wong is the founder of zyre a cannabis vape company that launched in bc in recent weeks right before wong learned about the bcgeu job action view this post on instagram a post shared by zyre canadian cannabis vapes zyrelife we never actually made it to retail stores maybe a couple who happened to order on the day that it shipped in wong was one of the people leading the charge to make cannabis legal in canada in 2017 working as an executive with the bc ldb i came from four years working at the government side so i forecasted these types of obstacles said wong the unfortunate part about how the cannabis model works in bc is that customers can t directly go to the source the monopoly distribution model means by law everything has to be sold through the bc cannabis stores wong admits that the current model has some cons but the pro is the logistics setup for a small supplier is much more simple when you deal with one customer and one invoice and they deal with the logistics and the fulfillment for you wong expects zyre products to be fully available in most cannabis retail outlets across the province looking at the larger picture of the bc cannabis industry pehota wishes that bc would look at a model like colorado s colorado continues to earn hundreds of millions of dollars in cannabis tax revenue and billions more in spinoff economic activity we are now several years into legalization and canada s cannabis capital has yet to see even a small fraction of that benefit we are absolutely squandering a slam dunk economic opportunity that should be benefitting the entire province not actively impeding small businesses

five weeks ago when the commerce department reported that the inflation adjusted gross domestic product dipped in the second quarter the house republican leader kevin mccarthy declared this morning the government announced what every american has been feeling for nearly a year we are in a recession at the white house that day joe biden pushed back pointing to continued job growth and an expansion in manufacturing he said that doesn t sound like a recession to me score one to the old guy in the aviator sunglasses on friday morning the labor department issued its monthly survey of payrolls which indicated that employers added another three hundred and fifteen thousand jobs in august following again of five hundred and twenty six thousand jobs in july the labor department s accompanying survey of households indicated even stronger job growth last month four hundred and forty two thousand the unemployment rate which is based on this second survey ticked up a bit from 3 5 per cent to 3 7 per cent but in this case the rise in unemployment reflected stronger economic activity rather than job losses in august a whopping seven hundred and eighty six thousand people entered or reëntered the ranks of those working or actively looking for work and the labor force participation rate ticked up to 62 4 per cent to put it gently economies that are in recession do not behave in this manner far from plunging into a slump over the summer the u s economy created more than 1 1 million jobs since the end of may over the past year total employment has risen by 5 8 million after the jobs report was released biden didn t exactly do a victory lap around the white house ellipse but at an event to promote business investment he did hail its contents the great american jobs machine continues its comeback he said with today s news we have now created nearly ten million new jobs since i took office nearly ten million jobs the fastest growth in all of american history as always the monthly report should be placed in a broader context taken over all it s still clear that the economy has slowed down appreciably from last year when it expanded at the fastest rate since 1984 as pandemic shutdowns ended the august employment update also confirmed that wages are rising more slowly than inflation which implies that workers purchasing power is falling furthermore nobody can be sure what will happen in the coming months as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to bring down inflation there remains a serious danger that its actions will tip the economy into a genuine slump these concerns explain the fall in the stock market over the past couple of weeks on friday the dow fell further as investors digested the jobs report but the republican claim that the economy is now in recession lacks credibility if it were true the signs would be visible in cyclical sectors like construction retail and temporary services instead the payrolls survey showed that all three of these sectors added jobs in june july and august other reports also point to continued expansion with gas prices falling consumer confidence rose in august according to the conference board a business research group the federal reserve of atlanta s g d p now model shows annualized g d p growth in the three months from july to september tracking toward 2 6 per cent which would represent a rebound from the previous two quarters this being an election campaign season there is no possibility that the republicans will acknowledge that they got it wrong of course on friday mccarthy didn t immediately react to the new jobs report neither did senator lindsey graham of south carolina the g o p response was left to representative kevin brady of texas the senior republican on the house ways and means committee who issued a statement saying that because of the biden recession and crushing inflation more americans are being forced back into the workforce to survive give brady credit for ingenuity at least for the past couple of years there have been concerns that because of the lingering effects of the pandemic many americans would never return to work or even to looking for work the latest payrolls report alleviated these concerns it showed that for the first time total employment has exceeded its pre pandemic peak of 152 5 million and now stands at 152 7 million to repeat the economy has recovered all the jobs that were lost to the coronavirus and then some because of population growth since the start of 2020 there is still room for further job gains especially among younger and older americans but in the prime age workers demographic those aged twenty five to fifty four the percentage of people employed is now virtually back to its pre pandemic level 80 3 per cent in august compared to 80 5 per cent in february of 2020 these are encouraging developments unless of course you are a republican politician running on the claim that the economy has gone to hell

text size in march last year the chief executive of a high flying artificial intelligence marketing start up called metigy went on a little known podcast to talk about his experience running a string of successful companies after the host bowled up a softball question about childhood business aspirations david fairfull had an unusual response it s probably someone like alan bond before the gloss came off fairfull said bond s gloss was substantial in the end the 1980s businessman and deal maker spent time in jail for fraud alan bond pictured in 1986 was a giant of the era but the gloss came off and he served time in jail credit neale duckworth but fairfull 55 saw something else in bond the aussie who came from nowhere who could do whatever they wanted and take on the world and seemingly make it work my view of it today is that you want to be great at what you do but you want to do it for the right reasons right fairfull s own business aspirations have not gone to plan advertisement metigy which the sydney morning herald and the age can reveal was trying to raise 50 million from investors at a 1 billion valuation as recently as march and had forecast annual recurring revenue to investors of 135 million by the end of 2022 has collapsed seventy five staff have lost their jobs its offices were vacant when this masthead visited this week rows of desks sitting empty metigy co founder david fairfull led the company since its inception in 2015 the herald and age can reveal that metigy s grand ambitions to help small businesses crack social media marketing came unstuck after an internal whistleblower contacted an investor to alert them to their concerns about the company s claims and its potential insolvency this masthead has decided not to name the whistleblower and they have not responded to inquiries it appears that whistleblower led to investors requesting that administrators be appointed to the company a request to which fairfull agreed late july according to documents filed with the corporate regulator the administrators who are now picking over the remnants of metigy and its business dealings have alleged that fairfull who was sole director when it collapsed ran the business for at least nine months while it was insolvent the herald and the age have put extensive questions to fairfull via call text and email prior to this story and over recent weeks he has not responded fairfull is not the david fairfull who is chairman of firm hall chadwick administrators from cathro partners have told metigy s creditors who are allegedly owed more than 20 million that the group became insolvent because fairfull loaned his private company 7 7 million from metigy in november 2021 on friday creditors voted to place the company into liquidation which will allow cathro partners to conduct deeper investigations into metigy s affairs fairfull is assisting the administrators advertisement in the lead up to the meeting administrator simon cathro told this masthead the loan money was likely used at least in part for payments on two luxury properties the first a 10 5 million five bedroom mansion in a quiet pocket in mosman overlooks sydney harbour the second a 7 7 million 118 acre estate near kangaroo valley includes a private rainforest waterfall tennis court swimming pool stables horse arena guest cottage and four bedroom residence across two wings these were the kind of rewards many a successful start up entrepreneur has claimed the family of one the co founders of atlassian the country s biggest technology company recently bought dunk island in far north queensland but metigy was not a corporate titan like atlassian spinning off more than 4 billion in annual revenue despite its bullish forecasts metigy s sales according to the administrators report were about 61 000 last year and 17 299 the year before that so who would put tens of millions into such a company and what were investors told before backing a business that made claims it expected to grow more than 300 per cent a year some of australia s highest profile investors were involved melbourne billionaire alex waislitz s thorney investment had a stake so too did adrian mackenzie s five v capital in a former life with private equity firm cvc capital partners mckenzie was the face of an audacious buyout of nine entertainment co which years after cvc s play had ended in disaster bought fairfax media and this masthead advertisement but thorney and five v had a relatively small role in metigy as fairfull told it when he announced a 20 million raise in november 2020 a small early investor cygnet capital had helped secure others we have no comment to make at this time a spokesman for cygnet said cp ventures another early investor was contacted for comment the largest investor who went in on the deal was regal funds management which recently completed a 5 6 billion merger with another fund manager the regal man who led the metigy deal ben mccallum was proud of his investment despite the transaction being organised over zoom metigy was probably the biggest investment i ve ever made without being in the same room and looking at the whites of the eyes of the ceo that we re about to invest in so it was definitely new from that experience mccallum said in april 2021 he said the diligence that we were able to do on the business convinced him it was the right move along with metigy s extraordinary numbers they showed it had just continued to grow and grow at an extremely rapid pace mccallum told industry publication adnews and he trusted fairfull who he said had a record of running successful businesses we knew that he would be a good custodian of new invested money mccallum said advertisement court documents obtained by this masthead now show regal is now suing the fairfulls and a private company fairfull holdings seeking a trustee be appointed to sell the two luxury private properties fairfull has not yet filed a defence regal declined to comment as did five v and thorney an investment presentation deck for metigy seen by this masthead sheds some light on how these usually savvy investors made what turned out to be a woeful decision the deck shows that in 2020 at the time of the first capital raising metigy was telling investors that its recorded revenue for the year ending june 2020 was 4 9 million and that its forecast revenue for the 2021 financial year was 19 6 million and a whopping 76 8 million for 2022 it also told investors its annual recurring revenue a key metric that investors look out for would reach 135 million in 2022 and was already at 8 million in 2020 at the time of the raising loading administrators have so far not reported figures that match those claims and instead believe the annual revenue for the group was a mere five figure sum it appears that investors took metigy at face value and believed the headline growth figure of more than 300 per cent a year was too tempting to miss out on at the time money was cheap because governments all over the world had pushed trillions of dollars of stimulus payments into the market to counter the hit from covid 19 advertisement

there are compelling reasons why it would be unwise to buy shares in housebuilders at present however cheap they may seem the list of reasons includes forecasts that the property market will weaken as incomes are squeezed by higher food costs and fuel bills and further interest rate rises surging inflation continues to drive up housebuilders energy labour and materials costs such overheads were relatively stable until the middle of 2021 as safe as houses if you are minded to take a gamble on the emergence of an economic rebound in 2024 it is possible to take a more sanguine view of the sector s prospects but if you are minded to take a gamble on the emergence of an economic rebound in 2024 it is possible to take a more sanguine view of the sector s prospects much of the bad news may already be reflected in the shares which may be why the consensus of analysts rates both barratt and persimmon a buy the weakening property market is a reminder that housebuilders shares are cyclical stocks dependent on the fortunes of the economy it is also a warning sign darius mcdermott of online fund research centre fundcalibre comments housebuilders margins will be under pressure if they have to cut the price of homes and profits can very quickly disappear in this industry there is more help to buy a boon to the sector since 2013 is ending next march and housebuilders total liability for cladding remediation is yet to be quantified amid shifts in government policy the souring of housebuilders relationship with ministers over cladding has exacerbated share price declines barratt a 4 2billion group has tumbled by 46 per cent this year while persimmon whose market capitalisation is 4 6billion is down 50 per cent the shares were hit yesterday by a particularly gloomy prediction for the sector from hsbc as this column pointed out in april smaller developers cannot deliver enough houses to turn generation rent into generation buy and so attract younger voters liz truss has pledged to rip up planning red tape turbocharging development but if the new government is to meet this goal against the background of ingrained nimbyism it must mend its links with housebuilders finding a solution to the cladding issue some leading investors believe it is the sector s moral responsibility to end this scandal savills and others may be forecasting house price falls in 2023 but savills contends the removal of the most stringent loan affordability tests should in theory enable more people to move there are many affluent homebuyers who have equity in their properties and substantial savings estate agency hamptons is forecasting that mainstream housebuilders may diversify into premium new builds designed for this clientele to compensate for help to buy s withdrawal meanwhile the direction of interest rates matters little to the 54 per cent of households who own their homes outright without a mortgage the recent results of housebuilders suggest that the deepening of the british attachment to property that took place during the pandemic may be a lasting phenomenon for example persimmon s half year results revealed a robust forward order book with 90 per cent 10 542 homes worth 2 32billion sold mcdermott points to other positives the housebuilders have huge amounts of net cash he says and the shares also look extremely cheap another lure is the dividend yields on offer although pressure on margins will constrain this generosity in future persimmon s yield is 16 47 per cent against 3 81 per cent average for the ftse 100 but if you continue to be sceptical about the appeal of housebuilders shares at present you should probably check whether you are holding these stocks through funds and investment trusts it is a good routine practice to discover where your cash is actually invested among the funds backing housebuilders is abrdn which owns most of the big names in its funds and trusts aberdeen standard equity income holds vistry for example jupiter uk dynamic which has a stake in persimmon and man glg income and undervalued assets which invests in bellway columbia threadneedle holds berkeley in its universal map multi asset portfolio funds because its business model is differentiated from the rest of the sector the company specialises in the regeneration of big brownfield sites in london and the surrounding areas where the supply of new homes is under half the amount needed the challenges facing consumers and housebuilders mean putting money into this sector now is a high risk flutter it is a leap of faith in recovery and also in the political will to deliver more homes the obstacles on the way are numerous but not necessarily immovable

balanced economy with steady growth including the job market and to decrease inflation the august employment report paints a very positive picture regarding the current state of the us economy with solid jobs growth yet signs that supply strains are easing as workers return to the labour force with wage growth coming in lower than expected it points to a slower pace of rate hikes after september s expected 75 basis point move knightley said in a statement knightley said the establishment survey of employers shows broad based gains across virtually all sectors there was no one real standout with trade and transport up 65k education and health up 68k and leisure and hospitality up 31k only federal government saw a fall the household survey used to generate the unemployment rate was even more impressive it reported employment rising 442 000 however the eye catching thing was the jump in worker participation to 62 4 from 62 1 with the civilian labour force increasing 786 000 in august he said consequently the unemployment rate rose to 3 7 but for a really positive reason it looks as though workers may finally be returning as the rising cost of living and higher wages together with rapidly receding covid caution incentivise finding a job wages themselves rose a little less than expected at 0 3 month on month versus 0 4 consensus but the year on year rate held steady at 5 2 for

key august jobs report pre market did not bring any major surprises just after the open the dow jones industrial average had added 255 points or 0 8 at 31 911 points the s p 500 was up 38 points or 1 at 4 005 points and the nasdaq composite was up 94 points or 0 8 at 11 879 points titan asset management chief investment officer john leiper commented that the non farm payroll data had taken on greater importance this week in the wake of jerome powell s jackson hole speech bottom line these are positive numbers but will do little to change the 75 basis point versus 50 basis point rate hike he said all eyes now turn to the next us inflation print on september 13th monex europe head of fx analysis simon harvey said august s payroll report was seen as disappointing on the whole as the market s expectations were largely set higher than analysts following yesterday s ism report that showed firms hiring intentions increased over the past month with economic conditions likely forcing more economically inactive individuals back into the labour market today s report suggests that downward pressure may soon start to be exerted on historically high wage growth harvey said should this occur in subsequent labour market reports it will ease the emphasis on the fed to aggressively tighten policy as they currently wish to reduce labour demand to diminish its effects on wage growth in a historically tight labour market and in turn the persistence of inflation 8 35am labor market remains tight hiring remained strong in august despite the fed s series of interest rate hikes according to new employment data from the us bureau of labor statistics the highly anticipated non farm payrolls report showed that the nation added 315 000 jobs in august slightly above the consensus analyst expectation of 300 000 notable job gains occurred in professional and business services health care and retail trade the bureau said unemployment which was forecast to remain stable at 3 5

payrolls data which will likely play a significant part in the outlook for interest rates in the world s biggest economy futures for the dow jones industrial average were trading 0 1 higher pre market while those for the broader s p 500 index were also up 0 1 and futures for the tech laden nasdaq 100 were flat as things stand us rate setters have indicated that they will stick to an aggressive path of interest rate hikes and a strong payroll number will solidify expectations of another 75 basis point increase at the upcoming rate setting meeting a factor that continues to weigh on equities all eyes are on the us jobs data today the us is expected to have added around 300 000 new nonfarm jobs in august ipek ozkardeskaya senior analyst at swissquote bank said noting that another strong nfp print will guarantee a 75bp hike in fomc s september meeting the non farm payrolls data is due out at 8 30am et the continued strength of the labor market has been a key factor in the federal reserve s pursuit of higher interest rates as it fights to tackle runaway inflation which is still hovering around 40 year highs over recent months non farm payrolls have risen rapidly often surpassing expectations suggesting that the wider economy can withstand aggressive interest rate hikes although many watchers still fear that the us will slip into a recession presently investors are braced for another strong nfp read and activity on fed funds futures gives around 75 chance for a 75bp hike in september we could see this probability spike higher in case of strong nfp data which would mean higher us yields a further advance in the us dollar and some more negative pressure on stock valuations noted ozkardeskaya but if today s nfp print is in line or ideally softer than expected as the federal reserve would like it to be then we could see a certain relief in the us yields a rebound in equity markets and hopefully a downside correction in the dollar before the weekly closing bell she added some sections of the markets are hoping for a softer reading after wednesday s adp private sector jobs report for august showed payrolls grew by just 132 000 lower than the 268 000 jobs added in

a combination of supply chain issues and necessary repairs to girders on the structure will keep the higgins avenue beartrack bridge project from being completed until perhaps well into november we spoke to engineering project manager on the higgins avenue bridge with the montana department of transportation matt straub on friday for an update on the bridge reconstruction project the week of september fifth we ll start working on our expansion joint closure pours which are on the ends began straub the week after that so the week of the 12th we ll be working on pouring curbs for the pedestrian vehicle rails so we re looking like we re going to be tied up with our phase two until the end of september straub said some of the work still to be done includes repairs from problems that occurred during phase one of the project get our free mobile app get our free mobile app starting at the beginning of october we re going to have to go in and do some phase one repairs he said we have some damaged girders that we need to go in and fix on the phase one side those repairs are expected to take four to six weeks we re hoping to get it done as soon as possible depending on weather and material availability but the material availability has been the primary driver of our delays we incurred some damage when we were deconstructing the bridge and have been fighting to get the materials to complete those repairs another sticking point in finishing the bridge project is the availability of the type of steel necessary for the job all our steel in the project is of domestic origin so one of the challenges is that we have to find the right steel from a domestic producer he said the steel on that bridge is considered fracture critical that means it has some special testing requirements that go above and beyond just the normal stock steel that you can get off the shelf and all those challenges have contributed to the delays straub said despite the delays and supply chain problems the budget for the project is still close to the original 16 to 17 million estimate upon completion the higgins avenue bridge will eventually be renamed the beartrack bridge according to missoula county commissioners dave strohmaier click here for details looking back photos of missoula and how it s changed check out these photos of how missoula has changed over the past decade

her husband said then july 24 steve jackson s 55th birthday he was out watching the boothbay harbor yacht club regatta when a friend suggested jackson open a candy store at the old big al s jackson has had other candy stores in his career which started with selling baseball cards and their bubble gum to pay for college at bob jones university in greenville south carolina jackson studied business then left before getting a degree because a baseball card company hired him he has had a candy distribution business 10 years and when the pandemic struck in march 2020 and the ski lodges he was selling candy to shut down he said i pivoted to retail in two years he has opened one sweetz more retail store each in tilton north conway merrimack and manchester new hampshire wiscasset will make five and jackson said distribution has come roaring back like a lion it is up 30 from pre pandemic levels he said the distribution center is in holderness candy is recession proof because people can afford a piece of candy even when they can t afford high ticket items in life jackson said in friday s phone interview after wiscasset newspaper saw the leased sign over the for lease one jackson said it was very hot in the midcoast when he recently checked out the building he noticed it was fairly cool inside thanks to the building s extra insulation cool is good for candy jackson continued july 25 cohen texted jackson a photo of a car that had pulled into the parking lot the license plate read candy jackson said cohen told wiscasset newspaper friday for him seeing that maine veteran s plate with that word on it meant leasing to jackson was meant to be cohen had been getting offers from numerous types of businesses since january but he said since a lease is like a marriage he held out for leasing to a business and business person he thought would be right for him and wiscasset he knew some businesses wiscasset didn t need in that spot and he liked what he saw heard and bought at the new hampshire sweetz more s including bonomo s turkish taffy a favorite of a friend of cohen s cohen recounted being at one of the stores and hearing a 40 ish couple talking looking around the woman s eyes got big cohen said and she said to him leave me alone and come back in an hour cohen said he also heard an 80 year old woman come in and say i ve died and gone to heaven children say that at the stores too jackson said he said his personal motto is working hard to make the world a sweeter place he wants to make his wiscasset store maine s sweetest destination jackson does not have an opening date yet but is more and more moving from his first thought of a seasonal store to keeping it open until january or year round given bath iron works commuters and others and gardens aglow and boothbay lights visitors the building s old carpet is being been pulled up this has left the concrete jackson said he may seal and not re carpet he explained this might work best due to the ice cream and soda he also plans to sell there he said the business has 40 ice cream flavors and 600 soda flavors that gives people 24 000 options for floats he said there could be a couple tables for enjoying the ice cream inside and others outside in their separate interviews jackson and cohen praised each other s business accomplishments and jackson said though he had never met cohen at big al s super values when ellen jackson would shop there he is now honored to consider cohen a friend and both have served on planning boards cohen in wiscasset jackson in louden cohen added his big al s fireworks store next door and the candy business will each add customers for the other cohen said the lease to jackson will run at least five years this is going to be a local attraction i think it s amazing cohen added how to get the workers these days jackson does not expect a problem filling the about 10 to 15 retail jobs in the retail store that will take up about 8 000 square feet and the about five to 10 jobs in the warehouse or distribution area in the other 5 000 square feet it is enjoyable work and employees can eat candy he said all his new hampshire stores are fully staffed jackson said he had been concerned by the three hour drive but he has a pilot s license and has already been landing at wiscasset municipal airport the commute there from a grass strip in plymouth is an hour he said when cohen announced last september that his longtime super values store would close lincoln county regional planning commission executive director mary ellen barnes said the store and its well known tv ads helped put wiscasset on the map so it was a loss but also an opportunity for new use there hearing from wiscasset newspaper friday inside lcrpc s office that the building across the road was set to become a candy store barnes said it is a great location for retail and i think it s another sign that wiscasset is booming to me it is you ve got different businesses opening up or changing hands to me thats s a healthy economy in town barnes said she would look forward to visiting the store to buy gifts for friends and family the jacksons have six grown children none in the candy business yet steve jackson said and four grandchildren when he was growing up in the town of norway his family would vacation in boothbay harbor ten years ago he and ellen started the tradition anew

the recipe for the farhat accounting lecture youtube channel is simple a powerpoint deck a professional voice and some red notes highlighting the most complicated concepts the videos cover a broad range of topics from auditing and income taxes to nonprofit accounting but what the channel is most famous for are the prep videos for the notoriously challenging cpa exam mansour farhat 45 doesn t believe the exam is difficult but that students are not prepared enough by exam prep providers saying that these companies often assume that their students have just graduated from college and that their degree gave them the necessary tools farhat argues that the quality gap between colleges grew wider these last few decades and that some students never got got a proper education while others forgot the basics and failed the exam especially in a post pandemic setting while passing rates vary widely among business schools only 50 of students passed on the first try this year and the numbers plummeted to 20 for all four sections at once as a result like many other finfluencers farhat has turned to social media to reshape the way people communicate about financial topics and his channel now counts more than 160 000 followers there is little room for wondering why this content is popular among u s millennials and gen zs with an inflation rate at its highest in 40 years their financial future has certainly known brighter days in 2021 the price for a median family home increased by 17 while more than 72 of millennials and 59 of gen zs were pessimistic about achieving financial security by retirement consequently these generations demonstrated an increased interest in savings debt management personal finances and all sorts of financial and economic topics as demonstrated by the deloitte global 2022 gen z and millennials survey the poll shows that cost of living is the main concern for both generations with unemployment following not far behind however millennials and gen zs still exhibited a lack of trust in financial institutions and turned toward digital assets such as cryptocurrency or stocks which are free from the central banks control that s where social media comes in to educate themselves in finance and investing 45 gen zs use youtube and 30 use tik tok while 47 of millennials tend to turn towards internet searches or youtube at 40 despite these trends financial institutions seem behind on new technologies and a 2022 verbatim r esearch found that only 8 of accounting firms offered a live chat on their website the report also found that three quarters of those surveyed either didn t have or didn t promote a twitter facebook or linkedin presence at the same time well established accounting figures such as tom hood or ron baker have caught on to the changing dynamics within the financial world and share their experience of growing an internet audience with videos podcasts blogs polls webinars and more the new finfluencers use these new tools to broaden people s understanding of the industry with humor insight and ambition sharing knowledge mansour farhat farhat argues that the cpa exam is not a good predictor of success in the field because a lot of the required material will never serve students again while the professor recognizes the necessity of the exam he says it lacks an appreciation for the technical skills or the entrepreneurial spirit needed to be a good accountant people who don t pass were not given enough time to succeed and that s when i come in said fahrat my product is not for someone who graduated from columbia or harvard but for those who need to start from the beginning and learn to love the field while it was never farhat s intention to become an influencer he now works seven days a week to maintain his online presence and is very attentive to engagement rates which evaluate what keeps people s attention still teaching college courses on the side farhat tweets out a motivational quote on twitter every morning and posts one or two lessons a day to keep his students engaged fahra applies accounting principles to real life examples such as fraud cases or mergers and uses them to explain how people get around the rules the former cpa puts a particular emphasis on youtube and instagram because of their popularity among millennials and gen z which he believes is due to their scalability and wide socio demographic reach fahrat thinks that the future of teaching resides online because students are looking for flexibility and want to take charge of their own education coming from all around the world subscribers leave their questions in the comments section and farhat makes a point to always be responsive when you are teaching online you can t leave any stone unturned and you need to think about every question he said it makes you a better teacher because you need to create and listen at the same time and i can understand their concerns if i put myself in their shoes when he was in community college for his master s degree fahrat taught night classes in financial accounting and worked at a local cpa firm during the day eager to spread his knowledge fahrat soon started recording his voice over powerpoint decks and moved all of his videos onto youtube after a few years the channel gathered a wide range of followers among them a lot of cpa candidates who were using the channel as a supplement to prepare for the exam responding to this growing need fahrat later created a website dedicated to exam preparation for a small fee subscribers can access over 60 000 true false and multichoice questions and thousands of accounting tax and auditing lectures i feel responsible for others said farhat for me youtube is no longer a job but a mission which makes it very stressful and demanding but it is also very rewarding because the feeling of helping others is undescribable eventually my goal is to be in every college helping students and become their no 1 info source redpixel stock adobe com challenging the industry ron baker people have always been attracted by garbage and there is loads of it on television and social media there s a strategy even in crap to redirect people s attention and gain a community according to ron baker i just hope that they will be able to form their own judgment and stop following random videos on tiktok eventually baker 60 has seen the financial world transform since he worked as a cpa at big four firm kpmg more than 20 years ago a passionate writer public speaker and radio junkie baker was contacted by voiceamerica com in 2014 to create a radio show and since then every friday at noon baker invites prominent authors or economists to discuss the accounting profession and the rest of the financial world not a great believer in social media or twitter s bathroom wall baker exercises his influence on the radio which he thinks is a theater of the mind and the most intimate form of expression contrary to videos that may be forgotten once the viewer scrolls down baker argues that the audience needs to stay engaged to follow a podcast and they get to know their host like an old friend the author of seven books baker hints that his upcoming work time s up may shake up the profession once again what i realized is that i am trading knowledge and that i want people to think with me said baker when i give my knowledge away i need to refresh it and replenish it and that s how i don t get chained to legacy thinking because i am ready to unlearn and pivot to a new arena of ideas among the many topics he has explored in his show baker has denounced the fact that auditors are often paid by the companies they audit he says that the accounting press is not educated enough on the topic and that agencies such as the american enterprise institute have been promoting reforms for years in the end of accounting and the path forward for investors and managers author baruch lev said that audits influenced only 5 of investors decisions which could say a lot about a need for change one of baker s lifelong goals has also been to change the billable hour system that most public accounting firms still use today the radio host argues that the current model which charges a client for the amount of time spent on a project forces customers to pay for a product they don t know baker says that it also worsens the current mental health crisis within the profession as accountants must record everything they do and are pushed towards productivity rather than quality medical practitioners often have 50 60 clients a day and it s eerie because it s so close to the cpa profession said baker it s impossible to build a relationship in a 10 minute tax interview whereas if you limit yourself to 600 patients with a subscription system it s no longer a fee for services model firms sometimes try to disguise their billing policies as a subscription by giving a fixed price and dividing it by 12 without adding value to the product others argue that this model would only benefit the wealthiest clients or would not be profitable in the long term but indiana cpa jody grunden is a great example of success according to baker he was one of the first to introduce a subscription based billing method and grew his 600 000 firm into a 11 million company for a diverse pool of customers that pays a weekly fee it was to promote this kind of thinking that baker created the verasage institute with two former partners in 2001 and their efforts paid off according to baker the number of firms using subscription style pricing rose from 5 to 35 since 1994 and while it may be a victory for accountants and their customers baker says that innovation always takes society by surprise expanding his area of influence is his way to prepare for future changes promoting critical thinking robert ross in early august of this year singapore based crypto trading platform vauld saw its 46 million worth assets frozen by india s anti money laundering agency for facilitating crime derived proceeds from predatory lending firms the company had become popular around october 2021 for its fixed deposits with a 12 68 interest rate in large part because many popular finfluencers promoted the product on social media the case prompted debates about the credibility of online personalities and many experts recommended caution when seeking financial advice on the internet more than half of people who reported losses to investment scams in 2021 said the scam started on social media and in the u s retail investors lose about 770 million annually from fraud initiated on social media platforms this is why robert ross 34 says that subscribers should google someone s name before giving them too much credit there used to be a trend on tiktok telling people to use leverage or margins and i had to make videos telling them not to because amazon was falling 40 said ross people need to be very skeptical about information that they get on social media even from professionals we get things wrong and predicting the future is very difficult the los angeles based author of a beginner s guide to high risk high reward investing has a few shows in development and has attracted more than 380 000 followers on tiktok where he is known as the tik stocks guy when he does not feature in time magazine or business insider ross aims to promote sensible investing habits with a hint of humor he was the first content creator to discuss stocks on the platform with a focus on risk management over a million investors now ask ross opinion on investing economics and personal finance every month and the creator attributes his success to his flexibility he says that staying relevant on the internet means conveying actionable and timely analysis to catch the eye of the algorithm and reach as many people as possible ross says that some famous tiktok personalities fell from grace because they didn t adapt to the changing market or real world expectations such as inflation the prospect of making money is always appealing to people but it is not something that i condone because they should focus on long term investments said ross the way you really make money in the stock market is to hold stocks for many years not to blindly follow sexy trades like wall street bets people forget that you never hear about those who lose a lot of money ross has been writing professionally since he left college but it was in november 2019 that he transformed his free articles into a subscription service before getting the idea of making videos he believes that tiktok is the best platform on which to gain a viewership from scratch because good content naturally gets pushed up but most of his revenues come from his patreon and from instagram where he is very active when it comes to the future of accounting finance and investing news ross believes that social media will come to replace the legacy media platforms such as tiktok gained the same kind of branding or content as newspapers and while social media has much fewer safeguards against misinformation dismissing their importance is not realistic ross doesn t see it as a good or bad thing but something that was inevitable with the rise of new technologies we are the new cnbc or wall street journal but instead of being owned by one corporation we are individuals building our own brand said ross people are subscribing because they want actionable advice market lessons and fast interactions the world is changing and finance professionals must either follow or become obsolete growing a community tom hood the term influencer was first added to the dictionary under its current definition in 2019 many years after personalities such as pewdiepie or lele pons gained significant notoriety online instagram was created in 2010 and youtube in 2005 and it was during the year of twitter s creation in 2006 that tom hood 52 understood where the future would be at the beginning of his career with the maryland association of cpas hood realized that he could encourage young people to become accountants via social media and started blogging about what he observed at the association after meeting someone from chartered accountants ireland and connecting him to a u s college class by webcam a unique move for the time hood observed that virtual connections could significantly increase his reach all those key thought leaders that i met helped me create my own information supply chain and if i was on a deserted island with nothing but my iphone i could keep up with all the latest trends just by looking at my twitter and linkedin feeds said the father of three it is a great way for young people who are stressed about money to connect with leaders and get the information they need hood distributes his online activities in five categories connecting collaborating curating innovating and influencing which are all turned toward having a conversation hood uses polls to understand what resonates with the 730 000 people who follow him on linkedin and whether good or bad their reactions help spread his work across the profession and beyond he sees influencing as earning trust and keeping it and not overcommercializing what people most care about thanks to his online presence hood has seen well known trends emerge from the profession before the media did he observed companies struggling with talent and skill shortages while the cfo world was crumbling under the recession from his exclusive window into people s lives hood saw that the accounting profession would never come back to what it was before the pandemic firms had to learn how to adapt to a hybrid world and how to meet the new demands of employees who now want purpose and a work life balance there is a quote that i love from edward too tall john you will be the same person in five years as you are today except for the people you meet and the books you read said hood if you apply this concept to social media it makes me learn from 700 000 people everyday getting recognition from the masses is the accomplishment that i am the most proud of because they care about what i have to say not about my position early on hood understood that reaching out to other public figures would help spread his message in 2011 he tagged authors tom peters and emmanuel gobillot on twitter to discuss the books referenced at the aicpa leadership academy and that one tweet got viewed by 40 600 people the creator was quickly noticed by a young linkedin which was building its top 100 influencers list and months later hood became one of the leading accounting influencers of the platform now the executive vice president of business engagement and growth for aicpa cima hood has been named the second most influential person in the profession by accounting today behind aicpa chief barry melancon accounting is the language of business and it remains a critical profession for our world s future said hood as the economy emerges and as new technologies start to shape it cpas will have to learn faster than their competition faster than automation and faster than the rate of change
a combination of supply chain issues and necessary repairs to girders on the structure will keep the higgins avenue beartrack bridge project from being completed until perhaps well into november we spoke to engineering project manager on the higgins avenue bridge with the montana department of transportation matt straub on friday for an update on the bridge reconstruction project the week of september fifth we ll start working on our expansion joint closure pours which are on the ends began straub the week after that so the week of the 12th we ll be working on pouring curbs for the pedestrian vehicle rails so we re looking like we re going to be tied up with our phase two until the end of september straub said some of the work still to be done includes repairs from problems that occurred during phase one of the project get our free mobile app get our free mobile app starting at the beginning of october we re going to have to go in and do some phase one repairs he said we have some damaged girders that we need to go in and fix on the phase one side those repairs are expected to take four to six weeks we re hoping to get it done as soon as possible depending on weather and material availability but the material availability has been the primary driver of our delays we incurred some damage when we were deconstructing the bridge and have been fighting to get the materials to complete those repairs another sticking point in finishing the bridge project is the availability of the type of steel necessary for the job all our steel in the project is of domestic origin so one of the challenges is that we have to find the right steel from a domestic producer he said the steel on that bridge is considered fracture critical that means it has some special testing requirements that go above and beyond just the normal stock steel that you can get off the shelf and all those challenges have contributed to the delays straub said despite the delays and supply chain problems the budget for the project is still close to the original 16 to 17 million estimate upon completion the higgins avenue bridge will eventually be renamed the beartrack bridge according to missoula county commissioners dave strohmaier click here for details looking back photos of missoula and how it s changed check out these photos of how missoula has changed over the past decade

also active in the community said fields 36 who has worked for a number of jewish organizations and now is the director of community engagement and public affairs for lifemoves which provides interim housing and services to unhoused individuals and families i can really bring the right perspective and knowledge and experience to council in this time of really significant transition fields was

fields who had already been thinking about seeking public office in order to address such issues as an elected leader as her city works on updating its general plan and meeting its new housing requirements as mandated by the state fields wants to help impact the outcomes of those efforts as a councilmember she worries about seeing the city s local control be restricted if it doesn t allow for new housing to be built we need to meet those obligations and be making investments in the infrastructure and amenities that make san mateo a nice place to live said fields adding that the city

city s mayor this november while lesbian san carlos city councilmember laura parmer lohan is vying for a san mateo county supervisor seat peninsula candidates the growing contingent of out elected leaders on the peninsula comes as its lgbtq community has worked to become more visible throughout the region and more organized in seeking support at both the local and county level playing a large role in that work has been the san mateo county lgbtq commission which sturken currently co chairs in a recent interview with the b a r sturken noted that he is the first person to run for elected office while serving on the lgbtq advisory body his former boyfriend jason galisatus had left the commission by the time he unsuccessfully ran in 2018 for a redwood city council seat redwood city

which includes the downtown area a renter sturken has served on his city s transportation advisory committee since last year and was appointed to his city s planning body in july i have the experience and the deep connection to the community said sturken who grew up in nearby belmont as for why he feels qualified to be a councilmember a co founder of lgbtq political club the san mateo county stonewall democrats in 2020 he has attracted significant support for his council candidacy assemblymembers kevin mullin d south san francisco and marc berman d palo alto and san mateo supervisors don horsley and warren slocum have endorsed him as has departing redwood city councilmember giselle hale currently serving as mayor redwood city s downtown is the pride of the peninsula i trust no one more to keep it a safe and vibrant place than chris stated hale who recently ended her bid for state assembly and announced she wouldn t seek reelection to the council due to the personal attacks and harassment she had received this year as a legislative candidate he will listen to our neighbors to ensure that redwood city small businesses and residents thrive mullin and berman have also endorsed fields candidacy for the district 3 seat on her city council as has departing councilmember joe goethals running against two male opponents fields would be the first out lgbtq councilmember in san mateo if she wins the race san mateo city council candidate sarah fields photo courtesy the campaign i felt i needed to step up and run as i have experience working in state and local government i am also active in the community said fields 36 who has worked for a number of jewish organizations and now is the director of community engagement and public affairs for lifemoves which provides interim housing and services to unhoused individuals and families i can really bring the right perspective and knowledge and experience to council in this time of really significant transition fields was referring to the fact that her city is set to see four new council members this year along with new congressional and state assembly members mullin is favored to succeed outgoing congressmember jackie speier d san francisco san mateo and diane papan san mateo s current vice mayor is set to replace him in the state legislature now that hale dropped out of the race san mateo is moving to district based council races this year with none of the current councilmembers running for the three seats on the november 8 ballot the winners of those races will help to appoint someone to papan s seat once she resigns later this year it is a really dynamic year for elective office noted fields the northern vice chair of the san mateo county democratic party the last two years originally from san diego fields attended college and graduate school in new york where she also worked in various capacities and also spent time living in israel in 2014 she returned to southern california and joined the staff of former state senator marty block d san diego her boss at the time was chris ward a gay man who is now a state assemblymember from san diego when block left office in 2016 fields relocated to san mateo and became involved with the peninsula young democrats which she led as president last year fields was appointed to san mateo s parks and rec commission she had worked for the public affairs firm singer associates inc in 2020 trying to pass a ballot measure that would increase san mateo s height and density limits for new developments it lost by 42 votes it was very upsetting recalled fields who had already been thinking about seeking public office in order to address such issues as an elected leader as her city works on updating its general plan and meeting its new housing requirements as mandated by the state fields wants to help impact the outcomes of those efforts as a councilmember she worries about seeing the city s local control be restricted if it doesn t allow for new housing to be built we need to meet those obligations and be making investments in the infrastructure and amenities that make san mateo a nice place to live said fields adding that the city also needs to accommodate the numbers we need to accommodate while minimizing the impacts for residents both new ones and the people who already live here sunnyvale city council candidate richard mehlinger photo courtesy the campaign south bay races mehlinger 35 is one of two candidates seeking the district 5 seat on the sunnyvale city council it includes the cannery park neighborhood where he

sunnyvale bicycle and pedestrian advisory commission he also became a board member of the democratic club of sunnyvale and volunteered on several local campaigns serving as the assistant campaign manager for cisneros council bid she is among a slew of elected leaders who have endorsed mehlinger as have eqca the victory fund and the silicon valley stonewall democrats i took stock of things and decided i wanted to get involved i wanted to fight to help make this country a better place recalled mehlinger who saw city engagement as the most impactful way to make a difference i realized pretty quickly there is little you can do as one person at the federal and state level but at the local level all you have to do is show up and show up consistently to have an impact

this five bedroom four bathroom house on 457 fuller placer road in breckenridge is listed for 1 995 000 leah canfield real estate agent for coldwell banker properties said there is only one single family home available in summit county under 1 million though this summer has brought a more buyer focused market a majority of home prices are still well outside of primary home buyer budgets colorado real estate co courtesy photo real estate transaction percentages have declined from 2021 to 2022 shifting power to buyers for the first time since 2019 however that doesn t mean it s a better market for the local workforce two real estate brokers in summit county gave context explaining that a combination of increased interest rates short term rental regulations and a chokehold on development could be contributing to this decrease in total purchase volume purchase volume is the total dollar amount of real estate transactions for a calendar year from 2020 to 2021 the purchase volume of real estate transactions in summit county skyrocketed april may and june brought increases of about 242 304 and 176 respectively brian flickinger with colorado real estate co attributed the high percentages to a high demand for summit county properties and a prolonged period of low interest rates one theory he had about the high demand was a population boom on the front range according to the u s census bureau denver s population as of april 1 2010 was 600 158 as of april 1 2020 the population grew to 715 522 historically flickinger said summit county s real estate market has been 40 front range buyers with that population increasing demand shot up another reason percentages were so high was historically low interest rates that increases everybody s purchasing power flickinger said it doubled if not tripled some people s purchasing power because the interest rates were so low and that was unsustainable now interest rates have risen while they were at 3 a few years ago rates are now 5 for primary homes and 6 for secondary homes comparing the spring and summer months of 2021 when percentages boomed with the same months in 2022 the purchase volume of real estate transactions in summit county has either barely increased or decreased significantly april increased by only 2 may decreased by 12 and june decreased by a significant 37 leah canfield a real estate agent with coldwell banker mountain properties said a consequence of high interest rates is fewer second home purchases because many second home owners in summit county are unable to afford their homes without short term renting them she added in may the summit board of county commissioners voted to begin begin a short term rental license moratorium lasting nine months in addition the town of breckenridge voted in late august to approve a set of short term rental regulations that created specific short term rental zones and established limits on licenses canfield reported seeing plenty of interested buyers turn away from summit county once the possibility of a short term rental license looked to be out of the question so what are the effects of these changes in the market canfield said this summer active sales have increased from last summer while pending sales have been almost cut in half so what that means is that people are listing their properties and they re sitting on the market canfield said both she and fiickinger said this trend may continue creating a market that is more favorable to buyers really what it s done has created a more healthy real estate environment where buyers and sellers are now kind of on parity flickinger said instead of rushing through and competing with cash buyers flickinger said primary buyers have more time to adjust contracts to their liking even so the problem of price still stands which will lead to more empty homes according to canfield unfortunately that doesn t necessarily translate to more opportunities for locals canfield said even though there are more houses sitting on the market there is only one single family home that is listed under 1 million therefore while interest rates have increased and short term rental regulations have slowed the purchase of homes the housing stock that is available is not providing more options for the local workforce who may need something more affordable because when a house on average is 2 million and the homeowner has to rent it for you know 10 15 20 thousand dollars a month in order to cover their expenses and their mortgage then it s not affordable to a local anyways canfield said so while summit county s real estate market has become more favorable for buyers canfield said if a buyer is on a budget the search for a home within the county will at the very least be difficult

a combination of supply chain issues and necessary repairs to girders on the structure will keep the higgins avenue beartrack bridge project from being completed until perhaps well into november we spoke to engineering project manager on the higgins avenue bridge with the montana department of transportation matt straub on friday for an update on the bridge reconstruction project the week of september fifth we ll start working on our expansion joint closure pours which are on the ends began straub the week after that so the week of the 12th we ll be working on pouring curbs for the pedestrian vehicle rails so we re looking like we re going to be tied up with our phase two until the end of september straub said some of the work still to be done includes repairs from problems that occurred during phase one of the project get our free mobile app starting at the beginning of october we re going to have to go in and do some phase one repairs he said we have some damaged girders that we need to go in and fix on the phase one side those repairs are expected to take four to six weeks we re hoping to get it done as soon as possible depending on weather and material availability but the material availability has been the primary driver of our delays we incurred some damage when we were deconstructing the bridge and have been fighting to get the materials to complete those repairs another sticking point in finishing the bridge project is the availability of the type of steel necessary for the job all our steel in the project is of domestic origin so one of the challenges is that we have to find the right steel from a domestic producer he said the steel on that bridge is considered fracture critical that means it has some special testing requirements that go above and beyond just the normal stock steel that you can get off the shelf and all those challenges have contributed to the delays straub said despite the delays and supply chain problems the budget for the project is still close to the original 16 to 17 million estimate upon completion the higgins avenue bridge will eventually be renamed the beartrack bridge according to missoula county commissioners dave strohmaier click here for details looking back photos of missoula and how it s changed check out these photos of how missoula has changed over the past decade
while the federal reserve and other central banks obsess over avoiding a 1970s style wage price spiral u s gdp data last week showed that the risk of inflation remaining elevated is more nuanced call it a profit price spiral by many measures the u s labor market is as strong as it has been for decades as labor is the biggest single input into firms total costs policymakers are right to fret that excessive wage demands may stoke or even accelerate inflation but looked at through the prism of profits corporate america is also in rude health especially big business in the second quarter this year u s companies raked in profits that depending on the cut were the highest on record or close to levels not seen in over half a century this is an inflationary threat too but we hear far less from policymakers about it than the risk of wages fueling a price spiral that would only be crushed by interest rate increases like those administered by former fed chair paul volcker in the early 1980s the battle between labor and capital which saw capital take an ever growing share of national income over the past 30 years is not a new issue certainly not politically but with inflation at a four decade high it is emerging as a policymaking challenge one the fed has to take on board says chris zaccarelli chief investment officer at independent advisor alliance i m sure higher corporate profits are indirectly encouraging the fed to increase interest rates to the extent that prices are rising everywhere and corporate profits are staying high those are a direct corollary to higher inflation he said as a share of gdp u s corporate profits in the second quarter rose to 12 25 around their highest levels since 1950 profit margins for non financial firms rose to 15 5 in the same period closing in on last year s peak going all the way back to the 1960s less surprisingly perhaps nominal profits in q2 were the highest ever still the burst through the 2 trillion barrier is noteworthy this comes at the same time u s labor market conditions are the tightest in decades also the unemployment rate was last lower than today s 3 5 over half a century ago and there are two job openings for every unemployed person while worker strikes and labor disputes are less likely in the united states than in europe fed officials would not welcome wage growth matching inflation far less exceeding it they would argue this would have one of two consequences both of which go against their dual mandate of price stability higher wages are passed onto consumers leading to even higher inflation or firms simply cut back on staff unfair burden fiscal policy is more suited to curbing u s corporate pricing power as robert reich professor at the university of california berkeley and a former labor secretary notes the biden administration passed a 1 tax on stock buybacks in the recently enacted inflation reduction act and a minimum corporate tax this doesn t go far enough he argues but recognizes that policies such as a windfall profits tax price controls higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy and bolder antitrust enforcement face stiff opposition in washington absent a powerful fiscal push the onus falls on the fed to use the blunt instrument of job sapping and recession seeding higher interest rates this is the only tool in the fed s tool kit the problem is that this puts most of the burden of fighting inflation on average working people and the poor reich told reuters there s little doubt that fed communications focus on the risks posed by wage pressures more than corporate pricing minutes of the fed s july 26 27 policy meeting reveal seven mentions of wage or wages 17 of labor market eight of job or jobs and not one of profit transcripts of fed chief jerome powell s press conference on july 27 show nine references to wage or wages 38 mentions of labor market 15 mentions of job or jobs but not a single mention of profit corporate company or companies if the political establishment in washington is unwilling and the fed is unable to cool the corporate profit boom s potential price pressures maybe the economy will do it for them as tighter financial conditions slow activity and demand profit growth should cool and companies margins should decline earnings growth is slowing down and heading towards zero this implies pressure on the margin which the consensus now forecasts to decline by 5 in 2022 equity analysts at societe generale otc scgly wrote on thursday source reuters by jamie mcgeever editing by andrea ricci

begone typos and grammar mistakes begone fat fingered auto corrected slip ups and textual despair the edit button is coming to twitter on thursday after countless pleas from many of its more than 237 million users some people will start being able to click a button on the social media service to edit a tweet after they have posted it it has only been about 15 years nine months and 22 days since they started asking for that ability since twitter was unveiled in 2006 the basics of using it have been simple and constant you wrote a tweet you posted it and then you dealt with the consequences there were no take backs on the timeline that makes the edit button perhaps the biggest shift at the social media service since 2017 when twitter increased the character limit for messages to 280 characters from 140 twitter s commitment to first drafts made it a destination for online brawls and hot takes but people have often regretted their choice of words or noticed a misspelling just after posting a tweet as twitter grew from a niche service to a global platform more users began demanding a way to edit their posts they complained they begged they raged some made typos in their tweets asking for an edit button to correct their typos even elon musk the billionaire who has been locked in a battle over whether to stick with a 44 billion deal to buy twitter has seemed to favour an edit button twitter didn t budge the company argued that there was something noble in leaving mistakes on display a nefarious user could change a tweet after it had already been shared widely swapping a benign message for a misleading one someone who had retweeted a statement might miss the update inadvertently broadcasting a tweet they no longer agreed with but more recently twitter began reconsidering an edit button as it tried to grow its service by attracting people who might be more careful with their words in 2020 twitter rolled out fleets an ephemeral feature that deleted users posts after 24 hours that didn t catch on and was axed this week the company introduced circles a feature that lets people post messages to a smaller subset of 150 followers maybe letting people correct their mistakes might reduce their stage fright too we re hoping that with the availability of edit tweet tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful twitter said in a statement you should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you the edit button will be granted to twitter employees first for internal testing and then to users of its subscription service twitter blue the company eventually though it did not specify when plans to give everyone the option to alter their tweets
famed investor jeremy grantham said the super bubble he previously warned about has yet to pop even after this year s turbulence in the us stock market the co founder of boston asset manager gmo known for calling market bubbles said in a note wednesday that the surge in us equities from mid june to mid august fits the pattern of bear market rallies common after an initial sharp decline and before the economy truly begins to deteriorate grantham 83 sees more trouble ahead because of a dangerous mix of overvalued stocks bonds and housing combined with a commodity shock and hawkishness from the federal reserve jeremy grantham co founder of us fund manager gmo believes wall street is in a super bubble only the fourth of the past century credit domino postiglione grantham predicted around the start of the year that benchmark stocks would plunge almost 50 per cent in a historic collapse the s p 500 at one point in june dropped almost 25 per cent from its january peak before roaring back in the following two months yet us equities are tumbling yet again on track to fall for the fourth straight session with prominent strategists like morgan stanley s mike wilson among those cautioning investors that the market hasn t hit bottom you had a typical bear market rally the other day and people were saying oh it s a new bull market grantham said in an interview that is nonsense
the chief executive of autonomous vehicle developer aurora innovation presented a swath of cost cutting and cash generating options to its board ranging from a hiring freeze and spinning out assets to a small capital raise going private and even selling itself to high profile tech companies apple and microsoft the ideas all aimed at shoring up its cash position and extending its runway in tough market conditions were laid out in an internal memo first reported by bloomberg and also viewed by techcrunch the internal memo which was intended for the board ahead of its august 3 meeting was mistakenly sent to all aurora employees which today numbers around 1 600 people following the bloomberg report aurora shares jumped as much as 27 shares closed up 15 17 to 2 43 aurora has a cash runway that will allow it to continue operations through mid 2024 according to its second quarter letter to shareholders and noted in the memo however aurora is still a pre revenue company and the memo written by co founder and ceo chris urmson acknowledged a two fold problem a challenging financial market that makes it difficult to raise additional capital and shifting timelines by its oem partners that delays revenue aurora which has prioritized commercializing self driving trucks has pilot partnerships with fedex paccar schneider werner and xpress aurora held a board meeting after the email was shared an aurora spokesperson declined to comment on what was discussed during the meeting the company did provide an emailed statement stating given the current macro conditions every company should be going through the exercise of evaluating its options and long term strategy we think that thinking through things like this is a positive sign and a mark of good governance urmson noted that market conditions make it unlikely that the company could raise 1 billion instead he laid out a long list of options each one noting pros and cons as well as his biggest concern of maintaining employee morale and said there was value in finding a path to raise 300 million in the next year to add around six months to our runway extending the runway urmson s internal memo reads more like a financial and strategic exercise than a plan of action the lengthy memo which was sent ahead of its august 3 board meeting lays out virtually every option the company could take to extend its cash position the memo s more eye catching ideas include selling itself to big tech companies like apple or microsoft or a tier 1 supplier however the memo provides zero hint that discussions with any company have even begun story continues there are a number of other options which fall under cash savings and cash generating measures laid out in the memo the cash savings methods run the gamut including a hiring freeze and even job cuts although urmson cautioned against the latter i believe that a rif reduction in force will be damaging to morale urmson wrote noting that teams are feeling understaffed though the board and i might believe that the team will be more efficient if smaller we expect that the negative morale impact and follow on increase in attrition of valuable talent would be challenging unless the layoffs are substantial we should think of this primarily as an improving efficiency tactic rather than a substantial increase in runway once we consider the severance costs on the workforce front urmson recommended two options aggressive performance management of poor performers and more intensive de duplication and prioritization cutting through the jargon this could mean laying off poor performers and eliminating duplicated positions or simply not filling those positions once vacated those measures urmson wrote may not have the operational simplicity of a rif or hiring freeze but would result in meaningful efficiency improvements and cost savings he estimated a savings of 7 5 million other cash cutting measures such as eliminating the ceo equity grant reducing software licenses by 20 suspending annual bonuses and stopping food service were also included in the memo urmson also threw out a variety of cash generating options that ranged from the sale of its test track and building to bigger moves such as spinning out or selling its lidar or simulation assets acquiring other av companies that are trading at or near the cash on their balance sheet in the neighborhood of 150 million to 300 million taking aurora private or selling itself to a bigger tech company or tier 1 supplier acquiring another av company would eliminate another competitor reduce the dilution of funding in the marketplace and allow aurora to aggressively reduce redundancies according to the memo aurora doesn t name any potential companies on that acquisition list however there are a few such as embark which has a market cap of 204 million that might qualify aurora hired allen co to analyze the acquisition path according to the memo of all the options urmson seemed most interested in exploring whether there was a viable path to spinning out tech pursuing an acquisition and investigating a small capital raise urmson said in the memo he was disinclined to sell the company at this time unless there was a strong offer from a very compelling strategic purchaser buzzy startup to spac aurora went from buzzy startup to publicly traded company via spac in a span of four years the company was founded in 2017 by sterling anderson drew bagnell and urmson all whom have a history of working on automated vehicle technology the three co founders who hailed from google s self driving project uber atg and tesla helped attract high profile investors and a stack of capital aurora s co founders doubled down in december 2020 when they reached an agreement with uber to buy the ride hailing firm s self driving unit the complex deal that at the time valued the combined company at 10 billion helped aurora double the size of its workforce under the terms of that acquisition aurora did not pay cash for uber atg instead uber handed over its equity in atg and invested 400 million into aurora uber received a 26 stake in the combined company according to a filing with the u s securities and exchange commission aurora made at least one other acquisition following the uber deal in february 2021 aurora bought ours technology the second lidar startup it had acquired in less than two years aurora acquired blackmore a montana based lidar startup in may 2019 against that backdrop dozens of startups across industries that were keen to unlock more capital turned to mergers with special purpose acquisition companies these spac mergers offered a quicker yet often more costly path to the public marketplace aurora jumped on the spac train announcing in july 2021 that it would go public via a merger with reinvent technology partners y a special purpose acquisition company launched by linkedin co founder and investor reid hoffman zynga founder mark pincus and managing partner michael thompson a year later the promises of what a high flying public marketplace could offer has come back down to earth forcing frontier tech companies like aurora to find ways to extend their capital runways long enough to reach commercialization aurora shares jumped as much as 27 after the bloomberg report was published
in all likelihood it just handed the white house to the republicans in 2024 when donald trump ran for president he provided a list of things he would do among those things secure the borders and ensure immigrants enter our country through the steps written in our laws get us out of the paris climate accords as china and india are 100 percent exempt from taking any steps to lower carbon emissions repeal nafta force european nations to pay their legal share of nato funding revamp our international trade agreements and ensure we are getting the best deal possible stand up to china for it s currency manipulation theft of intellectual property and trade imbalance bring manufacturing back to america create jobs cut taxes put america first when dealing with other countries he chose as his slogan make america great again which his supporters viewed as a summation of the concept bring america back as a global leader stop the obama policy of apologizing for our actions and give us reasons to be proud of our nation again a nation where people respectfully stand up when the flag goes by his detractors claimed the maga slogan was code for take us back to the days when blacks women gays lesbians and other minorities were oppressed although he delivered on all of his campaign promises he proved to be too acerbic for the american population president joe biden wisely stayed in his basement during the campaign and allowed president trump to hang himself via mean tweets and his abrasive personality support fitsnews subscribe during his inauguration speech president biden stated today on this january day my whole soul is in this bringing america together uniting our people and uniting our nation we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue rural versus urban conservative versus liberal with that trump was gone banned from twitter he no longer had a plausible way to communicate with the 75 000 000 americans who voted for him except for the riot on january 6th the maga crowd has remained peaceful and had only fox news talk radio and conservative websites to broadcast their gripes and frustrations president biden went on to reverse all of president trump s executive orders and with lightning speed proved himself to be the most inept president in modern history record inflation unemployment a crashing stock market a return to energy dependence sky high gas prices a war in ukraine an emboldened china authoritarian covid policies an exploding border crisis a humiliating retreat from afghanistan an explosion in crime parents labeled as domestic terrorists then on september 1 2022 president biden showed us his commitment to unifying america the 80 000 000 people who voted for him and the 75 000 000 who voted for trump standing in front of blood red spotlights and symbolically flanked by two u s marines he offered these unifying thoughts donald trump and the maga republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic maga republicans do not respect the constitution they do not believe in the rule of law maga republicans promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights to the pursuit of justice to the rule of law to the very soul of this country on top of that there are public figures today yesterday and the day before predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets no matter what the white supremacists and extremists say i made a bet on you the american people and that bet is paying off paying off here was the response from america s media yahoo news joe biden s primetime speech got everything right msnbc the soaring rhetoric was needed for the soul of the country for people to hear the language of freedom and democracy be used to advance civil rights not restrict them nbc news america has faced down its fascist demons before and we can do it again the atlantic biden s sharp speech has only one justification so much of it is true cnn it was a very very patriotic speech chuck todd nbc meet the press this was easily the most important speech he s given and i think it was his best click to view via getty images regardless of one s hatred for trump conservatives and traditional values the question should be asked did this speech really help unify america of course not perhaps the nuttiest thing of all is the claim maga republicans promote authoritarian leaders maga republicans to a person are for smaller government government that gets the hell out of the way and allows each american to pursue their happiness in their own way whether they know it or not most maga republicans are conservative libertarians in other words the exact opposite of what an authoritarian leader allows but president biden gave that speech because his handlers and strategists aren t stupid they ve done the polls and research and have discovered the mid term bloodbath is looking worse than they thought this speech was an act of desperation delivered to excite the left and inspire them to vote and save america from the orange man desperate times call for desperate measures the attacks on the orange man are especially ponderous at this time because whether he s tried or not he s rarely appeared in the news i should know the orange man provides me with endless entertainment and i keep an eye out for his stunts especially the ones that result in the shrieks and rage of the media the only extensive coverage he s really received is regarding the democrats sixth year of using the weaponized fbi and doj to try and find something anything they can use to put him in jail the fact that the orange man isn t on the ballot in the mid terms doesn t matter the message is clear your republican neighbors are the enemy they aren t just political opponents they are literally potential killers who want to be ruled by a fascist strongman and aim to topple the nation by any means necessary if you don t get out and vote in the mid terms they will drag you out of your home and burn you at a stake politically it wasn t unprecedented lindsey graham used the same ploy successfully he went from dough boy rino to tough guy in the kavanaugh hearings and south carolina republicans fell for it hook line and sinker decades of his milquetoast representation was gone in a flash and he became a hard nosed leader president biden s handlers have failed to understand something critical most republicans hope florida governor ron desantis will be the nominee with president trump rallying his followers to support him odds are that won t happen trump will announce and desantis will wait four years to run he s got too bright of a future to lock horns with president trump so if trump runs does anyone really think republicans will vote against him cross over and vote for whoever the dnc can convince to run after this disastrous administration on the ideal that being represented by an unintelligible senile old man is better than mean tweets and egotistical behavior since the presidency of thomas jefferson when the economy is bad americans have asked themselves am i better off than i was four years ago and 100 percent of the time they vote that issue every single time want recent proof after the gulf war george h w bush had the highest approval ratings of any president in modern history he was a wwii war hero had the manners of gentleman and was beloved especially by americans over 50 bill clinton beat him by running on the mantra it s the economy stupid there s not a chance anyone even slightly right of center will vote liberal the democrats are desperate and their media is hyping up the fact that mid term races are tightening and the economy is strong and isn t it amusing that in the two weeks leading up to his poisonous speech president biden s approval ratings went up ten points out of thin air despite the fact nothing has changed whoever runs as the gop nominee will take president biden s speech and reshape the message to the democrats think you are violent extremists who do not respect the constitution or the rule of law no one will remember maga republican they ll remember republican laughably the day after the speech president biden said to fox news peter doocy i don t consider any trump supporters a threat to the country i do think anyone who calls for the use of violence refuses to acknowledge an election changing the way you count votes that is a threat to democracy sounds like his people did some overnight polling about the speech too late mr president this speech will pay dividends beyond even hillary s deplorable remark in all likelihood it just handed the white house to the republicans in 2024 about the author via

better listen to god did on the latest dj khaled album jigga is as cool as they come richard branson a british billionaire who founded the virgin group branson capitalising on his business acumen and skills launched the elders an independent group of top global leaders tackling key world problems when selling the record label of virgin in 1992 for over 1 billion he is reported to have cried

to do it first oprah winfrey staying true to her story and origin oprah winfrey not only used her show the oprah winfrey show to create the needed awareness about important issues but has also donated

contemporary culture talk about a spirit manages his space and energy and also gets to make the universe move in the direction of his thoughts in a world where billionaires crave the attention of the

the august jobs report was in the goldilocks zone it was neither too hot or too cold last month the u s economy added 315 000 new jobs topping the market estimate of 300 000 the unemployment rate rose to 3 7 up from 3 5 in july in addition the bureau of labor statistics bls revised its june and july numbers by a combined 107 000 jobs this sent financial markets rallying on the news but then the gains were evaporated on monetary policy and energy woes in europe in addition the spread between the two and ten year yields a key recession indicator for investors remained at around 20 basis points that said it was not all sunshine and lollipops meanwhile average hourly earnings edged up 0 3 in august down from 0 5 in july workers are earning an average of 32 36 on an annualized basis average hourly earnings held steady at 5 2 average weekly hours dipped to 34 5 last month down from 34 6 in the previous month this is a notable metric because it usually ticks lower before a recession as employers do not want to shed staffing levels just yet but also want to rein in operating expenses the labor force participation rate climbed to 62 4 up from 62 1 are more americans fearful of current economic conditions but there was an important data point that should capture some attention total multiple jobholders bls data showed that the number of americans working two or more jobs totaled 7 572 million up from 6 783 million at the same time a year ago seasonally adjusted the number exceeded 7 7 million this represented nearly 5 of total employed with the federal reserve essentially abandoning its crusade to fight inflation through a higher fed funds rate which would slow the economy and kill demand in theory many americans would be fortunate to possess one job bank of america chief economist michael gapen wrote in a research note following the report in our view the august employment report contains enough good news for the fed that will lead them to slow the pace of rate hikes beginning in september we continue to expect the fed to raise its policy rate by 50bp in september looking further ahead we maintain our view that the fed will hike by another 50bp in november and 25bp in december bringing the target range for the federal funds rate by year end to 3 5 3 75 risks to our outlook for federal reserve policy are skewed in the direction of more rate hikes on account of underlying momentum in the us economy that said based on the full set of data in hand since the fed last met in july we think risks are in the direction of more cumulative hikes over time as opposed to another large 75bp hike in september for now it is a sad state of affairs when more than 7 5 million people need to hold two or more jobs to keep the lights on and put food on the table a cost of living crisis of course this figure is not exactly surprising the u s annual inflation rate stands at 8 5 although the figure is a lot higher if real estate prices for example were factored into the consumer price index cpi the country is suffering through a cost of living crisis many americans are living paycheck to paycheck households are shifting their spending behaviors to endure skyrocketing prices consumers are saving less and borrowing more to keep their heads above water the cherry on top is that interest rates are increasing making borrowing a lot more expensive at the same time the u s economy is living through abnormal times some say it is bizarro world the united states is entrenched in a technical recession while there are more than 11 million job openings manufacturing and non manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi readings are falling but business and consumer sentiment is inching higher like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here

ari shapiro host working people got some good news heading into the labor day weekend workers are still in high demand we learned today that u s employers added 315 000 jobs last month and that means employment is now back to pre pandemic levels with more than 3 5 million jobs added so far this year wages are also climbing though not fast enough to keep up with inflation still president biden says the economy is moving in the right direction soundbite of archived recording president joe biden bottom line is jobs are up wages are up people are back to work and we re seeing some signs that inflation may be i m not going to overpromise here may be beginning to ease shapiro npr s scott horsley has been studying what else today s jobs report reveals hey scott scott horsley byline hi ari shapiro sounds like employers are still hiring at a rapid pace and yet the unemployment rate went up last month can you explain what s going on there horsley unemployment did inch up a bit but only because a huge number of people entered or reentered the workforce almost 800 000 people came off the sidelines in august and started looking for work many of them found jobs right away some did not and you only get counted as unemployed if you re looking for work so the unemployment rate rose but it s still just 3 7 which is very low by historical standards and there s still a ton of job openings out there so a lot of those new job seekers should be able to find work pretty quickly shapiro any idea why almost 800 000 people would suddenly start looking for jobs last month horsley good question or to put it another way what took them so long you know up until last month jobs had been coming back more quickly than workers had in fact earlier this summer we actually saw a drop in the number of people looking for work so that august turnaround is encouraging part of it could be the new school year which might be freeing up parents to go back to work part of it could be people feeling less worried about covid those would be the positive explanations on the negative side inflation could be a factor betsey stevenson who s an economist at the university of michigan says some people might feel like they have to go back to work just because the cost of living keeps going up betsey stevenson people are being sort of pushed by the rising prices to think my savings are getting hit a little bit too hard and we ve been seeing people in the last few months dip into their savings horsley whatever the explanation the share of people who are working or looking for work increased significantly last month for women in their prime working years that share is basically back to where it was before the pandemic which is really encouraging you might remember that a lot of working women dropped out of the labor force early in the pandemic the share of working age men however still has a way to go to get back to pre pandemic levels shapiro let s talk about inflation the president said there are signs that inflation might be easing we know gas prices are down what else is going on there horsley today s report may offer some good news on that score inflation watchdogs at the federal reserve have been worried that the job market is overly tight and that if there aren t enough workers to go around both wages and prices could then spiral out of control if that s what you re worried about stevenson says this big influx of workers should come as some relief stevenson the fed s concern is that if people aren t coming into the labor force willing to take those jobs that demand for workers is just going to create inflationary pressure but if instead that demand for workers is drawing people back into the labor force we ll be able to meet employers demands for hiring without it creating additional inflationary pressure horsley so we still have a tight job market but not as tight as it was and that could take a little wind out of the inflationary sails the stock market seemed to read it that way this morning stocks rallied when the report first came out but then investors fell back in a funk and stocks ended down about 1 shapiro npr s scott horsley thanks a lot horsley you re welcome transcript provided by npr copyright npr

securities law firm with offices in new york pennsylvania california and georgia stitch fix sells a range of apparel shoes and accessories through its website and mobile application traditionally stitch fix sold products as a fix through which the customer would receive a monthly box of items chosen by a personal stylist the customer would not know specifically which items they were receiving but would have the option to return whichever items it did not want the customer paid a 20 styling fee per fix and that fee would be applied to any of the items the customer chose to buy prior to the class period in 2019 stitch fix announced a new direct buy retail component eventually named freestyle the freestyle program allowed customers to shop the site for specific products giving the customer more control over what items they received but also removing the curation element that differentiated stitch fix from other e retailers the freestyle program was first made available to a subset of existing stitch fix customers in 2020 and incrementally rolled out to all existing customers in early 2021 in september 2021 the freestyle program was formally launched to new customers the complaint alleges that throughout the class period stitch fix made numerous false and misleading statements to investors concerning the synergy between the company s fix and freestyle programs and repeatedly denied claims that the freestyle program could cannibalize the company s legacy fix business specifically stitch fix repeatedly assured investors that the company s freestyle business was an additive experience and complimentary to the fix business that the combination of those two things will allow us to address many more types of clients and that we see solid growth in both sides of the business in truth throughout the class period stitch fix concealed the fact that these programs were not complementary or additive stitch fix knew that the freestyle program would be much preferred to the company s original fix model and that the freestyle program would inevitably cannibalize the company s legacy fix business as a result of these misrepresentations and omissions stitch fix s class a common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the class period the truth began to emerge on december 7 2021 when stitch fix announced a loss for its first quarter of 2022 and cut its full year revenue projections and admitted for the first time that as a result of the expansion into freestyle the company may experience short term impacts of cannibalization as a result of these disclosures stitch fix s share price declined by 5 97 per share or 24 from a closing price of 24 97 per share on december 7 2021 to a closing price of 19 00 per share on december 8 2021 however stitch fix continued to assure investors that this was a short term problem then on march 8 2022 when stitch fix reported earnings for its second quarter of 2022 the company offered a weak outlook for its third quarter of 2022 and cut its guidance for the full year stitch fix attributed the guidance cut to friction between the freestyle and fix businesses as a result of this disclosure the price of stitch fix stock declined by 0 67 per share or 6 from 11 01 per share to 10 34 per share the court appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the

of state building the priority of the strategy of the president of uzbekistan shavkat miromonovich mirziyoyev is the further development of democratic principles and their implementation in state institutions and the development of civil society jakarta globe in recent years uzbekistan has also been conducting active foreign policy what are its main elements ambassador first of all i would like to note that the foreign policy priorities initiated by the president of uzbekistan shavkat mirziyoyev are pragmatic and strategically verified this contributed to strengthening our country as a reliable and stable partner that deserves trust and pursues an active foreign policy the main result of this approach was a significant improvement of the political situation in central asia e g the evolution of the spirit of good neighborhood in the region the beginning of joint work between neighboring states to resolve vital regional issues joint responses to the challenges and threats faced by the region including the pandemic and its consequences solving environmental problems preventing transnational threats of extremism and terrorism as well as strengthening interethnic harmony friendly and fraternal ties between the peoples of central asia it has already become a tradition to hold regular consultations of the heads of states of central asia as president shavkat mirziyoyev noted the term central asian spirit has appeared in the political vocabulary of the world accurately reflecting the positive political atmosphere of cooperation and mutual understanding created in our region uzbekistan s initiative to strengthen interregional cooperation deserves special attention on july 11 the un general assembly unanimously approved a special resolution on strengthening interconnectedness between central and south asia the adoption of the resolution became the practical implementation of the initiative of the president of the republic of uzbekistan h e mr shavkat mirziyoyev put forward during the high level international conference central and south asia regional connectivity challenges and opportunities held in july 2021 in tashkent the tashkent conference brought together an unprecedented number of delegates about 600 representatives from 50 countries of the world un secretary general antónio guterres who attended the event at the time said that connectivity plays a key role in trade economic growth and sustainable development and can help build long term peace stability and prosperity in central and south asia closer cooperation with south asia the creation of new transport corridors of course will play a positive role in expanding mutual trade and economic cooperation with the countries of central asia and with the countries of southeast asia including indonesia generally uzbekistan has balanced relations with the leading states of the world the countries of the region and international organizations maintaining the geopolitical balance and ensuring the diversification of trade and economic ties today we have equal relations with foreign countries and maintain mutually beneficial trade and economic relations jakarta globe how are bilateral and multilateral relations between uzbekistan and indonesia developing today in what areas and sectors do you think have the greatest potential for growth in mutual cooperation ambassador this year we are celebrating an important anniversary the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the republic of uzbekistan and the republic of indonesia over the years significant results of mutual cooperation have been achieved political dialogue is developing the parties are providing mutual support within the framework of international organizations and mutually beneficial economic cultural and humanitarian ties have been established and strengthened if we talk about the potential for further cooperation in my opinion first of all economic cooperation has a great prospectus for growth uzbekistan and indonesia have a number of complementary sectors of the economy and types of products which have high demand in our markets uzbekistan is interested in further increasing the volume of mutual trade including the supply of chemical fertilizers textile products cotton yarn and fabrics silk agricultural products legumes mung beans beans dried peppers garlic fresh fruits pomegranates stone fruits cherries cherries apricots peaches nectarines plums etc dried fruits nuts and vegetables that are in demand on the indonesian market at the same time uzbekistan is ready to buy from indonesia goods which have demand in our domestic and central asian markets tea and coffee various tropical fruits bananas pineapples and dragon fruit seafood paper rubber products etc according to statistics for the period of january july of this year exports from indonesia to uzbekistan increased by 1 4 times and foreign trade turnover between our countries increased by 1 6 times and exceeded this figure for the whole of 2021 in general we managed to overcome the drop in trade caused by the pandemic in foreign trade we can achieve much greater results therefore work is on to intensify cooperation between the chambers of commerce and industry and the relevant agencies of uzbekistan and indonesia certainly another promising direction of cooperation is tourism uzbekistan is one of the centers of islamic civilization and the birthplace of imam al bukhari bahouddin nakshbandi ibn sina and other great scientists of not only islamic but also world civilization i would like to note that the development of tourism is one of the elements of uzbekistan s strategy today a visa free regime has been granted for tourists from more than 90 countries and indonesia was one of the first to be granted these preferences even during the most acute phase of the covid 19 quarantine entry for indonesian tourists to uzbekistan remained as visa free in 2019 before the start of the pandemic the number of tourists from indonesia exceeded 3 5 thousand people this is a small number but the growth rate is 1 7 times compared to 2018 was impressive in december 2019 uzbekistan presented the umrah program with the allocation of passenger seats for indonesian pilgrims on the tashkent jeddah tashkent flights as a result in the 1st quarter of 2020 the number of indonesian tourists visiting uzbekistan increased two times in the 1st quarter of 2020 indonesian tourists came out on top among the citizens of the southeast asian countries who visited uzbekistan as part of the ziyarah tourism at the same time i would like to note the excellent opportunities of our country for winter tourism in recent years ski resort infrastructures have been developed in uzbekistan at high international standards in turn visiting the island of bali and other resorts and historical centers of indonesia is also becoming popular in uzbekistan and as a person who is directly familiar with the high level of tourist services in indonesia i consider it a very promising and high potential to expand the inbound tourist flow from uzbekistan to indonesia unfortunately the covid 19 pandemic has made serious adjustments we have lost significant volumes of mutual passengers number and direct flights have been suspended but today in uzbekistan and indonesia the main quarantine restrictions have already been softened or completely canceled in this regard we are very optimistic about the prospects for the resumption of mutual tourist flow of course the list of promising areas of cooperation between our countries is not limited to the above mentioned we have a very wide range of interaction it is worthy to note the successes in the development of ties in the field of science and education including the exchange of representatives of academic circles until today 16 agreements were signed between the universities of the two countries on the creation of training courses for specialists in the field of halal tourism modern hotel services teachers of the indonesian language etc in september 2019 a joint master s program was launched between bukhara state university and gunadarma university to train ict specialists in the tourism sector our country remembers with deep respect the visit of the first president of the republic of indonesia h e mr sukarno to the former soviet union in september 1956 despite religious restrictions in the ussr at that time mr sukarno s decision to travel to uzbekistan to visit the tomb of imam al bukhari was an example of true respect for the prominent son of uzbekistan since then it has been a unique event and one of the sources of friendly relations between uzbekistan and indonesia even if we are far from each other from a geographical point of view our nations are close by hearts and enjoy mutual respect for traditions which creates a solid opportunity for long lasting comprehensive cooperation jakarta globe mr ambassador thank you very much for the interview share url berhasil di salin the latest tags keywords
the democrat party s pick for secretary of labor says ceos are being victimized by a shortage of immigrant workers companies want to hire another 11 million people labor secretary marty walsh told fox news on september 2 adding if those 11 million jobs had to be filled tomorrow we certainly don t have enough people in the united states to fill those jobs the issue of workers has to be addressed and the only way you can do it is through immigration when i talk to ceos from companies all across america they re all in favor of immigration reform he said they re all in favor of pathways of visas for people coming into the united states working and we re going to have to have that real serious conversation because at some point it will begin to impact our economy but walsh doesn t seem to know what s going on in the u s labor market in terms of real wages for the less educated or the labor force participation responded steve camarota research director at the center for immigration studies there are two main things that you could do make it more attractive to work and make it less attractive to sit on your ass he said could you ever get teenagers to work like they did in the 70s no but could you get a million more teenagers to work yeah could you ever get men to have the labor force participation rate of 96 percent say non college men 25 to 54 that we had in 1964 no but could you get it up to 88 percent instead of 84 percent or 83 percent yes the government should try to fill jobs with some of the roughly 60 million adults not working by allowing wages to rise he said the 60 million number includes 5 5 million people who said they want a job but are not part of the unemployment numbers because they have not looked for jobs in the last four weeks the government should also try to raise the productivity of american workers with better training and machinery he added the most important way to make a country actually richer on a per capita basis which is all that really matters is productivity if you want to grow the per capita gdp productivity is really a key option and there s no evidence that immigration helps to do that walsh seems to be entirely captive to the perspective of wall street which wants a bigger economy and ignores the fact that productivity growth is the real key to increasing wages and improving the standard of living he added some gop legislators are looking at ways to help non working americans rejoin the labor force for example sen ron johnson r wi told a town hall event there is a number of innovative ideas i would support phil gramm came to the senate where we were talking about our labor shortage and one of his suggestions was to coax seniors to re enter the workforce don t charge them payroll tax they re not paying it anyway so they want to get back in and earn a few extra bucks but that pro american anti poverty proposal was quickly stabbed by todd schulte the president of a billionaire funded pro migration advocacy group would suggest a better approach is a pathway to citizenship work permits for undocumented immigrants not terminating daca tps h 4 eads and modernizing and expanding vs trying to slash legal immigration avenues for those coming in the future schulte heads fwd us which is a trade lobby created by wealthy west coast investors including mark zuckerberg eric schmidt bill gates and various other investors billionaires the group was formed in 2013 to maximize the inflow of foreign workers taxpayer aided consumers and high occupancy renters into the u s economy the investors have close ties to many democrats including biden s chief of staff ron klain would suggest a better approach is a pathway to citizenship work permits for undocumented immigrants not terminating daca tps h 4 eads and modernizing and expanding vs trying to slash legal immigration avenues for those coming in the future todd schulte thetoddschulte september 2 2022 the mostly female staff of the group tries to hide the identity of the investors who founded and funded the group but copies exist at other sites many local business groups are also calling for sidelined americans to be replaced with eager compliant hard working migrants on july 7 about 30 business and humanitarian leaders gathered in nemo to initiate plans for freedom s haven for new american s workforce said a september 2 report in watertown public opinion the report by a local real estate appraiser brad johnson continued the group led by lake area technical college president mike cartney recognizes that south dakota s economy depends on more immigrant and guest workers thune who participated in the july meeting had just asked president joe biden to increase the number of work visas critics of thune and anyone who suggests more immigrants be welcomed and allowed to work allege that these workers take jobs the u s citizens would fill obviously that is not the case in south dakota one employer said wednesday that a 21 an hour part time job to wash cars in brookings a college town had no applicants however many companies are trying to sell automated car cleaners that allow a few employees to earn good wages while washing many more autos many companies are being pressured by labor shortages to invest in high tech high wage gear including dairies in south dakota similarly a new meatpacking plant in south dakota will rely heavily on automation drgnews reported july 19 the western legacy development corporation facility will utilize robotics and artificial intelligence along other tech applications thereby creating a completely automated packing line which will make the facility safer more efficient more humane and will provide consistent cuts of meat that would not ordinarily be achieved by a human with known margins for error many pro migration advocates and journalists admit that labor migration is the third rail of u s politics for example johnson wrote that will take congressional action to modify and thune sen mike rounds r s d and rep dusty johnson r s d plan to meet with business leaders sometime in september to map out a strategy part of that strategy will be insulating the three men from the inevitable attacks coming from those who demonize anyone who supports making immigration easier the government s policy of pumping foreign labor into the u s economy has distorted the incentives for the nation s ceos investors and political leaders camarota said immigration allows them to both be empathetic and indifferent at the same time he said immigration lets us ignore the problem of all these men sitting on the sidelines not even looking for work he said adding they do want to care but they re just exasperated to some extent with the nonworking black and white and actually u s born hispanic population because the truth is raising the labor force participation rate of less educated men is very challenging it s not clear exactly how to do it whereas just bringing the foreigners and having a lot of sympathy for them is easy the immigrants seem to be more more virtuous because they work everything is perfect they re nice and quiet and so forth training less educated americans especially at small companies is thankless with lots of frustration and lots of failures given how kids are raised today it s more and more failure all the time he said adding there are all kinds of that have atrophied as a consequence of immigration there used to be seasonal employers at the beach or in the mountains or at camps who had all kinds of contacts in the cities and suburbs with ministers and other community leaders to help them funnel young people to those seasonal jobs that s all gone just use the h 2b h 2a workers and illegal immigrants don t need to worry about keeping their contacts for politicians and government officials the easy option is to pay them their disability and give them medicaid camarota said but democrats also want immigration to deliver them additional immigrant voters on election days in a may statement walsh downplayed the value of non citizen teporary visa workers saying we need to figure out some immigration laws and get some reform not h 2b visas h 2a visas not those visas that s not immigration extraction migration it is easier for government officials to grow the economy by immigration than by growing exports productivity or the birth rate so washington dc deliberately extracts millions of migrants from poor countries and uses them as extra workers consumers and renters this extraction migration policy both grows and skews the national economy it prevents tight labor markets and so it shifts vast wealth from ordinary people to investors billionaires and wall street it makes it difficult for ordinary americans to advance in their careers get married raise families or buy homes extraction migration slows innovation and shrinks americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using stoop labor and disposable workers instead of the american professionals and productivity boosting technology that would allow americans and their communities to earn more money this migration policy also reduces exports by minimizing shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional economic gaps between the democrats cheap labor coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states an economy fueled by extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it gives an excuse for wealthy elites and progressives to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society such as drug addicts this economic strategy is enthusiastically pushed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into an economic empire of jealous identity groups overseen by progressive hall monitors we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted but the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits the poverty of migrants and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors progressives hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding narratives and theatrical border security programs progressives claim the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration helps migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations similarly establishment republicans media businesses and major gop donors hide the skew towards investors by ignoring the pocketbook impact and by touting border chaos welfare spending migrant crime and drug smuggling many polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but the polls also show deep and broad public

keep up to date with the latest stories with our walesonline newsletter keep up to date with the latest stories with our walesonline newsletter in the quaint town of penmaenmawr in conwy there is a sea wall called violet s leap perhaps little is known about the story behind its name but it is arguably one of north wales most scandalous stories it was a cold january night in 1909 when an expensive minerva car a belgian brand of automobile available at the time was discovered hanging over the edge of a sea wall dangling above the roaring sea the car s windscreens had been smashed and its driver was nowhere to be seen all that was left was an expensive tam o shanter hat and an abandoned diary the journal the hat and the car all belonged to one owner violet gordon charlesworth read more olivia newton john s connections to wales and how she found out about her welsh roots violet was a 24 year old woman she was born as may charlesworth in stafford in 1884 her father david was an insurance agent and her mother was called miriam davies violet was the youngest of at least four children the family lived in and around derby until the early 1900s when they moved to rhyl in north wales the charlesworths lived a life of luxury first living in rhyl and then later at the bod erw manor house in st asaph violet was often seen in the local area wearing expensive clothes and travelling in luxurious cars her alluring lifestyle captured the attention of the press who would report on her every move image british newspaper archive a couple of days before her 25th birthday violet was driving with her sister lillian and their chauffeur watts along the north wales coastline when her car swerved and crashed into a wall it was reported that violet was thrown out of the windscreen down a ledge and into the sea no body was found and she was presumed dead but all was not as it seemed it turned out that violet was very much alive and on the run with the aid of her mother and sister she had spent the past nine years defrauding wealthy doctors widows stockbrokers and more it is said that violet started ripping off potential suitors when she was just a teenager in 1907 the family set up a shop in rhyl they started spreading a lie that violet was the goddaughter of general charles gordon a famous british army officer who had earned national acclaim for his service in china image british newspaper archive he had famously been killed in action back in 1885 while defending khartoum from rebel muslims in sudan having served in pembrokeshire very early on in his career it made sense that he had some links to wales the charlesworths would lie in order to present violet as a lucrative heiress in one instance violet obtained 5 000 from a rhyl doctor edward hughes jones whom she had promised to marry she told him she would receive 100 000 when she turned 25 the more violet was believed the more suitors were attracted to her they would shower the young lady with vast sums of money and gifts which amounted to over 2m in modern terms and the more gifts violet received the stronger her image as a wealthy heiress became she used her money to invest in the stock exchange as well as buying expensive cars boxes of jewellery and even diamond tiaras while the average wage at the time was no more than a 1 a week violet was spending 4 000 annually days before the supposed crash however her long term scheme began to crumble and with the impending call of creditors to her door she decided to fake her own death image british newspaper archive the story of the car found hanging on the side of the cliff made headlines all over the world including in the usa australia and all over the uk but concern that no corpse was found and rumours of violet faking her death to escape creditors prompted a nationwide manhunt for the heiress the affair became known as the welsh cliff mystery with reports of alleged sightings doing the rounds in newspapers photos of the young heiress were shared far and wide she was later found in a hotel in oban scotland where she went by another false name margaret macleod eventually she confessed her true identity to the press as being violet charlesworth upon the arrest the weekly mail reported miss macleod has confessed that she is the missing lady motorist miss violet gordon charlesworth the admission was made to several press representatives at edinburgh in these words it is no use my denying it any longer i am miss violet charlesworth image daily post wales during one interview when explaining what happened on the night of the supposed accident in penmaenmawr it was reported that she had said i gave one wild look around and then an impulse came into my head to get away from the horrible associations of the place violet and her mother were convicted of four counts of conspiracy to obtain money by false pretences and two counts of obtaining money by false pretences in march 1910 the two were sentenced to five years of hard labour which was later reduced to two and imprisoned in aylesbury in england before being released back to scotland in february 1912 little is known about what happened to violet thereafter genealogy service findmypast believe that her mother miriam died in lancashire in 1920 while there is a death record for a may charlesworth in stoke on trent in 1957 violet may have long

extinguishing inflation dny59 here s how i think of my money soldiers i send them out to war every day i want them to take prisoners and come home so there s more of them kevin o leary the investment scene has been a challenging place to be during this bear market that isn t unusual watching your portfolio erode brings about plenty of emotional responses and often questions an investor s strategy economic and market events are unpredictable but it is up to policymakers and investors to take past experiences into account in future actions since 1962 there have been eight recessions nine bear markets fifteen presidential elections three pandemics and countless wars and geopolitical events e g the cuban missile crisis the gulf war and the 9 11 terrorist attacks while periods of uncertainty are uncomfortable they teach lessons serve as a roadmap for future decisions and give investors belief in the resiliency of the markets the long term view this is the perfect time to remind investors of some of the steadfast and timeless principles of investing to build wealth â timing the market and allowing emotions to dictate decisions can be detrimental to a portfolio case in point the annualized price return for the s p 500 over the last 60 years is 7 4 but for investors who missed the top 25 best trading days out of 15 130 total it would have cut their average annualized return to 4 6 having a long term investment horizon and a plan with your goals is paramount in navigating short term volatility successfully â i encourage investors to focus on their unique goals rather than following the sentiment of the crowd time and time again history shows that extreme levels of â crowdâ optimism and pessimism can lead investors to stray from their well established asset allocation strategy oftentimes being a contrarian and not getting caught up in the crowd mentality has proven to be more successful â even investors with decades long time horizons can get distracted by near term performance as a reminder of the resiliency of the markets and the power of compounding assume an investment of 100 per month in the s p 500 beginning in august 1962 over these sixty years the investor would have deposited a total of 72 000 through all the aforementioned major market events the initial investment still would have increased 20x for a market value today above 1 4 million this illustrates that consistent inflows and a long term horizon can weather market storms that is a perfect example of why concentrating on the long term will reap huge rewards but some don t have the luxury of decades and that brings us back to the present macro situation the short term view if the u s isn t already in one a recession looks likely despite ongoing debates and what some claim are mixed signals fixed income markets suggest that the odds of a recession have risen sharply using different treasury curves and different credit market inputs suggests an 80 chance of recession starting in 12 months interest rate hikes have â long and variable lagsâ and they are occurring in a slowing economic backdrop the shocks of these hikes are still yet unknown short term interest rates in the united states are tracking the fed funds rate higher over the last 7 months short term yields have risen faster since the early 1980s unintended consequences of this extremely fast pace of tightening have not started to emerge but an extreme commitment to tightening until inflation drops dramatically guarantees some sort of unintended consequence one might be the dollar which in real terms has soared to the strongest since the 1980s in the latest blow to us manufacturing between supply shocks fiscal tightening monetary tightening reduced discretionary income thanks to high commodity prices and the shift back from goods to services consumption in a post covid world a global industrial recession looks likely global manufacturing www bespokepremium com eurozone manufacturing pmis have already dropped into contraction territory global manufacturing activity is only barely clinging to an expansion thanks in part to a rebound in chinese activity here in the us the ism new orders index has already dropped below 50 that sort of reading does not guarantee a recession but these drops tend to meaningfully increase the odds of a recession in the interim markets have been too optimistic about the pain the fomc is willing to enforce to reduce inflation that will not slow as fast mechanically as the fomc needs the market has already priced in a mild recession and that is why we see stocks remain in a primary bear market downtrend we witnessed just how offside many investors were as they assumed a â slower pace of rate hikes at some pointâ mindset crept into their strategy then they started to forecast when the fed was going to start cutting rates unfortunately i never believed the fomc would oblige without much further progress on core inflation while headline and some components of the core are likely to lessen rents are very unlikely to decelerate fast enough for core cpi to fall meaningfully towards 2 before mid 2023 itâ s one thing to get underlying cyclical inflation to 4 5 getting it lower is a structural challenge then there are energy costs and from where i sit it doesn t appear there will be a change in energy policy to bring down commodity prices in the near term rising costs of debt will start to challenge a range of highly leveraged economic agents over the coming months labor markets have already slowed and will decelerate significantly further with follow on shocks to spending at a lag given high debt growth and low savings rates the message on inflation here has been loud and very clear policy errors introduced inflation to the investment scene once introduced the fed had to come back into the investment scene much earlier than anyone anticipated that was a warning not many heeded investors will now come to find just how difficult it will be to tame inflation this fed will have a tougher time because the federal government has been the catalyst and is the main source of continued high inflation for those that need a translation of chair powell s message it can be stated in three words higher for longer my message is the same and it s a simple one anyone that wants to survive and thrive in this bear market needs to heed don t fight the fed the fundamental picture remains cloudy at best whether the clouds turn into a full blown economic tornado remains to be seen global stock markets the u s is not the only country that is struggling and the country etfs of each major global economy posted the same pattern in august on average these stock markets had reached a 3 1 gain at their month to date highs but they finished down an average of 3 5 for the month overall developed markets have fared much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4 8 versus 1 2 respectively bespoke investment group there are only two etfsâ brazil ewz and india inda â that were positive for the month meanwhile china mchi is unchanged on the other end of the spectrum sweden ewd has been the worst performer nearing an 11 decline with several other european nations following up with the next worst performance with stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in august most have moved back below their 50 day moving averages heading towards oversold territory there are no country etfs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although ewz and inda have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week this year s declines have resulted in the average country etf falling 24 below its 52 week high those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below pre covid highs as well at the moment there are only four countries that remain above pre covid 52 week highs taiwan ewt india inda the united states spy and canada ewc this exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert to those prior highs the week on wall street after a disappointing failure to keep the rally off the june lows going the bulls were absent for most of this week and the bears roamed wall street the result was a four day 5 5 losing streak that finally ended with a rally 15 minutes before the bell rang on thursday when the dust settled the s p showed a 7 8 loss since being rejected at a key resistance level on august 16th friday saw a quick rally snuffed out leaving the s p down 78 on the day and off 3 for the week the nasdaq is now in a 6 day losing streak longest of the year leaving the index with a 4 loss for the week all of the major indices are now on 3 week losing streaks the economy employment nonfarm payrolls increased 315k in

cycle global monetary tightening is running at a truly dramatic pace geopolitical scene as if the fundamental backdrop needed another issue to fret over tensions were ramped up between china and taiwan recently with the taiwan army firing at chinese drones in the meantime the administration is asking congress to approve a 1 1 billion arms sale to taiwan russian and chinese aggression is at the root of geopolitical tensions in the world today and they have drawn the us into this scene it would appear further escalation in anxiety over chinese taiwan affairs will only add to the billions in expenditures that the us now finds itself entangled in this however is a different situation china is not russia and how convenient is that the chinese actions piggyback with their russian allies the us is already helping to finance one war and doesn t need to be dragged into another conflict while the reckless spending continues on the home front that might be precisely what the chinese russian alliance wants mid term elections president joe biden currently has the worst pre midterm approval rating since president truman in 1950 americans are experiencing â issue fatigueâ with multiple â crisesâ on a wide range of issues that are weighing on households voter dissatisfaction with the direction of the country has reached its highest level in 40 years although americans are generally dissatisfied with the president betting markets still project a nearly two thirds chance that democrats will retain control of the senate the only two previous presidents that saw approval ratings lower than biden s heading into mid terms since the start of wwii roosevelt in 1942 third term and truman first term in 1946 ended up in the mid terms losing twelve and five senate seats respectively only five presidents have seen their party s position in the senate improve or remain flat since the start of wwii in a mid term election cycle in these five cycles the sitting president averaged an approval rating of 57 2 which is 19 2 percentage points higher than that of biden in those mid term years when the president had an approval rating below 50 the average loss of senate seats for the president s party was five and the only one to pick up senate seats was trump 2 in 2018 given the backdrop the possibility of democrats keeping their majority in the senate would seem unlikely but with less than three months until election day the betting markets say otherwise will democrats be able to overcome this historical tide outcome probabilities analysts now suggest lower odds currently 50 for a republican senate that is a function of the unsettled outcome in senate primaries and the somewhat favorable map for democrats gop sweep 50 â 5 â republicans control the house and the senate split decision 30 unchanged â republicans take the house and democrats to maintain control of the senate status quo 20 â 5 â democrats maintain control of the house and senate by political standards there is an eternity left between today and election day where anything can happen i doubt the stock market will be swayed by any of the pre election banter it will come down to what occurs after the votes are counted in my view a government scene that is ruled by gridlock split government control will be looked at favorably by the markets food for thought based on the cbo score the recently passed tax and spend legislation would reduce deficits by 305 billion through 2031 that of course can be debated but assuming it is accurate it was just offset by recent actions taken by president biden forgiving student loan debt will cost between 300 billion and 980 billion over 10 years according to a new analysis published in bloomberg a penn wharton study suggests the cost could be as high as 1 trillion whether we take the low estimates or the higher forecasts this is an inflationary spending bill perhaps there will be a supreme court challenge that overturns this legislation because the president s action to forgive debt is unconstitutional if it can t be repealed then the administration added another roadblock to the road to reducing inflation however the roadblocks don t end there insanity is often defined as doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result the fed s mission to slow inflation starts with curbing demand certain state legislators have now deemed it absolutely positively necessary to hand out inflation relief checks calif will send out 20 million checks in october that will only increase demand it s been my premise that the policies of the federal government are the largest contributor to the inflationary spiral that has forced the fed to act much sooner than expected the fed would not be part of the investment scene today if it were not for high inflation yet despite the high inflation backdrop the consistent spending programs keep repeating the same mistake and we won t see a different result inflation will stay embedded for a lot longer finally there are 11 million job openings in the us so there is no shortage of opportunities for everyone to improve their situation without inflation laden government assistance the green new deal power grids are already strained without any impact from the green movement yet the push to transition to electric continues evs have a long way to go before they become mainstream an issue you won t hear this from the green movement california is having a problem with charging evs as their power grids are under severe pressure the state s new climate plan will produce surging demand for electric power that will require hundreds of billions of investment to build the required infrastructure not to mention the need to build a reliable source to provide the power needs california isn t alone there will be other states that will line up to spend what will amount to trillions all of that will be paid for by the consumer and will add another element of uncertainty for the economy and the markets at some point one might want to ask what the return on that investment will be how much will this endeavor reduce global temperatures sentiment the bears are still committed to their case and their numbers are growing the weekly sentiment survey from the ndicates bearish sentiment surged by 8 rising from 42 4 to 50 4 while readings above 50 have been more common this year in the history of the survey since 1987 less than 4 of weekly readings have been higher than this week s level of bearish sentiment the daily chart of the s p 500 spy a textbook rejection at resistance left the s p and all major indices looking for support the subsequent rebound rally also failed at a lower level leaving the s p vulnerable to further weakness s p 500 www freestockscharts com whether this is the extent of the retest of the june lows or not is still a question mark my daily updates cover this and all of the other indices in detail using technical analysis is a must when assembling an investment strategy investment backdrop august is in the books and what appeared to be the second month in a row with gains turned into the 5th month where the s p fell this year this is the 5th worst start to a year in us stock market history the s p nasdaq djia and dow transports all lost in the neighborhood of 4 5 in august the russell 2000 small caps were the winner only dropping 1 7 at the sector level only energy 2 9 posted a gain that was despite crude oil having its worst month of the year semiconductors were the big loser with a 9 loss in august year to date results continue to show a sea of red energy commodities and utilities are not in bear markets and remain standouts in 22 the semiconductor sector has now lost 31 this year and that helped drag the nasdaq to a 24 ytd loss this week s price action confirms that the last mini uptrend was indeed another failed bear market rally thirteen trading days ago the s p was at 4305 and from that day when resistance proved to be insurmountable the index has dropped 8 8 sorry for the broken record commentary but the only place to be is in the stocks and sectors that are in bull market trends everything else is an attempt to play against the primary trend and that comes with elevated risk thank you for reading this analysis if you enjoyed this article so far this next section provides a quick taste of what members of my marketplace service receive in daily updates if you find these weekly articles useful you may want to join a community of savvy investors that have discovered how the market works the 2022 playbook is now lean and mean opportunities are condensed in energy commodities utilities and healthcare along with that i ve defined bearish to bullish reversals the message to clients and members of my service has not changed stay with what is working each week i revisit the canary message which served as a warning for the economy the focus was on the financials transports semiconductors and small caps i used them as a tell for what direction the economy was headed to help forge a near term strategy unfortunately all of the canaries are very very sick small caps my indicators that track the long term chart of the russell 2000 are now flashing defcon 3 the bear market trend is firmly in place and despite the modest loss in august the technical situation looks a lot worse sectors along with the sub sector of commodities bci every sector except energy xle and utilities xlu are in bear market trends and little need to discuss involvement unless one has a long term time horizon commodities rare earths are 17 elements on the periodic table most of them found in what s known as the f block of the table not all of them are truly â rareâ â cerium for example is more abundant in the earthâ s crust than copper â but the sparse availability of economically viable ore deposits means that mining takes place in several locations chinaâ s historical dominance in this market is mainly sourced as a byproduct of large scale iron ore mining operations in the provinces of inner mongolia and sichuan rare earths www bbc com in 2021 the global extracted supply of rare earth totaled 285 000 metric tons with china accounting for 59 of that here is one area of the green revolution where the us is making inroads the u s stands out for being the fastest growing supply source in recent years leapfrogging australia to become second largest behind china all of this comes from mp materialsâ mp mountain pass mine in california the only large scale rare earth mine that is currently operating in north america on a smaller scale india madagascar and thailand are also expanding in case you are curious russiaâ s role is tiny 2 600 metric tons in 2021 and barely up from 2015 letâ s go back and look back to the mountain pass mine whatâ s counterintuitive about this site is that all of the output is shipped to china for processing this means that the u s exports raw rare earths but imports processed rare earths according to the u s geological survey the u s imported 160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2021 of which 78 came from china the reason is fairly straightforward the u s has only limited manufacturing capacity vis a vis the high tech products that we described earlier electronics and various industrial goods are simply not produced in the u s on the scale that they are in china itself and or its asian neighbors i suspect at some point the light will go on and policymakers will come to understand that if the green agenda is to succeed this is another area where the us has to play catch up or remain beholden to china in the interim a company like mp materials which is the only u s listed pure play is a solution it possesses the only large scale mining site in north america the business model is currently mining centric but vertical integration is underway via a 700 million project in texas this facility â supported by a u s department of defense contract worth 35 million â will produce alloys and magnets and it is expected to come online in late 2023 the company has a long term agreement with general motors to supply components for ev powertrains commodities as measured by the bloomberg commodity index etf bci are another area of the market that is in bull mode a brief pullback to support this week and if that level holds the etf has the potential to trace out a move back to the 31 32 range and perhaps a new high energy i am very pleased with my year so far and having energy as my favorite area of the market has helped with that when i review the sectors it is hard to find a better short term chart now not many can show prices above all three short term trend lines the volatility remains as the group rallied quickly got overextended and pulled back this week given the energy policies in place today energy has a big tailwind and that catalyst doesn t appear to be going away anytime soon with inflation now back in the minds of investors and the thought that it will be around for a lot longer than most want to believe that adds credence to the notion that oil prices will remain elevated i also do not see any change in energy policy as the green new deal agenda forbids embracing the production of fossil fuels here in the us scaling into the high paying dividend oil names has worked all year i don t believe it s time to abandon that strategy natural gas nat gas etf ung is not for the faint of heart but despite the volatility this energy play is a winning situation that recently set another new high this is a strong bull trend that has fundamental tailwinds at its back the etf is an add on a drop to any of the support trend lines it is a fantasy to think that europe s energy crisis is going to be resolved quickly it s doubtful this will be the last winter where the eu is facing an energy crisis commentary from a recent energy conference in norway we should confront the reality that europe may suffer a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions through efficiency savings through rationing and through a very quick buildout of alternatives such as gas imports and alternative energy sources that opens the door for us liquified natural gas demand to remain at elevated levels enter cheniere energy lng the leading producer of lng in the us the stock has been part of the savvy portfolio since june here is a name that should be on everyone s watch list it is a strong buy on any move back to support healthcare the healthcare etf xlv has been struggling lately and is back at the lower end of its 2022 trading range the etf is barely hanging on to its long term bull trend and this sector may also succumb to the selling pressure and drop into a bear market of its own sub sector biotech after a 46 rally off the june lows the bearish to bullish reversal in the biotech etf xbi pulled back 12 new support areas were tested and despite the poor price action in the overall market the etf remains in its mini uptrend technology analyzing the long term charts of the nasdaq composite the nasdaq 100 and the semiconductor etf soxx the technology sector has been given a defcon 3 high alert status sub sector semiconductors last week i mentioned that i was short the philadelphia semiconductor index using an inverse etf the sector has been extremely weak and suffered 5 straight days of losses greater than 1 each day a streak in which it has dropped more than 11 the inverse short position was stopped out on friday morning yielding a 20 gain since august 22nd the current losing streak for the sox ranks as the longest run of 1 daily declines since january 2016 and just the 12th such streak in the index s history while friday morning s quick rally triggered the sale of my inverse etf position i do not believe the pain in this sector is over there could be another opportunity presented to short this sector on the next rally attempt ark innovation etf arkk last week i mentioned the bearish to bullish reversal trend in the ark innovation etf could be in jeopardy the week s price action leaves the etf in a precarious situation the arkk is now below all short term trend lines but is still above the july lows cryptocurrency cryptocurrencies have pivoted lower alongside equities in the wake of fed chair powellâ s short speech that resulted in bitcoin moving into oversold territory and out of the past several daysâ range however btc trading below its 50 day ma is not a positive sign for future performance unlike other assets which historically see stronger returns when they become oversold the opposite is true for cryptos similar to equities september has historically been one of the worst months for cryptos in the case of bitcoin it has not risen even a single time in september in each of the past five years averaging an 8 5 decline during the month bitcoin www bespokepremium com for anyone that wants to play the weak trend in bitcoin i suggest using the proshares short bitcoin etf biti final thoughts investors who have decided to fight the fed or don t believe the fed s message are going to be destroyed market participants that wish to follow the rhetoric that suggests all is well and the us economy is on the right track are also going to get destroyed of course that assumes they haven t already been decimated these weekly missives are constantly accused of being too political so be it i report the data and if the data points out the issues that are affecting the us economy and equity market i will continue to report them those that believe i m selling an agenda need to look in the mirror and follow their view before objecting to my perspective of the situation if you are content with the economy and believe we are not in a recession or won t be in a recession in 23 position yourself that way if you believe in the energy policy that is in place is correct for the economy that it s perfectly fine to increase taxes in a slowing economy and continue massive spending in an inflationary backdrop then by all means set your strategy to take advantage of that if you trust that an anti business backdrop will enhance economic growth then by all means add to your positions a dose of reality all i am doing is speaking to what is occurring today on the investment scene and positioned in a way to take advantage of this current backdrop i m on the other side of those that wish to bury their heads in the sand and dismiss the issues because of their political bias those that have heeded the new era investment strategy that was outlined here in february have flourished in this bear market i will add that strategy not only looks at the fundamental issues that are troubling this investment scene but also the very important technical scene the fundamental signals due to the policies enacted in mid 2021 are now confirmed by the technical view the difference between the two camps is one is dealing with reality and one is dismissing the preponderance of evidence in front of them for those that want to believe i promote a biased agenda i m not here to win a popularity contest i m here to make money and that is exactly what i ve accomplished in this bear market this success was accomplished by recognizing the issues unnecessary spending increases inflation a new energy policy created an energy crisis that increased costs and will keep inflation cemented in place raising taxes in a slowing economy will hamper future growth anti business policies will also impede growth negative gdp in the first half when the anti growth policies change i will change my strategy finally it is not important who does that but it must happen for the markets to return to a positive bull mode postscript please allow me to take a moment and remind all of the readers of an important issue i provide investment advice to clients and members of my

by christoph steitz and caleb davis frankfurt gdansk reuters russia has scrapped a saturday deadline to resume flows via a major gas supply route to germany deepening europe s difficulties in securing winter fuel after saying it had found faults in the nord stream 1 pipeline during maintenance nord stream 1 which runs under the baltic sea had been due to resume operating at 0100 gmt on saturday after a three day halt for maintenance but gazprom mcx the state controlled firm with a monopoly on russian gas exports via pipeline said on friday it could not safely restart deliveries until it had fixed an oil leak found in a vital turbine it did not give a new time frame however siemens energy which normally services nord stream 1 turbines said such a leak should not stop the pipeline from operating it also said the portovaya compressor station where the leak was discovered has other turbines for nord stream to keep operating such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site it is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work the company said moscow has blamed sanctions imposed by the west after russia invaded ukraine for hampering routine operations and maintenance of nord stream 1 brussels says this is a pretext and russia is using gas as an economic weapon to retaliate this is part of russia s psychological war against us tweeted michael roth chair of the german parliamentary foreign affairs committee siemens energy said it is not currently contracted to carry out maintenance work on the line but is on standby european commission chief ursula von der leyen said earlier the eu should impose a price cap on russian pipeline gas to foil what she said were president vladimir putin s attempts to manipulate the market russia has denied previous allegations of using gas as an economic weapon or manipulating the gas market the united states and europe were collaborating to ensure enough energy supplies were available a spokesperson for the white house s national security council said on friday it is unfortunately not surprising that russia continues to use energy as a weapon against european consumers the spokesperson added wholesale gas prices have rocketed 400 since august 2021 hurting european industry and households as demand recovered from the covid 19 pandemic and because of the ukraine crisis we see that the electricity market does not work anymore because it is massively disrupted due to putin s manipulations von der leyen said adding that a gas price cap on russian pipeline supplies could be proposed at the european level former russian president dmitry medvedev said moscow would turn off supplies to europe if brussels imposed such a cap there will simply be no russian gas in europe he wrote on the telegram app in response to von der leyen reduced deliveries via nord stream alongside lower gas flows via ukraine another major route have already left european states struggling to refill storage tanks for winter and prompted many to trigger emergency plans that could lead to energy rationing and stoking concerns about recession european commission spokesman eric mamer wrote on twitter nyse that gazprom had acted under fallacious pretences to shut down nord stream 1 it s also proof of russia s cynicism as it prefers to flare gas instead of honouring contracts group of seven finance ministers agreed on friday to put a price cap on russian oil exports moscow said it would halt oil sales to countries imposing the cap adding that the move would destabilize oil markets russia is the world s biggest exporter of crude and fuel combined better prepared germany s network regulator said the country was more ready to cope with a disruption to russian supplies but households and companies had to cut energy consumption it s good that germany is now better prepared but now it s down to each and everyone klaus mueller president of the bundesnetzagentur said on twitter kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov suggested earlier on friday there could be more disruptions to deliveries via nord stream 1 it s not the fault of gazprom that the resources are missing therefore the reliability of the entire system is at risk he said when asked if more outages could be expected gazprom chief executive alexei miller said on wednesday that sanctions meant siemens could not carry out regular maintenance eu governments have been preparing for the possibility that russia stops deliveries completely after gazprom first reduced flows in june and then again in july this week s maintenance was announced at short notice germany which is particularly reliant on russian supplies has been racing to fill its storage tanks before winter that storage is now nearly 85 full but berlin says reaching a 95 target by nov 1 will be tough unless companies and households use less fuel the eu has exceeded its 80 target for storage to be full by oct 1 ready for when heating usage

via msn however rate hikes may slow growth raise unemployment and cause headaches for borrowers he said the economist said inflation could spiral if the fed doesn t raise interest rates high enough nouriel roubini warned investors to prepare for a historic market crash and suggested the us economy could tumble into a quagmire of shrinking output surging inflation and soaring unemployment the economics professor at nyu stern whose nickname is dr doom shared his grim outlook during a recent etoro webinar he argued the federal reserve might have to double interest rates to 5 in order to curb inflation but hiking to that level could choke economic growth and cause a spike in joblessness moreover raising rates could spark a debt crisis roubini said american consumers companies and other entities have borrowed aggressively over the past decade and could struggle to repay their loans if interest costs jump he explained the upshot is the rate hikes needed to rein in inflation could tank the economy and cause crashes across stocks bonds housing credit private equity and other assets in bubble territory roubini said if that fallout spurs the central bank to give up on fighting inflation price increases could spiral out of control as well he continued

martha c white on friday the bureau of labor statistics reported that the us unemployment rate had ticked up to 3 7 in august an increase that surprised economists who had expected it to remain at july s 3 5 in a normal labor market rising unemployment is a red flag but even though today s labor market is far from normal last month s rise in unemployment is actually an indication that the job market is normalizing economists say one of the main reasons unemployment ticked higher in august was because more people were working or actively looking for work labor force participation rose three tenths of a percentage point to 62 4 while still a full percentage point lower than its pre pandemic level in february 2020 the august jobs report offered the first glimmer of hope that there might be some relief ahead when it comes to the tight supply of workers in the current context where labor supply has been a key constraint this rise in the labor force participation rate is actually very encouraging said gregory daco chief economist at ey parthenon increasing the supply of available workers is positive for the economy even if it does increase the official jobless rate us secretary of labor marty walsh said in an interview with cnn s jim sciutto on friday it s a sign that a lot more people are looking for work which is a plus given the extraordinary lengths to which employers are going to recruit and retain workers in a labor market with 11 2 million job openings if the unemployment rate goes up a little bit because of that that s okay because there are still many job openings in united states of america and we need to get more people back into work walsh said adding that he was very encouraged by the growth in labor force participation gary burtless labor economist at the brookings institution echoed that sentiment that is something we ve been worried about in this recovery that too few people are looking for work and that s causing a lot of labor market tightness he said improvement in the number of prime age americans between the ages of 25 and 54 joining the workforce was especially heartening he said a lot of the increase in the civilian labor force is in the population we ve been most worried about he said this is good news even if they re not finding jobs right away burtless added entered the workforce but they didn t immediately find work and consequently were added to the ranks of the unemployed he said which is why the unemployment rate rose even as the economy added jobs even after increasing unemployment is still very low by historical standards which suggests that policymakers and lawmakers alike will have to stomach a higher rate of joblessness if they want inflation to moderate said ken kim senior economist at kpmg that 3 7 unemployment rate is probably still adding to inflation in the us economy through higher wages he said we think the unemployment rate will have to rise to 5 5 to get inflation back to the fed s 2 target wages rose at an annualized rate of 5 2 in august the same as in july the combination of higher pay and a higher cost of living is likely motivating at least some of the new job seekers with inflation running at 8 5 household finances are under pressure if you re currently without a job you re probably reassessing your financial situation your wealth situation and stepping back into the labor pool to maintain your standard of living kim said aside from inflationary pressure economists said stock market volatility receding fear of covid and a new school year in which in person learning is once again the de facto norm are prompting more people to reenter the workforce we also are seeing improving health conditions probably helping alleviate some of the strains we ve seen on the child care front daco said public school are open on a more reliable basis we re seeing some signs that some education workers are returning to the labor force and that has knock on effects by freeing parents mostly mothers from child care obligations that were keeping them out of work it s the fact that you know the school is not going to close every time there s a case he said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved
a combination of supply chain issues and necessary repairs to girders on the structure will keep the higgins avenue beartrack bridge project from being completed until perhaps well into november we spoke to engineering project manager on the higgins avenue bridge with the montana department of transportation matt straub on friday for an update on the bridge reconstruction project the week of september fifth we ll start working on our expansion joint closure pours which are on the ends began straub the week after that so the week of the 12th we ll be working on pouring curbs for the pedestrian vehicle rails so we re looking like we re going to be tied up with our phase two until the end of september straub said some of the work still to be done includes repairs from problems that occurred during phase one of the project get our free mobile app starting at the beginning of october we re going to have to go in and do some phase one repairs he said we have some damaged girders that we need to go in and fix on the phase one side those repairs are expected to take four to six weeks we re hoping to get it done as soon as possible depending on weather and material availability but the material availability has been the primary driver of our delays we incurred some damage when we were deconstructing the bridge and have been fighting to get the materials to complete those repairs another sticking point in finishing the bridge project is the availability of the type of steel necessary for the job all our steel in the project is of domestic origin so one of the challenges is that we have to find the right steel from a domestic producer he said the steel on that bridge is considered fracture critical that means it has some special testing requirements that go above and beyond just the normal stock steel that you can get off the shelf and all those challenges have contributed to the delays straub said despite the delays and supply chain problems the budget for the project is still close to the original 16 to 17 million estimate upon completion the higgins avenue bridge will eventually be renamed the beartrack bridge according to missoula county commissioners dave strohmaier click here for details looking back photos of missoula and how it s changed check out these photos of how missoula has changed over the past decade
it s one of the most controversial components of the 2010 dodd frank act but it has a nearly perfect political name what member of congress could possibly be against the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the name is so perfect that hardly anyone stops to ask why the 20 plus federal statutes dodd frank transferred to create the new agency failed to adequately protect consumers the truth is that the bureau s architects had a very different kind of consumer protection in mind protecting consumers from themselves consider the wells fargo account scandal the bureau completely failed to protect those customers state based lawsuits in california uncovered the problem and the comptroller not the cfpb was likely the first federal regulator to know what was going on all the cfpb did was levy a fine after the comptroller and the city and county of los angeles had levied their own fines there is no excuse for fraud and it should be punished but what exactly did the cfpb bring to this party other than piling on perhaps centralizing more power at the federal level is not the best approach back in 1982 when the alternative mortgage transaction parity act amtpa preempted state mortgage laws consumer advocates argued that this federal takeover would only weaken consumer protection an excellent case can be made that weaknesses in the current legal framework made what happened at wells more likely to occur but political posturing has prevented congress from having that discussion now sen elizabeth warren d mass is tying the wells scandal to efforts to nullify the new cfpb arbitration rule last week american banker reported wells fargo right now is using these arbitration clauses to claim that people whose names were used to open fake accounts cannot sue wells fargo because in the one true account they had there is a hidden arbitration clause told reporters wells fargo is trying to use arbitration clauses to hide out from responsibility for opening fake accounts for millions of people in this country wells is undeniably using the arbitration clauses to try to prevent a class action suit but wells isn t hiding behind anything they screwed up and they ve admitted it wells ceo testified before congress and apologized saying i am deeply sorry that we failed to fulfill our responsibility to our customers to our team members and to the american public that s surely not enough for many people but wells is not hiding warren on the other hand is hiding she s hiding behind the wells case because she knows that ultimately the wells fargo case is nothing more than a distraction that s delaying congress from protecting consumers from the cfpb the dodd frank act directed the cfpb to limit or prohibit arbitration clauses only after a thorough study provided evidence to support such actions but the cfpb s study clearly does not make the case for banning arbitration agreements arbitration has a long history of benefiting consumers by providing an unbiased cost effective alternative way to resolve disputes members who really want to protect consumers will help enact liability reforms that create better safeguards against fraud ideally policymakers would design a fraud deterrence regime that concentrates on individual rather than corporate liability under the existing system wells shareholders are still suffering from the actions of front line employees many of whom were fired long ago perhaps if employees who commit fraud are individually held liable there would be less fraudulent activity congress should also consider imposing stricter corporate civil rather than criminal penalties to better align shareholder incentives and to make clearer distinctions between federal and state enforcement responsibilities there s very little chance that congress will completely redesign the fraud deterrence regime anytime soon but congress can fix the mess that it created with the cfpb first it can use the congressional review act cra to nullify the cfpb s arbitration rule the cra allows congress to invalidate an agency rule via a joint resolution of disapproval signed by the president it gives congress a limited period 60 days after the rule is received by congress to nullify the rule and the resolution only need pass by a simple majority in both chambers of congress the house has passed its resolution and the white house has announced that it will strongly support the house s effort the trump administration s official statement notes if allowed to take effect the cfpb s harmful rule would benefit trial lawyers by increasing frivolous class action lawsuits harm consumers by denying them the full benefits and efficiencies of arbitration and hurt financial institutions by increasing litigation expenses and compliance costs particularly for community and mid sized institutions the senate has introduced its own resolution and at least one senator believes the senate will vote in the next few weeks next congress can eliminate the cfpb and protect consumers based on the ideas in the financial choice act the financial regulatory reform bill that the u s house recently passed the choice act would rename and restructure the cfpb it would convert the bureau to an enforcement only agency and authorize the president to fire the director at will it would also require among other changes that funding for the new agency go through the regular appropriations process the choice act is unlikely to get 60 votes in the senate but republicans can still pass key sections of the choice act with only the 52 seat majority they currently hold they can do so through the budget reconciliation process because the congressional budget office cbo recently estimated that enacting the legislation would reduce federal deficits by 24 1 billion over the 2017 2027 period the cbo report is a green light for the senate to reform key parts of the dodd frank act thus protecting taxpayers and strengthening financial markets while waiting on reconciliation senators can quickly protect consumers by using the cra to nullify the arbitration rule congress should waste no time in nullifying the arbitration rule and then adopting dodd frank reforms such as those included in the financial choice act
sitka is considering action to limit the growth of short term rentals in the community based on both a sudden uptick in the number of permit applications this year and the widespread feeling in town that housing is extraordinarily tight but now it s more than a feeling the alaska department of labor s latest monthly report shows sitka near the top of the list of communities whose housing stock is tied up in short term rentals the available long term housing also costs sitkans more than alaskans who live elsewhere another indicator suggests there are more vacancies than expected 2022 is not the first year that sitkans have complained about a housing shortage but it does seem more acute lately in just the last few days on a social media page called sitka housing leads there are five new postings in search of places to live by a tidy non smoker by someone hoping for 2 3 bedrooms not more than 1 600 a month and by someone desperately in search of a place for themselves and a medium lab dog mix through november who is open to anything there are also some housing units listed including a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment for 1 500 which is sure to be snapped up a nicely remodeled 4 bedroom house but sorry no ocean view for 625 000 and there s a recent listing for a studio apartment for 2 000 but it has no bathroom the picture shows a birdhouse a humorous commentary on a situation that s not especially funny if you re one of those who just can t seem to find a place an efficiency townhouse listed recently in sitka housing leads for 2 000 mo residents will have to manage without a bathroom facebook sitka housing leads and this has just been so stressful ben kinzer told the sitka assembly in march there were many times where we were worried and preparing to be possibly homeless in a few months or living out of our car which i didn t expect ben kinzer testified before the sitka assembly when a proposal to freeze short term rental permits came up kinzer and his partner both fully employed in good jobs had moved six times in 18 months the assembly ultimately declined to impose a freeze on short term rentals and instead is moving toward issuing permits only to residents for rentals at their primary residence the original idea behind a bed and breakfast the ordinance appears likely to pass but members noted the absence of hard data to back up the experiences of those like kinzer who ve felt the pinch that data may have arrived the september report of the alaska department of labor called trends has extensive research on rentals in the state and it puts the situation in sitka in perspective for example in the second quarter of this year april june sitka had 151 vacation rental listings out of a total housing stock of just over 4 000 4 229 units that s three and a half percent of sitka s available housing in short term rentals in juneau there s considerably more housing stock almost 14 000 units 13 792 but only 379 short term listings in the same period that s about a full percentage point below sitka kodiak falls into the same range as juneau two and a half percent of housing is short term and ketchikan is even lower at 1 9 percent in fact the only place to top sitka is the kenai peninsula with a whopping 6 8 percent of available housing listed as short term rentals where sitka and kenai diverge though is in the cost of long term housing kenai ranks lowest in the state with residents spending 22 percent of their wages to pay an average rent of just over 1 000 sitkans on the other hand are at the top of the list paying 31 percent of their wages to pay an average rent that is 350 more than kenai the last piece of the housing puzzle in sitka doesn t quite fit as easily into the scarcity picture while a lot of sitka s available housing is tied up in short term rentals the vacancy rate for long term housing is the highest in the state 7 6 percent gunnar schulz the research economist in juneau who authored the report in trends wrote rising costs and waning pandemic supports have increased the burden on tenants the prices of big budget items such as food and gas have risen substantially over the last year meanwhile eviction moratoriums stimulus payments expanded unemployment benefits and emergency rental assistance have all expired adding unusual twists to affordability calculations all of this suggests that housing is dynamic and what was accurate in the second quarter of this year might not be accurate in the third who knows with a little paint and the right furniture that birdhouse might be a steal

local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals get started now note this guide focuses on the home equity conversion mortgage hecm the most common type of reverse mortgage loan and the only one insured by the federal housing administration fha reverse mortgage pros reverse mortgages have several advantages that can make them attractive to homeowners here are the primary reasons to consider using them cash out home equity the fundamental appeal of reverse mortgages is that homeowners can use them to convert their home equity into cash that can be a saving grace for retirees having difficulty supporting themselves with their savings and social security benefits unfortunately financial issues plague a disappointingly high percentage of seniors in the united states where most consumers struggle to accumulate the savings necessary to fund a reasonable retirement you generally need to save and invest at least 15 of your income over a 40 year career to retire on time but the annual personal savings rate has averaged much lower for decades with only a few exceptions as a result roughly 80 of households with adults over 65 report struggling financially few americans are genuinely secure since medical or long term care expenses can overwhelm even above average retirement savings and social security benefits fortunately buying a home is something of a forced savings plan you must stay current on your monthly mortgage payment to stay in your house so simply hanging onto a property inevitably means building equity as a result you re probably sitting on funds that can extend the life of your retirement portfolio if you ve paid down the mortgage on your home for years reverse mortgages let you draw down those funds all at once or set up a series of recurring payments for example you might receive 200 000 in cash upon closing the reverse mortgage or opt to withdraw 20 000 a year over the next ten years in equal monthly payments tax free income because most people don t pay income taxes out of pocket the same way they pay for food or rent it s easy to overlook the expense however taxes can significantly reduce the value of many retirement income sources fortunately the internal revenue service irs treats funds generated with a reverse mortgage like they do proceeds from a conventional mortgage in other words the cash provided is an advance not income and therefore non taxable proceeds for a reverse mortgage go farther as a result proceeds from a reverse mortgage go farther than the cash you draw from taxable retirement accounts like traditional 401 k s and individual retirement plans iras or even social security for example say you re a 65 year old retiree in texas who s married and files jointly with 30 000 in annual expenses you d need to withdraw roughly 33 500 from your 401 k each year to support yourself and pay your federal income taxes in addition to helping you avoid losing money to taxes the fact that reverse mortgage proceeds usually don t count as income helps minimize their impact on your retirement benefits these often have income limitations and earning too much in a single year can jeopardize them for example a two person household in california must earn less than 24 353 to remain eligible for the local medicaid program stay in your home if you re a retired homeowner struggling financially selling your home is often one of the best solutions to your problems not only does it convert your home equity into cash but it also allows you to move to a new location that s often beneficial since many retirees live in homes with wasted space for example couples that stay in the property where they raised their families after the children move away are probably paying for rooms they no longer need how can you reduce your housing payments if you sell your home you can significantly reduce your housing payments by renting or buying a smaller house or apartment alternatively you could move to a lower cost of living area however selling isn t a viable option for everyone not all seniors can save money by moving to a new location and some may prefer to stay in their homes for other reasons such as to be near family or avoid the stress of a move in these cases a reverse mortgage would be a better option you can use them to access your home equity without having to sell the property or vacate the premises protection from declining home values one of the primary risks with most forms of home equity financing is that your loan balance could grow to exceed the underlying property value that can happen if your property decreases in value or you miss debt payments and accrue extra interest if you or your beneficiaries need to sell your home while underwater like this making up for that shortfall can be a significant financial burden for example say you have a paid off home worth 250 000 you take out a home equity loan for 200 000 and invest the proceeds in bonds to help fund your retirement immediately after your local real estate market crashes causing your property value to plummet to 175 000 if you were to try to sell at this point you d need to make up the 25 000 difference between your equity and outstanding loan balance fortunately hecms offer protection from that danger unlike home equity loans and helocs they re a form of non recourse debt that means the lender can only collect on the balance by seizing the underlying collateral they can t come after you or your beneficiaries income or other assets to recoup their losses reverse mortgage cons reverse mortgages offer several attractive benefits but they also come with considerable drawbacks that diminish their utility here are the ones you need to understand to make an informed decision equity requirements you need to build some amount of equity in your residence to use any form of home equity financing lenders won t let you borrow against your home without enough meat on the bone to cover your closing costs and still benefit unfortunately reverse mortgages have noticeably higher equity requirements than most alternatives though the specifics vary between lenders you generally need at least 50 equity in your primary residence to complete one meanwhile you can generally qualify for a home equity loan or heloc with as little as 20 equity in your home that makes reverse mortgages much less accessible than their counterparts make sure you actually have enough for a reverse mortgage some retirees have been in their homes long enough to build sufficient equity for a reverse mortgage but not all for example if you refinanced too recently or suffered significant drops in property value a reverse mortgage may be out of reach to calculate your home equity subtract the outstanding balance on your mortgage or any other home equity financing arrangements from your property s fair market value for example say that you buy a house for 300 000 with a 30 000 down payment 30 000 divided by 300 000 equals 10 which means you d have 10 equity in the property closing costs and interest reverse mortgage fees are often more expensive than the charges involved in other means of liquidating your home equity for example your closing costs will likely be higher than if you sold your home or took out a heloc in addition to being higher reverse mortgage costs are more complicated than those involved in a traditional mortgage in fact they re so complex that borrowers must go through specialized counseling before receiving a loan upfront mortgage insurance premium that equals 2 of the mortgage balance annual mip that equals 0 5 of the outstanding mortgage balance origination fees up to the greater of 2 500 or 2 of the first 200 000 plus 1 of the remaining balance not to exceed 6 000 total third party charges which can include an appraisal title search surveys inspections recording fees mortgage taxes credit checks and more interest rates higher than those of a regular mortgage monthly service fees up to 30 for annually adjusting or fixed interest rate accounts up to 35 for monthly adjusting interest rate accounts while the terms vary between providers you ll generally incur some expenses fortunately you don t have to cover these expenses out of pocket you can pay for the upfront costs with funds from your reverse mortgage and roll the ongoing expenses into your loan balance in which case they re not due until you no longer live in the home heirs will inherit less as long as you stay current on your required property taxes homeowners insurance and ongoing maintenance your reverse mortgage balance won t come due until you sell move out or pass away however that doesn t mean the accounts are free the cost is merely deferred and your heirs will probably feel most of the impact the longer the account remains outstanding the more it will erode your home equity and reduce the value they ll inherit fortunately they won t have to pay anything extra even if the balance grows to exceed the underlying property value however if your reverse mortgage is outstanding for too long you may have little to no remaining equity be sure and get a fixed rate for example say you have a paid off home worth 400 000 you then use a reverse mortgage to cash out 200 000 of your home equity in a lump sum the loan carries a fixed interest rate of 7 the balance remains outstanding for ten years during which time the value of your home increases by 3 each year even if you ignore all the other ongoing reverse mortgage costs your home equity would still decrease significantly each year check your math on your home value and the reverse mortgage after a decade the home value would be roughly 537 567 however the value of the reverse mortgage would have increased to 393 430 as a result your heirs would only stand to inherit at most 144 137 watch could violate other retirement benefits many retirement benefits are need based which means you might not qualify for benefits if your income or assets exceed certain thresholds as a result taking out a reverse mortgage could impact your eligibility if you don t plan well enough while reverse mortgage proceeds generally don t count as income the cash they generate definitely still counts as an asset because of this you can inadvertently disqualify yourself from some programs by liquidating your home equity too quickly check that you don t mess up your eligibility for specific benefits most notably reverse mortgages can jeopardize your eligibility for medicaid and supplemental security income ssi both of which generally include asset limitations though medicaid programs vary between states for example say you live in california and rely on medicaid for your health insurance you and your spouse have 150 000 in your 401 k accounts but your expenses will deplete your funds within five years even with your social security benefits fortunately you have 200 000 in home equity and you want to use a reverse mortgage to liquidate it however in 2022 couples are ineligible if they have more than 195 000 in countable assets which includes cash and securities as a result taking out more than 45 000 in a lump sum using a reverse mortgage would put you over the asset limitation and disqualify you from medicaid tenure plan similar to an annuity this option provides you with guaranteed equal monthly payments for as long as you live in the home the total can exceed your home equity if you live long enough similar to an annuity this option provides you with guaranteed equal monthly payments for as long as you live in the home the total can exceed your home equity if you live long enough term payments much like a home equity loan this arrangement provides a fixed monthly payment for a set period such as ten years much like a home equity loan this arrangement provides a fixed monthly payment for a set period such as ten years line of credit instead of withdrawing funds immediately you can set up your reverse mortgage as a revolving line of credit and borrow against it when necessary instead of withdrawing funds immediately you can set up your reverse mortgage as a revolving line of credit and borrow against it when necessary hybrid plans for maximum flexibility you can combine the annuity or term payment options with a line of credit that way you ll have a steady income with the ability to borrow more whenever you want fortunately you can receive your reverse mortgage proceeds in several other ways to protect your eligibility for any other retirement benefits you may have consider drawing down your funds over time using one of these methods instead of a lump sum it s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to help you determine the best option property maintenance reverse mortgages require that you retain ownership of your home indefinitely while some seniors are happy to stay in their homes for life they may struggle to keep up with the required maintenance as they age an apartment is usually manageable for a long while but keeping a house in good shape is often too physically demanding for seniors for example few elderly individuals can climb ladders to clean gutters or shovel snow out of their driveways unfortunately taking out a reverse mortgage raises the stakes further failing to maintain your residence properly could violate your terms and cause your outstanding balance to come due immediately can you keep up with upgrading requirements that s exceedingly rare but seniors who lack the physical attributes necessary to keep their homes in line with health and safety standards could run into trouble if you don t have younger family members in the area who can help maintain your property and lack the capital to pay for help taking out a reverse mortgage might not be the best idea would it be better to sell and downsize instead you d likely be better off selling your home and downsizing to a more easily manageable property such as a condo with a homeowner s association that handles all the external maintenance reverse mortgage requirements though none are especially challenging reverse mortgages have many eligibility requirements in addition to being a homeowner and at least 62 years old you must also meet the following criteria principal residence you can only execute a reverse mortgage using your primary home investment properties aren t eligible for the loan product you can only execute a reverse mortgage using your primary home investment properties aren t eligible for the loan product

and spending increase the american economy is reel ing two million americans have lost their jobs personal and business bankruptcies are at all time highs and family incomes are falling with little prospect of a strong re covery in the near future policy makers are coming to realize that actions must be taken to jump start the economy a consensus is emerging that tax relief is necessary p erhaps even the key to restoring economic growth but the proposals now before congress rely on radically different approaches to the problem ronald reagans policies particularly his tax cuts these lawmakers led by senator albert gore of tennessee and representative thomas downey of new york both democrats have introduced legislation h r 2242 s 995 that would grant tax relief to low income families but sharply increase marginal tax rates for higher income tax payers supporters of this legislati o n assert that reagans economic policies hurt the poor and therefare would amend the tax code to achieve more fairness and income quality as well as they hope to triggcr economic growth last years record tax increase these legislators believe that the w ay to rejuvenate the economy is to enact tax cuts that would increase incentives to work save and invest the economic growth and jobs creation act s 381 h r 960 introduced by sena tor malcolm wallop the wyoming republican representative tom delay the texas republican and representative robin tallon the south carolina democrat would re some legislators continue to believe that the current recession is the culmination of tax cut remedy other legislators believe the nzession due at least in pa rt to duce payroll taxes lower the capital gains tax expand individual retirement ac counts and cut taxes on business investment supporters of the wallop delay tallon bill point out that america enjoyed its long est ever period of peacetime economic growth after ronald reagans tax cuts took ef fect and that the income of all segments of the population rose sharply in the 1980s these advocates of supply side economics reject the notion that tax cuts for some americans must be offset by tax increases for others in fact they argue that such an approach likely will reduce revenues to the united states treasury leading to higher budget deficits and pressure to impose higher taxes on all income groups reagan success as lawmakers consider these and oth e r tax relief plans they would do well to learn the public policy lessons of the 1980s by every measure of prosperity reaganomics worked some twenty million new jobs were created infla tion was brought under control and inflation adjusted income rose for all segments of the population much of the credit for this spectacular economic performance goes to the 1981 economic recovery tax act which cut tax rates across the board for individ uals and reduced the tax burden on business if policy makers want to restore economic growth they should heed the following lessons of the 1980s lesson 1 economlc growth is the best weapon agalnst poverty lesson 2 economic growth is stlmulated by low taxes partlcularly low lesson 3 the poor get richer when the rlch get rlcher lesson 4 if the alm is to make the rlch pay more actual taxes cut their tax lesson 5 ralslng taxes on the rlch does not help the poor lesson 6 increased social securlty taxes have wlped out the beneflts of lesson 7 hlklng taxes doe s not lower the budget deflclt it ralses it while there is much about the u s economy that economists cannot explain the cur rent recession is no mystery for nearly six months last year politicians debated which taxes they should raise this created u ncertainty in the financial markets lowered con sumer confidence and undermined investors faith in the future the prolonged debate resulted in the bush administration and congressional democrats agreeing to saddle workers consumers and businesses with the largest single year tax increase in americas history when combined with then enactment of costly new regulatory legis lation such as the clean air act and the americans with disabilities act this tax in crease was a body blow to an already fragile e conomy last two years but a strong economic recovery is unlikely in the absence of a pro growth tax package not all tax cuts however are created equal the wallop delay marginal rates rates reagans tax cuts for many amerlcans reducing the tax burden alone will not undo all the economic policy mistakes of the 2 tallon and gore downey tax bills are radically different fortunately lawmakers need only look back over the last fifteen years to determine which approach will work the economic boom of the 1 9 80s during the 1980s americans enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom reagans economic recovery tax act of 198 1 set the stage for this record expansion by reduc ing the tax penalty against business investment and sharply reducing in three stages income tax rates for individuals once the tax rate reductions were fully phased in the economy took off not only did reaganomics produce the longest expansion in americas peacetime history it did so while simultaneously reducing inflation a feat that many e conomists believed could not be accomplished reducing marginal tax rates along with regula tory relief and sound monetary policy proved to be a potent prescription for an ailing economy during the reagan boom inflation adjusted gross national product gnp rose 32 percent and median family income hit record levels thanks to the creation of twenty million new jobs the proportion of the u s population holding jobs reached a new record of 63 1 percent refuting critics when fmt proposed many critics r e jected the central tenet of reaganomics that lower marginal tax rates would increase incentives to work save and invest and thus would ignite an economic expansion that would improve the liv ing standards of all americans these critics maintained that increased government spending is the engine that drives the economy tax cuts by contrast were condemned as inflationary the record expansion with lower inflation which followed the reagan tax cuts conclusively refuted these critics broad statistics however do not present a complete picture of the economic situa tion in the 1980s the untold story is how low taxes benefitted those americans who traditionally had not enjoyed the hits of the countrys prosperity income levels for al m ost every demographic group had begun to decline sharply in the late 1970s but once reagans policies took hold the statistics reversed inflation adjusted median household income for black americans for instance jumped by 16 5 percent between 1982 and 1989 after declining by 10 2 percent between 1978 and 1982 women also realized sigdicant benefits from reaganomics their inflation ad justed median income climbed by more than 28 percent between 1981 and 1989 after declining by 2 9 percent between 1977 and 19 81 and while some critics maintain 1 economists continue to debate what year marks the beginning of reaganomics some say 1980 when reagan was elected president many use 1981 since that was the year that reagan actually took office others no te that the budget far fiscal 1981 already had been signed into law by jimmy carter before reagan was inaugurated reagans fmt budget was far fiscal 19 82 some economists contend however that reaganomics did not begin until 1983 the first year in whic h the tax rate reductions were fully phased in there is no completely accurate answer to this conmersy what is safe to say and is supported by the statistics cited in this study is that after beginning to decline in the late 1970s most measures of econ omic well being recovered in the early 1980s and improved dramatically throughout the decade 3 the 1990 that the poor suffered under reagan the average inflation adjusted income of the bot tom 20 percent of families rose 11 9 percent between 1982 and 19 8 9 by comparison the same income group saw their inflation adjusted incomes decline by 12 7 percent from 1978 to 1982 despite the economys spectacular performance during the 198os many lawmakers were determined to reverse reagans policies indeed almost f iom the moment the economic recovery tax act was signed into law in 198 1 lawmakers on capitol hill pushed for higher taxes succeeding on several occasions during the 1980s the ill ef fects of those tax hikes however were at least partially offset by further tax rate reduc tions included in the 1986 tax refom act as a result reduced tax rates helped as sure that the record economic expansion was still going strong when george bush was inaugurated in 1989 budget fiasco it did not take long for congre s s and the new administration to reverse many of reagans accomplishments a relatively small 5 6 billion tax increase in 1989 was followed by the 1990 budget summit agreement the uncertainty created by nearly six months of summit negotiations and the even t ual imposition of nearly 200 billion of new taxes over five years was a major cause of the recession just as tax cuts helped spark the longest peacetime expansion in americas history the largest tax increase in history helped bring the economy to a shu ddering halt supporters of the 1990 budget agreement which set spending and tax policies for 1991 and beyond claimed the tax hike was needed to reduce budget deficits then pro jected to exceed 150 billion in 19 91 opponents of the budget package war ned that budget summits in 1982 1984 1987 and 1989 all resulted in higher taxes ostensibly designed to reduce the deficit yet in every case the budget deficit rose the following year opponents also warned that a major tax increase would throw the econo my into recession they further predicted that congress simply would spend the new tax reve nues they were right the budget deficit climbed to nearly 300 billion in 1991 the fmt year of the agreement and is now projected to reach record 350 in billio n fiscal year 1992 largely thanks to recd increases in domestic spending and a sharp recession is expected permanently to lower living standards for all income classes compared to what they would have been had the economys growth not faltered ignoring hi s tory ironically even though the dismantling of reagans economic legacy ended the expansion and pushed the economy into recession some lawmakers assert that additional tax increases somehow will strengthen the economy other law makers apparently believ e that while congress should cut taxes for some americans it should raise taxes on others still other politicians argue that the best way to help poor citizens is to increase taxes on wealthier americans 2 see larry hunter the never ending recession th e wolf street journal september 19 1991 4 lawmakers who support these policies claim fairness requires income redistribu tion higher taxes and more government spending americas less fortunate citizens however historically have not fared well under suc h policies if lawmakers truly are in terested in helping the poor they should adopt policies to promote economic growth not redistribute income whether measured by job creation income growth the pov erty rate or any other indication of living standar d s and prosperity the poor have done best in years when the economy expands the choice for congress policy makers now face what should not be a difficult choice do they return to the pro growth policies of the 1980s or do they replicate the mistakes of the 1970s heap ing additional taxes and regulations on an economy already staggering under a record tax burden and an unprecedented wave of expensive regulation the lessons of the 1980s provide an easy answer lesson 1 economlc growth is the best weapon agalnst poverty many politicians in washington would like americans to believe that poverty can be cured by more federal programs in reality high increases in spending have had little impact on poverty and may have exacerbated the problem it was o nly after the so called war on poverty began in the mid 1960s that the poverty rate which had been falling rapidly and steadily since the early 1950s leveled off like other measures of economic distress the poverty rate began to rise in the late 1970s rising from 1 1 4 per cent in 1978 to 15 2 percent in 19 83 it began to fall however once reagans policies took effect dropping to less than 13 percent by 1989 3 26 20 15 10 6 os chart 1 1959 1990 americas poverty rate 010 1016 970 1976 1010 806 l0d o

routinely overestimate poverty in the united states it probably safe to assume however that changes in the poverty rate do reflect whether poverty is rising or falling even if the totals are

average house hold and family income statistics for the poorest fifth of the population indicate that low tax policies in the 1980s raised living standa r ds for less fortunate amen cans the incomes of poor households stagnated for much of the 1970s began to decline sharply in the late 1970s and rebounded only after reagans tax cuts were fully in place if the 1990 numbers are the beginning of a new trend it ap pears that high tax and spend policies under the bush administration will have the same damaging impact on ameri cans as jimmy carters biggovernment policies lesson 2 economlc growth is stlmulated by low taxes partlcularly low marginal tax rates while accepting that the economy grew in the 1980s some analysts assert that this prosperity had nothing to do with reagans policies in general and his tax cuts in particular some even claim that income levels for the poor would have increased faster had it not been for reaganomics yet after taking the effects of other economic factors into account the evidence still points clearly to low tax policies as the leading cause of record growth in the 1980s with the myriad forces that affect eco nomic growth there is no way to deter mine precisely the influence of any sin gle policy on the economy the great table 1 average income for poorest fifth of u s households in 1990 dollars i lncomeof chan eln i year households i

decision in 1932 to raise taxes in the middle of the economic downturn doubtlessly exacerbated the economys contraction but it can not be said w ith precision how much the tax increase contributed to the depression the economic decline which began in the late 1970s also was partially due to high taxes but other factors such as inflation and excessive government regulation of busi nesses contribut ed to the stagflation which plagued america similarly while the 6 bottom second middle year fifth fifth fifth 1978 82 8 2 5 4 5 2 lop 5 3 8 1 1 3 2 h percent fourth fifth is that if the rich get richer then the poor must become poorer this view of the world however is completely at odds with the evidence as table 2 indicates the fortunes of all income classes tend to rise or fall together the census bureaus household income statistics underscm john f kennedys contention that a rising tide lifts al l boats when the economy prospers the poor are just as likely to realize the benefits of economic growth as are those in higher income classes similarly if policy makers adopt anti growth policies for the stated purpose of helping the poor all incom e groups suffer the household income figures also indicate that the reagan years benefitted all in come classes even if the base year used is 1981 before the reagan tax cuts were phased in the figures show significant income gains for

overlooks one very important fact poorer americans incomes increased in real terms during the 1980s if a goal of policy makers is to improve living standards for the poor t h e reagan policy of reducing tax rates on the rich as well as the poor did more to improve the standard of living of low income households than the high tax pol icies of the carter and bush administrations lesson 4 if the aim is to make the rlch pay more taxes cut thelr tax rates critics of ronald reagan assert that tax rate cuts in the 1980s meant wealthy ameri cans paid less than their fair share of taxes indeed robert s mcintyre of citizens for tax justice a washington d c based research organiz a tion contends tax breaks for the rich during the 1980s are the sole cause of todays budget deficit yet the assump tions required to support this assertion border on the absurd to achieve his results mc intp takes 1977 tax rates and applies them to cur r ent income levels to determine the size of the tax cut received by the rich in other words his model just assumes that the economy would have expanded just as much had the top tax rate stayed at 70 per cent rather than being cut to 28 percent during th e reagan years the model also conveniently assumes that wealthier taxpayers would earn and report just as much income with 70 percent tax rates as they are projected to earn and report next year with tax rates at 31 percent not surprisingly internal revenue service statistics paint a very different picture according to irs data wealth ier americans are now paying a far larger share of the total tax burden today than they were before the reagan tax cuts as chart 2 meals the richest one percent of u s tax payers shouldered 27 5 percent of the total income tax burden in 1988 up from 17 6 percent in 198 1 the propartion of the income tax burden paid by the top five percent jumped from 35 1 percent in 1981 to more than 45 percent in 1988 chart 2 shar e of total federal income tax paid

confronted by t hese statistics some critics complain that the rich are paying a higher portion of the income tax burden only because their incomes rose so dramati cally during the 1980s when compared with those of other americans yet this is pre cisely what advocates o f low tax rates predicted would happen once marginal tax rates were reduced they said the incentive to work save and invest would increase while the amactiveness of tax shelters would be reduced as a result taxable income would increase significantl y moreover as lesson 3 explains this income gain did not come at the expense of other groups of americans incomes for all groups rose dur ing the 1980s lesson 5 ralslng taxes on the rlch does not help the poor with the economy in recession and the bu r den of federal taxes at an all time high according to the washington d c based tax foundation some policy makers finally have concluded that tax relief is needed for example senator albert gore of tennes see and representative thomas downey of new yo r k both democrats have intro duced legislation which would among other things lower taxes on families by creat ing an 800 tax credit for each child h r 2242 s 995 senator lloyd bentsen of texas and representative dan rostenkowski of illinois the d emocratic chairmen of the tax writing committees in each chamber are rummd to be drafting similar legisla tion that is the good news the bad news is that the gore downey legislation also raises the top income tax rate to 36 percent from todays 31 perce nt and imposes an additional 15 percent surtax on upper income taxpayers the combined effect of these two provisions would push mar ginal tax rates to more than 40 percent for certain taxpayers while this boost in the top rate allegedly is designed to promote fairness and offset the revenue loss caused by the tax credit for children neither goal will be satisfied if history is an accurate guide increasing the top tax rate by approximately one third as the gore downey bill would do means reducing sig nificantly the prospects for a strong recovery from the current recession as lesson 1 illustrated the poor axt most dependent on economic growth for their well being thus while the gore downey bill might in the short term benefit those taxpayers eligib l e for the tax credit the package would in the long term hurt lower income households because higher marginal tax rates mean economic growth would slow down fewer jobs would be created and living standanis would de cline supporters of the gore downey l e gislation fail to understand what has become so evident to the emerging democracies of eastern europe it is better to promote the creation of wealth than it is to attempt to redistribute it flawed calculations the gore downey redistribution legislation i s based in part on deeply flawed calculations used by the congressional budget office cbo the cbo uses estimates that predict higher tax rates will generate revenue to offset the losses to the treasury caused by the childrens credit but the static model used by the cbo assumes taxpayer behavior is unresponsive to changes in the tax code as a re sult even huge increases in tax rates are projected to raise large amounts of new tax revenue according to the cbo model practical experience refutes this las t years tax increase for instance initially was projected by cbo to raise nearly 200 billion in revenues by 1995 above and beyond 9 the revenue growth otherwise projected to occur recent cbo budget projections however now estimate that revenue in the 1991 1995 period will be lower than that projected for the same period in the summer of 1990 before last years tax increase was enacted the congressional budget office blames attributes this huge revision to economic and technical factors lesson 6 incr e ased social securlty taxes have wiped out the beneflts of despite the reductions in marginal tax rates enacted in 1981 and 1986 total federal tax rates the percentage of income paid to washington through direct taxation actu ally are higher today for m i ddle class americans than they were before ronald reagan became president meanwhile total federal tax rates have declined for the richest tax payers this has led some policy makers to condemn the reagan tax cuts as a giveaway to the rich at the expense of the poor federal income tax rates for all income classes were reduced by the reagan tax cuts and remain lower today than they were under the carter administration the reason total federal tax rates have increased for many taxpayers is because of rapi dly escalat ing payroll taxes in other words income tax rate reductions for many americans have been completely wiped out by increases in social security and medicare taxes to add insult to injury the social security system collects far more money tha n is needed to pay retirement benefits most americans assume the surplus funds are put into an ac count safely tucked away and drawing interest to help pay retirement benefits for fu ture generations in reality congress spends every penny of this money on other gov ernment programs leaving nothing but ious in the social security trust fund because wealthier taxpayers are less affected by rising payroll taxes since there is a cap on the amount of income subject to such taxes lower and middle income taxpay ers have been harmed disproportionately by rising payroll taxes the impartant ques tion of course is how to address this inequity some legislators apparently believe higher income taxes on richer taxpayers are the way to offset high tax rates o n the mid dle class these politicians overlook of course the fact that raising taxes on upper in come americans will do nothing to lower the payroll tax burden on less affluent citi zens the pro growth solution to high effective tax rates is to reduce social security pay roll taxes not only would the reduction in these tax rates spur additional economic l growth it would put an end to the fiction of the social security trust fund lesson 7 hlklng taxes does not lower the budget deflclt it ralses it perhaps the most important lesson of all to learn from the 1980s is that tax increases lead to higher rather than lower budget deficits tax increases were imposed on the american people in 1982 1984 1987 1989 and 19 90 on each occasion the legisla reagans tax cuts for many amerlcans 5 daniel j mitchell the facts about cutting social security taxes heritage foundation backgroundcr no 817 march 15 1991 10 tion was accompanied by prom ises that the money would be used for deficit reduction in every instance the deficit rose the following year the reasons for this are simple notwithstanding the congressional budget offices simplistic static model higher taxes inhibit economic grow th as a result even if a tax increase does bring in some additional revenue this new money rarely if ever reaches the level predicted when taxes first are raised this typical shortfall on the revenue side is compounded by the way in which the federal b udget process works congress bases its spending decisions on how much money it expects to receive so boosts in spending invariably outstrip rises in revenue after a tax increase thanks to this process last years budget deal turned a 150 billion deficit into 350 billion of red ink in just two years conclusion the impulse of many lawmakers to enact tax relief to counter the recession is under standable and sound what is difficult to understand however is why some lawmakers think the way to improve liv i ng standards for the poor is to raise taxes on the rich largely as a result of the 1990 budget summit a strong expansion was turned into a recession in a remarkably short period while some members of the bush administra tion claim that the president had to violate his promise not to raise taxes because con gress would have overridden his veto anyway there was no evidence before or after the budget summit to support this assertion the legislative branch in fact has never been able to raise taxes over the objection of a president6 by caving in to pressure for higher taxes the bush administration presented the big spenders in congress with a long awaited opportunity as long as the resident main tained his vow not to increase taxes the american people resisted the siren song of tax fairness but once the budget summit began and the president was persuaded by mem bers of his own administration to accept a tax increase many americans understand ably wanted the burden of any new taxes to fall on someone elses shoulders since few americans consider themselves wealthy regardless of their earnings and since few americans truly understand the relationship between tax rates and growth propos als to tax the rich tend to be popular with voters reaganomics as a hat to the growth of government for these lawmakers the 1981 tax cuts had to be repudiated to restore the pre reagan political dynamic now thanks to last years budget deal politicians once again can press for higher taxes and vote for more spend i ng under the guise of tax fairness and deficit reduction the 1990 budget summit also was a victory for those lawmakers who viewed 6 congress actually did enact a uuc increase over a presidential veto on one occasion franklin d roosevelt vetoed a tax inc r ease because it was not as large as he desired rather than vote for an even larger tax hike however congress overrode his veto 11 tragic cost the recession has imposed a tragic human cost two million ameri cans have lost their jobs the poverty rate i s climbing and family incomes are falling sadly the news may get worse yet under the deceptive rubric of tax fairness some lawmakers want to compound the damage of last years tax hike by further raising mar ginal tax rates as the last ffiteen years c learly show however the poor will not be helped by tax increases because the result will be slower growth choice for bush george bush already has presided over the slowest period of ece nomic growth of any president since franklin d roosevelts fust te r m whether the economy begins to recover may depend on what he does next if bush returns aggres sively to the pro growth policies of the 198os there is every reason to expect that the economy will respond as vigorously as it did during the reagan boom on the other hand if bush fails to make the case for low taxes and to veto any tax increase legisla tion america may face a decade of economic stagnation 12

menafn usa art news not so long ago we were approached by a large fmcg retail chain the company wanted to create a truly innovative service a people s digital convenience store which would work without sales halls queues and salespeople and the wezom team built the entire it ecosystem for such a store in an incredible three months anticipating the release we want to tell you how such projects are implemented and how they will affect retail in the not too distant future what is the darkstore we are used to visiting shopping malls and supermarkets as it is an integral part of our consumer culture but going to the supermarket is not always like a family walk among beautiful shelves of goods often shopping is simply tiring and irritating there are lines there is a race to the checkout with carts and there are cashiers in bad moods from retailers perspective traditional supermarkets also need to be optimized too much money is spent on renting space large staff and other retail costs businesses started looking for new approaches to retail and they found them one of the best ideas can be considered the concept of the darkstore a store without a real space which relies on online sales and courier delivery basically it s something in between a typical online store and a food delivery courier service like an amazon you place your order on the app or website and the courier delivers it to your door in 15 20 minutes it is believed that the darkstore format was invented in 2009 by british retailer tesco but then the idea was 10 years ahead of its time and the niche of such stores was still small recently the format has been reborn the general availability of smartphones and the pandemic have made it more relevant than ever similar startups are now growing rapidly in the uk jiffy germany gorillas and other countries around the world how we started creating a darkstore at the end of 2021 we had our first call with our new client a huge retailer team the retailer had already achieved impressive success having built a network of a hundred fmcg stores across the country in just three years however the client was not going to stop there and set an ambitious goal to create an innovative darkstore with products of daily demand which would conquer the market the client considered 2022 as a turning point in retail when the business would start a startup race during the post crisis economic recovery he needed a new darkstore platform as soon as possible we are not just talking about an online store but about a service with the shortest purchase cycle and super fast delivery the key point the customer must receive his order by courier in 15 minutes this can be achieved through the creation of an extensive network of small warehouse stores in the city limits which overlap almost any delivery address such a system requires well functioning logistics and a powerful digital ecosystem the project concept was detailed quickly it required a website and a mobile application for e commerce as well as an application for couriers these products had to be combined through a single darkstore backend and integrated with digital retail tools 1c accounting a customer management system crm and a warehouse management platform wms such a task could take a strong it team more than a year but based on our experience and expertise we contracted to do it within three months there was no time to speed up photo how the technology was chosen although the format of the service is innovative technically darkstore development does not require anything complicated all solutions for creating darkstores have been used in e commerce one way or another for a long time you just need to put them all together the site was developed through classic layout html css native javascript the cross platform mobile apps were made in flutter using bloc hive and dart the backend is written in php 8 1 laravel octane posgresql and redis are used for database management all these tools are familiar to our developers including from experience working on products for e commerce this allowed us to speed up the development process many times over how communication was managed this does not mean however that the team had nothing to do on the contrary deadlines were very tight and the team decided to abandon the usual practice of working in sprints breaking a three month project into sprints did not make sense and instead we formed a common task board that needed to be distributed among specialists and then we moved from stage to stage drawing and design approval for each individual product technical development creating presentations and managing quality control such development required constant daily communication between the team and the client for efficiency and responsiveness the team constantly had to clarify something to address issues on the integration of 1c and crm request access to resources and documents to find out the details of the business logic while developing the wezom team and the product manager on the client side became one team and this connection was maintained even after the war began although not without difficulties development challenges frequently the set tasks turned out to be much more complicated than they were initially imagined knowledge of technology didn t save the team from unexpected difficulties with the development of new modules api integration and third party tools the biggest challenge was mobile development the mobile app plays a central role in the dark store ecosystem since the overwhelming majority of users will be using the service from their smartphones the platform had to implement a complex ordering chain with various scenarios and consider numerous interconnections with the company s tools and databases integration of the api for google maps also caused certain difficulties which required serious work on geolocation what do we have now despite the technical difficulties and the war the development as a whole managed to meet the declared deadline due to obvious circumstances the project has been put on pause and its release is delayed for the future nevertheless as of today the product is technically ready for release it consists of three products darkstore website a mobile app for customers darkstore app courier app darkstore courier app let s take a closer look at each of them site successfully combines the capabilities of an online store and a corporate portal on its pages customers can view the product catalogue form their cart and place an order and specify the delivery address availability of goods is tied to a specific darkstore with a specific delivery zone in turn couriers can get employment information on the site and apply for an interview there is also a separate page for suppliers and distributors wishing to cooperate with the store the app is a good example of a modern darkstore mobile service in a nutshell it provides the same features as the website but also notifications the experience of using the app is something between a classic online store and a food delivery service after placing an order the user can monitor the status of his order in real time from processing and assembly to final delivery the courier app is a simple and effective delivery tool that any employee can quickly learn without any problems the platform gives the courier countless advantages mapping mobile notifications simple accounting and a personal account with a history of completed orders the delivery card contains not only the address but also the amount and method of payment the courier can immediately contact the recipient of the order and clarify the details all these products are units of the same chain they work through a common backend third party tools are also built into this chain google card apis and payment services 1c accounting tools crm and warehouse management the main objective of created ecosystem is to simplify users way to purchase and ensure that their order is delivered within 15 minutes the system may look simple but this impression is deceptive many of its functions rely on complex logic and their implementation has become a real challenge for the team for example each darkstore is a location with its area of coverage from specific streets which required point markings on the map it is very likely that the coverage zones will change in practice so it was important to edit them easily in addition each darkstore has its own current assortment which is important to update in real time it depends on which products right now can be found in the catalog of an individual user finally darkstores in different cities and locations will differ in terms of opening hours and delivery costs and the app needs to adequately present this logic why are darkstores influential of course traditional retail with physical stores is not going to disappear after all it is important for brands to attract attention and ensure their offline presence and customers appreciate the opportunity to see offline the goods they are interested in and often consider shopping as a weekend pastime however all this is more relevant for non food retail clothes electronics etc and to a lesser extent for everyday goods if we are talking about a weekday trip to the store for vegetables for the soup people are less willing to spend time on it and that makes the darkstore format a very promising model in addition it has more powerful advantages resilience to social upheaval the experience of the past three years has shown that the emphasis on business online provides him a good margin of safety in any situation physical stores can close because of another pandemic or military threats but online delivery in such situations continues to work as long as it is possible to provide its logistics reduced costs a traditional supermarket requires renting a spacious space in a busy location as well as equipment for the sales floor and merchandising in contrast to supermarkets darkstores can be equipped in compact and unpresentable warehouses darkstore warehouse as there will be no customers no guards and cashiers even the electricity bill will be lower this is an obvious opportunity to save money smart stock control darkstore vitally needs real time visibility into each warehouse s product inventory without it it s difficult to ensure the adequacy of the assortment in the application and the speed of delivery but it also helps the retailer dispose of products more rationally to increase inventory turnover and reduce losses among stock balances this is especially relevant in fmcg where goods have a limited shelf life simplicity of management traditional supermarket requires a large staff at the same time sales staff work in a stressful mode sometimes torn between the layout of goods control of the queue and questions of individual customers which is detrimental to service at the same time darkstore requires only an operator a picker and a few sorters of goods who will not be distracted by customers this avoids additional costs and makes much more efficient use of employees time the global economic crisis has slowed down the development of retail but it certainly hasn t stopped it as the market revives the online delivery market will grow rapidly and we will see a number of such startups in the coming years

pretty dull affair until 1982 when the market was just beginning to rise after fed chair paul volcker wrestled hyper inflation to the mat by raising rates up to 20 from 1979 to 1982 so to lure their 6 7 mvp to the meeting the kansas city fed decided to hold their 1982 annual meeting near a fishing spot volcker liked in jackson hole in the remote northwestern corner of the kansas city fed s district as it turns out missouri is headquarters for two of the fed s 12 districts with my favorite district st louis holding down the eastern half of the state they specialize in monetarist studies and historical charts with their fred database the kansas city district is more of a bucolic farm oriented district how did missouri capture two of the 12 fed district capitals elementary my dear wilson when the fed was born in 1913 the first year of democratic president woodrow wilson serving 1913 1921 the speaker of the house was champ clark a democrat from missouri the federal reserve system was opposed by james reed a powerful democratic missouri senator from kansas city who served on the senate banking committee so wilson s secretary of agriculture david f houston from st louis and one of the three members of the federal reserve bank organization committee and clark held out the plum of a federal reserve district for st louis and kansas city making reed and houston happy for the last 40 years paul volcker s fishing haven has become an annual getaway for central bankers with some of the most beautiful scenery above usually causing some reflection and thought about the future of central banking rather than some 8 minute rant about fixing the problems bankers have caused be that as it may this late august confab has become an annual rallying point for the stock market over the last 15 years since the world fell apart in 2007 09 but this year was an exception usually this pre labor day meeting in the rockies provided a boost the market needed especially under ben bernanke the 2010 jackson hole conference was held august 26 28 in his august 27 talk mr bernanke said that the pace of economic growth had been less vigorous than the fed was expecting and the pace of the u s job growth was painfully slow he also acknowledged that the fed was surprised by the sharp deterioration in the u s trade balance his solution was to revive the fed s late 2008 quantitative easing qe scheme the market loved this qe2 the s p rose from 1040 on the day of bernanke s jackson hole talk to 1363 the following april up over 30 the 2011 jackson hole conference was held august 25 27 during an especially volatile month in market history gold was soaring stocks were sagging at jackson hole chairman bernanke laid out the groundwork for another new fed monetary strategy called operation twist the details weren t announced until september 21 but then various fed governors hit the road to explain and defend their 400 billion operation to artificially flatten the yield curve the stock market loved operation twist the s p 500 rose over 26 from august 2011 to april of 2012 the 2012 jackson hole conference held august 30 to september 1 laid the groundwork for qe3 which was officially launched on september 13 bernanke s jackson hole remarks were more frank than usual first he said that the stagnant job market was of grave concern to the fed he also called current economic growth far from satisfactory and tepid because of this bernanke said that the fed will provide additional policy accommodation as needed this became qe3 which the market loved as the s p 500 rose over 17 from its august 2012 lows the 2013 jackson hole conference was held august 22 24 by then chairman bernanke was a lame duck so he let his replacement janet yellen speak in his place strangely she did not say much except as part of a panel since the skies were smoky around jackson hole due to all of the fires in idaho the inside joke was that jackson hole s skies reflected the foggy future of the fed especially since bernanke s hints of tapering uttered in may were spooking the markets in the end tapering failed to faze the market with the s p 500 rising 16 in the next 7 months ben bernanke made history with his qe helicopter money pronouncements in wyoming bernanke s time at the fed expired in january 2014 but here s his track record after the 2008 09 crash janet yellen and mario draghi continued to spread the benjamins around long after benjamin bernanke left the scene the benjamins kept pouring out of the fed chairperson janet yellen took her turn at the helm saying our goal is to help main street not wall street but she turned out helping both by keeping rates super low she encouraged many businesses to borrow money at low rates often to buy back more of their shares low rates also make home mortgages and vehicle loans more affordable reviving the housing and auto markets low rates also put a damper on the debt service portion of the federal budget even though low rates limit some fixed income investors in all ben bernanke and janet yellen kept the federal reserve s key short term interest rate the fed funds rate near zero officially in a range of zero to 0 25 for seven full years seven of president obama s eight years in office starting on december 16 2008 and lasting until december 16 2015 encompassing bernanke s final five jackson hole conferences and janet yellen s first two sessions there more importantly the 2014 jackson hole conference introduced modern monetary theory mmt into the conversation when european central bank president mario draghi indicated that he was worried about inflation staying too low for too long this laid the groundwork for europe s more virulent version of qe including negative interest rates starting in 2014 several rounds of quantitative easing qe seven years of zirp zero interest rate policy bolstered by modern monetary theory mmt now popular in washington dc and helicopter money bernanke s phrase has been a bold experiment in avoiding a greater depression and that sort of succeeded but the central bankers waited too long to return to normal after 2008 since the financial crisis of 2008 central bankers have bent over backward to be accommodating fighting any remote chance of a 1930s rerun this fear of deflation has caused central bankers to fuel too much inflation for too long before belatedly fighting back and that has put jerome powell in an obviously foul mood perhaps he is angry at himself and other central bankers and justifiably so but his friday temper tantrum caused a wall street panic the stock market may not bottom this year until september or early october if history is any guide so we may have a rocky road ahead this does not mean sell stocks i may be wrong and it s better to weather any market panic or switch sectors than to sell all stocks the full weight of quantitative tightening qt or 95 billion per month taken out of circulation from the fed s balance sheet could have the opposite effect of qe i e radically lower inflation by year s end as i predicted at the start of 2022 this could put upward pressure on bond yields which could test the resolve of international t bond buyers is the u s still the global capital oasis yes i think it still is so as we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first jackson hole meeting with a mini replay of the first one when paul volcker faced down runaway inflation with monster tightening we should remember what happened next august 1982 was also the birth of a monster bull market rising 15 fold in 17 years

finley martin 14 gets a shot of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine at the first baptist church of pasadena may 14 2021 in pasadena calif ap photo marcio jose sanchez file washington the biden administration is seeking tens of billions of dollars in emergency funds as part of the upcoming short term spending bill lawmakers will take up this month ranging from more military aid to ukraine to heating and cooling assistance for low income households administration officials laid out the new requests totaling 47 1 billion on friday ahead of the long labor day weekend congress reconvenes next week to start working on stopgap funding legislation on which president joe biden s signature is required before oct 1 in order to avert a partial government shutdown the largest individual piece of the white house proposal seeks 22 4 billion to cover ongoing needs associated with the covid 19 pandemic office of management and budget director shalanda young said in a blog post that additional funds are needed to restart a suspended program that sent free at home testing kits to u s households and help prepare for a potential fall surge of the covid 19 request 18 4 billion would go to the department of health and human services and 4 billion would support global efforts to contain and treat the pandemic republicans have blocked additional supplemental funds for covid 19 response efforts including a 10 billion installment earlier this year arguing unspent pandemic aid should be repurposed instead the administration ended up taking the 10 billion from other pots of money as we ve been clear with members of congress for months every dollar of covid response is either obligated being executed or planned for specific purposes the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said on a conference call if they do not give us the funding we have asked for it will force us to make very difficult trade offs and pull from existing planned uses to meet the needs of the american people the administration is also seeking 4 5 billion to battle the spread of the monkeypox virus with 600 million of that total devoted to international efforts ukraine would receive 11 7 billion under the white house proposal with 7 2 billion in military aid including for replenishment of u s weapons and equipment stocks sent to help combat russian aggression and 4 5 billion in direct budget support to the ukrainian government young said about two thirds of previously appropriated funds have been spent with the remainder expected to run out by the end of september we have rallied the world to support the people of ukraine as they defend their democracy and we cannot allow that support to ukraine to run dry young wrote in her blog post a separate 2 billion is intended to offset domestic energy cost increases as a result of the ukraine conflict including funds to purchase uranium for u s nuclear reactors and to shore up the strategic petroleum reserve which the administration has been tapping to help ease gasoline price rises finally the white house is calling on congress to attach 6 5 billion in emergency disaster assistance as communities across the country continue to cope with the aftermath of floods hurricanes drought and more the federal emergency management agency s main disaster relief fund would get 2 9 billion to help with short term needs arising from recent flooding in kentucky and other disasters that may strike early in the next fiscal year the agriculture department would get 1 9 billion to provide direct payments to farmers and ranchers who ve lost crops and livestock and the department of housing and urban development would receive 1 4 billion in longer term recovery funding for disasters that struck last year in louisiana california and texas the proposal also asks lawmakers to add 500 million for low income heating and cooling assistance as households cope with higher utility prices and 150 million to help improve the resilience of the electric grid an administration official said the funding proposals shouldn t require offsets and are similar to items funded by members of both parties previously this is emergency funding and we believe congress should provide it that way again he said as part of the white house requests to capitol hill administration officials also laid out what special adjustments to regular spending known as anomalies would be required as part of the continuing resolution or cr the house is writing a bill that s expected to extend programmatic funds generally at current year spending rates through dec 16 but in many cases the current funding level will be outdated fall short of what agencies say their most critical needs are and prevent new projects from getting started during the period they are operating under the stopgap measure the white house is also seeking several legislative changes in certain programs authorizations this package of technical assistance provides guidance to lawmakers on funding and legislative adjustments that are necessary to avoid disruptions to a range of important public services young wrote in her blog post provisions sought by the white house include a package of changes intended to pave the way for afghan nationals paroled into the u s to obtain green cards as well as continue to receive benefits such as resettlement assistance and access to food stamps and medicaid other anomalies include changes that would make available higher rates of funding for fema s diaster aid account and to help the agency provide emergency food and shelter for migrants entering the u s at the southern border at the same time immigration and customs enforcement would be able to spend more on detention transportation and removal driven by emerging needs along the southern border the transportation security administration would get a higher rate of funding for airport staffing without which the administration estimates a high risk of increased wait times for passengers this upcoming holiday season as well as safety problems other provisions requested would appropriate 1 8 billion for hhs to help care for unaccompanied children crossing the border citing among other needs an increased number of cuban entrants provide the centers of disease control and prevention 3 million to replenish a fund it uses to inspect cruise ships in order to control the spread of gastrointestinal illnesses establish a waiver for aid caps that would take effect and cut off funds for the south carolina national heritage corridor and the illinois and michigan canal national heritage corridor extend by an extra year statutory authorities that provide physical protection and personal security for two years to former pentagon officials after they leave the agency lawmakers will decide whether to include those and other requested anomalies during the next few weeks as the house takes up its short term stopgap bill which will need 60 votes to clear the evenly

los angeles california the u s national weather service said a record breaking heat wave is expected to hit california this week adding that over the labor day weekend temperatures will rise to 115 degrees fahrenheit 46c in the state s inland valleys and 100 degrees along the coast excessive heat warnings were issued highlighting the risk of heat related illness for people exposed to prolonged outdoor heat as well as to livestock eric kurth meteorologist with the national weather service s sacramento office said it is not uncommon to get some hot temperatures during the labor day period but this is an extraordinary heat event as reported by reuters in addition to extreme weather and an ongoing drought just two weeks ago there was a prolonged period of high temperatures throughout the state the heat in california will gradually build up throughout the week and hit the south of california before scorching the northern regions over the long holiday weekend the national weather service said temperatures could reach all time highs in many parts of the state including the state capital sacramento where temperatures reached 113 degrees this week sarah rogowski meteorologist and emergency response specialist with the national weather service s regional office in utah said the heat wave is also expected to affect other parts of the west including washington state idaho montana and oregon
the french president emmanuel macron recently warned that the western world had reached the end of the age of abundance he did not specify at what date or at what hour this singular event occurred but with strict rules coming into place in france and elsewhere in europe and california for use of electricity apparently the age of lacking has already begun advertisement the french president would appear to be the heir apparent in the line from thomas robert malthus through paul ehrlich that posited that the world cannot sustain so many people and catastrophic events including mass starvation and death must necessarily ensue the failure of malthusian predictions to come true has always been the result of applied technology malthus predictions and those of ehrlich were based on static views of society and its capabilities they never could factor in large increases in crop yields or better hygiene yet when better methods of farming became available the inevitable famines and mass death never occurred one would expect the same to be true of president macron s somber declaration but the one difference is that today s society refuses to deploy all of the technology at its disposal two years ago the united states was energy independent for the first time in decades the us produced huge amounts of gas and oil and cheap energy prices led to large growth in energy intensive businesses and lower prices for consumers for everything from eggs to cars with the rise of the ideological biden administration coupled with a green focused europe the western world faces a very serious energy shortage completely the result of political and ideological choices made in the name of a supposed energy emergency in california all future cars sold will be based on anything other than gasoline yet within a week officials told residents not to charge their electric cars due to an extreme lack of electricity in the state this would be high comedy coming out of hollywood if it did not mean that many people who bought into the green dream may find themselves as stuck at home as they were during the height of the covid lockdowns in europe business signs go off between 1 am and 6 am to save electricity citizens are encouraged to use fans and not air conditioners as natural gas stocks are low due to russian actions with the nordstream pipeline europeans are looking at the prospect of a very cold and miserable winter germany is already planning public buildings where people can go to warm up this is from a first world country the price of electricity on the continent has gone up exponentially but why is there an energy shortage yes does there have to be an energy shortage no macron is no more right than malthus was but he has the ideological support to keep energy out of the reach of citizens and truly realize his world lacking abundance it is by choice that the us england and other countries that harbor large amounts of gas choose not to frack and extract it europe could solve its problems by generating more electricity from nuclear which used to be the backbone of french and german power production the us could increase gas and oil production to drive down fuel prices guarantee enough heating oil for winter and provide europe the liquid natural gas it needs to make up for losses from russia the europeans could also push ukraine to settle its war with russia to return regular gas flows from russia if they can t wean themselves off of russian gas but in all cases these steps are not taken and not because of any technological limitation but solely due to ideological considerations from the supposed climate emergency to the desire to punish putin even if it means germans freezing to death in their apartments when the netherlands attempted to enforce the world economic forum wef policy of reduced nitrogen fertilizers it was based on the same thinking regarding potential damage to the environment dutch farmers their livelihoods and their herds be damned but is there really a climate emergency that for the first time in history checkmates technology that could make life better and more comfortable as a scientist i do not see enough data to truly suggest that human activity is the driver of any change in climate natural phenomena play much larger and more powerful roles in climate and human contributions are small compared to them but for the sake of argument let s pretend that everything that know nothings like john kerry and prince charles spout is true the fact that the chinese and the indians having the two largest populations in the world are not reducing their emissions means only one thing the pain and destruction that the west is willfully forcing upon its populations will have no impact on total carbon emissions those two countries alone are building on average a new coal fired electricity generating plant every two weeks they are determined to move as much of their poor population into the middle class and offer them cars air conditioners and the comforts of modern life that president macron claims are now gone so even if there was a climate emergency western self destruction will lead to barely a rounding error in any change in gas emissions and distant future temperature changes advertisement instead of it being an end to the age of abundance maybe it should be an end to the age of politicians and their enablers who put their people on the altar of the green new deal but personally feel no pain do you think that mr macron will not have air conditioning in the élysée palace or any of the wonderful delicacies to which he is accustomed didn t president obama buy two houses just next to the oceans that are supposed to devour them didn t steven spielberg and other hollywood stars put millions of pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through their truly unnecessary private planes my feeling is that if g d has given a person wealth he should enjoy it big house on the beach a private plane for traveling with comfort and ease but don t lecture us on our barbecues air conditioners and suvs the end of abundance is meant for us and certainly not for them as my kids always point out people voted for these people whose incompetence and rigid ideology have led to supply chain disruptions sky high energy prices painful inflation and now energy shortages if you wish again to enjoy the abundance that comes with cheap energy which is available the time has come to vote and choose only those candidates who want to make your life better and not poorer and more miserable

with the chinese stock market in turmoil earlier this month orville schell arthur ross director of the center on u s china relations wrote about the dramatic crash for the guardian why china s stock market bubble was always bound to burst schell was one of the first american journalists to chronicle china s stock markets here s a piece he wrote with todd lappin for the nation in 1992 about the birth of the shanghai stock exchange the editors until recently the pujiang hotel on shanghai s waterfront was distinguished only by its sooty exterior grimy windows and gloomy interior decor of dark wood paneling and peeling plaster during the 1920s when the building was known as the astor house it had been one of the most deluxe hotels in china but when the people s liberation army marched into shanghai in 1949 the fortunes of the astor house fell into a spiral of decline and its liveried doormen elegantly appointed rooms and french restaurant with palm garden were soon no more than a distant and almost unimaginable memory on december 19 1990 the waning fortunes of the pujiang took a sudden turn for the better when a caravan of limousines arrived at the main entrance and disgorged a procession of luminaries the likes of which the hotel had not seen for almost half a century included in the retinue of 500 high ranking dignitaries were zhu rongji shanghai s mayor at the time and currently a vice premier huang ju the vice mayor liu hongru vice minister of china s state commission for restructuring the economy lady lydia dunn chairwoman of hong kong s trade and development bureau and an assortment of foreign investment specialists to enthusiastic applause the distinguished visitors ceremonially unveiled a brass plaque marking the hotel s rebirth as the home of the shanghai securities exchange china s first national computerized stock exchange during this milestone event mayor zhu gave a speech in which he reminded the assembled guest that even after the turmoil of 1989 china had refused to abandon its policy of modernizing and opening up to the outside world and he promised that the city of shanghai would continue to reform its financial institutions as a crucial part of its own modernization drive minutes later the opening gavel came down in one of the pujiang s refurbished ballrooms and 100 red waistcoated brokers sitting at computer equipped desks arrayed around a new electronic big board began their first day of securities trading long before december 19 however word had spread to other chinese cities that shanghai was about to open a stock exchange and the news created no small amount of envy almost every other competing center of trade and commerce it seemed was vying for a full fledged exchange of its own and on december 18 1990 a day before the exchange in shanghai officially opened the shenzhen special economic zone just across the border from hong kong in south china s guangdong province boldly decided to jump the gun without receiving prior sanction from beijing shenzhen officials unilaterally announced plans to convert the city s over the counter stock market to an open exchange party leaders in beijing were infuriated by this defiant act fearful that they might soon face challenges from other insurgent stock markets around the country they moved quickly to control this unprecedented rebellion at the same time however officials in the capitol helped to avoid an open confrontation that might lend to an ugly showdown with guangdong province one of the most economically powerful and independent minded regions in all of china the main proponent of this dramatic change in economic practices was none other than deng xiaoping himself beijing finally decided to defuse the situation by allowing shenzhen to become an open exchange if the city would agree to postpone the official opening of its new market until spring such a compromise enabled the party s central planners to maintain the appearance that they were still controlling china s economic reforms which had languished after the 1989 beijing massacre before again gathering momentum in late 1990 since the new shenzhen securities exchange had already coronated itself by hanging a brass plaque outside its offices after the compromise was reached local authorities had to hastily cover it up with a piece of red cloth until after the official opening at the time few chinese were aware of the struggle between beijing and shenzhen but the conflict underscored the tensions that were developing between china s central government and regional authorities as deng xiaoping s economic reforms allowed localities to seize more and more responsibility for their own economic destiny i when the doors of the shanghai exchange swung open on the first day of business only seven listings were available for trading and most of them were unexciting fixed interest bonds by the close of 1991 the two big boards in shanghai and shenzhen offered only fifteen and seventeen listings respectively these were but a tiny fraction of the more than 3 000 issues that chinese enterprises were already selling to their employees and over the counter investors throughout the country but given the government s discomfort with both the idea of selling off the heart and soul of its industrial infrastructure and the disorganization that reigned in china s incipient financial markets few state owned enterprises in the public sector were allowed to issue shares on the new exchanges instead most of the companies listed on the exchanges were collective enterprises despite having cloned this capitalist gene onto china s socialist chromosome government regulators at the bank of china still tried to limit the amount of securities these enterprises could sell to private investors as distinguished from government entities in order to maintain the appearance that china still had a socialist economy in which state ownership predominated nonetheless by the end of 1991 the shanghai market alone had already registered 100 000 official individual investors double the number of the previous year while nobody had any idea how many more private punters had purchased shares in the numerous joint stock companies not officially listed on the exchanges that proliferated as a result of deng s economic reforms the government s concern about this increasingly chaotic and unregulated market had been one of the main incentives for officials in beijing to establish the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges in the first place however by permitting such financial markets to become a legitimate part of china s socialist market economy the government was in effect admitting that the old system of state ownership centralized planning and government subsidies had failed surprisingly the main proponent of this dramatic change in economic practices was none other than deng xiaoping himself as an economic pragmatist deng recognized that the economic retrenchment program undertaken after the beijing massacre and intended to bring china s 20 to 30 percent inflation rate under control had left government coffers badly depleted he was also painfully aware that 20 percent of the state s annual revenues were being used to prop up the more than 60 percent of all state owned industries that were unable to turn a profit deng knew that in the long run the government simply could not continue to bear the burden of such massive subsidies without running up increasingly large and dangerous budget deficits there were only three alternatives force these overstaffed undercapitalized and technologically backward industrial behemoths into bankruptcy try to find foreign joint venture partners or let them finance themselves as joint stock companies although government officials had advocated eliminating the worst of these state owned enterprises by declaring them bankrupt in fact a provisional bankruptcy law had even been passed in 1986 marxist die hards found the idea of forcing workers out of their jobs even more repugnant than the notion of creating capitalist style stock markets most party officials remembered all too clearly what had happened in poland after dissatisfied workers formed the independent labor union solidarity and rose up against that country s communist regime in 1980 and they had little desire to contract the polish disease which would force them to quell a new round of protests by angry and economically disfranchised members of the chinese proletariat memories of how workers had poured into the streets to join forces with demonstrating students during the last weeks of the 1989 protest movement were the stuff of party nightmares starting small the idea of selling securities as a way of generating capital was not entirely unheard of in the people s republic china had been experimenting with financial markets since 1981 when beijing first issued a series of treasury bills to finance the country s modernization drive after the economic debacle of the cultural revolution the symbolic nature of this initial break with maoist economic theory which categorically rejected any form of national debt was extraordinarily significant and the t bills quickly presaged the introduction of other capitalist style financial instruments before long ambitious rural collectives cash starved local governments and even a few state owned enterprises were issuing stocks and bonds themselves and ordinary chinese were embracing these new investment opportunities with enthusiasm soon thousands of businesses were selling securities to their employees while others began hawking stocks and bonds to private investors on city street corners to impose some semblance of order upon this ad hoc trading network in 1986 beijing authorized the manchurian city of shenyang to set up china s first stock market the name sounded grandiose but this initial exchange was really only a single cashier s window in a local bank office where the prices of a few fixed interest government approved bonds were listed on a blackboard hanging on the wall next the cities of beijing wuhan tianjin canton chongqing guangzhou harbin and shenzhen received permission to set up their own local markets and with little prompting hordes of small investors flocked to take advantage of what seemed like high rates of return compared with the relatively low interest rates derived from bank savings accounts china s new securities markets gained additional momentum after october 1987 when the thirteenth national communist party congress concluded that shareholding was a legitimate form of property distribution in socialist enterprises with this high level nod of approval china s economic reformers moved to expand the country s financial markets even further and by march 1989 they had set up a stock exchange executive council to study the question of solidifying the regulation and organization of china s future securities exchange system the council assembled a staff that included several bright young foreign trained chinese economists and legal experts who had experience on wall street to design the financial markets of socialism with chinese characteristics as deng had taken to calling china s polyglot economic system a month after the council was formed however protesting students flooded into tiananmen square in the immediate aftermath of the beijing massacre plans to expand china s nascent stock markets were abruptly shelved with conservative central planners exercising control over the government s economic policy offices once again efforts to encourage state enterprises to privatize and sell shares much less create a nationwide securities exchange became ideologically taboo had it not been for deng xiaoping s steadfast support for the reformist cause it s unlikely that the notion of economic liberalization would have survived the crisis of 1989 at all deng was hardly an advocate of liberal democracy but his enthusiasm for china s grand experiment with crypto capitalist market mechanisms remained steadfast equally important after seven decades of experience within the fractious party leadership deng had mastered the art of discerning how and when to move against his political rivals deng s great leap in january 1992 china s 87 year old paramount leader made one of his boldest moves since launching his reform program in 1978 having avoided public appearances for more than a year deng took off on an unexpected pilgrimage to the glittering symbol of china s economic miracle shenzhen s thriving special economic zone in his characteristically terse way deng proclaimed that the importance of shenzhen s experience was the courage to blaze new trails as if to underscore exactly what he had in mind deng then paid tribute to shenzhen s new securities exchange are such things as securities and stock markets good or bad he rhetorically asked the group of high ranking guangdong provincial officials who accompanied him on the trip is there any danger in adopting such things can they only exist under capitalism cannot they also be adapted to socialism for marxists these were questions of a very complex and delicate theoretical nature but deng had ready answers a planned economy does not equal socialism because planning also exists in capitalism he said a market economy does not necessarily equal capitalism because the market also exists in socialism in order to make socialism superior to capitalism we must boldly take heed of and absorb all the accomplishments of civilization that the human race has achieved including all the advanced modes of operation and management developed by other countries what relation did this sweeping redefinition of socialism have to china s infant stock markets people should be allowed to keep observing but in the meantime resolute action must be taken to experiment with such things deng proclaimed with these words deng instantly removed any uncertainty about his own position regarding the expansion of organized financial markets in china predictably reformers welcomed his call for bold experimentation while orthodox marxists found such comments deeply vexing to blunt the impact of deng s pronouncements they moved to limit media coverage of his southern hegira however after a month of behind the scenes manipulations deng s allies in the central committee finally managed to transmit the text of his speeches throughout the country as an official party document the effect was instant and galvanic instead of running their usual barrage of editorials warning against the omnipresent dangers of bourgeois liberalization and peaceful evolution terms that hard liners were using in reference to foreign influences they considered noxious the official press suddenly bloomed with encomiums about the miraculously curative powers of financial markets to rescue china s ailing state owned industries from irreversible decline in late february even the normally conservative people s daily finally weighed in with an editorial calling for utilization of the useful aspects of capitalism arguing that it is ridiculous to label all measures used by capitalist countries as solely capitalist and refuse to accept them by march the paper was also proclaiming that active and prosperous financial markets will bring the country innumerable benefits although the editors warned against the practice of blindly developing stock markets they nonetheless echoed deng s call for chinese to boldly make experiments and breakthroughs in implementing shareholding systems so that a joint stock economy can serve our socialist construction for now deng had won in his struggle with the old guard the rapid change in the official media s attitude toward the notions of accelerated reform and expanding chinese capital markets was so abrupt that it almost seemed as if some mind altering gas had been added to china s air supply even for the reformers the benediction of china s two new securities exchanges by the party s paramount leader was a shift that took some getting used to after all china was still ruled by the same people s government that had so self righteously closed down the shanghai stock market after liberation in 1949 permitting such an institution to become an important part of china s new economy raised the embarrassing question of what socialism meant if a purportedly socialist state allowed an indolent class of speculators rentiers and coupon clippers to live off the toil of the proletariat deng xiaoping however has never been much interested in such theoretical issues his putative 1979 statement that black cat or white cat it s a good cat if it catches mice is not only his most famous utterance but to this day remains the most apt summation of his ideological pragmatism when forced to choose between marxist leninist orthodoxy and a series of economic reforms that might prolong the life of the country s much vaunted people s democratic dictatorship deng made the obvious choice people s republic capitalism in march china s politburo confirmed deng s triumph over the hard liners saying that to judge whether something is socialist or capitalist will depend mainly on whether it will benefit the development of productive forces under socialism the enhancement of comprehensive national strength of our socialist country and the promotion of the living standard of the people for the sake of appearances party theoretical cosmeticians were called in to give this new great leap forward a semblance of congruity with the marxist canon the tenuous lines of argument they constructed to justify such a dramatic policy reversal attested to the difficulty of their assigned task a tangerine growing in southern anhui is called a tangerine but the same fruit is called an orange if it grows in northern anhui rationalized one commentary in xinhua ribao during early may the same object may have different characteristics in different social environments securities and stocks are capitalist in a capitalist society and are used by capitalists to exploit workers but they can however be socialist under a predominantly socialist environment as deng s new line was publicized no one proved more enthusiastic about the idea of trading in stocks and bonds than ordinary chinese many of whom demonstrated their approval by stampeding down to brokerage houses to get in on the anticipated windfall profits the small number of initial listings did nothing to deter these eager new investors from queuing up by the tens of thousands to get a piece of the action in fact it only seemed to increase their eagerness motivating many to wait outside the new trading houses for hours on end like teenage fans hoping to get tickets to a performance by a popular rock group of course relatively few of these would be investors had a very sophisticated understanding of how financial markets actually work much less an awareness of the downside risks of securities trading most simply reasoned that since deng himself had anointed the exchanges with his blessing stocks and bonds must be a good thing something like putting money into a savings account only considerably more lucrative and with one of the highest savings rates in the world china was a financier s dream during 1992 the country s savings rate was running somewhere around 30 percent creating an underutilized investment pool of 1 3 trillion yuan 260 billion that had no place to go other than low yield bonds and bank savings accounts for chinese hoping to find new and lucrative places to put their money the shenzhen and shanghai exchanges seemed like a godsend especially since the incredible demand for securities caused the value of most shares to skyrocket as soon as they were listed investors may not have understood the vagaries of price earnings ratios but they quickly recognized that instant fortunes could be made when a share price doubled in value almost overnight an occurrence that was suddenly not uncommon among the lucky investors who bought stock in the eleven companies listed on the shanghai exchange during november 1991 most paid roughly 7 000 yuan 1 400 for 2 000 shares by august 1992 however these same 2 000 shares were worth somewhere between 30 000 and 50 000 yuan with returns such as these it was hardly surprising that ordinary chinese were quickly seized by stock exchange fever by the end of last winter the demand for the limited number of listed issues had become so great that officials in shanghai found themselves overwhelmed by the huge crowds flocking to the trading counters each day to solve the problem shanghai authorities adopted a system of numbered tickets similar to the one used at busy delicatessens in the united states but rather than entitling an investor to actually buy securities these so called share purchase certificates each of which cost 30 yuan 6 merely allowed buyers to enter a lottery in which only those lucky enough to have their number drawn were entitled to register with a brokerage office and purchase a limited quantity of securities the system was hardly an unqualified success brokers immediately found themselves inundated by massive crowds of people trying to buy coveted share purchase certificates investors were so determined not to be left out that many even camped out overnight to secure a good place in line of course it didn t take long before speculators and liumang or petty gangsters and hoodlums realized that there was just as much money to be made by selling these certificates on the black market as there was in trading stocks and bonds themselves lines in shanghai quickly became packed with fast buck artists as tens of thousands of people brought with them folding chairs bedding supplies of food canteens of water fans portable radios umbrellas and even their children as they waited for a chance to buy a share purchase certificate in shenzhen where a similar system was introduced fist fights broke out and two men were even murdered as gang members fought over positions in line public security bureau police had to step in to restore order certificates that originally cost 30 yuan sold on the black market for 1 400 yuan 280 a premium of more than 4 000 percent and this free for all of speculation was not limited to the illegal sale of certificates the market for the securities themselves was so hot that scalpers in the streets also began hawking black market shares at vastly inflated prices of the lucky few who were able to get certificates and then reach shanghai stock counters many were disappointed to find that not only was the total number of shares they could buy limited but there were only a few companies whose stock was for sale when they were finally able to buy as one chinese friend put it the long wait reminded me of the days when we used to have to line up like russians at food stores and then buy whatever happened to be available in the market at that moment up up and away in the middle of april 1992 a frisson went through the shanghai market when a sudden downward correction created what one chinese financial columnist a new breed of journalist for the p r c characterized as a wave of frenetic trading for many chinese who imagined that the market only went up it was a rude surprise to help cushion the shock of such unpleasant corrections the government took to printing a cautionary message alongside the stock quotations in shenzhen papers that said the stock market involves risks however this benign admonition seemed to have no more effect than the cancer warnings by the u s surgeon general on cigarette packages as a bull market began again chinese were in no mood to listen to the voice of prudence indeed the craze to invest on the shanghai exchange only gathered more momentum than ever in may when officials removed the regulations that had previously controlled the amount a share price could move up or down on any given day on may 21 alone during the first day of trading under the liberalized rules 417 000 shares with a total value of 180 million yuan 36 million changed hands this was twice the volume of the day before and it made the index skyrocket to double the previous week s already record high weekly stock reports about this bullish market drove price earnings ratios through the roof in shenzhen the ratios rose to the high 80s while in shanghai they climbed to the 300s one chinese issue even reached a ratio of 500 to 1 a spread that was worthy of a place in the guinness book of records according to one chinese reporter of course these staggering price earnings ratios had nothing to do with the soundness or profitability of the issuing companies on hong kong s hang seng index for example ratios remained at less than twenty to one for most stocks in china the dramatic spread stemmed from one simple fact officially listed securities were in short supply while buyers were not fearful that the market was losing all sense of reality authorities intervened in late may to reimpose some trading limits when combined with widespread rumors that the exchange was preparing to list thirty four new share offerings news immediately sent the volatile market tumbling by june 1 sell orders were pouring into shanghai in such volume that brokers were forced to open an annex in a city square to handle the deluge of agitated investors who wanted out but before they had handled even 600 orders security police lost control of the more than 5 000 people trying to shove their way up to the trading counters and the annex had to be shut down when panicky officials scrapped the restrictions the market regained some of its lost ground but the frenzy hardly abated just a few days later two people were killed and twenty more were injured when tens of thousands of crazed investors mobbed a shanghai sports stadium where shares were being distributed the shenzhen exchange was hardly more stable in the beginning of june the shenzhen index plunged when the government announced that it was going to look into allegations concerning illegal speculation by financial institutions involved in the securities trade things leveled off somewhat by july but by then the weekly graphs charting the precipitate ups and downs of the two new exchanges were as jagged and saw toothed as a profile of the high sierras contributing to the volatility of the situation was the absence of an overarching government agency similar to the u s securities and exchange commission uniform accounting procedures or a business law to provide a juridical framework for enterprises planning to issue shares technically it was the responsibility of the bank of china to regulate the sale of securities but china s new financial markets were creating such a sensation that it often seemed as if nobody was in control what made investors so crazed was the fact that in the spring of 1992 after deng s trip south both the shenzhen and shanghai markets repeatedly soared to new heights meaning that there was plenty of money to be made despite all the ups and downs between december 1991 and july 1992 the shanghai index rose from just above 100 to over 1 200 before settling at around the 800 level in shenzhen the index rose from 120 to almost 300 before leveling off at around 275 by june 1992 more than 360 000 investors had purchased shares on the shenzhen exchange and this number was growing by approximately 20 000 each month during the bullish first half of 1992 the total value of transactions on the two exchanges was 5 2 billion yuan 1 billion based on a volume that was five times higher than the total for the entire preceding year simultaneously enthusiasm for investing in securities had spread throughout the country and chinese were reported to be holding a total of some 60 billion yuan 12 billion worth of notes by august eighty three of the shanghai exchange s 103 trading members were based outside the city by september the number of seats had risen to 212 a figure that was expected to grow to more than 600 in the near future popular excitement about the new stock exchanges remained so great that shanghai officials had to delay the listing of twenty six newly approved stocks because officials had not yet figured out how to cope with the physical bulk of all the cash that the nearly 1 million shanghai investors who held share purchase certificates were expected to bring to the market they were also fearful that this new infusion of shares might spark a crash by altering the chemistry of scarcity that had driven prices so high the stuff of dreams capital hungry enterprise managers ecstatically welcomed this investor interest in securities and cheered government plans calling for more than half of all state owned industries to convert to a shareholding system within the next five years for them the thought of issuing shares and being able to raise unheard of amounts of cash almost overnight seemed like divine providence by the same token many chinese whose work units had previously forced them to buy bonds through payroll deductions in lieu of their full salaries during the post 1989 economic retrenchment also underwent a sudden conversion with regard to their compulsory investments by becoming shareholding companies firms can help their employees become rich because share prices on the local stock market keep rising a staff reporter with china daily wrote breathlessly in several well publicized cases such as that of the shanghai special steel tubing company he was absolutely right when the company was first listed on the shanghai exchange on may 25 employees were stunned to learn that the shares they owned had risen 471 percent during the day s trading yielding an average windfall profit of some 20 000 yuan 4 000 for each worker and it was not difficult for other chinese to imagine that the streets would soon be paved with gold when they heard the story about the yuyuan company whose stock sold for only 100 yuan 20 when it was initially listed but which by the middle of march had shot up to 4 329 yuan 865 tales such as these were the stuff from which new and fantastic chinese dreams were being made as confirmed by a survey conducted in july by people s daily which revealed that almost one fifth of china s 1 2 billion people were thinking about buying into the stock market in today s shanghai everything related to stocks is in great demand one shanghai securities exchange broker told the new china news agency tiny radios that tuned in to special stock reports became all the rage among investors as radio stations and television channels rushed to include market reports in their daily broadcasts a special twenty four hour phone number was established in shanghai to provide around the clock quotations while several hotels in the vicinity of the pujiang opened special stock exchange saloons where market devotees could hang out and swap hot tips although the cover charge at such establishments was a hefty 30 yuan 6 or about a tenth of an average worker s monthly salary the saloons were almost always filled to capacity at times the clamor became so great that neighbors complained near one saloon someone was reported to have posted a sign in the street saying we wish that you make big money but please try to be a little quiet and not disturb us newspapers and magazines became filled with columns and articles advising readers on how to play the market brokerage houses also began currying favor among a new set of milkenesque high rollers known as dakuan or big bucks because some of them had more than 500 000 yuan 100 000 invested in the market by setting up special lounges where the dakuan could watch the buy and sell orders on a computer screen while enjoying complimentary snacks newspapers and magazines became filled with columns and articles advising readers on how to play the market getting a copy of the shanghai securities weekly a newsletter printed by the exchange itself inevitably involved standing in line even though its print run was up to 150 000 copies in fact any publication with the words stocks or bonds in its title tended to sell out almost before it hit the stands one large beijing bookstore was reported to have sold its complete stock of 1 000 copies of the paperback 183 tricks of playing the stock market in a matter of hours while the xinhua bookstore in the busy wangfujing shopping district could not keep copies of the abcs of investing in stocks on its shelves we ve tried our best to place orders with publishing houses all over the country and push them to publish or reprint more such books as quickly as possible lamented qi fengju the manager of the economics section however the supply still can t meet the increasing demand for those who couldn t locate copies of these popular books it was always possible to attend one of the new private schools that were hastily organized to teach the mysteries of the stock market to potential chinese investors i m counting on this to make me rich one unemployed youth told a new china news agency reporter after registering for classes at the wanlong securities night school the school had been founded by sun puqin an economics professor from beijing s finance and economic college after a single small newspaper advertisement brought him 120 eager students willing to pay 180 yuan 36 to enroll in his three month course in the past we didn t dare think about these things but after what deng xiaoping said we have greater faith declared a 55 year old pharmacist another of sun s eager new students the advent of computerized stock trading may have been a new beginning for many chinese investors but for some it was the end of the line in early may a columnist for china daily half jokingly noted that china s stock market won t truly be mature until a few people have jumped out of windows it wasn t a long wait one week after the article appeared shanghai s liberation daily announced that a 41 year old resident named tang had hung himself in his home after losing l 000 during the april market correction it was the first stock market related suicide in china since 1949 lamentably if tang had been just a little more patient he would have more than recouped his losses during the bull market that began in mid may soon there were other chinese market casualties in june the people s republic marked its second known stock exchange suicide when a 39 year old worker named liu xiaodong electrocuted himself after losing 4 000 yuan 800 of borrowed money when the market suddenly tumbled after its epic may rise ii in spite of these parenthetical tragedies the first half of 1992 was a manic period for china s nascent securities exchanges officials in other cities watched shanghai and shenzhen with thinly veiled envy champing at the bit to get in on the action themselves even conservative beijing expressed an interest in getting in on the boom in april chen yuan vice governor of the people s bank of china announced that he favored opening an exchange in the capital chen s declaration was particularly surprising because he owed his prominent position to the patronage of his father chen yun the ultraconservative economic central planner and leader of the central advisory commission a council of elders that had steadfastly cast aspersions on deng s policy of accelerated economic reform chen yuan s desire to open more exchanges was shared by almost every other large city in china in sichuan province the chongqing branch of the people s bank of china allowed three enterprises to issue publicly 61 3 million yuan 12 million worth of stock without obtaining approval from the central government and to start selling share purchase certificates not surprisingly the price of the certificates quickly shot up from 5 yuan to over 1 000 yuan 200 much the same thing happened in fujian province where on june 15 even though beijing had not given local officials permission to establish an open market the xiamen municipal joint stock experimental unit leadership committee authorized twenty six companies to issue and sell stock publicly capitalizing on this news brokers in the city began selling share purchase certificates at 5 yuan at locations throughout the city by the end of the day some 400 000 certificates had been sold and the black market price had shot up to 110 yuan each on hainan island another region known for acting first and seeking permission from beijing later market boosters simply opened a securities exchange of their own without even bothering to obtain beijing s approval less than a month after trading started however zhu rongji china s vice premier personally traveled to hainan to close down the renegade exchange he swatted us like a fly a hainan official told lincoln kaye of the far eastern economic review he worried that if we could launch a stock market on our own soon they would be sprouting up all over the country zhu s intervention did little to subdue the stock trading frenzy in hainan refusing to be thwarted by beijing speculators simply set up a gray bourse and continued to sell securities through a decentralized system of independent brokerage houses in an effort to rein in these upstart tendencies the bank of china and the state council in beijing issued a statement reaffirming the policy that the issue of stocks investment fund certificates and trustee certificates must be strictly reviewed according to regular procedures and that no local body unit or individual has the right to violate the review process breach authority or make unauthorized approvals for issuing or listing stocks or securities without being held accountable to law it was obvious that moves to establish rogue exchanges in the provinces made officials in beijing extremely nervous about the prospect of losing control over the entire reform process it was also obvious that beijing s ability to restrain the provinces from seizing control of their own economic destiny was tenuous indeed with increasing regularity one began to hear chinese in beijing saying guanbuliao tamen or it s impossible to control them while speaking about the regionalization of china s economy in the long run i really don t think the government will be able to control this thing gao xiqing general counsel and executive director of the quasi governmental chinese stock exchange executive council admitted to us the problem is that regional governments don t really listen to the central government to get around their policies without approval they simply interpret rules and regulations as they wish if they want to allow enterprises to sell stock they just call it an internal offering to employees and then turn around to sell shares to the public on the sly what can the central government do to stop it to stem the flood of unapproved securities in mid june china s state council and the state commission for restructuring the economy began issuing a new set of administrative procedures to standardize the process of forming joint stock companies and issuing listing and trading securities the urgent task now is to work on standardization and to insure that the experiment develops healthily so as to facilitate the exploration of a correct way to develop socialist shareholding enterprises and stock markets during the implementation of reform wrote liu hongru vice minister of the commission in a june 23 people s daily article after rationalizing the approval of financial markets by citing various passages of canonical marxist texts liu urged the quick promulgation of new regulations when laws and regulations are incomplete they cannot effectively protect the interests of the broad masses of investors and the normal business activities of the shareholding enterprises he said he also warned that although the experiment in the shareholding system and stock markets has developed rapidly and although people s enthusiasm is great many shareholding companies have failed to meet the demands of standardization creating a bad influence in an effort to realize some measure of standardization the governor of the people s bank of china was ordered to supervise a new china securities supervisory management committee that would review companies seeking to issue shares and insure that markets operated according to the new regulations the watchdog agency was also charged with trying to control the rampant spread of unauthorized shares that were being traded on china s streets and the widespread speculation that was driving the markets to such dizzying heights the supervisory committee s formation came hardly a moment too soon because by mid summer it was rumored that major market manipulations were taking place behind the scenes among members of the so called taizidang or prince faction the sons and daughters of high ranking communist party officials by investing heavily in companies that they knew would soon be issuing stock and by using their influence to get their favorite companies approved for listing on one of china s new exchanges the young princes were able to make a killing by buying in early and then selling their holdings just after issues hit the market and share prices soared under the pressure of eager small investors rushing in to buy going for broke stocks and bonds were not the only capitalist style market mechanism china adopted during this hectic period as it sought to enlist the invisible hand of supply and demand to weaken the deadening grip of central planning in the management of the country s economy in late may china crossed another rubicon when the country s first futures exchange was opened in shanghai to begin trading in contracts for nonferrous metals showing no signs of maoist prudery the inaugural gala featured a banquet that climaxed when fifty seductively attired female comrades arrived like so many hired taxi girls for the dancing pleasure of the metals exchange s male guests it s a historic event for china commented dale lorenzen a visiting first vice chairman from the chicago board of trade about the new exchange although he might just as easily have been referring to the presence of the young women china s avid speculators quickly took to this new investment medium and within two months of its splashy opening the daily volume of trade on the metals exchange was over 150 million yuan 30 million meanwhile a chain reaction of sorts had begun in henan province officials announced that the zhengzhou wholesale market china s biggest commodities market had put a group of experts to work around the clock designing an agricultural futures contract trading system that would open in the spring of 1993 this news was a particularly poignant reminder of how far china had drifted from its ideological moorings because orthodox communists during the pre 1949 period looked upon the idea of futures trading as little more than a glorified form of gambling one of the infamous six evils that included slave trading drug dealing prostitution superstition and pornography and thus even more odiously bourgeois than the sale of stocks and bonds how now mao all these dramatic new experiments left one with the inescapable impression that china s old system of state owned enterprises and central planning was under assault by china s paramount leader himself there was something about deng s enthusiastic call for stock market experimentation and the frenzied popular response it had produced that was eerily reminiscent of the exhortations by mao that kicked off the cultural revolution just as mao had been forced to go to leftist shanghai to circumvent the resistance of beijing party regulars in 1966 so too deng had been forced to abandon the stronghold of hard line marxist conservatism in the capital and visit liberal shenzhen to make his appeal for economic reform and while mao had urged the red guards to bombard the headquarters of a party whose leadership opposed his radical political line deng now called upon chinese entrepreneurs to arise and create new securities exchanges and to introduce other market mechanisms into the chinese economy in defiance of conservative opposition both mao and deng had appealed over the heads of other leaders to mobilize their respective mass constituencies and both evoked a similar totalistic unquestioning and exuberant response from their adherents the zealousness of these responses stems from the age old tradition of obedience to the ruler that the communists have inherited from china s imperial past yet at the same time another part of the phenomenon is rooted in the crisis of identity that has gripped china ever since the fall of the last dynasty in 1911 an event that left the middle kingdom vulnerable to ceaseless radical shifts in political ideology and periodic seizures of blind optimism followed by unalloyed pessimism economics is the current focus of china s ongoing quest for historical salvation and the chinese have pursued this quest for wealth with much the same ardor that they once reserved for class struggle and mass political movements but how any single society can embrace such contradictory belief systems and monumental extremes is a question that the advocates of economic reform seem wary of asking only in passing did an article in a july issue of china daily broach the subject going to extremes finds its best expression in economic reforms the paper said with unusual candor china is changing its old economic mode to a new one some people either negate every part of the old system or affirm every part of the new system going to extremes is an illogical way of thinking countering the conservatives china s hellbent economic extremism also has complex roots within the communist party s long history of factional struggle sharp ideological divisions within the central committee have encouraged members of each competing faction to press ahead fanatically with their economic and political programs whenever an opportunity to expand political leverage arises china s vast population has become highly adept too at anticipating the practical implications of these political realignments almost as soon as they take place when the political winds shifted after almost three decades of sacrifice and self denial under mao many chinese were more than ready to indulge themselves in private gain chinese politics are so quixotic that everyone knows such opportunities can come and go in the blink of an eye few have forgotten how the country s earlier flirtations with financial markets and stock exchanges were abruptly put on hold in the aftermath of the beijing massacre and everyone is aware that even though deng s line of liberal economic reform coupled with strict party political control is now ascendant neo maoists have still not completely lost their influence conservative hard liners had several concerns about the negative effects of stock markets on ordinary people says gao xiqing for people to get rich without working was in their view no better than speculating but they also feared that socialism would be eroded as discrepancies between the rich and the poor grew larger and public ownership was compromised by the corporatization of state enterprises as one local shanghai broker told new york times reporter nicholas kristof in a way that made it impossible to know whether he was being facetious we re in a transition to capitalism conducted under the leadership of the communist party this time around however members of the reform faction have taken some very shrewd steps to insure that party conservatives will find it difficult to reverse the latest innovations just after deng s trip south select chinese enterprises were allowed to start issuing so called b shares a special series of securities designed specifically for sale to foreigners this represented another significant milestone in china s long process of economic reform especially given the party s extreme sensitivity concerning the historical legacy of foreign imperialism but as far as deng was concerned the dangers of allowing foreign investors to own a stake in china s development were more than offset by gaining access to a new source of capital to fuel china s modernization drive moreover with foreigners as investors it became all the more risky for conservative leaders to think of reversing the verdict on these new securities markets since such a move would now represent an attack on the hallowed institutions of international finance during 1992 foreign investors were well aware that china s economy had been enjoying double digit growth while most of the rest of the world was floundering in recession so the b shares caught on like wildfire when the shanghai vacuum electron device company put 1 million b shares on the market in december 1991 investors grabbed them all up within the first day for most hong kong traders the problem was not selling b shares but getting enough to satisfy their clients needless to say chinese enterprise managers and executives were also overjoyed at the thought of attracting a massive infusion of hard currency simply by selling off a few thousand sheets of paper but it created a dangerous mentality of easy money most enterprise managers don t make any connection between selling stock and expanding the net worth of their business lamented a shanghai think tank director they see the issuance of stock simply as a quick and easy way to get rich and buy a new corporate car the prospect of suddenly having a lot of cash to play around with sparked plenty of grandiose dreaming chairman xue wenhai of shanghai vacuum began fantasizing about using the 67 5 million in proceeds earned during one early b share offering to construct a shopping center in beijing a factory in mexico and hotels in mauritius he was also thinking of setting up trading ventures in australia and the virgin islands as kaye of the far eastern economic review put it a cargo cult mentality had begun to infect the issuers of shares as well as investors in the chinese market the beijing review crowed in august a golden age for the big development of stocks in china is drawing near outside investors took more than a little notice when the shenbao industrial corporation made 1 34 million worth of b shares available for sale on the shenzhen securities exchange in mid june overseas investors inundated the local branch of the bank of china with some 112 million in subscription funds more than eighty times the par value of the available securities such a sensational subscription is rarely seen in the international stock market said a dazed liao xiwen general manager of the stock company of the shenzhen special economic zone at a press conference it attests to overseas investors confidence not only in the shenbao industrial corporation but also in shenzhen s stock market and the country s economic development beijing had hardly uttered a single word about liberalizing china s autocratic political system liao seemed to be right by july 16 foreign bankers had set aside some 2 billion for investment in b shares while the wall street journal reported that some twenty different worldwide funds had been established to focus exclusively on chinese investment opportunities during the last two weeks of july alone the first three of these funds to begin trading on the new york stock exchange poured some 300 million into chinese securities markets and several overseas investment funds even sent special emissaries to china to uncover new investment ventures especially those involving companies not yet approved for listing on the exchange these investors would thus be able to get in on the ground floor before stock prices soared as b shares were being eagerly snapped up by foreign investors zhou zhishi vice president of the shanghai branch of the people s bank of china left china for hong kong to discuss ways of publicly listing shares of shanghai companies in the colony s markets acknowledging that there were vast differences between the accounting methods used by chinese firms and generally accepted international practices zhou nonetheless expressed confidence upon returning to china that some adaptation methods would be worked out so shanghai markets could be more closely integrated into the global finance system no sooner had he spoken than a chinese paint manufacturer made the hong kong grade and watched its b shares triple in value after the first day of trading although the b share market cooled down somewhat by fall during the week of october 5 another great leap forward occurred when a fully chinese owned company brilliance china automotive holdings a manufacturer of minibuses that had been conveniently set up as a bermuda holding company for tax and accounting reasons passed muster and with first boston corporation serving as lead manager and merrill lynch and salomon brothers as secondary underwriters leapfrogged the b share strategy by listing 5 million ordinary shares on wall street no one doubted that it would not be long before other chinese firms followed this trailblazer marxist laissez faire as the summer of 1992 began the chinese government continued to formulate trading regulations while pushing forward its plans to develop a fully integrated and electronically linked securities trading system that would enable investors to trade from any city in china without having to rely on paper transactions during early august government authorities allowed another 363 chinese companies to issue shares experimentally although they did not allow them to be traded on either of the new exchanges thus raising the total number of officially approved shareholding companies in china to 3 683 as a whole the situation is good and the development trend healthy said a pleased liu hongru vice minister of the state commission for restructuring the economy however some problems still remain it was quite an understatement when we asked gao xiqing what kind of problems vice minister liu was referring to he said perhaps the biggest problem is that there are so many things that are being done unilaterally and chaotically in these regional financial markets if the cities continue to ignore the central government or if there is much more trouble with these new exchanges it could be very bad not only for the stock buying public but for the country as a whole if hard liners become tempted to try to regain their grip by closing down the stock markets who knows where it will lead the reform movement the answer to this question was by no means clear but during the spring and summer of 1992 almost every day brought more astounding news about china s mad rush to transform itself from a centrally planned economy into a bastion of free market enterprise amid this orgy of laissez faire reforms it was easy to forget that china remained the world s largest surviving marxist leninist state one that continued to uphold mao s dictatorship of the proletariat as a central component of its political philosophy and in spite of the furor over china s economic reform beijing had hardly uttered a single word about liberalizing china s autocratic political system likewise nothing had been said about ameliorating the country s huge network of labor reform camps in which hundreds of thousands of hapless political prisoners are still incarcerated it is no small irony that some of the inmates held within these gruesome facilities were originally imprisoned for having supported the notion of freer markets and politics china may have succeeded in breathing new vigor into its system of one party rule by cloning capitalist institutions into its mutant system of socialism while it seems probable that in the long run these institutions could help destroy the communist party s grip on the chinese government in the short run they have had the paradoxical effect of strengthening the party and prolonging its survival as a chinese aphorism put it they were imbibing poison to cure the disease but for the moment the political demise of the ancien régime hardly seems imminent the center doesn t hold if stock markets and futures exchanges made a mockery of china s depiction of itself as a marxist leninist society they also accelerated the process of regionalization that has been dividing the country into economic satrapies slowly drifting beyond beijing s control this process of decentralization raises a question nobody wants to confront at least not as long as everyone is making money what would the central government which after all still controls the military do if one of these regions began to translate economic independence into political independence with economics so dominating the agenda in the people s republic it seems very possible that as gao xiqing implied the next major challenge to the beijing regime might revolve around questions of regional economic autonomy rather than issues of freedom democracy and human rights indeed only a week after gao s comments a disturbance took place that made his words of warning seem prophetic on august 8 rioting erupted in the city of shenzhen as thousands of chinese scrambled to get application forms for an upcoming stock market lottery that would allow winners to purchase shares in the fourteen new companies that were due to be listed on the exchange in the coming months each of the 5 million lottery tickets cost 100 yuan 20 and the receipts from their sale were purportedly being used to fund municipal welfare projects only 10 percent of those applying however would win chances to purchase shares in the new companies whose names and balance sheets had still not been made public even though the actual sale of applications was not scheduled to begin until sunday august 9 on friday people had already begun to line up at the 300 distribution centers by saturday tens of thousands were queued up in the suffocating summer heat some were barefoot peasants from distant provinces who had heard that people could get rich on the stock market others had come from faraway cities bringing with them the identity cards of friends back home so they could buy application forms for them by proxy there was such eagerness to get applications that some people bought places in line for as much as 2 000 yuan 400 creating pushing and jostling that quickly led to unruliness gang fights broke out in some lines by sunday a crowd waiting outside the local branch of the bank of china grew so rowdy that officials were forced to barricade entrances with filing cabinets to keep from being overrun and police moved in using electric cattle prods bamboo canes and leather belts to restore order china s capitalist revolution went mad with a deluge of people hoping for a chance to buy shares in the city s stock exchange reported hong kong s south china morning post by midday sunday there were more than half a million people waiting in line rumors raced through the crowd that police had purloined thousands of the eagerly sought forms and were selling them illegally on the black market at enormous profit when it was announced that all 5 million lottery tickets had been sold the crowds went berserk some people marched to the shenzhen municipal building where they demanded to see mayor zheng liangyu to secure a guarantee that the distribution of the applications had been carried out in a fair efficient and safe manner and to make matters worse while the official chinese media refused to report on the riots hong kong television which almost everyone in the pearl river delta watches showed lurid shots of police savagely beating people this incited the crowds even further the next day when reports began circulating that two people had been killed in the rioting an allegation that was promptly denied by the chinese government and ultimately proved to be untrue in spite of rain angry crowds poured back into the street in an even more volatile mood than before it did nothing to calm them when the head of shenzhen s 6 000 man police force liang chianyi denied that police had acted in an uncivilized manner the police had no choice but to control the unruly crowd liang insisted if the same situation had happened in hong kong the police there would also have faced the same problem on monday august 10 huge crowds massed in front of the shenzhen municipal offices again to accuse police not only of siphoning off many of the coveted applications for themselves but also of unnecessary violence as demonstrators smashed windows and overturned and burned several vehicles nervous police backed up by antiriot vehicles mounted with machine guns upped the ante by retaliating with high pressure water hoses and tear gas and even fired live shots into the air more than a dozen people were reported injured in the confusion with protesters waving placards and banners proclaiming such slogans as down with corruption the scene was hauntingly reminiscent of the 1989 tiananmen square demonstrations that had in no small part also begun as a protest movement against government corruption and mismanagement of the economy monday s riots did not die down until government officials promised to distribute more application forms the next day by then however the shenzhen stock index had begun to plunge so rapidly that trading had to be stopped on the city s exchange for what officials described as technical reasons some of the government s early statements made it look as if the city might take the same kind of hard line against rioters that deng xiaoping had taken in beijing three years earlier a small number of hooligans have exploited the lack of supply of stock application forms and some our shortcomings in the operation to incite the public and cause trouble declared shenzhen mayor zheng who promised to deal severely with those who have taken advantage of public sentiment to stir up turmoil and just as in beijing three years earlier foreign reporters particularly those from hong kong were quickly blamed as agents provocateurs for showing footage of the riots on television several were detained had their film confiscated and were accused of having illegally entered china however as the riots ended officials seemed to catch themselves and to think better of fanning the embers of dissatisfaction with inflammatory recriminations even deng who had been among the hard liners calling for military action in 1989 now seemed to want to keep the government response well tempered and he insisted that authorities in shenzhen deal with the crisis purely as a local matter the last thing deng wanted was to see the shenzhen protest spark sympathy demonstrations elsewhere in china after all only seven months earlier he had held up shenzhen as a national model and urged the chinese to resolute action in their experimentation with stock markets if anyone was responsible for what had happened he was a prime candidate for blame comes the counterrevolution what reformers immediately feared of course was that conservatives would use the riots as an excuse to launch a counterattack against deng s accelerated changes it was this fear coupled with a concern that charges of police corruption and brutality might lead to even more protests that finally seemed to make shenzhen authorities moderate their tone and address the problems head on rather than try to palm them off on a small number of hooligans guangzhou mayor li ziliu who was eager to have a securities exchange in his own city insisted that the riots did not constitute chaos but should be viewed more like a baby learning to walk it s inevitable he said that he will fall we don t deny that there are imperfections in the current sales method since we are in fact very inexperienced shenzhen s mayor zheng admitted on august 13 as he quite pointedly trooped off to honghui hospital to visit some of those who had been injured during the rioting we have made you go through all this because we did not do well in our work he said contritely we are sorry about you and express our apology guangzhou radio also seemed to bend over backward to calm public passions the phenomenon of fraud did happen at some stations selling tickets an announcer admitted during an august 22 broadcast some public security cadres and policemen were not civilized enough in behavior while performing their duties since yesterday afternoon the city has paid great attention to the mass complaints and has organized a special force to conduct an investigation should fraud be discovered such cases will be dealt with resolutely such contrition was in marked contrast to the central government s militant denial of all responsibility when the 1989 protest movement in the capital ended in a massacre future shocks even though there was no massacre in shenzhen the august riots were a vivid reminder that economic reform can bring unrest that is as difficult to control as political protest when deng visited shenzhen this past january he had promised that if the practice of opening financial markets proves correct it could be spread across the board as a caveat he had also said that if anything goes wrong such markets could either be corrected or closed but then as a kind of afterthought he had added there is nothing to be feared with such an attitude we will make no big mistakes but there was plenty to be feared the shenzhen riots gave a hint of how ill equipped china is to deal with the consequences of the reckless pace of economic reform that deng has unleashed china s new stock exchanges may have appeared to most chinese to be providential cash cows that can be milked endlessly by investors and factory managers alike in fact they are delicately balanced markets capable of sending devastating shock waves throughout the chinese economy if not managed correctly it came as something of a surprise to the chinese when shortly after the august riots the stock markets began to go into a nose dive no one knew what was causing it but as ren kan who writes a weekly market analysis in china daily said of the suddenly bearish market although it s still autumn china s two securities markets are making investors feel winter s freezing cold by november the shenzhen index had plunged to just a little bit above 100 down from its may high of almost 300 while the shanghai index was hovering around 500 down from its may high of over 1 200 to those who were paying attention it was a reminder that what goes up can also come down and sometimes have unforeseen and sudden consequences deng xiaoping may have imagined that by accelerating the process of economic liberalization while slowing political reform china would have a better chance of remaining stable but as mao zedong pointed out more than sixty years ago a single spark can light a prairie fire and it is not difficult to imagine that china s young stock markets and the riots they produced might someday ignite a larger political conflagration the danger for china is that the country still does not have a political system capable of reliably mediating such periods of crisis the chinese government is a faction ridden snake pit of warring party leaders who range from neo maoist hardliners to westernized liberals in the absence of a stable political system and a legal system that cannot be overridden by political considerations resolution of conflict depends almost entirely on a big leader in this case deng xiaoping now 88 but the experience of china s financial markets suggests how volatile the country s burgeoning market economy is the riots in shenzhen served as a warning that when upheaval next comes to china it may be precipitated not by students and intellectuals demanding more democracy and human rights but by ordinary chinese who feel insecure about their stake in the country s strangely eclectic economy with its roller coaster highs and lows the chaotic development of china s stock market is also a warning that future upheaval may not begin in beijing but in the provinces where the extraordinary growth of the market is creating patterns of regional power that can be highly centrifugal
