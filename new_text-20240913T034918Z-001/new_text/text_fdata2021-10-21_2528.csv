commutes in the washington dc area already among the country s worst became even more frustrating this week when the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata announced it was pulling roughly 60 percent of its subway cars from service instead of trains running every few minutes during the peak of rush hour most lines will have service only twice per hour suffice to say lengthy waits inside a subway station metro station in the local parlance isn t time well spent the service slowdown comes after inspections of subway cars following a recent derailment uncovered defects in the wheel and axle assembly delays are slated to last the remainder of the week and some observers fear that ultimately resolving the issue could take years overlooked in this whole mess however is that wmata didn t just buy apparently defective railcars but paid artificially inflated prices for them thanks to the use of federal funding their purchase was subject to buy american laws requiring at least 60 percent since raised to 70 percent of the railcar s components to be u s manufactured and that its final assembly take place domestically which is how it came to be that railcars sold by japanese company kawasaki were assembled in lincoln nebraska rather than being built in the location and with the materials deemed most efficient by the market the production of railcars has been instead partly determined by the whims and desires of politicians spending other people s money that means higher costs and wasted dollars according to the american action forum had wmata been able to purchase subway cars at the average cost paid by 14 foreign cities in various advanced economies for their own subway systems the savings would have amounted to 441 million perhaps unsurprisingly wmata is attempting to avoid buy american requirements for its next major purchase of rolling stock unfortunately some of the savings will be undone through a requirement that 8 percent of the contract s value remain in the mid atlantic region it s just another sign that these laws shouldn t exist in the first place besides frittering away taxpayer dollars and promoting self impoverishment buy american requirements have other harmful effects such as reducing u s exports other countries can t purchase u s products if americans don t purchase theirs that s what trade and mutual exchange are all about furthermore such measures invite u s trading partners to impose similar restrictions both to their own detriment and ours if federal legislators are serious about improving the country s infrastructure and truly building back better then the repeal of protectionist measures such as buy american requirements would be an excellent place to start

all investors securities held by a fund as well as shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the

measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease the debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks including issuer risk reinvestment risk prepayment risk credit risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund s portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolio s current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates liquidity risk is the risk that illiquid and restricted securities may be difficult to value and to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the fund believes it is desirable to do so a mortgage backed security may be negatively affected by the quality of the mortgages underlying such security and the structure of its issuer for example if a mortgage underlying a particular mortgage backed security defaults the value of that security may decrease moreover a downturn in the markets for residential or commercial real estate or a general economic downturn could negatively affect both the price and liquidity of privately issued mortgage backed securities a portion of the fund s managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgage backed securities such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of non payment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency to the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference interest rate it is subject to libor risk the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor will cease making libor available as a reference rate over a phase out period that will begin immediately after december 31 2021 the unavailability or replacement of libor may affect the value liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades any potential effects of the transition away from libor on the fund or on certain instruments in which the fund invests can be difficult to ascertain and they may vary depending on a variety of factors and they could result in losses to the fund investments in asset backed or mortgage backed securities offered by non governmental issuers such as commercial banks savings and loans private mortgage insurance companies mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers are subject to additional risks the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are a the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the instruments or indices underlying the futures contracts and the price of the futures contracts b possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired c losses caused by unanticipated market movements which are potentially unlimited d the investment adviser s inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other economic factors and e the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations if a security sold short increases in price the fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price resulting in a loss repurchase agreements are subject to the risk of failure if the fund s counterparty defaults on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented

the hill reported yesterday that sens joe manchin d wv and john tester d mt poured cold water on democratic colleagues attempt to include a carbon tax in the 3 5 trillion reconciliation bill sen manchin may just have foiled president biden s ambition to enact a major climate initiative in 2021 and make a big splash at the cop26 climate summit that convenes in glasgow on october 31 and this just in e e news reports that when a group of progressive lawmakers emerged from a meeting at the white house yesterday afternoon an outline of a scaled down reconciliation package in hand it looked increasingly likely that democratic policymakers would settle for the only two climate policies the country has ever known tax credits and regulations a quick recap of how we got here on earth day april 22 president biden pledged to the united nations that the u s would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 in mid september the administration and congressional allies unveiled their flagship climate policy a 150 billion initiative called the clean electricity performance program cepp a de facto clean energy mandate the cepp would pay utilities to increase electric generation from non fossil sources by 4 percent annually and penalize utilities that fail to do so the goal was to expand the market share of non emitting electric power nuclear hydro wind and solar from roughly 40 percent today to 80 percent by 2030 however manchin has said for weeks that he opposes subsidizing an electric sector transition that is already occurring on october 16 the new york times and nbc news reported that senate leaders were likely to drop the cepp from the reconciliation package due to manchin s opposition why was his support critical unlike ordinary legislation a reconciliation bill cannot be filibustered requiring only a simple majority of senators to pass because republicans hold 50 seats and all oppose spending another 3 5 trillion on top of the 4 8 trillion the u s government already spent in fiscal year 2021 democrats cannot pass the reconciliation spendulus without manchin s vote when manchin refused to back down on cepp democratic leaders tried to sell him on a carbon tax his negative response was predictable and not only because he raised a red flag over colleagues push for a carbon tax in september politically the core function of a carbon tax is to make fossil fuels unaffordable beginning with coal west virginia is the nation s second largest coal producer and coal fired generation accounts for 91 percent of the state s net electric generation if sen manchin deemed the carrots and sticks cepp to be unacceptably damaging to west virginia s economy there was no way he would support a carbon tax democratic colleagues are reportedly fuming but manchin may have saved their political bacon earlier iterations of carbon pricing schemes al gore s btu tax on carbon based energy in 1993 and the waxman markey cap and trade bill in 2009 contributed to the democrats loss of their majorities in the house the larger point is that the green movement s netzero agenda is unaffordable and therefore unsustainable that is the case even if netzero is achieved via a carbon tax allegedly the most efficient least cost greenhouse gas reduction strategy bjorn lomborg explains why in a recent wall street journal op ed and series of twitter posts lomborg unpacks a recent nature climate change study beguilingly titled the surprisingly inexpensive cost of state driven emission control policies you might assume the study finds that state level climate policies are inexpensive what it actually finds is that state level climate policies are not substantially more expensive than a uniform nationwide carbon tax but in either case the costs of netzero are ruinous the nature study estimates that to almost achieve netzero by 2050 a 95 percent reduction in u s energy related co 2 emissions a carbon tax would have to increase beyond 1 500 per ton for perspective that is about 18 times higher than the biden administration s social cost of carbon dioxide estimate for 2050 see table es 1 by mid century the tax would cost the economy 4 trillion annually about 12 percent of u s gdp and 11 300 per person such a policy is not sustainable either economically or politically lomborg comments us going net zero will cost more than 11 300 per person per year in 2050 according to new nature study that is almost 500x as much as average american willing to pay that won t end well the stock rejoinder is that inaction is the costliest policy of all and we must do whatever it takes to hold global warming below 1 5 c the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is usually invoked as scientific authority for that viewpoint however the ipcc s special report on global warming of 1 5 c did not affirm or imply that climate change is an existential threat the ipcc estimated using overheated models and an inflated emissions baseline scenario that in a world with no climate policies whatsoever global average annual temperature will rise by 3 66 c in 2100 that results in a projected global gdp loss of 2 6 percent chapter 3 p 256 a 2 6 percent reduction in gdp is undesirable but far from existential especially if the decrease is not from current gdp but from the much higher levels of gdp expected after another eight decades of global growth consider that in the ipcc s five socioeconomic development scenarios global gdp in the 21st century is projected to grow between 600 and 1 800 percent history suggests that market driven innovations if not sabotaged or blocked by central planning and other political interference will keep improving the state of the world regardless of climate change in contrast carbon taxes to say nothing of less efficient climate policies are likely to do more harm than good imposing substantial costs for undetectably small benefits the netzero agenda is the path to poverty misery and disunity which is why even the first steps on the path are beyond the political strength of the president and his congressional allies

compared to the previous quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower utilization in brazil and lower rates in west africa during the third quarter 2021 offset in part by higher utilization in the gulf of mexico and the north sea our third quarter revenues were negatively impacted by the completion of our long term contract in brazil on the siem helix 1 in august which subsequently commenced its regulatory dry dock during the quarter overall well intervention vessel utilization remained flat at 72 in the second and third quarters 2021 well intervention net loss from operations increased to 13 3 million in the third quarter 2021 compared to 6 7 million in the previous quarter the increased loss was due to lower revenues in brazil combined with higher variable costs associated with our increased activity in the gulf of mexico during the third quarter well intervention revenues decreased 9 5 million or 7 in the third quarter 2021 compared to the third quarter 2020 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower rates and vessel utilization in the gulf of mexico and brazil offset in part by higher utilization in the north sea and west africa during the third quarter 2021 our third quarter 2021 rates and utilization in the gulf of mexico and brazil were negatively impacted by the completion of our long term contracts on the q5000 during the second quarter 2021 and the siem helix 1 during the third quarter 2021 our third quarter 2021 utilization in the north sea and west africa benefitted from utilization on the seawell and the q7000 both of which were stacked during the third quarter 2020 well intervention vessel utilization was 72 in the third quarter 2021 compared to 68 in the third quarter 2020 well intervention incurred a net loss from operations of 13 3 million in the third quarter 2021 compared to operating income of 18 8 million in the third quarter 2020 the decrease was due to lower segment revenues as well as higher costs associated with our resumed activity in west africa robotics robotics revenues increased 11 0 million or 35 in the third quarter 2021 compared to the previous quarter the seasonally higher revenues were driven by increased vessel days and rov activity during the third quarter vessel days during the third quarter 2021 included 77 spot vessel days performing rov support work for a telecom project offshore guyana and 99 spot vessel days performing seabed clearance work compared to 61 spot vessel days on the seabed clearance work during the second quarter 2021 chartered vessel utilization increased to 99 in the

million during the third quarter 2021 compared to the previous quarter due to higher revenues offset in part by higher operating costs associated with increased spot vessel days quarter over quarter robotics revenues decreased 7 2 million or 14 in the third quarter 2021 compared to the third quarter 2020 the decrease in revenues year over year was due to fewer vessel days as well as a reduction

biotechnology company engaged in the development of drugs for neurodegenerative diseases its lead therapeutic product candidate is called simufilam formerly pti 125 developed as a treatment for alzheimer s disease ad and its lead investigational diagnostic product candidate was savadx a blood based biomarker diagnostic to detect ad simufilam purportedly targets an altered form of a protein called filamin a flna in the alzheimer s brain and reverts it to its native healthy conformation thereby countering the downstream toxic effects of altered flna the company s financial viability is largely dependent upon the clinical success of simufilam as the company currently has no sources of revenues on february 2 2021 cassava announced results from its interim analysis of an open label study of simufilam which purportedly demonstrated that patients cognition and behavior scores both improved following six months of simufilam treatment with no safety issues according to the company n a clinical study funded by the national institutes of health and conducted by cassava sciences six months of simufilam treatment improved cognition scores by 1 6 points on adas cog11 a 10 mean

defendants failed to disclose to investors that 1 the quality and integrity of the scientific data supporting cassava s claims for simufilam s efficacy had been overstated 2 data underlying the foundational research for cassava s product candidates had been manipulated 3 experiments using post mortem human brain tissue frozen for nearly 10 years was contrary to a basic understanding of neurobiology 4 biomarker analysis for patients treated with simufilam had been manipulated to conclude that simufilam was effective 5 quanterix corp quanterix an independent company had not interpreted the test results or prepared the data charts for the biomarker analysis for patients treated with simufilam 6 as a result of the foregoing there was a reasonable likelihood that cassava would face regulatory scrutiny in connection with the development of simufilam and 7 as a result of all the foregoing defendants positive statements during the class period about the company s

accuracy and integrity of clinical data for simufilam the petition requested that the fda halt cassava s clinical trials pending a thorough audit of the publications and data relied upon by the company among other things the petition stated that the etailed analysis of the western blots shows a series of anomalies that are suggestive of systematic data manipulation and misrepresentation it also stated that the methodology for studies about simufilam s effects in experiments conducted on postmortem human brain tissue defies logic and the data presented again have hallmarks of manipulation the petition further stated that after initial analyses of phase 2b trials found that simufilam was ineffective in improving the primary biomarkers endpoint cassava had these samples analyzed again and this time reported that simufilam rapidly and robustly improved a wide array of biomarkers and the reanalysis shows signs of data anomalies or manipulation on august 25 2021 before the market opened cassava issued a response to the petition claiming that the allegations regarding scientific integrity are false and misleading among other things the company claimed that the clinical data which the citizen petition stated had been reanalyzed to show simufilam was effective had been generated by quanterix an independent company suggesting that the reanalysis was valid on

santa ana ca accesswire october 20 2021 infinity bank otcqb inft the bank today reported financial results for the third quarter ended september 30 2021 financial highlights for the third quarter of

deposits increased by 123 1 million loans for the quarters ended september 30 2021 and june 30 2021 total loans were relatively flat at 153 6 million and 153 5 million respectively however during the third quarter of 2021 7 2 million paycheck protection program ppp loans were forgiven bringing the balance of ppp loans down to 5 6 million which means that non ppp loans grew by approximately 7 3 million for the quarter non ppp loans generally yield significantly more than ppp loans so this is an important growth point for the bank in terms of income generation total loans increased by 17 7 million or 13 when compared to december 31 2020 as of september 30 2021 the bank recorded a year to date increase of 88 4 million in new loan commitments the loan to deposit ratio decreased to 51 3 as of september 30 2021 compared to 87 1 as of june 31 2021 the decrease in the loan to deposit ratio was due to an increase in total deposits during the third quarter of 2021 given the current economic conditions the bank increased its allowance for loan and lease losses alll to 1 4 from 1 3 on all non ppp loans the alll was 1 38 1 20 and 1 16 of total loans as of september 30 2021 june 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively ppp loans are guaranteed by the u s government and therefore do not require an alll amount to be allocated to them and therefore as the total ppp loans outstanding decrease the alll as a of total loans increases the yield on average loans for the quarter ended september 30 2021 was 6 39 an increase of 69 basis points when compared to the previous quarter and 110 basis points when compared to the same quarter in 2020 the yield on average loans increased 47 basis points to 5 94 from the nine month period ended september 30 2020 the increases in the yields are directly related to the amount mix of loans as ppp loans decrease as a percentage of total loans the yield will increase as noted above deposits total deposits increased by 123 1 million or 69 8 to 299 4 million when compared to second quarter ended june 30 2021 and 127 0 million or 73 7 when compared to december 31 2020 noninterest bearing demand accounts increased by 103 0 million or 105 8

2021 the bank purchased 9 4 million of brokered time deposits these deposits bear interest at 0 08 and mature in the third quarter of 2022 the drivers behind this dramatic increase were the seasonal growth in the amounts our clients hold with the bank as well as the growth in the number of clients already at the bank the cost of funds for the quarter ended september 30 2021 was 21 basis points a decrease of 5 basis points when compared to the quarter ended june 30 2021 and a decrease of 18 basis points when compared to the same quarter of the previous year the low cost of funds is a result of the bank s continued focus on long term deposit relationships that are not solely based on pricing as well as the large increase in non interest bearing demand during the third quarter of 2021 net interest income net interest income in the third quarter of 2021 was 2 3 million up 318 thousand or 16 0 from the second quarter of 2021 and up 736 thousand or 46 8 over the third quarter of 2020 for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the bank s net interest income equaled 6 2 million an increase of 2 2 million or 56 7 from the nine months ended september 30 2020 the bank s primary source of net interest income was driven by interest income from loans the bank s net interest margin decreased by 50 basis points to 3 49 during the third quarter 2021 when compared to the previous linked quarter the decrease in the net interest margin was due to the mix of interest earning assets at september 30 2021 38 of the interest earning assets were held in lower yielding cash and due from banks versus 19 as of june 30 2021 which was driven by the rapid growth of deposits during the third quarter of 2021 the bank s net interest margin increased 17 basis points when compared to the quarter

income equaled 224 thousand an increase of 66 thousand or 41 8 when compared to the nine months ended september 30 2020 the increase in non interest income for all periods was driven equally by

thousand or 10 5 when compared to the same period ended september 30 2020 the increase in non interest expense for the three months ended september 30 2021 was primarily due to incentives which are based on increases in loans and deposits for the nine months ended september 30 2021 non interest expense totaled 4 8 million an increase of 607 thousand or 14 4 from the like period in 2020 and was

president joe biden s deputies have invited roughly 570 000 migrants across the southern border since january amid a worldwide epidemic and economic crisis according to federal data leaked to the washington post the biden migration was boosted by lax border security which allowed at least 450 000 additional migrants to sneak across the border many of those so called got aways were allowed to make repeated unpunished efforts to sneak past the thin screen of distracted border guards the inflow of roughly 1 million job seeking wage cutting migrants was hidden under a record breaking total of 1 7 million official encounters with migrants at the border according to the post s article historic data shows fiscal year 2021 s figure was the highest total ever recorded the federal government s fiscal year ends each september 30 and re starts october 1 border officials have the legal authority to exclude nearly all migrants but biden s progressive deputies have instead welcomed roughly 39 percent of the 1 7 million poor migrants even as many other unlucky migrants die on the trail to the border or get sent home deep in debt to the smugglers many agencies leak information to the washington post to influence national media coverage in this case the record breaking border arrivals of 1 7 million were finally leaked mid month as democratic leaders announced details of their record breaking plan to spend almost 2 trillion or 2 000 000 million to expand government services much of the new spending is aimed at poor people who have been made poor by the governments immigration policies the inflow of at least 1 million migrants delivered roughly one migrant for every 3 5 births in the united states during 2021 the inflow is in addition to the biden administration s choice to revive legal immigration roughly 1 million per year and the inflow of foreign temporary workers holding h 1b and other work permits all told biden s deputies likely imported 2 million foreigners into the united states even as tens of millions of americans are struggling to find good jobs pay for homes or rent and to persuade politicians to vote in their pocketbook interests biden s overall inflow is roughly five times the level seen in 2020 under president donald trump on october 14 breitbart news reported cbp officers and border patrol agents encountered nearly 1 96 million migrants nationwide during fy21 which ended on september 30 according to a highly placed source operating under the umbrella of the department of homeland security a document from the agency reviewed by breitbart texas revealed the record breaking level of migrant encounters along the u s mexico border of the nearly 1 96 million migrants encountered more than 1 66 million a new record for border patrol were migrants apprehended by u s border patrol agents at the southern northern and coastal borders this represents an increase of 310 percent over the previous year s 405 000 migrants most of the legal immigrants visa workers and illegal migrants settle in coastal states this federal inflation of the coastal labor force minimized the economic incentive for investors to create new jobs and wealth in the heartland states such as kentucky west virginia or ohio the government s policy of extracting economic migrants from poor countries also shifts wealth from ordinary americans to investors fort example the stock market has grown by roughly one quarter in 2021 partly boosted by biden s inflow of low wage workers and extra government aided consumers roughly 90 percent of stock value is held by the wealthiest 10 percent of americans according to cnbc com the wage cutting rent spiking diversity boosting migration has proved very unpopular and helped drag biden s approval numbers below 40 percent the post reported on the white house s excuses once in office biden quickly halted construction on the border wall ended the remain in mexico policy reversed key asylum restrictions and announced a 100 day pause on most deportations and enforcement by u s immigration and customs enforcement biden officials initially blamed the previous administration s policies for the increase in border crossings and said migration pressures intensified as a result of the pandemic s economic fallout many migrants have told reporters they opted to make the risky journey north at great cost and considerable danger with the belief that biden would allow them to stay a tight u s labor market became another pull biden s border deputy is alejandro mayorkas a pro migration zealot who arrived in the united states from cuba in 1960 mayorkas is now working to import many more migrants via questionable legal loopholes such as expanded asylum rules amid little pushback from the establishment gop the donor funded gop leaders prefer to downplay the pocketbook impact of migration on americans communities instead they try to steer voters concerns towards subsidiary non economic issues such as migrant crime the border wall border chaos and drug smuggling for example on october 20 the national republican congressional committee lightly criticized biden s migration saying the data plainly shows the biden administration created a border crisis and democrats have done nothing to fix it meanwhile migrants continue to stream across the southern border in droves the committee manages the gop s effort to elect more republicans to the house but it is heavily funded by business groups that want more imported workers consumers and renters gop politicians do vigorously oppose amnesties and other legal immigration proposals that would import more democratic leaning voters and so threaten their ability to keep their jobs in congress overall the federal acceptance of legal and illegal immigration is a pro establishment economic policy that extracts migrants for use in the u s economy but which is pitched as a national moral obligation regardless of congress laws or the harm done to americans migrants and their home societies immigration damages ordinary americans career opportunities cuts their wages raises their rents curbs their productivity shrinks their political clout widens regional wealth gaps and wrecks their democratic equality promoting civic culture it also pushes people towards drug addiction and minimizes the incentive for employers to help

in the past global speculators have routinely looked for a scapegoat when the united states emerged from an economic crisis when the u s economy recovers the market makes a money move in which the flow of money changes global speculators look for this opportunity to make money in 2010 when the u s economy was on the rise after the 2008 global financial crisis the acronym piigs began to spread in the global financial community originally pigs was coined in the 1970s as a pejorative acronym referring to portugal italy greece and spain later ireland was added and the abbreviation referred to those countries in fiscal crisis that had been handling their finances with money from other countries in the end speculators attacked these countries causing their treasury bond rates to increase and leading to a chaotic market collapse greece ireland and portugal even received bailouts as the european debt crisis subsided the term fragile five spread across the global financial community in 2013 investment bank morgan stanley classified five countries with large current account deficits brazil indonesia india turkey and south africa as countries with weak currencies at the time federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said that as the u s economy recovered he would start tapering to reduce the release of money in 2014 when foreign funds were withdrawn in these five countries the currency value fell and stock prices plummeted whenever a global crisis breaks out south korea is referred to as the global atm this is because foreigners can easily withdraw money due to south korea s high level of dependence on trade despite this fact south korea avoided being scapegoated twice in 2010 and 2013 it has accumulated a great amount of foreign cash reserves and reduced short term debt since the asian and global financial crises the government also took measures to prevent excessive inflow of overseas speculative funds calling its strategy the three sets of macroprudential measures the u s economy is now on track to recovery fed chairman jay powell said that in november he would end the emergency measures that were implemented in response to the covid 19 crisis and start tapering it is time for global speculators to find a scapegoat once again it is difficult to know what standards they will apply in advance however each crisis comes with a different face the most vulnerable part of the korean economy is mounting household debt the wall street journal already named south korea as one of the 10 countries most vulnerable to household debt as of feb 2018 noting that the growth of household debt in south korea and norway is particularly high however south korea has made matters worse instead of reinforcing any weaknesses while the government created a real estate policy to prevent speculation it only drove young people into panic buying as the interest rate was drastically lowered due to the covid 19 crisis the government neglected to come up with measures allowing money to flow into the innovative economy sector as a result the household debt to gross domestic product ratio was 105 in the first quarter up 13 2 percentage points in two years it is the third largest increase after hong kong and norway if speculators group countries vulnerable to household debt together as targets south korea will not be left out one of the most popular phrases on wall street lately is party hard but dance near the exit it means that we should prepare for the end of the u s money lending season by taking stopgap measures as our economic officials do now south korea will easily become the target of global speculation recently the government stepped forward to reduce household debt but it is now too late as the horses are out of the barn we hope that the next administration s economic team will implement a policy to reinforce weaknesses in advance
a new project in the lone star state wasn t enough to convince the bears to hold on to their shares what happened while the market s enthusiasm for synthetic biology specialist ginkgo bioworks dna 6 25 was undeniable yesterday investors seem less interested today despite the company announcing some interesting news the stock soared more than 20 yesterday however it gave back some of those gains in today s session shares of ginkgo bioworks ended the day down 7 1 slightly less steep than the intraday drop of 11 5 so what although analyst upgrades and positive earnings announcements are usual suspects for sharp upticks in growth stocks like ginkgo bioworks yesterday s movement was attributable to another catalyst a hedge fund s vote of approval according to bloomberg baillie gifford an investment management firm located in scotland reported in a recent regulatory filing that it has a position in the company that s valued at more than 1 billion today evidently it seems that investors are concerned that the stock flew too high yesterday and can t sustain its lofty valuation so they ve chosen to take profits after the stock hit its highest price since its initial public offering ipo last april evidently the company s news regarding a new deal with the texas department of state health services to assist with covid 19 testing services for elementary through high school aged students couldn t convince the bears to stay away working with quest diagnostics ginkgo bioworks will provide support services such as online reporting and site staffing for the program through its k 12 school testing collaboration financial terms of the deal were not disclosed now what for those who are bullish on ginkgo bioworks today s sell off represents a good buying opportunity the stock s drop doesn t reflect a fundamental concern that has emerged with the company instead it s purely a reflection of investors zeal with collecting profits in fact the deal in texas is an encouraging sign if ginkgo bioworks demonstrates proficiency in covid 19 testing it may be a harbinger of similar deals as other states look to implement testing regulations

officer thank you very much welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings as mentioned with me are dave dykstra dave stoehr kate boege tim crane and rich murphy we have the same format as we instituted earlier this year i m going to give some general comments regarding our results go to tim crane for more detail on the balance sheet and to dave dykstra for other income and other expense and rich murphy will discuss credit for some summary comments and thoughts on the future and then time for questions the overview all in all very successful quarter i could almost give the same comments made at the end of q2 at the end of last april at the start of the pandemic and the government s massive response to it and dakota support this it was going to attempt to grow through it then we ve accomplished this goal and as such third quarter shows the strategy is working all our growth to date has been organic second quarter was is another all around 1 billion quarter assets deposits core loans net of ppp loans all grew by over 1 billion both price mix remain very good of particular note core loan growth resulted in overall increase in total loans for the quarter even after ppp run off we re able to achieve another 1 billion loan quarter in q4 which we believe is more than reasonable assumption given our pipelines which by the way are 13 month high at quarter end fully replace all the ppp balances this is our intent before we embarked on this strategy the income for the quarter was 109 million or 1 77 per diluted common share year to date we saw 367 4 million or 6 per share reported net interest margin decreased 4 basis points 2 592 2 59 primarily due to excess liquidity net interest income was up 19 7 million from quarter two if you back out the ppp loan income and total net interest of almost 8 million over quarter two period end loans exceeded average loans in the quarter by 670 million which bodes well for q4 our liquidity portfolio is at 1 563 billion on average this portfolio remains very short remains very short over 5 2 billion overall money at the fed investing this money is rates rise a level we can pull when the time is right strong growth as i said was excellent in all areas of our business as our current pipelines line usage remains low a little over 39 it was up around 1 from the end of quarter two hopefully hit bottom on this and the line usage saw an increase normal average is closer to 50 through return of normal average another 1 billion of outstanding loans credit quality got better with charge offs totaling by net zero we had some charge offs but we have recoveries which shows should indicate our and ratings thing off good on recovery npls and npas were constant versus q2 npls were 2 5 million to 90 million or 27 basis points for npas shrunk 2 5 million 22 basis points this of course improve portfolio quality and moving some of your view of the overall economy so the reserve release was 7 9 million mortgage increased the experienced some growth in the quarter dave will discuss in detail wealth management continued steady improvement fees up 1 million for the quarter up 18 million year to date i will turn the call over to tim who is going to provide some additional detail on the balance sheet tim timothy s crane president good thanks ed i d like to briefly highlight a few balance sheet items as well as cover two topics that appear to be of interest first with respect to the balance sheet total assets increased to just under 48 billion as we continue to experience strong growth as ed mentioned loans excluding ppp grew 1 2 billion during the quarter essentially mirroring last quarter s growth the growth was spread across virtually all loan categories as rich will discuss in a few minutes on a percentage basis this is the second straight quarter where annualized loan growth again excluding ppp was approximately 15 with respect to ppp loans we saw a reduction of approximately 800 million during the quarter at this point almost all of the ppp loans originated in 2020 have been forgiven and approximately half of the loans from 2021 either have been or in the process of being forgiven by year end we project the remaining ppp balances will be down materially and the remaining income impact to be relatively small for the remainder of the year we are comfortable with our loan growth target of mid to high single digits on a percentage basis again rich will provide some additional color on loan pipelines and the factors that would drive potential upside to that number deposit growth for the quarter was also strong 1 1 billion almost all of that either dda or low cost deposits this is an annualized growth rate of approximately 12 despite the high levels of ppp forgiveness we are not seeing unusual volatility in customer deposits this quarter the interest bearing deposit cost fell another 9 basis points to 29 basis points this was largely a function of cd repricing deposit costs will continue to decline but at a slower pace in coming quarters as we ve noted in prior periods we continue to monitor the deposit growth carefully given the high levels of liquidity in the market however we ve used stable low cost deposits as a strength of the company and we ll continue to pursue deposits related to client relationships on the investment front we remain very liquid during the quarter our securities balances were up slightly as we replaced investments maturing the generally have not yet moved to deploy the large amounts of excess liquidity as we remain wary of locking in low long term yields as the market continues to trend up we will evaluate our position and view appropriate deployment of this liquidity as an opportunity in future periods to improve the margin and income our capital levels remain appropriate given the conservative risk profile of the bank you will note that during the quarter we repurchased approximately 9 5 million worth of stock at just over 71 per share given where we believe volumes and yields will land we continue to expect that despite lower ppp accretion net interest income will increase as it has for four consecutive quarters and that excluding ppp the margin will remain roughly stable i have two other brief comments that relate to new slides in the earnings release presentation the first has to do with digital adoption you ll see on page nine of the presentation with our high touch community banking model also has a high tech component and that we are seeing the same increases in digital adoption and usage that some larger banks have reported we continue to upgrade our digital capabilities to give clients options on how they would like to be served these capabilities position us to compete successfully and in some cases to differentiate ourselves versus our competitors currently you ll see that a full two thirds of our checking clients regularly use our digital services page 10 in the presentation document is also a new slide relates to the customer satisfaction of our commercial clients in this case the source is greenwich data and as you can see wintrust is top ranked across a host of important categories to scale this for you the 97 overall satisfaction score wintrust achieves compares generally to scores in the 60s and 70s for many of our competitors the service we provide increases the depth of our relationships and is the foundation for our strong momentum in the illinois and wisconsin markets as well as nationally in many of our niche businesses with that i ll turn it over to dave david alan dykstra vice chairman and chief operating officer great thanks tim as ed mentioned i ll cover the income statement categories starting with the net interest income for the third quarter of 2021 net interest income totaled 287 5 million that was an increase of 7 9 million compared to the second quarter and an increase of 31 5 million as compared to the third quarter of last year the 7 9 million increase in net interest income compared to the second quarter was primarily due to average earning asset growth which was up on an annualized basis by 12 5 over the prior quarter and one additional day in the third quarter which was offset somewhat by a slightly compressed net interest margins net interest margin declined 4 basis points to 2 59 benefits the decline of 8 basis points for the rates paid on liabilities was offset by a 10 basis point decline on the yield on our average earning assets and a 2 basis point decline in the net free funds contribution which resulted in a slight decline in the net interest margin the decline in the earning assets in the third quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the impact of building short term liquid assets the decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to 9 basis point decrease and the rate paid on interest bearing deposits primarily due to the repricing of time deposits i think it s important to note that the net interest income expanded despite 11 4 million of less interest income associated with the ppp loan portfolio in the third quarter which included 7 8 million of lower ppp loan fee accretion and as ed mentioned the net interest margin excluding the ppp portfolio was relatively stable as it declined by only 1 basis point turning to the provision for credit losses like many other banks have done this quarter wintrust again recorded a negative provision for credit losses of 9 9 million that compared to a directionally similar negative provision of 15 3 million in the prior quarter and a 25 million provision expense recorded in the year ago quarter the negative provision was driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to improvements in the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter including decreases in net charge offs and covid related loan modifications and improving loan risk rating migration rich will cover credit quality and additional detail in just a few minutes i will now talk about the non interest income and non interest expense and income tax sections in the non interest income section our wealth management revenue increased 841 000 to another record level of 31 5 million in the third quarter compared to 30 7 million in the second quarter and that revenue was up 26 from the 25 million recorded in the year ago quarter the revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations which impact the pricing on a portion of our managed asset accounts mortgage banking revenue saw a reasonable solid loan origination volume during the third quarter with origination activity fairly consistent with the second quarter of this year to that end the company originated 1 6 billion of loans mortgage loans for sale in the third quarter of 2021 down from the approximately 1 7 billion that we originated in the prior quarter as we forecasted on our last call mortgage banking revenue increased to 55 8 million for the third quarter of 21 as compared to 50 6 million in the second quarter revenue was higher in the current quarter primarily due to a less material unfavorable fair value adjustments on our mortgage servicing right portfolio the company recorded a 5 5 million negative valuation adjustment in the second quarter as compared to a smaller decrease of 88 000 in the current quarter looking forward based on market conditions and expected seasonality of home purchasing activity we anticipate mortgage originations for sale in the fourth quarter of 2021 to be down 20 to 30 from the origination volumes we experienced in the third quarter and mortgage revenue excluding the msr valuation adjustments to be down similarly also as we saw in the first three quarters of this year the wildcard relates to mortgage banking as it relates to mortgage banking revenue is the mortgage servicing right valuation which is tied closely to mortgage interest rate movements i m not going to speculate on where those rates are going to move to but our previous forecast of a reduction of 20 to 30 excludes any change in the msr valuation other non interest income totaled 23 4 million in the third quarter of 21 up approximately 3 0 million from the 20 4 million recorded in the prior quarter the primary reasons for the higher revenue in this category include 2 million of higher swap fee revenue 2 2 million of higher income from investments in partnerships which are primarily related to cra purposes positive swing of 859 000 in foreign exchange valuation adjustments associated with the us canadian dollar exchange rate 812 000 of higher boli income and offsetting those increases was the fact that the prior quarter included a 4 million gain on the sale of a few branch locations in southwestern wisconsin and there were no such similar gains in the current quarter turning to non interest expense non interest expenses was totaled 282 1 million in the third quarter up approximately 2 million from the 280 1 million recorded in the prior quarter there are a handful of categories that i ll address that comprise the majority of that net increase salaries and employee benefits expenses actually declined by 1 9 million in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of this year the 1 9 million decline is primarily related to 6 3 million of lower compensation expense associated with the mortgage banking operation offset somewhat by higher incentive compensation expenses for annual bonus and long term incentive compensation plans advertising and marketing expense totaled 13 4 million in the third quarter an increase of 2 1 million compared to the second quarter of 2021 the increase in the third quarter relates primarily to increased sponsorship activity for the summer months including our major and minor league baseball sponsorships and more community events occurring we would expect this expense while the decline in the fourth quarter as many sponsorships are geared toward the summer months software and equipment expense totaled 22 0 million in the third quarter an increase of 1 2 million as compared to the second quarter total of 20 9 million the increase was due to increased expenses associated with upgrading our data centers for increased capacity scalability and reliability other network upgrades to support our growth and ongoing digital enhancements and various other software upgrades as we ve done over the last few years we continue to invest in software and technology to enhance our customer experience and delivery systems and products as well as to invest in systems to support our growth and as tim mentioned our customer satisfaction results are great and so i think the investment in those systems is paying dividends oreo expenses were actually negative by approximately 1 5 million in the third quarter as a company recorded gains of approximately 1 9 million on the sale of oreo properties these gains were an amount that exceeded the aggregate cost of oreo expenses and valuation charges on other oreo properties the miscellaneous expense category totaled 23 4 million in the third quarter compared to 21 3 million in the second quarter of this year it s an increase of 2 2 million the increase was primarily impacted by approximately 1 7 million of more travel and entertainment expenses and a variety of other smaller fluctuations the increase in the travel and entertainment expense category was due to increased costs associated with in person client relationship meetings and conferences as well as some additional expense associated with an all employee event to celebrate wintrust 30th anniversary and to thank our employees who are performing well during the pandemic although this expense category is higher in recent quarters there is still lower than the general run rate we had in prior periods before the pandemic began and we re encouraged to see our team returning to normal more normal in person events to build and maintain solid customer relationships this activity is important to maintaining the strong loan growth we ve been achieving in recent quarters so other than those expense categories i just discussed all other expense categories in the aggregate were up by less than 1 million compared to the second quarter and nothing of significance to discuss there the net overhead ratio a measure of our operational efficiency improved in the third quarter relative to prior quarter and net overhead ratio stood at 1 22 which is down 10 basis points from the 1 32 recorded in the second quarter the ratio continues to benefit from strong balance sheet growth and good mortgage banking results our current target assuming relatively normal mortgage activity is for the net overhead ratio to stay below 1 35 due to the strong balance sheet growth and the focus on expense control relative to revenue growth i should note that the efficiency ratio also improved in the third quarter relative to the prior quarter efficiency ratio stood at 66 03 in the third quarter a decline of 253 basis points from the prior quarter moving on to the income tax expense the effective tax rate was relatively stable at approximately 27 which is in the range that we would consider normal in summary core fundamentals were strong with robust loan and deposit growth increased net interest income despite significant ppp loan reductions record wealth management revenue strong mortgage revenues improved net overhead and efficiency ratios strong pipelines and very good credit quality so with that summary i ll conclude my comments and turn it over to rich richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the second quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide four of the deck loan growth for the quarter net of ppp was 1 2 billion or 15 annualized well above our guidance equally as important was the nature of this growth which was spread across our loan portfolio specifically c i loans were up 543 million cre loans which were up 207 million wintrust life which was up 296 million and first insurance funding which was up 95 million throughout the pandemic we have seen solid and consistent loan growth if you look at q3 20 compared to q3 21 we have seen total loans net of ppp grow by 3 4 billion or 12 on our last earnings call we expressed confidence in our ability to continue to meet or exceed our loan growth guidance because of the strength of our core loan pipeline we believe this momentum is attributable to a number of factors the ppp halo effect which is really taking hold on the level of commercial loans we have seen substantial expansion in the numbers and amounts of treasury management relationships over the past several quarters but it takes time to move the entirety of the credit relationship out of the incumbent bank we are now seeing those effects resulting outstandings markets disruption has been pronounced throughout this year and throughout the pandemic and we have seen customers and bankers look to wintrust as a consistent and preferred banking partner in chicago and southern wisconsin as a result pipelines continue to look very strong and at the highest levels we ve seen in several years finally as detailed on slide 17 after five quarters of decreased c i line utilization the trend is beginning to reverse as noted in earlier calls this utilization has been historically close to 50 we saw this level of bottom out in q2 at 38 4 and we ended q3 at 39 3 we believe this trend of increased usage will continue in the fourth quarter as discussed in prior quarters one of the keys of the performance and growth of our credit portfolio has been diversification across a number of product lines this quarter was another great example of that strategy our niche products particularly premium finance and leasing grew substantially during the pandemic now we are beginning to see very strong growth coming from our core banking customers in addition slide 15 details the geographic diversification in our portfolio as we have stated before wintrust as a chicago milwaukee nexus however as this slide illustrates our various business lines provide us with meaningful amount of credit opportunities outside of these primary markets from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide 16 we continue to see solid credit performance across the portfolio as the economy stabilizes this can be seen in a number of metrics non performing loans remained flat at approximately 90 million or 27 basis points npls continue to be at record low levels and roughly half of where those were at this time last year charge offs for the quarter were essentially zero an amazing result especially when looking at total charge offs of approximately 2 million for the past two quarters combined and as noted in the bottom right quadrant on page 16 credit risk ratings continue to show meaningful positive migration as our customers continue to recover from the pandemic that concludes my comments and credit and i ll turn it back to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer thanks murp those of you who examined transcripts of our earnings calls and a lot of similarities between this quarter and the last hope you are fans of consistency as i mentioned at the beginning of the call our strategy has been to grow the balance sheet during this period of low rates to use our structural hedges like mortgages to buffer the loss in nii until such time as balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to lower rates ppp loans were expected benefits add on to the strategy all the above was to be accomplished by enhancing our asset sensitivity position in anticipation of higher eventual higher interest rates balance sheet growth asset deposit growth of 4 1 billion year to date a loan growth of 3 4 billion excluding launch held for sale at ppp we have experienced tim laid out has been done totally on an organic basis the acquisition market remains somewhat consistent with quarter two based primarily the amount of inbound calls we continue to receive so we still have very high expectations so we ll see where this ends up loan pipelines remained strong in all major categories and i said at the beginning 13 month high this is aided by not only our reputation but also market disruption and our diversified portfolio our asset sensitivity position is right where we want it it appears with the following that inflation is transitory is coming to an end and rate increases are inevitable the underwater beach ball will rise at hopefully soon we continue to leg into investments with our excess liquidity take advantage of market blips we re knowledge to be total investment is likely in the lousy long term rates doesn t make a lot of sense to us credits remarkably good thanks for consistently conservative underwriting standards and diversified loan portfolio work with both our lending line and credit folks npas and npls are lower than they were before the start of the pandemic the wealth management area is delivering strong results with assets under administration continuing to grow so today the plan is working we need to continue to grow or just bring this plan to fulfillment organic loan growth should remain strong to take advantage of the opening of the acquisition market it make sense in short i like where we stand as mentioned or we referred to in december we will celebrate our 30th anniversary being close to a 50 billion bank with 35 billion in assets under administration in our wealth management group is beyond any thought of where we d be at this point in time so a couple of guys in here what that original timetable and i think you could pinch us if you knew i would say we were above where we are and what our prospects are going forward for the next 30 years you can be assured of our best efforts going forward we appreciate your continued support now we have time for some questions so thank you very much move on to questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your question please jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning everyone or afternoon everyone good morning i guess edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer how are you jon jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes i m good i m good little confused but on the time but anyway i want to talk about loan growth i know edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer though jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst eastern central i don t know but the just the loan growth numbers i appreciate the guidance for the fourth quarter but to murph s comments on the ppp halo market disruption line utilization i think i would throw in premium finance bull market in there as well but what slows this down and what would cause you to pull back on saying you can put up this kind of growth into 2022 edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer i think if you see rationale if rates stay low then rationality kicks in and we re trying to see that the bigger banks going to just given it away because the dearth of earning assets out there that could cause us to back off a little bit because as you know our policy and our profitability model are and we re not going to be changing those trailing but right now we don t see it we see people coming from other banks who appreciate our long term approach appreciate our approach to doing business i d like to say that you know a lot of them just they just thought there have a good time where the bank and before as tim mentioned we spent a lot of money and we do a better job of telling you how much money we spend on our technology going into the fourth quarter that s why we will give you a real detail how much of our expenses relates to our technology build and winning the those greenwich awards is really heartening to us because the numbers we re seeing it 95 in the like of people would recommend us and that builds on itself so i don t think you can see the premium finance market change that much in turn i think it s really a harder even next year the market continues to get harder people who are thinking maybe 20 30 increase there additional increase in premiums on the commercial side on the life side we see some pricing risk but we stay away from those and with what s going on with the tax laws and like it s going to make life insurance a reasonable way to plan your state and not have to pay the exorbitant state taxes that are being proposed on the commercial side murph i don t know richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer yes no you hit the nail on the head i think that generally speaking we like where we sit and we think that our positioning in the marketplace is very good and as we alluded to we re seeing not only customers but also bankers look at us as a real attractive alternative so really good core momentum there i think to your question what wrinkles are out there as ed said the challenges that you look at every one of our competitors and they are also they have a lot of cash to deploy so you are seeing pricing being very aggressive and you re seeing you know structure is also pretty aggressive so right now we don t anticipate any type of bit over anything like that but it s something that we are very aware of the other thing is on the life side it is because rates were so low it really was a great opportunity for people to use that product and if rates were to go up dramatically here that s probably going to have an impact on that but for right now we see ourselves being as we go into budget season we re pretty optimistic about where we see edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer hope our lease average richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer leasing is good you know leasing s had a really good time during the pandemic anything where leasing tends to be a little bit more of a transactional business and so people are very focused on structure and pricing and so we are very mindful of that so we re not going to go out there and chase deals but as you ve seen jon over the course of the last three years and the way we ve grown that portfolio we re pretty optimistic of where it s at but it s probably the one area where we re really focused on pricing because we re if we re going to lean in on pricing it s going to be for complete relationship where you get the full share of wallet jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes okay ok good color on that thank you and then i guess just one on the margin i appreciate the comments tim on the margins being relatively stable you alluded to the beach ball we ve heard that for a long time but any threats to the margin yes no i ve heard it a lot 20 years ago but we re waiting we re still waiting but what can make your margin lift and you ve alluded to maybe getting a little bit more aggressive on liquidity deployment but still being careful but as we look forward to the margin it feels like it s bottomed out here and maybe the only way to go is up from here but talk a little bit about the plan and can the margin lift edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer well additional liquidity would cause the margin to have additional pressure but in terms of net interest income i think you re going to see that growing nicely throughout the rest of the year tim you want to comment on the timothy s crane president sure wehmer yes i mean we re kind of watching pricing pretty carefully deposit costs will continue to help a little bit not as much as they have in the prior quarters and if we get rising rates here the 10 years up to 165 million we watch that closely and we deploy some more liquidity will help both our margin or income we re patient there so i hesitate to forecast when that might happen but we feel pretty good we remain very interest sensitive and feel like that s still an important part of the equation jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks guys edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer dave you got some of other david alan dykstra vice chairman and chief operating officer no i just 5 billion of that liquidity and then deposits peak coming in so that s a good lever but i was then also say that both new loans are sort of coming on at the existing portfolio pricing right now so if you see a little bit of compression from some older loans paying off at higher rates but the new loans are coming on so i think we ve stabilized on the lower side substantially and so ex ppp it should have like you said should have roughly bottomed out and we have the upside from the deployment so we re optimistic on that front jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael young from truist securities your question please michael young truist securities analyst hey thanks for taking the question wanted to do a quick follow up on just the excess liquidity that 5 billion or so and just kind of cash basically on the balance sheet it seems like it current rates you can deploy that maybe for 150 basis point kind of pickup up over cash yields so by my math that s maybe 0 75 or so of earnings to 1 of earnings is that kind of the right way to think about it but then maybe if you could deploy that into loans instead maybe it s 1 50 or so edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer well yes i think right now i think the concept is right i mean as you said you re earning roughly 15 basis points on mortgage backs or plus or minus 2 right now so there is your spread differential for investing of do you want to invest long term at that rate or do you want to wait for it to go up but it s pretty simple math it s 15 basis points and beside what asset class you want to invest it in and what rates so the loan probably be closer to 3 so we think that we were a slowly showing solid growth in nii by the growth that we re having i think that ourselves we believe we re not at the start or in the even in the first quarter of an inflationary cycle the wages are rising i sit on a couple of boards and we talk to them and price increases are flying through but not going to go backwards supply chain disruption plus lack of labor is going to cause this cycle to start once it starts and get some momentum it s hard to stop it s stopped by higher rates the government has to take eventually in which case because of our deposit base at a higher rate is the lower rates you re playing like in the red zone the higher rates you re going to get normal spreads anyhow so to lock in long term at 2 although it could make us money now but there is down the road so we look at we take a long term view and there is also the possibility at the end of the year people said moving money out there is so much money out there they move it out there hopefully they ll keep it in the bank we never know where it s going to go we have to keep a little bit excess liquidity because of that i think so these are really unprecedented times in terms of the liquidity side of the equation but they re not unprecedented in terms of the completion cycle or start and this they can t fight the economics of it all can try to stay still economics where you re going to do but we re old school guys and we believe that at rather lock in at 5 or 6 and the way up then the 2 percent right now because of our deposit base being very retail and well just retail nature of the deposit base and all could have cut basically 90 odd is all core of deposits we can lag on the way up then we can make a lot more money than so we take it a long term measured approach on this that we could drop it in and make another bucket share a couple of bucks a share over time but we don t think that s prudent to do given that we think down the road i think a lot more money to the company and for the shareholders michael young truist securities analyst okay thanks for all that color and just kind of my follow up question you segued it nicely and to just inflation it s been a long time since we ve seen material inflation and just curious kind of your high level thoughts maybe on inflation and then how that could affect the expense base and kind of growth there edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer well i think the government wants inflation i got all the money that borrowing we want get back and cheaper dollars so we ve seen the movie it kind of think it s i think it s going to be there for a period of time i think the cycle has started it s hard to stop the cycle without raising rates and slowing things down of it kind of a conundrum because of the are not out of the pandemic yet supply chain issues are causing some of those i don t think there ll be over by at the end of next year according to some of the boards and the manufacturing i m talking to doing those in force majeure anything else going on it s tough out there for our clients and labor is tough so to pay a lot more money to get people in the house transportation stuff out there right now it could be a truck there making a 150 grand a year some of the offerings that are out there now so i think inflation is here and it s going to stay and we have to be ready for it and in inflation we have to make more money they did before just to stay even right so that s what that s our plan that s what we re doing we sticking through it and i just think i ve seen the movie answer how it s going to any differently michael young truist securities analyst and dave maybe any thoughts on your expense base specifically and how that will affect kind of our outlook for 2022 or 2023 kind of expense growth david alan dykstra vice chairman and chief operating officer i think i d look at it michael is if the inflation really kicks into the expense base and rates rise of the increase in the margins going to more than more than offset the expenses and our efficiency ratio will get better and our net overhead ratio etc we ll actually probably to get better because of the growth in the assets and the growth in the margin so yes our biggest cost is labor cost so we re just if you see increases in labor costs and will have half of that go up but the rest of that we should be able to control reasonably well but i just think the margin will expand dramatically more than the expenses if inflation does kick in michael young truist securities analyst okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens your question please terry mcevoy stephens analyst hi thanks good afternoon edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer how are you terry terry mcevoy stephens analyst good thank you maybe i ll start with table 8 your interest rate sensitivity i m just wondering how your underlying deposit betas maybe have changed this cycle versus the past and when i look at the 83 loan to deposit ratio and that includes ppp how much are you assuming you can lag on deposit rates when rates rise timothy s crane president well i mean we re pleased that a third of deposits or dda and obviously the bulk of the rest of it is very low rate at this point i think we will lag as rates move up hard to predict what will happen kind of with the ppp money again from my comments earlier we ve not seen anything unusual with respect to deposit volatility i think it will continue to help us i think for the next couple of quarters you ll see deposit costs go down almost in spite of what happens to rates and we should be in good shape david alan dykstra vice chairman and chief operating officer yes and i think terry my recollection is right the last time we have rising rates from the near zero environment the first 25 really there wasn t much of a rise in deposit costs and the second 25 basis point increase was same and they only started to see increases with the third increase and i would think that it would be similar to that if not even a longer lag because of the way more liquidity in the system right now and people aren t as anxious to bring deposits so i think if history repeats itself you d have a waste 50 basis point increase before in too much movement by the industry and my personal opinion is because of all the liquidity in the system that might go up beyond that before you see much of an increase in the positive cost timothy s crane president yes and terry if it helps virtually none of our deposits are linked to an index so terry mcevoy stephens analyst that s helpful thank you and then as a follow up we all know there is a large acquisition about to close later this year in your market and a new name about to enter your market so i guess my question is how quickly did you start to see the disruption from the last deal mbfi and how long did that window remain open for a bank like wintrust to capitalize on any opportunities edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer what we re starting to see a little of it the window stays open for a long time i mean we will give you the year to see this is going to work or not we re relentless on our pursuit of these guys on a previously announced deal it took what four or five years before we started seeing an outflow so in guess which one that is we know you cannot really get anybody on the old place and now we re getting people and assets that we never thought we d get there were very loyal to the old place so we ll be relentless side and we ll see murph any thought richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer no i think that s right it s really kind of the total spent by the acquiring institution and we ve seen it run the gamut from the day that the deal gets announced and they come in and they immediately change you know the credit culture and just the overall tone of the organization but as ed pointed out we ve seen the other side where it takes a while but eventually things change and people cut both customers and bankers you know bankers sense that change and look to find something a little more in keeping with the way they like to be treated so i don t think there s one set answer to the question but it is inevitable edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer word of mouth has been great for us i mean these awards that we re getting from greenwich are very very helpful plus we walk the walk we don t just talk the talk people come over and they see our technology and what we have i ll put up against the big banks for the most part we are better than them because of the personal service we give on top of it and i get nothing but complementary letters about how happy people are when they get over here so having a good time before but now they really are having a good time so word of mouth is happening a lot too plus i think our advertising is paying off in chicago s bank and wisconsin s bank they have great momentum there but we got to back it up we have been backing it up and the people we are seeing people from all the acquired organizations asking us well what our plans are what we re going to do and great interest on their part another thing is with remote working it s helped us like on the it side we were able to pick up a number of people just because of our reputation we picked up a couple out in new york who heard who just heard how good we were to our clients and our people and they came with us so the talent is out there i think our reputation helps and i think our momentum is very good and we don t see anything that will stop it right now michael young truist securities analyst thanks again appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long from raymond james your question please david long raymond james analyst hey everyone thanks for taking my questions edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer how are you doing david david long raymond james analyst good hey appreciate all the color on the loan growth and the margin expectations the question i wanted to ask you about now is more about you re hitting 50 billion in assets here very soon how does that change your operating strategies and does that change how you re thinking about regulations and the ability to continue to acquire edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer not really because we do the smaller deals which aren t going to so we ve certainly done smaller deals which don t really get the attention of the big guys in dc when we do as of now who knows what will happen if the new comes in and maybe i ll have to speak russian or something then but right now we have a great relationship with the regulators our cra is i mean almost what 14 of the 15 banks are outstanding the other one is about hopefully really close and we always said that the regulators make the rules got to play by the rules you can yell at the ref only i can bump the ref but we ll play it by year but i think we have a good reputation with them and we do just because of how we re structured we still are small i mean we might be 50 billion in the aggregate but our average bank is what 2 billion 3 billion and the branches combined they have their own i mean everybody is an owner here we re able to really be close to the customer with our decisions i think that model can keep going for a long time and we any comments on that richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer no i don t think there s anything magical about the 50 billion mark per se i mean our infrastructure is that we can have considerable growth and we just continue to build the infrastructure and the team to handle that so i don t see anything significant you hear in the marketplace that the bigger deals are a little bit slow to get regulatory approval right now but as ed said we typically have done the smaller tuck in deals and those seem to be moving at a quicker pace so i don t see anything significant david david long raymond james analyst got it and then you mentioned the infrastructure to become a larger bank at what point do you have to upgrade it is it core deposit system couldn t handle a doubling of your size at this point or is there at some point that you would need to make any additional investments edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer no we i think our investments and we have done a very good job of telling you how much we spent on this but we have lots of room to grow here we have really upgraded every system in the joint and made it not just upgraded but very flexible in terms of being able to work off the base systems that we have and add things on and take them off and tim you want to comment on that timothy s crane president yeah we are fine from a whole system standpoint and the enhancements and new introduction of services on the digital side is really starting to pay dividends and so i think in terms of getting to the point where we re comfortable at 50 billion we ve been working that for years and so i don t see any immediate issues at all in that front and we re well positioned to continue to grow david long raymond james analyst got it thanks for the color and keep up the good work thanks timothy s crane president thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw your question please chris mcgratty kbw analyst hey guys maybe a question on m a just to further explore i mean you ve got so much momentum organically right now and we ve seen some of the reactions for deals in the buyer stocks i guess why do you even need to consider a deal at this point is there something that these are business you need to build out or a market you need to develop a bit more edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer so we ve always been opportunistic about it and it s got to make sense on the pricing side and strategically we haven t done anything in a couple of years because we have found one that did and we ve always been very very prudent in how we approach it so i said before 1 000 times we are not going to give up a lot of tangible book value to grow give up five years of earnings to grow 0 20 a share it doesn t make a lot of sense we take what the market gives us right now it s giving us organic growth pricing on deals big or small big deals are a pain in the neck not to say that we wouldn t consider it but if i want to philosophize that every big deal we ve seen starts with taking care of management before they take care of shareholders that drives be absolutely crazy absolutely nuts and guys who come in and you start with that and the conversation about what about us what about our shareholders doesn t work management is the last you cut your deal live with it so that we haven t had we have every investment bank in the world calling on us about this deal or that deal or big deals and how big we could be and that s unimportant to us what s important to us is continuing to grow like we grow the market gives us right now this organic growth is awesome smaller deal is still our bread and butter up to 1 billion is good and it has to make sense it has to make sense strategically it has to make sense economically and bigger deal it would just be it just doesn t make a lot of sense right now for a lot of reasons but you never know till we have one that does make sense but i d say it drives me nuts when management says what about me and know a little about my shareholders i hate those conversations and they are a turn off right out of the box for me i agree with you the market is giving us great growth why differentiate deviate from that and there ll be a time when the acquisitions become more affordable and makes more sense and we ll jump in then dave you got anything on that david long raymond james analyst no i think that s right we understand the concept you laid out chris but we can at the same time there is a deal that comes that makes economic and cultural sense but as i ve said we re not going to overpay or do a deal just to do a deal so we re enjoying the organic growth now and pipelines are good and we ll keep marching to that deal chris mcgratty kbw analyst great answer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race from piper sandler your question please nathan race piper sandler analyst yeah hi guys afternoon going back to terry s question on some of the loan growth drivers and within the context of the m a disruption that s ongoing curious in terms of the commercial real estate c i growth that we saw in the quarter obviously on the c i side of things you guys benefit from an uptick in line utilization but just curious how much of that growth you re seeing in footprint on the commercial side of things is being driven by share gains and i m curious within that context what inning we re in in terms of wintrust benefiting from all the m a related disruption that s occurred in chicago within last few years edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer rich richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer i would say we re in pretty early innings at this point i mean we as we talked about a couple of questions ago this disruption has really been pretty recent phenomenon over the last four five years so we think that the goodwill that got established during the pandemic through ppp and we basically told all of our lenders when the pandemic hit this is when you really start to differentiate yourself as being a banker that you can count on and customers appreciated the fact that we were out of the box reaching out and seeing what they needed doing the things that make us different i had lunch with one of our bankers that we hired from one of our competitors recently and he said it was the exact opposite at the bank he was at that they were curtailing lines and they were bumping rates and doing things that in the short term it could enhance the overall return but in the long run you re just going to really just anger your customers so i think there is a long way to go here i mean our market share is still relatively small in chicago and milwaukee relative to the competitors so i think there is a real strong opportunity here over the next couple of years to be able to grow that core business nathan race piper sandler analyst got it that s great color and maybe just changing gears a question dave on mortgage curious if you could remind us in terms of the gain on sale margin expansion that we saw this quarter is a little more pronounced than we saw from some others so just curious if you could remind us in terms of the va arm what that secondary market premium tends to look like in terms of or at least on a relative basis to be kind of conventional 30 year product generally speaking richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer well i am trying to figure out how to answer that you are wondering about the directionality of the gain on sale margins nathan race piper sandler analyst yeah and just you need to wintrust obviously you guys have the va arm that contributes somewhere around quarter volumes each quarter so just curious in terms of what that gain on sale margin benefit from having that production arm in the fold relative to just the typical 30 year venture product richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer well certainly it s higher but as far as the blend of the gain on sale margin that s pretty much been a quarter of our business for the last over a year so i don t think it s going to change the directionality of the overall margin it may be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter as the purchase business goes down in the chicago area because veterans first does business all over the country and a lot in the southern states but i don t think it would change dramatic dramatically we actually think as far as our margin goes it increased a little bit this quarter as secondary marketing gains and losses were a little bit better this quarter as far as that hedging activity that we do goes in and a little bit of product mix change where veterans first was 26 of the volume versus 23 last time so those two factors helped increase the margin a little bit our thoughts for the fourth quarter right now and again will depend on mix of business and some other secondary marketing volatility that could or may not happen but we would expect a gain on sale margins to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter nathan race piper sandler analyst okay great that s really helpful i appreciate all the color thanks guys nice quarter richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of richard from da davidson your question please richard d a davidson analyst hey good afternoon guys just one big picture question for me at this point and it relates to slide 15 of your deck that highlights the geographic and loan portfolio diversification they are clearly paying dividends with the growth you guys are putting up i m just curious are there any geographies you are not in that you d like to be or loan products or niche lending verticals that would fill out this map further edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer we re always looking for new niches problem is right now if there is one out there they want a lot of money for if you want to buy it and kind of wait till it dies down and starting from scratch and paying big though and have a big cbv dilution rich you want to comment on the other side richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer yeah i think that s right i mean we are always looking at opportunities i think the leasing example is a good one we started that three years ago and have built that out because of exactly what you re talking about it gives us a much more geographic spread to the loan portfolio but if we had bought something of comparable size we would have paid substantial premium on it so we like to be building these things but we re right now i think it s not so much about markets that we re not necessarily in but really trying to expand the markets i mean i think that certainly adjacent to the footprint we would like a bigger presence in indiana we d like to expand our presence in wisconsin and looking around the midwest you can kind of see some of the other markets that i think would really appreciate kind of what we do and how we run our business because it really isn t a wintrust type alternative in some of the meaningful cities around the midwest and then we re also looking at opportunities we ve been able to through following our cre sponsors to other markets we ve seen some real good opportunities and we ve been able to build the wintrust brand in some markets that historically we haven t had many and haven t had a presence and we re looking at does it make sense to step out a little bit maybe open up lpos or see how that would fair but it s definitely something that is that s why we put this slide in here it s front and center for us to make sure that while we love chicago and wisconsin we want to make sure that we re just we re having good diversification within the portfolio edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer concentration skill i always say that and say if you can diversify between product type and geography that s a very good thing richard d a davidson analyst thank you guys that was it for me i appreciate your thoughts operator thank you our final question for today comes from the line of brock vandervliet from ubs your question please brock vandervliet ubs analyst thanks dave just following up on the mortgage banking i just wanted to clarify so we should look for 20 to 30 origination drop and similar rev drop in q4 correct david alan dykstra vice chairman and chief operating officer yeah that s right now those applications in october have been very similar to september so far a little less than july and august but just based upon seasonality that what we re thinking and i think it s fairly in line with the mba forecast too brock vandervliet ubs analyst okay so that s you just hit on it that s more seasonality than any rate move that s already percolated through your pipeline that s just what you re expecting for things to kind of fall off david alan dykstra vice chairman and chief operating officer yeah hopefully it s a little bit better than that but that s what our expectations are right now i don t think we generally are too much different than the overall market on origination trends brock vandervliet ubs analyst okay and shifting over to ppp i apologize if i missed this already but you ve got about 25 million left i believe what s kind of the cadence of that recognition do you think richard b murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer it s probably from a fee standpoint maybe another 30 to 40 of that comes in the fourth quarter and then it tails off from there depending on kind of what we see in terms of customer seeking forgiveness but as we talked about we think the loans will drop off quite a bit and the fees follow brock vandervliet ubs analyst got it okay all right thank you operator thank you this does conclude the question and answer session of today s program i would like to hand the program back to edward wehmer for any further remarks edward joseph wehmer founder and chief executive officer thanks everybody for listening in good quarter you can be assured of our best efforts going forward if you have any other questions that come up after you continue reading our 1 000

sections of progressive opinion in sri lanka are currently commemorating the second anniversary of the country s epochal aragalaya which brought down the dictatorial and racist gotabhaya rajapaksa regime april 9th 2022 needs to be remembered especially as the date on which sri lankans in their tens of thousands irrespective of ethnic religious and language differences rose as one to impress on the country s political class and rulers that their fundamental rights cannot be compromised or tampered with for whatever reason and that these rights should be realized henceforth during the aragalaya sri lanka attained nationhood since the totality of the country s social groups standing shoulder to shoulder spoke out for equity and equality among them from the same platform thus was sri lankan nationhood born which is quite different from statehood it is left to progressives to ensure that sri lankan nationhood thus born out of the aragalaya does not prove to be stillborn to express it briefly political independence or statehood is believed by most sri lankans to have been attained in 1948 but this is not tantamount to achieving nationhood the latter is realized when equity and equality are established among a country s communities of course we are a long way from achieving these aims but the historic significance of the aragalaya consists in the fact that the ideals central to nationhood were articulated assertively and collectively in sri lanka as never before the opinion climate conducive to nation building it could be said was created by the aragalaya it is left to the progressives of sri lanka to forge ahead with the process of realizing the ideals and central aims of the aragalaya without resorting to violence and allied undemocratic approaches which are really not necessary to bring about genuine democratic development the aragalaya was a historic wake up call to the country s political elite in particular which over the years could be said to have been engaged more in power aggrandizement rather than nation building which is integral to democratic development given this bleak backdrop it amounts to a huge joke for any prominent member of the country s ruling class to make out that he has been presiding over the only country in asia where democracy is completely safeguarded to begin with a huge question mark looms over sri lanka s true constitutional identity it is not a fully fledged parliamentary democracy in view of the substantive and sweeping powers wielded by the executive presidency and this issue has been discussed exhaustively in this country on the other hand sri lanka is not free of strong theocratic tendencies either because there is no clear separation wall so to speak between religion and politics the fact is that sri lanka s rulers are constitutionally obliged to defer to the opinion of religious leaders therefore sri lanka lacks a secular foundation to its political system this columnist is inclined to the view that in terms of constitutional identity sri lanka is neither fish flesh nor fowl moreover the postponement of local and provincial council polls in sri lanka by governments alone proves that what one has in sri lanka is at best a façade democracy derailing democracy in sri lanka goes religious and ethnic identities in particular continue to be exploited and manipulated by power aspirants and political entrepreneurs to the huge detriment of the countries concerned needless to say such factors are coming into play in the lead up to india s lok sabha polls they are prominent in pakistan sri lanka and bangladesh as well statesmanship is a crying need in these societies but nurturing such leaders into existence will prove a prolonged long term project which also requires the interplay of a number of vital factors many of which are not present to the desired degree in the countries concerned however of the south asian eight india is by far the most advanced democracy it has a constitution that explicitly enshrines the cardinal rights of the people for example including the very vital right to life such a right is non existent in the sri lankan constitution for instance and this is a huge drawback from the viewpoint of democratic development among other things what this means is that the sri lankan state exercises substantive coercive power over its citizens on the other hand the indian supreme court has time and again creatively interpreted the right to life so much so life threatening conditions faced by indian citizens for instance have been eliminated through the caring and timely intervention of the country s judiciary sri lanka needs to think on these things if it intends to entrench democratic development in the country thus far the country s track record on this score leaves much to be desired a predominant challenge facing progressives of south asia such as the aragalaists of sri lanka is how to forge ahead with the task of keeping democratization of the state on track a negative lesson in this connection could be taken from bangladesh where the ideals of the 1971 liberation war under shiekh mujibhur rahman were eroded by subsequent regimes which exploited divisive religious sentiments to come to power in the process religious minorities came to be harassed persecuted and savaged by extremists in the centre whereas the founding fathers of bangladesh had aimed to create a secular socialist state this was not allowed to come to pass by some governments which came to power after the sheikh which sought to convert bangladesh into a theocracy a harrowing account of how the ideals of 1971 came to be betrayed is graphically provided in the international best seller lajja by taslima nasrin the exiled human and women s right activist of bangladesh at page 60 of the 20th anniversary edition of lajja published by penguin books nasrin quotes some persons in authority in bangladesh as telling the country s hindus during the religious riots of 1979 the government has declared that islam is the state religion if you want to stay in an islamic country all of you must become muslims if you don t become muslims you will have to run away from this country not all the post liberation governments of bangladesh have turned against the ideals of 1971 and the present government is certainly not to be counted as one such administration but the lesson to be derived from bangladesh is that unless progressive opinion in a secular democracy is eternally vigilant and proactively involved in advancing democratic development a country aiming to tread the path of secularism and democracy could easily be preyed upon by the forces of religious extremism

the dissident shareholder group attempting to take over cytodyn inc is throwing in the towel after a judge denied a request to prevent the company s annual meeting from taking place next week the group led by portland businessman paul rosenbaum and bruce patterson ceo of incelldx a private diagnostics company based in the san francisco bay area had been mounting a proxy fight in recent months and proposed a slate of candidates for cytodyn s board the activist group had filed a lawsuit in delaware chancery court accusing cytodyn of thwarting a fair proxy contest cytodyn said the group hadn t complied with its bylaws and rejected the group s nomination notice the delaware judge sided with cytodyn dealing a major blow to their efforts we can t appeal it now because it will be too late because the vote is going to take place in the next eight days rosenbaum said on oct 20 the battle s over for the shareholders i don t know where this company s going but it doesn t have a bright future from what we can see cytodyn which is based in vancouver and trades over the counter has been trying to gain regulatory approval for a monoclonal antibody called leronlimab as a therapy for hiv cancer and covid 19 on wednesday the delaware judge issued another order in response to the activist group s request for an injunction stating that to force a delay of cytodyn s annual meeting particularly after it prevailed at trial would cause harm to the company all steps necessary to conduct that meeting have been taken canceling it a week before it is to go forward would result in substantial costs and serious confusion the judge wrote cytodyn said the meeting will take place as scheduled on oct 28 when results will be announced on the vote for its slate of six nominees including three current board members chair and chief medical officer dr scott kelly president and ceo nader pourhassan and jordan naydenov three cytodyn chairmen naydenov samir patel and alan timmins top the business journal s list of highest paid directors of public companies in oregon and southwest washington with compensation around 1 million apiece pourhassan earned 10 million in total compensation last year we started this thing because we wanted to call out the egregious compensation packages of this company rosenbaum said they have zero revenue we were looking for maximum value for shareholders and that means a change in management and we had the votes to do it if the judge would have allowed us to get on the ballot earlier this week the group pointed out on its website that cytodyn s management want to increase authorized shares by 200 million according to their most recent proxy statement it s the third time the company has requested an increase since april 2019 the rosenbaum group urged shareholders to vote no as the request means more value destruction the group said on its website advancing leronlimab cytodyn s board said the additional shares will give the company greater flexibility to use its common stock for business and financial purposes while acknowledging that stockholders could experience further dilution of their ownership according to the proxy

for the nine months ended september 30 2020 great southern president and ceo joseph w turner commented we are pleased with our third quarter earnings and continued strong financial position which reflects our associates ongoing commitment to take care of our customers in this uncertain health and economic environment while overall economic conditions continue to show signs of improvement uncertainty remains regarding the timing and magnitude of the recovery in the third quarter of 2021 we earned 20 4 million 1 49 per diluted common share compared to 13 5 million 0 96 per diluted common share for the same period in 2020 increased earnings were driven by a negative credit loss provision for our funded loan portfolio higher net interest income primarily driven by reduced deposit costs and ppp loan net deferred fee income recognition and increased non interest income mainly related to point of sale debit card and atm fees importantly our pre provision net revenue continues to be strong as noted above we recognized significant deferred fee income related to repaid ppp loans in this third quarter and we expect that we will recognize a significant portion of the remaining ppp fee income in the fourth quarter of 2021 earnings performance ratios were solid with an annualized return on average assets of 1 47 annualized return on average equity of 12 82 and efficiency ratio of 57 27 while our net interest margin has been somewhat pressured by increased deposits and resulting changes in asset mix net interest income was 133 7 million in the first nine months of 2021 up from 132 6 million in the same timeframe of 2020 thus far in 2021 loan production and activity in our markets has been quite vigorous but loan repayments including customers refinancing or selling stabilized projects that collateralize loans or completing the process of debt forgiveness for ppp loans have created significant headwinds outstanding loan totals have decreased 271 million compared to outstanding loans at december 31 2020 with 222 million of this decrease in our multi family loans category our pipeline of loan commitments and unfunded loans remains strong and increased by about 100 million from the end of the second quarter of 2021 this type of lending environment can be a dangerous time for banks like credit cycles in the past we recognize the current short term growth challenges and won t stretch our credit structure discipline for the sake of loan growth we manage for the long term and understand that we will have periodic ebbs in our loan growth turner added credit quality metrics remained excellent during the third quarter for the first nine months of 2021 net charge offs were 9 000 at september 30 2021 excluding fdic assisted acquired assets non performing assets were 5 2 million a decrease of 325 000 from june 30 2021 non performing assets to period end assets were 0 10 at the end of the third quarter pandemic related loan modifications

a second round of funding in 2021 through an amendment to the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act in the first round of the ppp we originated approximately 1 600 ppp loans totaling approximately 121 million as of september 30 2021 full forgiveness proceeds have been received from the sba for almost all of these ppp loans on december 27 2020 the economic aid to hard hit

march 31 2021 on march 30 2021 the ppp extension act of 2021 was signed extending the ppp an additional two months to may 31 2021 along with an additional 30 day period for the sba to process applications that were still pending as of may 31 2021 in the second round of the ppp we funded approximately 1 650 ppp loans totaling approximately 58 million as of october 11 2021 full forgiveness proceeds have been received from the sba for 829 of these ppp loans totaling approximately 26 million great southern receives fees from the sba for originating ppp loans based on the amount of each loan at september 30 2021 remaining net deferred fees related to ppp loans totaled 2 1 million the fees net of origination costs are deferred in accordance with standard accounting practices and will be accreted to interest income on loans over the contractual life of each loan these loans generally have a contractual maturity of two years from origination date but may be repaid or forgiven by the sba sooner if these loans are repaid or forgiven prior to their contractual maturity date the remaining deferred fee for such loans will be accreted to interest income immediately we expect a significant portion of these remaining net deferred fees will accrete to interest income during the remainder of 2021 with little of this income being recognized in 2022 in the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 great southern recorded approximately 1 6 million and 3 9 million respectively of net deferred fees in interest income on ppp loans loan modifications at september 30 2021 we

of 2021 increased 755 000 to 44 9 million compared to 44 2 million for the third quarter of 2020 net interest margin was 3 36 in both the third quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2020 for the three months ended september 30 2021 net interest margin increased one basis point compared to the net interest margin of 3 35 in the three months ended june 30 2021 in comparing the 2021 and 2020 third quarter periods the average yield on loans decreased 11 basis points while the average rate on interest bearing deposits declined 46 basis points the margin compression resulted from changes in the asset mix with average cash equivalents increasing 333 million and average investment securities increasing 4 million while average loans decreased 266 million without this additional liquidity the net interest margin would have been 23 basis points higher in addition the yield accretion on fdic assisted acquired loans was seven basis points less during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 the average interest rate spread was 3 22 for the three months ended september 30 2021 compared to 3 12 for the three months ended september 30 2020 and 3 18 for the three months ended june 30 2021 net interest income for the nine months ended september 30 2021 increased 1 1 million to 133 7 million compared to 132 6 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 net interest margin was 3 37 in the nine months ended september 30 2021 compared to 3 52 in the same period of 2020 a decrease of 15 basis points the decrease in the margin between the nine months ended september 30 2021 and the nine months ended september 30 2020 was primarily due to the same factors as discussed above for the comparison of the current year third quarter margin to the prior year third quarter margin with average cash equivalents increasing 286 million and average investment securities increasing 20 million without this additional liquidity the net interest margin would have been 21 basis points higher in the nine months ended september 30 2021 in addition the yield accretion on fdic assisted acquired loans was nine basis points lower during the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the average interest rate spread was 3 20 for the nine months ended september 30 2021 compared to 3 24 for the nine months ended september 30 2020 also the increase in interest cost from the subordinated notes issued in june 2020 net of the decrease in interest cost from the redemption of the subordinated notes issued in 2016 resulted in a decrease in net interest income of 1 4 million in the nine months ended september 30 2021 compared to the nine months ended september 30 2020 additionally the company s net interest income included accretion of net deferred fees related to ppp loans originated in 2020 and 2021 the amount of net deferred fees recognized in interest income was 1 6 million in the three months ended september 30 2021 compared to 1 1 million in the three months ended june 30 2021 and 1 2 million in the three months ended march 31 2021 the amount of net deferred fees recognized in interest income was 3 9 million and 1 0 million in the nine months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the amount of net deferred fees on ppp loans in the 2021 nine month period was greater than the 2020 nine month period due to loan forgiveness and repayments being received only during the three month period ended september 30 2020 compared to the entire nine month period during 2021 in october 2018 the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans the notional amount of the swap was 400 million with a contractual termination date in october 2025 as previously disclosed by the company on march 2 2020 the company and its swap counterparty mutually agreed to terminate this swap effective immediately the company received a payment of 45 9 million including accrued but unpaid interest from its swap counterparty as a result of this termination this 45 9 million less the accrued to date interest portion and net of deferred income taxes is reflected in the company s stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income and is being accreted to interest income on loans monthly through the original contractual termination date of october 6 2025 the company recorded interest income related to the swap of 2 0 million and 2 0 million in the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the company recorded interest income related to the swap of 6 1 million and 5 6 million in the nine months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the company currently expects to have a sufficient amount of eligible variable rate loans to continue to accrete this interest income ratably in future periods if this expectation changes and the amount of eligible variable rate loans decreases significantly the company may be required to recognize this interest income more rapidly previously the company s net interest income and margin have been positively impacted by significant additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in its fdic assisted transactions for each of the loan portfolios acquired the cash flow estimates increased during the prior periods based on payment histories and reduced credit loss expectations this resulted in increased income that has been spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools and therefore has decreased over time because the balance of these adjustments will be recognized generally over the remaining lives of the loan pools they will impact future periods as well the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income was 606 000 at september 30 2021 of the remaining adjustments affecting interest income we expect to recognize 178 000 of interest income during the remainder of 2021 as previously noted we adopted the new accounting standard related to accounting for credit losses as of january 1 2021 with the adoption of this standard there is no further reclassification of discounts from non accretable to accretable subsequent to december 31 2020 all adjustments made prior to december 31 2020 will continue to be accreted to interest income the impact to income of adjustments on all portfolios acquired in fdic assisted transactions for the reporting periods

primarily as a result of the following items point of sale and atm fees point of sale and atm fees increased 657 000 compared to the prior year period this increase was primarily due to a reduction in

levels of activity overdraft and insufficient funds fees overdraft and insufficient funds fees increased 210 000 compared to the prior year period this increase was primarily due to reduced fees in

loan sales decreased 537 000 compared to the prior year quarter the decrease was due to a decrease in originations of fixed rate single family mortgage loans during the 2021 period compared to the 2020 period fixed rate single family mortgage loans originated are generally subsequently sold in the secondary market these loan originations increased substantially when market interest rates decreased to historically low levels in 2020 as a result of the significant volume of refinance activity in recent periods and as market interest rates have moved a bit higher in the third quarter of

rate was 20 9 and 18 8 respectively except for the three months ended september 30 2020 these effective rates were at or below the statutory federal tax rate of 21 due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax exempt investments and tax exempt loans which reduced the company s effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the company s utilization of tax credits the level of tax exempt investments and loans the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre tax income in 2020 the company s state income tax expenses were higher than normal in various states due to the recognition of income for tax purposes related to the gain recognized on the termination of the interest rate swap state tax expense estimates have evolved throughout 2021 as taxable income and apportionment between states have been analyzed the company s

losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments effective january 1 2021 the cecl methodology replaces the incurred loss methodology with a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for loans held to maturity debt securities and other receivables measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired this standard requires the consideration of historical loss experience and current conditions adjusted for reasonable and supportable economic forecasts our 2020 financial statements were prepared under the incurred loss methodology standard upon adoption of the cecl accounting standard we increased the balance of our allowance for credit losses related to outstanding loans by 11 6 million and created a liability for potential losses related to the unfunded portion of our loans and commitments of approximately 8 7 million the after tax effect reduced our retained earnings by approximately 14 2 million the adjustment was based upon the company s analysis of then current conditions assumptions and economic forecasts at january 1 2021 management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards portfolio mix delinquency level or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in the national unemployment rate commercial real estate price index housing price index and national retail sales index worsening economic conditions from the covid 19 pandemic higher inflation or interest rates or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in provision expense management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses such as a watch list of problem loans and potential problem loans documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size loan type delinquencies financial analysis on going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work outs management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense if necessary to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level during the quarter ended september 30 2021 the company recorded a negative provision expense of 3 0 million on its portfolio of outstanding loans compared to a 4 5 million provision expense recorded for the quarter ended september 30 2020 during the nine months ended september 30 2021 the company recorded a negative provision expense of 3 7 million on its portfolio of outstanding loans compared to a 14 4 million provision expense recorded for the nine months ended september 30 2020 total net charge offs recoveries were 27 000 and 63 000 for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively total net charge offs were 9 000 and 427 000 for the nine months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the provision for losses on unfunded commitments for the three months ended september 30 2021 was 643 000 compared to a negative provision expense of 339 000 for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the level and mix of unfunded commitments resulted in a decrease in the required reserve for such potential losses in the nine month period general market conditions and unique circumstances related to specific industries and individual projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs in 2020 due to the covid 19 pandemic and its effects on the overall economy and unemployment the company increased its provision for credit losses and increased its allowance for credit losses even though actual realized net charge offs were very low the bank s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1 56 1 32 and 1 56 at september 30 2021 december 31 2020 and june 30 2021 respectively prior to january 1 2021 the ratio excluded the fdic assisted acquired loans management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio at september 30 2021 based on recent reviews of the bank s loan portfolio and current economic conditions if challenging economic conditions were to last longer than anticipated or deteriorate further or management s assessment of the loan portfolio were to change additional loan loss provisions could be required thereby adversely affecting the company s future results of operations and financial condition asset quality prior to adoption of the cecl accounting standard on january 1 2021 fdic assisted acquired non performing assets including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans were not included in the totals or in the discussion of non performing loans potential problem loans and foreclosed assets these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and accounted for in pools the loan pools were analyzed rather than the individual loans the performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the company s five fdic assisted transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates in the tables below fdic assisted acquired assets are included in their particular collateral categories and then the total fdic assisted acquired assets are subtracted from the total balances at september 30 2021 non performing assets excluding all fdic assisted acquired assets were 5 2

a percentage of total assets were 0 10 at september 30 2021 compared to 0 07 at december 31 2020 and 0 10 at june 30 2021 as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio changes in economic and market conditions and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances the level of non performing assets will fluctuate compared to december 31 2020 and june 30 2021 and excluding all fdic assisted acquired loans non performing loans increased 2 0 million and decreased 343 000 respectively to 5 0 million at september 30 2021 and foreclosed and repossessed assets

fdic assisted acquired loans potential problem loans decreased 1 6 million and 566 000 respectively to 2 8 million at september 30 2021 due to the impact on economic conditions from covid 19 it is possible that we could experience an increase in potential problem loans in the remainder of 2021 as noted we experienced an increased level of loan modifications in late march through june 2020 however total loan modifications were much lower at december 31 2020 and decreased further at september 30 2021 in accordance with the cares act and guidance from the banking regulatory agencies we made certain short term modifications to loan terms to help our customers navigate through the current pandemic situation although loan modifications were made they did not automatically result in these loans being classified as troubled debt restructurings potential problem loans or non performing loans if more severe or lengthier negative impacts of the covid 19 pandemic occur or the effects of the sba loan programs and other loan and stimulus programs do not enable companies and individuals to completely recover financially this could result in additional and or longer term modifications which may be deemed to be troubled debt restructurings additional potential problem loans and or additional non performing loans further actions on our part including additions to the allowance for

financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap these non gaap financial measures include core net interest income core net interest margin and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio we calculate core net interest income and core net interest margin by subtracting the impact of adjustments regarding changes in expected cash flows related to pools of loans we acquired through fdic assisted transactions from reported net interest income and net interest margin management believes that core net interest income and core net interest margin are useful in assessing the company s core performance and trends in light of the fluctuations that can occur related to updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 fdic assisted transactions in calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets we subtract period end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations as it provides a method to assess management s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets which are subjective components of valuation facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers in addition management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance these non gaap financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on gaap financial measures because not all companies use the same calculation of non gaap measures this presentation may not be comparable

executive officer jim eccher said an improving economy and conservative positioning resulted in solid core earnings trends relative to last quarter featuring increased spread income a stable margin and controlled expenses loan growth remains a challenge in the face of low line utilization rates and tepid overall demand with continuing elevated prepayments the end result was flat total loan volumes relative to last quarter exclusive of ppp loan settlement activity deposit inflows remain robust and resulted in a further increase in excess liquidity as evidenced by a 23 9 million increase in average cash on the balance sheet during the quarter we continue to deploy a portion of the excess liquidity on our balance sheet in short duration securities with yields far below the aggregate portfolio yield the combination of these factors largely resulted in a two basis point reported increase in our net interest margin over the linked quarter our credit quality metrics and expectations have continued to improve as the chicago area seems to be moving towards a more normalized environment and we recorded a 1 5 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses this quarter looking forward i am optimistic on loan growth trends for the remainder of the year and continue to believe reported margin trends will be dominated by changes in liquidity levels on our balance sheet rather than any fundamental change in our business i believe old second remains conservatively positioned to meet the challenges that may present themselves as our expenses remain well controlled our business is well diversified customer activity is increasing and our underwriting has remained disciplined and consistent i would like to thank our employees for their continued hard work in delivering a solid quarter while focusing on exceptional customer service as we move towards a more normal routine eccher continued in late july we announced an agreement to acquire west suburban

the steepest 12 month brent backwardation since 2013 is yet another bullish indicator for oil prices opec appears in no rush to add supply to markets and appears to be producing below its self imposed production ceiling the oil price rally is far from over with inventory drawdowns across the world suggesting the market is far from being balanced even after hitting the highest levels in several years in recent days oil prices have further room to rise this winter at least short term market fundamentals suggest so analysts say inventories around the world have fallen to below the pre pandemic five year average as stocks are depleting with demand bouncing back amid a weaker supply response from producers the energy crunch in europe and asia and record high natural gas and coal prices add more arguments to the bullish case for oil in coming months as a switch from gas to oil products such as fuel oil and diesel especially in asia is already underway the structure of the oil futures curve a year from now also points to a tight market and headroom for higher crude prices stocks draw as demand rebounds on the demand side recovering economies and mobility have boosted global oil demand in recent months leading to inventory drawdowns that have reduced global stocks to below recent averages in both the united states and the oecd developed economies as a whole commercial oil stocks have dropped to below pre covid five year averages after more than reversing the huge builds from the spring and summer last year reuters market analyst john kemp notes as of the latest reporting week u s commercial crude oil inventories stood at 427 million barrels around 6 percent below the five year average for this time of year gasoline inventories were about 2 percent below the five year average distillate fuel inventories were 9 percent lower while propane propylene inventories were a massive 21 percent below the five year average for this time of year the latest eia data showed in oecd commercial stocks in august were 162 million barrels below the pre covid five year average the international energy agency iea said in its latest monthly report last week preliminary data for the u s europe and japan show on land industry stocks fell by a further 23 million barrels in september related exxon considers abandoning major oil and gas projects to appease esg investors globally implied q3 refined product balances show the largest draw in eight years which explains the strong increase in refinery margins in september despite significantly higher crude prices said the iea the energy crisis in europe and asia could additionally boost global oil demand by 500 000 barrels per day bpd compared to a normal market without a natural gas and coal crunch the agency noted raising its 2021 and 2022 global oil demand forecasts supply lags demand as opec keeps market tight while demand has rebounded despite the summer covid flare ups in the u s and asia supply additions to the oil market have been lagging behind the pace of growing demand first it was hurricane ida that limited u s oil supply from the gulf of mexico from the end of august through most of september supply will not recover to its full capacity until early next year as a shell operated platform will remain offline until the end of 2021 at the same time the opec group continues to keep the market tight adding just 400 000 bpd each month to its overall supply that s despite calls from the u s and other consuming nations to open the taps and tame the high oil prices and despite the energy crisis which has forced utilities to fire up oil fueled power generation amid record high natural gas prices boosting demand for oil products opec leaders point to expected oversupply next year and to the need to look beyond the next two months in their decision to continue to reverse only 400 000 bpd per month of their cuts saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman last week basically ruled out the option that the alliance would respond to the oil price rally by adding more supply than planned we should look way beyond the tip of our noses because if you do and take 22 into account you will end up by end of 22 with a huge amount of overstocks he said on thursday related oil prices dip as china considers market intervention moreover output figures point to the fact that opec is actually pumping well below its collective production ceiling as per bloomberg s estimates if all members of the alliance stuck to their respective production ceilings in september the overall production of the group would have been 747 000 bpd higher than what it was it looks like opec is not too worried about demand destruction at 85 oil at least not for now the group s leaders stress the importance of a longer term vision and stability on the market expecting increased supply in 2022 from both their own wells and from the u s shale patch which appears to be maintaining its capex discipline even at 80 oil advertisement blowout backwardation points to even higher oil prices at the end of 2021 however supply remains tight while backwardation a key indicator of a tightening market between the december 2021 brent contract and the december 2022 contract has jumped to above 8 per barrel in recent days this is the steepest 12 month brent backwardation since 2013 according to refinitiv eikon data cited by reuters energy crunch is carving out an usd80 b oil floor japanese mufg bank said in its oil market weekly report last week the blowout in brent crude timespreads in recent trading days signals that the pathway even higher oil prices remains firm the bank s research team wrote by tsvetana paraskova for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

by faraz shauketaly the passing away of one of the last of sri lanka s big men drew immediate concern as to the state of independent broadcasting in sri lanka such was the impact that rajendram rajamahendran who passed away in july 2021 had on the political and commercial landscape of this island nation our paths crossed some years ago when i decided to compile a book on the wealthy in sri lanka i had to create some hype and awareness and i called on good fortune from the past a maternal uncle of mine had worked for the maharaja organisation and had maintained a good rapport with mr rajamahendran after my uncle s death the friendship continued with my aunt keeping in touch along with my cousin who was working in the region i called my cousin and aunt and asked for a reintroduction to mr rajamahendran i got an email invitation to see him in his office we had a brief chat and he then said i was to coordinate with chevaan daniel for whatever publicity i needed for the book i had coverage on radio television interviews and cover on the prime time news my friend angela seneviratne assured me that i had got more than anyone would have wanted after the launch i asked for an appointment and went to the head office armed with limited edition copies of the book mr rajamahendran greeted me and as we walked towards his office he laughed and said with all your detective work you could not get a photograph of me i admitted that was the case and related that my printer had sourced one for me and had quoted rs 50 000 over the phone i explained to the boss that even if the man had quoted 250 000 i would have happily paid and confirmed over the phone it was his turn to smile but he was happier when i told him that the offer of a picture for rs 50 000 was not of him anyway he was very private and didn t want any publicity for himself the boss thanked me for the books i presented to him and told me that he had purchased several copies off the shelf from a leading departmental store which was the first to stock the book he had already supported me a colossus mr rajamahendran was truly a colossus when i saw an advert for a fireside chat proclaiming that six daring businessmen would be present i immediately took umbrage what s the point i would say to anyone who would listen the only daring person in our country has to be rr my favourite mantra was rr built the maharaja organisation twice over we are now better than ever before the boss believed not in publicity but in truth i always found it interesting that despite his private personality he owned easily the most vociferous media stable in the country he was passionately and pro actively involved in his media stables he uniquely possessed an intrinsic understanding of the people s unspoken voice in 2015 the story that would eventually change the governor of the central bank replace the then minister of finance responsible for the calling of a presidential commission of inquiry and perhaps reshaping the trajectory of the political landscape in sri lanka broke ground news1st led the way in highlighting the blatant conflict of interest and the political patronage extended to the perpetrators in what was to become popularly known as the central bank bond scam the attorney general s department described it as the largest ever financial fraud inflicted upon the people of sri lanka not once did mr rajamahendran flinch from carrying on the expose of all exposes in contemporary sri lankan history by then mr rajamahendran had already spotted a niche in the market and newsline live was born in july 2015 we broadcast at the almost god forsaken hour of 7 am my colleague the former presidential spokesperson and later diplomat bandula jayasekera had his own early morning programme pathikada on sirasa internally there was opposition to both bandula and me the boss made the final decision and we were on our way bandula always reminded me that we were opening the batting for the group ensure he warned me gravely don t put the boss in a bad mood with a poor performance the rest of the group will blame us he assured me what more inspiration did we need other than to satisfy the exacting expectations of our chairman we were both mature enough to understand that he was in effect mentoring our programmes it became a matter for concern amongst colleagues that no matter what the subject of discussion was newsline found a way to highlight the bond scam and the sheer audacity of then prime minister wickremesinghe chevaan daniel came up with the 6 minute radio talk segment on yesfm talk of the town there were rumblings of discontent about my continuous highlighting of the then prime minister s failings in the bond scam the prime time talk of the town was shifted to an hour later the boss advised me that i ought to stand my ground boss gave me as he did to all opportunity as the de facto editor in chief he could have ordered me to change my content but no he did not interfere forthright mr rajamahendran was forthright not once did he ask me to change my presentation of the bond scam we collected a team of regular commentators one of whom was described by a then serving judge of the supreme court as a tv advocate mr rajamahendran was incensed that the public s monies had been squandered and virtually robbed by the perpetrators of the bond scam he did not leave any stone unturned he even called whilst on holiday abroad to remind the editorial team to keep the bond scam in the spotlight mr rajamahendran to me was the ultimate creator of opportunity so many youngsters were quietly funded by him to further their education when they succeeded more responsibility was thrust upon them enabling them to shine on some even left the group but boss did not hold anything against them even the gentleman would only have expected them to have the courtesy of informing him they were going mr rajamahendran s gentlemanly ways were infectious boss would routinely walk down to the car park and bid his goodbyes there once a visiting head of state wanted to have a cuppa with the boss after a small event they retreated to what i often called the comfort zone boss s office the leaders security detail were beside themselves when a very long time had elapsed with no sign of the leader emerging they had tried to guide the leader to his car after the event only to be told by their leader i am having a cup of tea with my friend boss insisted that no matter how contentious the topic of discussion guests on our network were just that guests visiting our home we were not to get personal and attack them debate the issue professionally and be gentlemanly about it and of course the boss was intensely loyal woe betide anyone who made false accusations against any of us journalists on a live programme once he demanded that a guest retract his accusation against me that i was slinging mud he wanted the guest to know that i was very much part of the cmg networks yet another occasion when i was discussing a national leader i kept referring to him as mr so and so he looked at me and said you know the proper way is to use the title honourable i said but this person is anything but that s the way it must be counselling give the correct title there was a boyish mischievousness in him as well one weekend i decided to take my friends from britain s channel 4 to mannar it was a visit that had nothing to do with the group and i was careful to not involve them the londoners were convinced that the skeletal remains being uncovered were related to the troubles of the ethnic conflict i wanted to show them that in the so called new ambiance sri lanka was uncovering as opposed to covering up surprise imagine my surprise when i was on the primetime news that evening highlighting me as being on the trail of a big story well if channel 4 had been right it would have been a scoop the remains were later identified by a florida lab as being 600 plus years old long before prabhakaran was even dreamt of when i went to south korea with my friend asoka wijegunaratne with a stop over in hong kong everyone in the office including and especially bandula jayasekera were convinced i was on the trail for arjuna mahendran it was a lot of fun but it was serious too many were the times that i was sent off to meet legal eagles about some angle that manifested itself at times i feared the cost involved but i soon learned that what boss wanted was to be perfectly correct not only from a moral perspective but also from a legal view it would be fair to say that my boss found the advisories from legal frustrating at times holding him us back from going gung ho after culprits it never stopped him and the news1st identity kept going year in year out whoever was in power it didn t mean in the slightest that he downgraded legal counsel merely that he found it impinging on his style of news a free spirit of news it was clear to me that thanks to the opportunity created by rajendram rajamahendran our network was the permanent opposition to any government in power on air live i could not simply be quiet i announced that in my view my boss ought to be the prime minister boss was unimpressed he chided me immediately with one word by sms i had a cup of coffee with him immediately after the programme perhaps one of the greatest tributes came from former governor and president s counsel maithri gunaratne he said that mr rajamahendran was the real opposition to any government of the day it was almost like no matter who won and how handsome the margin of victory was the real opposition was found in the voice of his media stables all popularly known by the one name sirasa it has been said that had the circumstance of his birth been different that is if he had been born a sinhalese son of the soil he would have attained the highest office in this independent nation many regretted the timing of his passing with sri lanka in the throes of its most exacting and challenging period in its entire history the cv19 pandemic has affected every nook and cranny of the nation and there has been no let in the amount of money and time being squandered either on vanity projects or projects purely designed to please the in house stooges of the day the people only ever got the fungi laden crumbs anyway the principal mitigatory power remained the maharaja organisation cmg media stables sirasa shakthi and tv1 and its radio stations boss was the driving force and was unafraid to remain strong in the face of the most intense intimidatory tactics many others of lesser stature would have done a u turn a long time ago not for him the u turn the boss was truly the iron man of sri lanka hard work president mohamed nasheed of the maldives where he is now the speaker described mr rajamahendran s success as sheer hard work indeed it was some years ago i asked for an appointment to see him my sms went out at just past 5 am he responded immediately come now i met him two and a half hours later after my programme naturally i asked about the early timing he assured me that he had been in office since early morning as he had discovered an issue with our flagship operation and he wanted to get to the bottom of it he was intense he was always decisive and constantly incisive it has taken me a long time to finish this article which i started within minutes of learning of his passing from a friend chevaan daniel is not in the habit of waking us up in the early hours when my samsung displayed chevaan daniel i knew this was the confirmation that i had just heard i was devastated boss was strong in mind and in physique in my view boss had a good 12 years of leadership in him incongruously he passed on july 25th when on that same day several years ago our group was burning to ashes rajendram rajamahendran rose from those ashes phoenix like to recreate the maharaja organisation to be better stronger than we ever were the killi legacy is a springboard for our group s future no one will be happier than rr that all of whom he has left behind will aspire to use that springboard to take all our businesses to even greater heights whilst fully and unequivocally being truly representative of sri lanka s opportunity hopes and aspirations boss was intensely proud to be sri lankan he was proud of his roots despite the many sticks and stones and bombs that were thrown his way in a philosophical way it was perhaps comforting that this gentle giant left in the way he did a victim to the pandemic cv19 the alternative may well have been leaving us all as a victim of a lack of political self confidence perhaps in a far more brutal and malicious manner the wreaths that we did not receive we know all about from the hundreds of thousands of people in sri lanka and around the world who were shocked by his untimely demise and expressed their sorrow and prayed for the soul of mr rajendram rajamahendran ultimately the facts are these that a young man from colombo took his business with for a while his brother maha to enormous heights ending up as one of the largest privately held conglomerates in sri lanka to appreciate the enormity of his contribution to the broadcast media one must understand that boss was a man from the minority community he had no need to wear a badge of honour he truly was a son of this soil he truly believed that we in sri lanka were as one save for some miscreants who traded then and even do so now on the cheapness of the communal card that did not detract boss and he strove on his forward trajectory of the ultimate one sri lanka rajendram rajamahendran was born a maharaja he lived his life as a maharajah farewell boss forever missed forever will you remain my chief inspirator lala salama mzee rajendram rajamahendran one of a kind

and the most common form of glomerulonephritis 2 3 a group of renal disorders that causes damage to the glomeruli the filtration units of the kidney hindering their ability to carry out their essential functions in igan a combination of genetic and environmental factors causes patients to produce galactose deficient iga1 gd iga1 whereupon the patients immune system reacts with producing specific autoantibodies the binding of these igg autoantibodies to gd iga1 leads to the formation of immune complexes in the circulation the immune complexes then accumulate in the glomerular mesangium where they induce local inflammation mesangial proliferation glomerulosclerosis and loss of renal function 4 5 patients with igan may experience different symptoms which are highly variable and may include blood and or protein leaking into the urine high blood pressure interstitial lung disease glomerulosclerosis scarring of the kidneys blood vessels and a slow progression to chronic kidney disease about 40 of the patients with igan progress to end stage renal disease within 20 years of diagnosis 3 4 6 7 worldwide igan incidence is estimated at 2 5 per 100 000 8 currently there

santa ana ca accesswire october 20 2021 infinity bank otcqb inft the bank today reported financial results for the third quarter ended september 30 2021 financial highlights for the third quarter of 2021 the bank realized its fourth consecutive profitable quarter reversed 1 98 million valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset total securities available for sale increased by 52 5 million total deposits increased by 123 1 million loans for the quarters ended september 30 2021 and june 30 2021 total loans were relatively flat at 153 6 million and 153 5 million respectively however during the third quarter of 2021 7 2 million paycheck protection program ppp loans were forgiven bringing the balance of ppp loans down to 5 6 million which means that non ppp loans grew by approximately 7 3 million for the quarter non ppp loans generally yield significantly more than ppp loans so this is an important growth point for the bank in terms of income generation total loans increased by 17 7 million or 13 when compared to december 31 2020 as of september 30 2021 the bank recorded a year to date increase of 88 4 million in new loan commitments the loan to deposit ratio decreased to 51 3 as of september 30 2021 compared to 87 1 as of june 31 2021 the decrease in the loan to deposit ratio was due to an increase in total deposits during the third quarter of 2021 given the current economic conditions the bank increased its allowance for loan and lease losses alll to 1 4 from 1 3 on all non ppp loans the alll was 1 38 1 20 and 1 16 of total loans as of september 30 2021 june 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively ppp loans are guaranteed by the u s government and therefore do not require an alll amount to be allocated to them and therefore as the total ppp loans outstanding decrease the alll as a of total loans increases the yield on average loans for the quarter ended september 30 2021 was 6 39 an increase of 69 basis points when compared to the previous quarter and 110 basis points when compared to the same quarter in 2020 the yield on average loans increased 47 basis points to 5 94 from the nine month period ended september 30 2020 the increases in the yields are directly related to the amount mix of loans as ppp loans decrease as a percentage of total loans the yield will increase as noted above deposits total deposits increased by 123 1 million or 69 8 to 299 4 million when compared to second quarter ended june 30 2021 and 127 0 million or 73 7 when compared to december 31 2020 noninterest bearing demand accounts increased by 103 0 million or 105 8 during the third quarter of 2021 to 200 3 million as of september 30 2021 and comprises 67 of total deposits noninterest bearing demand accounts increased 99 6 million or 98 9 when compared to december 31 2020 interest bearing deposits grew by 10 7 million or 13 5 when compared to june 30 2021 and by 18 0 million or 25 1 from december 31 2020 to september 30 2021 during the third quarter of 2021 the bank purchased 9 4 million of brokered time deposits these deposits bear interest at 0 08 and mature in the third quarter of 2022 the drivers behind this dramatic increase were the seasonal growth in the amounts our clients hold with the bank as well as the growth in the number of clients already at the bank the cost of funds for the quarter ended september 30 2021 was 21 basis points a decrease of 5 basis points when compared to the quarter ended june 30 2021 and a decrease of 18 basis points when compared to the same quarter of the previous year the low cost of funds is a result of the bank s continued focus on long term deposit relationships that are not solely based on pricing as well as the large increase in non interest bearing demand during the third quarter of 2021 net interest income net interest income in the third quarter of 2021 was 2 3 million up 318 thousand or 16 0 from the second quarter of 2021 and up 736 thousand or 46 8 over the third quarter of 2020 for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the bank s net interest income equaled 6 2 million an increase of 2 2 million or 56 7 from the nine months ended september 30 2020 the bank s primary source of net interest income was driven by interest income from loans the bank s net interest margin decreased by 50 basis points to 3 49 during the third quarter 2021 when compared to the previous linked quarter the decrease in the net interest margin was due to the mix of interest earning assets at september 30 2021 38 of the interest earning assets were held in lower yielding cash and due from banks versus 19 as of june 30 2021 which was driven by the rapid growth of deposits during the third quarter of 2021 the bank s net interest margin increased 17 basis points when compared to the quarter ended september 30 2020 due to the decrease in ppp loans as of september 30 2021 as compared to the prior year ppp loans earn interest at 1 and comprised 21 of the bank s total loans as of september 30 2020 versus 4 as of september 30 2021 non interest income for the quarter ended september 30 2021 total non interest income totaled 92 thousand an increase of 11 thousand or 13 6 from the previous quarter ended june 30 2021 non interest income increased 41 thousand or 80 4 when compared to the like period ended september 30 2020 for the nine months ended september 30 2021 total non interest income equaled 224 thousand an increase of 66 thousand or 41 8 when compared to the nine months ended september 30 2020 the increase in non interest income for all periods was driven equally by service charges and other income non interest expense total non interest expense increased by 275 thousand or 19 2 versus the previous quarter ended june 30 2021 non interest expense increased 163 thousand or 10 5 when compared to the same period ended september 30 2020 the increase in non interest expense for the three months ended september 30 2021 was primarily due to incentives which are based on increases in loans and deposits for the nine months ended september 30 2021 non interest expense totaled 4 8 million an increase of 607 thousand or 14 4 from the like period in 2020 and was primarily related to the addition of staff to support the bank s asset growth of 73 year over year income tax expense due to the net operating losses incurred during the bank s first few years of operation the bank realized a deferred tax asset primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards as there had been uncertainty related to the realization of the deferred tax asset a valuation allowance was recorded against the full value of the deferred tax asset since the bank has been profitable for the past twelve consecutive months and believes that the net operating losses will be fully utilized the bank reversed the 1 89 million valuation allowance during the third quarter of 2021 resulting in a tax credit the tax credit is offset by the current year tax expense at a rate of approximately 31 net income the bank realized its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability and recorded net income of 2 2 million or 0 66 per share which includes the tax credit of 1 89 million 0 57 for the period ending september 30 2021 this represents an increase in profitability of 622 from previous linked quarter of 302 thousand or 0 09 per share and 2 3 million increase over the net loss of 165 thousand or 0 05 per share when compared to september 30 2020 net income for the nine months ended september 30 2021 totaled 2 7 million or 0 82 per share an increase of 3 3 million as compared

santa ana ca accesswire october 20 2021 infinity bank otcqb inft the bank today reported financial results for the third quarter ended september 30 2021 financial highlights for the third quarter of 2021 the bank realized its fourth consecutive profitable quarter reversed 1 98 million valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset total securities available for sale increased by 52 5 million total deposits increased by 123 1 million loans for the quarters ended september 30 2021 and june 30 2021 total loans were relatively flat at 153 6 million and 153 5 million respectively however during the third quarter of 2021 7 2 million paycheck protection program ppp loans were forgiven bringing the balance of ppp loans down to 5 6 million which means that non ppp loans grew by approximately 7 3 million for the quarter non ppp loans generally yield significantly more than ppp loans so this is an important growth point for the bank in terms of income generation total loans increased by 17 7 million or 13 when compared to december 31 2020 as of september 30 2021 the bank recorded a year to date increase of 88 4 million in new loan commitments the loan to deposit ratio decreased to 51 3 as of september 30 2021 compared to 87 1 as of june 31 2021 the decrease in the loan to deposit ratio was due to an increase in total deposits during the third quarter of 2021 given the current economic conditions the bank increased its allowance for loan and lease losses alll to 1 4 from 1 3 on all non ppp loans the alll was 1 38 1 20 and 1 16 of total loans as of september 30 2021 june 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively ppp loans are guaranteed by the u s government and therefore do not require an alll amount to be allocated to them and therefore as the total ppp loans outstanding decrease the alll as a of total loans increases the yield on average loans for the quarter ended september 30 2021 was 6 39 an increase of 69 basis points when compared to the previous quarter and 110 basis points when compared to the same quarter in 2020 the yield on average loans increased 47 basis points to 5 94 from the nine month period ended september 30 2020 the increases in the yields are directly related to the amount mix of loans as ppp loans decrease as a percentage of total loans the yield will increase as noted above deposits total deposits increased by 123 1 million or 69 8 to 299 4 million when compared to second quarter ended june 30 2021 and 127 0 million or 73 7 when compared to december 31 2020 noninterest bearing demand accounts increased by 103 0 million or 105 8 during the third quarter of 2021 to 200 3 million as of september 30 2021 and comprises 67 of total deposits noninterest bearing demand accounts increased 99 6 million or 98 9 when compared to december 31 2020 interest bearing deposits grew by 10 7 million or 13 5 when compared to june 30 2021 and by 18 0 million or 25 1 from december 31 2020 to september 30 2021 during the third quarter of 2021 the bank purchased 9 4 million of brokered time deposits these deposits bear interest at 0 08 and mature in the third quarter of 2022 the drivers behind this dramatic increase were the seasonal growth in the amounts our clients hold with the bank as well as the growth in the number of clients already at the bank the cost of funds for the quarter ended september 30 2021 was 21 basis points a decrease of 5 basis points when compared to the quarter ended june 30 2021 and a decrease of 18 basis points when compared to the same quarter of the previous year the low cost of funds is a result of the bank s continued focus on long term deposit relationships that are not solely based on pricing as well as the large increase in non interest bearing demand during the third quarter of 2021 net interest income net interest income in the third quarter of 2021 was 2 3 million up 318 thousand or 16 0 from the second quarter of 2021 and up 736 thousand or 46 8 over the third quarter of 2020 for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the bank s net interest income equaled 6 2 million an increase of 2 2 million or 56 7 from the nine months ended september 30 2020 the bank s primary source of net interest income was driven by interest income from loans the bank s net interest margin decreased by 50 basis points to 3 49 during the third quarter 2021 when compared to the previous linked quarter the decrease in the net interest margin was due to the mix of interest earning assets at september 30 2021 38 of the interest earning assets were held in lower yielding cash and due from banks versus 19 as of june 30 2021 which was driven by the rapid growth of deposits during the third quarter of 2021 the bank s net interest margin increased 17 basis points when compared to the quarter ended september 30 2020 due to the decrease in ppp loans as of september 30 2021 as compared to the prior year ppp loans earn interest at 1 and comprised 21 of the bank s total loans as of september 30 2020 versus 4 as of september 30 2021 non interest income for the quarter ended september 30 2021 total non interest income totaled 92 thousand an increase of 11 thousand or 13 6 from the previous

income equaled 224 thousand an increase of 66 thousand or 41 8 when compared to the nine months ended september 30 2020 the increase in non interest income for all periods was driven equally by service charges and other income non interest expense total non interest expense increased by 275 thousand or 19 2 versus the previous quarter ended june 30 2021 non interest expense increased 163 thousand or 10 5 when compared to the same period ended september 30 2020 the increase in non interest expense for the three months ended september 30 2021 was primarily due to incentives which are based on increases in loans and deposits for the nine months ended september 30 2021 non interest expense totaled 4 8 million an increase of 607 thousand or 14 4 from the like period in 2020 and was primarily related to the addition of staff to support the bank s asset growth of 73 year over year income tax expense due to the net operating losses incurred during the bank s first few years of operation the bank realized a deferred tax asset primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards as there had been uncertainty related to the realization of the deferred tax asset a valuation allowance was recorded against the full value of the deferred tax asset since the bank has been profitable for the past twelve consecutive months and believes that the net operating losses will be fully utilized the bank reversed the 1 89 million valuation allowance during the third quarter of 2021 resulting in a tax credit the tax credit is offset by the current year tax expense at a rate of approximately 31 net income the bank realized its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability and recorded net income of 2 2 million or 0 66 per share which includes the tax credit of 1 89 million 0

worldwide currently there are no approved treatments that can specifically prevent the production of galactose deficient iga1 gd iga1 nor its corresponding autoantibody 1 we believe felzartamab could have great potential as a targeted therapy for patients with autoimmune renal diseases who currently have limited treatment options said mikhail akimov md senior vice president and global head drug development at morphosys dosing of the first igan patient is an exciting milestone for morphosys physicians and patients alike as we are rapidly broadening our development program for felzartamab felzartamab mor202 is an investigational therapeutic human monoclonal antibody derived from morphosys hucal r antibody library and directed against cd38 by targeting cd38 felzartamab has the potential to deplete the cd38 positive plasma cells which may ultimately improve the patient s kidney functions this multi center randomized double blind parallel group placebo controlled trial will enroll approximately 48 patients and is designed to assess the efficacy safety and pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic of felzartamab in patients with igan nct05065970 the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of felzartamab compared with placebo the primary endpoint is relative change in urine protein to creatinine ratio and will be assessed for each patient 9 months after treatment initiation study sites are located in europe north america and asia pacific excluding greater china about igan immunoglobulin a nephropathy igan also known as berger s disease is an autoimmune disease and the most common form of glomerulonephritis 2 3 a group of renal disorders that causes damage to the glomeruli the filtration units of the kidney hindering their ability to carry out their essential functions in igan a combination of genetic and environmental factors causes patients to produce galactose deficient iga1 gd iga1 whereupon the patients immune system reacts with producing specific autoantibodies the binding of these igg autoantibodies to gd iga1 leads to the formation of immune complexes in the circulation the immune complexes then accumulate in the glomerular mesangium where they induce local inflammation mesangial proliferation glomerulosclerosis and loss of renal function 4 5 patients with igan may experience different symptoms which are highly variable and may include blood and or protein leaking into the urine high blood pressure interstitial lung disease glomerulosclerosis scarring of the kidneys blood vessels and a slow progression to chronic kidney disease about 40 of the patients with igan progress to end stage renal disease within 20 years of diagnosis 3 4 6 7 worldwide igan incidence is estimated at 2 5 per 100 000 8 currently there

activtrades weekly by chris illing www activtrades bs there is still a shortage of containers all over the world the ships are jammed in the ports for example in los angeles the pandemic is disrupting global trade anyone looking at world trade is somewhat astonished there is a lack of product and raw materials everywhere and prices are sky rocketing our local super value chain warned consumers to expect rising prices in the food store the containers seem to be the bottleneck what is going on you could say that this is the perfect storm that has been brewing and it is also a long lasting one it all started with covid 19 the pandemic has distorted the situation and unbalanced supply and demand when the first us stimulus checks were issued in april 2020 and people started buying again the demand skyrocketed world trade suddenly just could not keep up with the demand the shipping companies did not have enough capacity to transport the goods in demand it was not because the shipowners sent fewer ships on to the water because of covid on the contrary it all started in long beach california in april 2020 the ships got stuck there and the port could not keep up with the handling we were able to see in real time how this traffic jam affected companies long beach is one of the ports through where a great deal of goods arrive from china into the us suddenly thousands of containers full of clothing and shoes were standing somewhere on some ship waiting to enter the port of long beach the ordered goods simply did not arrive in the shops shortly afterwards you could see how the stock market price of nike collapsed there have been attempts to bypass long beach as an importing port some shipping companies or freight forwarders have tried to call at the east coast however this means the ships had to travel through the suez canal from asia the calculation was that you would then have longer transit times but that you would be better able to plan that was the biggest problem off long beach you did not know when a ship could be unloaded maritime trade is primarily about predictability at least that was the idea but then the ever given got wedged in the wall of the suez canal and the ships were backed up there as well and we had the same problem that nobody knew will it take one day until the ship is free again or will it take one month this of course meant that planning was no longer an option there was the idea of sending the ships via the route around south africa the calculation was that they would be at the ports of destination before the ships that were backed up in the suez canal it was assumed that it would pile up again at the ports when the canal became free again and that has been confirmed even if not to the extent that many feared this is a chain of unfortunate coincidences we now see again and again that port capacities collapse when there are covia outbreaks the authorities in yantian have just closed large parts of the world s fourth largest port this also affects the supply chains in addition the us is currently acting like a black hole for containers many countries are sending goods to the us but the containers stay there because hardly anything is exported from the us and nobody wants to send the boxes back empty one thing about containers is that they are often not where you need them but that also has an advantage containers are also a supply and demand commodity the increased demand and undersupply of capacity has caused prices to skyrocket on some routes to an extent that has surprised even die hard supply chain experts we have seen connections that normally go for 2 000 that are now 16 000 this is simply because there is no more space on the ships if we can better predict when which ship will arrive where planning can be done much more efficiently along the rest of the value chain and prices will decrease again many companies are currently investing in this in order to come up with solutions one must see that maritime trade is still the backbone of the world economy it is just not economical to transport toilet paper by plane and yes there is now a train line from china to germany nevertheless 99 percent of all goods come by ship that will not change either recently it was reported that an incredible number of new ships had been ordered but a ship is not ready tomorrow it takes a long time to get on the water and there is very little unused capacity in the entire chain the ports also are extremely full one of the biggest problems is that goods that are currently on the water represent tied up capital this applies to nike shoes and car parts but the more it is the more expensive the goods are one solution could therefore be for companies to gain a better overview of where which goods are currently and when their predicted arrival is this makes it much easier to plan many processes from one end of the supply chain to the other if one knows six weeks in advance that the

securities and exchange commission i will now turn the call over to matt missad matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you dick and good afternoon everyone we have been spouting superlatives for several quarters as the ufp team makes a positive habit of breaking records the third quarter of 2021 fits sweetly into that pattern and exemplifies our 2021 mantra we will win the progress through the first three quarters has been spectacular and i am continually amazed at the ufp team on our team no one wants to be defeated and regardless of the obstacle or adversary they just beat it so in spite of a lumber market drop of nearly 50 from the end of q2 and the resulting margin degradation from our variable priced items the strength of our diversified business model which includes diverse products and pricing models as well as diverse end markets brought us to record net sales and net earnings for the third quarter some quick highlights for the record books record net sales for the quarter were 2 1 billion record pbop for the quarter was 196 7 million record gross profit dollars were 327 6 million and record eps was 1 93 per share and the first three quarters of 2021 represent the best year in our company s history for sales and profit as we explore the segment results for the quarter we ll start with retail solutions overall retail unit sales were down 1 from 2020 and profits were down from the record set in 2020 as well as you recall the lumber market was rising in q3 of 2020 and retail customer takeaways exceeded expectations 2021 was a different story as retail demand was soft early in the quarter and the lumber market continued to fall dramatically so the prowood treated products and the sunbelt spartanburg treated products were negatively impacted through the quarter the higher lumber costs were absorbed in the quarterly profit numbers for the third quarter and fortunately the retail demand normalized in september and inventories are now more in line with the market so we expect the fourth quarter for this business to be more typical ufp edge our siding pattern and trim business unit will see more capacity come online in the fourth quarter and plans to expand sales when the capacity is available ufp edge also plans to add additional manufacturing and coating operations in other parts of the country deckorators has become the product of choice among retailers in canada and combined with us awareness gives us confidence in the added capacity coming online in q4 and in 2022 both in wood plastic composite and the patented mineral composite deckorators does continue to feel some of the impacts of higher resin and transportation costs as evidenced in q3 handprint the home and decor business unit continues to gain more sales volume with its cut to size product offering for building materials retailers outdoor essentials has expanded its fencing range to include a variety of materials including aluminum and composite it s planter boxes and pergola kits are also gaining traction sales continue to climb through our e commerce work on customer portals and our e commerce team is adding a distribution facility in texas to help accelerate our deliveries to customers around the country the overall outlook for retail is positive as our big box customers have a positive forecast for consumer demand both from diy consumers as well as professional contractors ufp construction unit sales increased nicely in q3 in the site built arena strong single family residential demand continues in the geographic markets we serve and multi family remains resilient the new products from recent acquisitions such as aluminum cladding and aluminum decks for multi family and commercial projects have created opportunities in other geographic locations as we scale these new products our trust facilities are operating near capacity with available employees we continue to recruit and hire to fill additional shifts where possible our factory built unit also improved as strong demand continues factory built absorbed the market drop on inventory commodity items for a manufactured housing customers during the quarter yet our team continues to invest in new product portfolio for the factory built market and in late q3 the factory built team of ufp distribution closed on the purchase of shelter products in alabama to expand its capabilities unit sales to commercial construction grew from a year ago but more importantly pbop was again positive for q3 our concrete forming business will consolidate the concrete forming related lumber and panel products sold through the retail solutions segment and bring more focus on converting customers to designed engineered and manufactured solutions throughout the construction segment imported products for some projects have been delayed due to the transportation and port issues we are pushing for relief from regulatory restrictions which limit transportation providers and cause unnecessary delays in the supply chain we also note that engineered wood products are still in short supply which encourages more customers to use our custom built floor trusses or other alternative products ufp industrial grew unit sales through its acquisitions during the quarter the focus on value adverse commodity results in some sales loss but better profitability also new analytics help sales better identify true cost to ensure we receive a fair price for the goods and services we provide the industrial team is investing heavily in automation material sourcing and recruitment as they continue to enhance the solutions offered to the customer the protective packaging runway is going from a small base but has a pipeline of acquisition targets to serve as a beachhead from which to grow and scale and our international group posted excellent performance in the third quarter as mexico continues to excel and australia adds additional products to its mix other areas we are working on include better utilizing our size and strength as a company we have seen the benefits of our purchasing team working effectively with each segment and leveraging the raw material spend for 2022 we will extend this benefit to our mro and supply spend as we have added acquisitions we haven t yet taken full advantage of our buying power and we believe there is at least 10 million in annual savings available to us as we look at our human capital needs one of our top priorities is attracting and retaining labor we have seen an increase in applications after the extra unemployment compensation payments were stopped yet we still need hundreds of individuals who are willing to work hard we have instituted incentives for referrals by paying existing teammates to identify recruit and on board those individuals who can be successful with us our hr teams and business operators have worked together to craft creative local solutions for the markets where our facilities are located we are focused on training and creating opportunities for teammates to move up in the organization our unique ufp business school graduated its fourth class of business degrees students in august and the class of 2023 is full and has a majority of low income individuals females and people of color and we continue to share our success with our hourly production teammates who continue to do whatever it takes to serve our customers they will be receiving a record 13 6 million worth of performance incentive payments based on the trailing 12 months performance that brings the year to date 2021 total of bonuses and increased benefits to nearly 24 million of course our strong focus on new products remains intact new product sales increased to 196 8 million for the quarter and 600 2 million year to date well in excess of the year to date budget we have increased the breadth of products in each business unit but we need to be even faster to vet and bring these new products to consumers more quickly of course capital allocation is a key focus we prioritize capital on strategic acquisitions new products and services expansionary and efficiency capital expenditures and return to shareholders acquisitions are a strategic growth initiative as we pursue targets in each segment with an emphasis on scalable and synergistic new products or services complementary value added products and core competencies the pipeline remains robust we have increased capital commitments for expansion and automation and technology and expect that trend to continue our investment in the innovation accelerator is designed to speed and enhance the return on investment in new products we also plan to return capital to our shareholders including cash dividends which the board agreed to increase to 0 20 per share for the december 2021 dividend payment we will also employ opportunistic share repurchases when appropriate on a positive anecdote based on the tremendous cash flow generation year to date we have essentially covered the acquisition costs of palletone sunbelt and spartanburg and have a strong cash position as of the end of q3 now i d like to turn it over to mike cole who will provide more details on our financial performance michael r cole chief financial officer thanks matt and good afternoon everyone our consolidated results this quarter are highlighted by unit sales growth of 13 and adjusted ebitda growth of 49 in spite of an unprecedented drop in lumber prices and softening of retail demand operating cash flow of 282 million 97 million ahead of last year a strong balance sheet with net debt to total capitalization of less than 9 and liquidity of 668 million and a trailing 12 month return on invested capital of over 26 now i ll review the financial statements in more detail starting with our sales by segment as we anticipated the retail segment had to fight through a combination of lower lumber prices and demand compared to the unprecedented highs in 2020 as consumers shifted spending this year when pandemic related restrictions were lifted and the economy reopened consequently organic unit sales dropped 19 in retail this decline was offset by the acquisitions of sunbelt and spartanburg which contributed 18 to unit growth resulting in a total unit decline of 1 the organic unit decline was most impactful in our prowood business unit which reported a 27 decrease we remain confident that demand in this market will normalize in the near term for a variety of reasons and when combined with our initiatives to increase market share we believe retail will be a strong contributor to our future long term growth sales to the industrial market increased to 103 and consisted of a 69 increase in selling prices as we sold through our higher priced inventory and as we continue to improve our value added product mix and maintain pricing discipline our unit sales increased 34 as a result of our palletone acquisition organic unit growth was flat this quarter due to capacity constraints like the availability of labor and long lead times on equipment and as we continue to be selective in the business we take in order to focus on higher margin value added products this sales strategy resulted in a strong improvement in gross profits which i ll review shortly market share gains from new customers new locations of existing customers and new products contributed 28 million 19 million and 20 million respectively to our sales this quarter these gains were offset by the loss of unit sales to less profitable accounts finally our sales to the construction segment increased 62 consisting of a 43 increase in selling prices and 19 unit growth including a 3 contribution from acquisitions organic unit growth was driven by a 26 increase in commercial 23 in site built housing and 17 in factory built housing demand in our backlogs of business in the construction segment continued to be strong which we expect will continue capacity constraints remain a challenge in this segment as well moving down the income statement our third quarter gross profits increased by 86 5 million or 36 by segment retail decreased by 95 million primarily driven by our prowood sunbelt and spartanburg operations as i mentioned last quarter we expected that our commodity based products sold on a variable price would be adversely impacted by the decline in lumber prices we anticipated during the quarter the decline in unit sales also adversely impacted our production cost per unit fortunately the increases we expected in industrial and construction also occurred and these segments contributed 78 million and 92 million respectively to our gross profit growth each of these segments which primarily sell value added products sold on a fixed price benefited from the drop in lumber prices organic growth and operating leverage also contributed to the gross profit increase in construction while favorable changes in product mix contributed to the increase in industrial acquisitions added 22 million to industrial gross profits and 1 million to construction our retail segment lost 7 million of gross profits on our sunbelt and spartanburg operations due to the drop in lumber prices continuing to move down the income statement our sg a expenses increased by almost 35 million consisting of 14 million from recently acquired businesses and 11 million increase in incentives and an 8 million increase in wages and benefits the remaining increase is primarily related to higher travel costs sequentially our sg a dropped from 185 million in q2 to 170 million in q3 primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense finally our operating profits increased nearly 62 million which was comprised of a 48 million increase in industrial 68 million increase in construction and a 10 million increase in international offset by an 88 million decrease in retail acquisitions contributed operating profit of 14 million to industrial and a loss of 12 million to retail moving on to our cash flow statement our cash flows generated from operations for the year was 282 million and consisted of net earnings and non cash expenses totaling 474 million compared to 245 million last year and 192 million increase in net working capital since year end compared to a 60 million increase in the prior year we anticipate further decreases in working capital through the balance of the year assuming lumber prices remain at current levels and as we move into what is typically a slower time of the year for most of our business units we measure our cash cycle to assess our working capital management it increased to 57 days this year compared to 43 days last year primarily driven by an increase in our daily supply of inventory due to lower retail demand than our customers anticipated for our inventory planning our investing activities included capital expenditures totaling 110 million including expansionary and efficiency capex of 60 million we re now planning for total capital expenditures for the year of 147 million notable projects include expanding our capacity to produce our mineral based and wood plastic composite decking products and our ufp edge siding pattern interim products expanding our machine built pallet capacity and taking advantage of automation opportunities we also invested 433 million on previously announced acquisitions lastly our financing activities included 28 million of dividends paid this year at a rate of 0 15 a share a 20 increase in the rate over last year and our board approved an increase in our fourth quarter dividend to 0 20 a share reflecting our confidence in the business outlook with respect to our balance sheet at the end of september our total debt net of cash was 182 million and our total liquidity was 668 million consisting of cash of 128 million and 540 million in availability under our revolving credit facility we expect further reductions in our networking capital investment as we work through the balance of the year resulting in favorable cash flows the strength of our cash flow generation and balance sheet provides us with plenty of capital to grow or to return to shareholders our highest priorities for capital allocation are currently capital expenditures and business acquisitions based on opportunities and the strength of potential returns we see that s all i have in the financials matt matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you mike now i d like to open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question will come from ketan mamtora with bmo capital markets please go ahead ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst thank you and good afternoon and congrats once again matt and mike matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you ketan michael r cole chief financial officer hi ketan ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst first question starting off on the composite decking side can you talk about the demand trends that you re seeing there i see that in the third quarter the organic volumes were down 14 year over year can you talk about what you re seeing on the demand side matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think the demand is still very strong ketan in terms of our manufacturing facilities that are both at capacity and they re both sold out now through the end of the year so i think the future on that still looks good from what we can see and in conversations with our retail customers they are still very bullish on both wood plastic composite and especially the mineral based composite ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst okay and so what drove the year over year drop in demand in the third quarter was it seasonal element or is it sort of people just being out for vacations i m just curious matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think some of it was just if you talk about what we talked about at the end of the second quarter was perhaps some people who had been basically kept at home for a year and a half took time off and spend money on vacations and other things that they couldn t do for that period of time i also think there may have been more inventory in the pipeline earlier in the year because of ordering so the big boxes had plenty of stock and so that may be part of part of the decline in the third quarter as well michael r cole chief financial officer i think that s right i d point out that year to date so for the full nine months deckorators is up 14 i believe on a unit basis ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst got it and so at this point you think sort of inventory in the channel has come down to more normal levels on the composite decking side matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i really can t speak to the whole composite space but i can only speak to our portion of that space and i think based on the demand that we re seeing and the fact that we have orders through the end of the year and extending beyond that that bodes well for us ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and then turning to the site built maybe talk a little bit about kind of what you are seeing in terms of demand and are there any particular areas or regions where you are seeing more strength versus the others matthew j missad chief executive officer that s a good question ketan and again just as a reminder we don t have facilities all over the country we tend to be more regional so the southeast texas colorado and non urban northeast is where we re located those areas all all seem to be very strong demand is strong our facilities are running at capacity as i mentioned for as much capacity as we can produce given the number of employees we re able to obtain i would say that the typical seasonality would occur in say upstate new york we would expect that to happen but other than that again demand is very strong and order files are well out into the future ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst got it that s very helpful i ll turn it over good luck in the back half of the year and into 2022 matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you ketan operator thank you our next question will come from stanley elliott with stifel please go ahead stanley elliott stifel nicolaus analyst hi everybody thank you all for taking the questions and also thanks for the additional information in the release very very helpful can you talk a little bit about what you re seeing from your customers with the supply chain do they have any thoughts on when all this might get cleared up and is there any way to frame kind of what sort of impact it s actually having on your business now on industrial or even the construction side matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah that s a great question stanley and i think you probably get just about the same number of answers as the number of people you ask that question to conversations that i ve had with our customers is there are certain products that just don t seem to be freeing up anytime soon and there s others where they see the light at the end of the tunnel for us since most of our products manufacture domestically that tends to help us but our customers that are waiting on parts or waiting on electronic devices or chips or other things like that it s kind of a wait and see game one of the positive though that i think has happened is that it s going to extend this period of what i ll call recovery because they haven t been able to build everything that they wanted to build and the demand still appears to be there so the demand should continue on maybe at a slightly lower level than historical but still very good for us stanley elliott stifel nicolaus analyst perfect and then the new products that you guys have i mean you ve blown through your initial target already very strong what has changed in the process whether it s the development as a consumer feedback on the front end just trying to get a better feel for why you re having such great success there matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i really have to give credit to the team all of the different business units have really put a focus on driving new products and driving new services they ve made investments in it and we all know how important it is to our future to come up with new things so they really done an incredible job of embracing that and turning it into real positive gains i think in terms of some of the sales dollars just keep in mind that some of those items that are in there do you have a higher cost number in them so that may give us slight head weight to the dollar amount stanley elliott stifel nicolaus analyst fair enough and then lastly for me nice boost on the dividend i apologize if you feel said on other calls how should we think about that in terms is there a percentage that you re targeting payout wise versus net income or any any sort of metric to think about matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think for us it s really just about making sure we balance the return to shareholders kind of currently with the long term growth value so i don t think we ve really set a specific target that we re looking at but mike you can add some color to that as well from a capital standpoint michael r cole chief financial officer yeah at the annualized at 0 80 that s 13 14 payout ratio of net earnings very comfortable we also look at yield to some extent and yield based on where where we think a reasonable valuation for the company would be so those are the metrics we look at and 0 80 was a nice increase for and one we can support very easily going forward stanley elliott stifel nicolaus analyst absolutely thanks guys very much appreciate it and best of luck matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question will come from reuben garner with the benchmark company please go ahead reuben garner the benchmark company analyst thank you good afternoon everybody matthew j missad chief executive officer hi reuben reuben garner the benchmark company analyst maybe starting or going back to the retail side for a second couple of follow up questions so one i think it was pretty widely reported that there was maybe at least on the diy side a slow down earlier on in the quarter more recently pricing seems to be moving higher have you seen trends on the demand side improve or do you think that the inventory situation just kind of balanced out and now it s just kind of normal course of business or is it supply chain drove in the prices up what do you think is is has or can you just talk about maybe the last four weeks five weeks six weeks relative to what you saw earlier in the quarter matthew j missad chief executive officer a lot of questions in one statement i m going to see reuben garner the benchmark company analyst yeah sorry matthew j missad chief executive officer if i can answer all of them so as we look at it i think you re absolutely right i think that slack demand in kind of early q3 has moderated and now i think it s kind of back to what we would see is more normal i do think there was excess inventory in the supply chain i know there was some shutdowns by mills for maintenance and other things so very judiciously used and probably the right thing for them to do and again i think we see still see a good demand there probably are some transportation related impacts that certainly would encourage people to make sure they have inventory on hand but i think everything is kind of balanced out and if i as i mentioned in my remarks if we kind of look at the fourth quarter i d expect it to be a little more typical for previous years reuben garner the benchmark company analyst perfect and then on the industrial side is it too early to see the benefits cross selling there with the palletone acquisition i know volume you mentioned kind of focusing on the value added so the organic growth is not maybe it is not maybe easy for us to tell what if that hasn t happened yet when can we expect kind of some some of those benefits to flow through would that be more of a 22 event matthew j missad chief executive officer well actually reuben i actually think there s a fair amount of that already happening there are customers common customers that we re sharing that are now being served in a wider area of geography through our previously existing ufp locations and vice versa i think we obviously aren t quantifying that in a public format but the benefits are already there and yes we would hope those continue to grow in the coming years reuben garner the benchmark company analyst okay and then last one for me and if you gave this apologies but the two questions on the gross profit line can you provide us with what the write down was if there was one in the quarter on the treated lumber side and then secondly what the contribution was from the acquisitions on gross profit just trying to get to what the kind of underlying organic gross profit improvement was even though your organic volume was down matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i ll start with the first one reuben the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve at the end of the quarter i think we did less than 2 million so we had worked through that inventory pretty effectively for the quarter and we re in pretty good shape and at the end of the quarter i think that 2 million was primarily in the sunbelt and the spartanburg operations and then with respect to acquisitions acquisitions added 22 million to industrial in terms of gross profits 1 million to construction and then retail loss of 7 million the sunbelt and spartanburg operations had a gross profit loss for the quarter reuben garner the benchmark company analyst okay great thank you guys matthew j missad chief executive officer thanks reuben operator thank you our next question will come from julio romero with sidoti and co please go ahead julio romero sidoti company analyst hey good afternoon matt and mike matthew j missad chief executive officer hi julio michael r cole chief financial officer hi julio julio romero sidoti company analyst so matt you called out several margin levers below earlier in your remarks i think you talked about automation pricing rationalization and procurement can you maybe rank order some of those initiatives and talk about which one do you think might have the greatest opportunity matthew j missad chief executive officer well clearly the automation one will help because it s not only does it help on the efficiency side but it also helps on the labor shortage side so the challenge with that is equipment manufacturing is obviously there at capacity so it takes a lot longer to get to that particular level lever excuse me but i would say the other part the rationalization on the customer front with analytics and other things is an ongoing process and that has brought in probably more immediate results which you re seeing in some of the numbers particularly in the industrial group so i think those are how i would rank them today but i think long term we would expect more with the automation and efficiency gains julio romero sidoti company analyst got it and that kind of dovetails into my next question is the rationalization improvements you made on industrial what inning are we in there or for much more do you have to go in industrial matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i would tell you i m really proud of the ufp industrial team they ve done a terrific job they ve really embraced working together across the company since we restructured and they have really done a great job of sharing customers and expanding our reach there so i know what they would tell you is they are not even close to being finished yet they got a long way to go but we continue to see very positive results from that julio romero sidoti company analyst understood and then last one for me and i ll pass it on is just given the current lumber environment how conducive do you think that is to your inventory restock for 22 matthew j missad chief executive officer that s a great question i don t really have a good crystal ball on that one but as i mentioned i think it s going to be a little more typical at least based on what we re seeing today so we don t know kind of what the future holds in terms of what the mills are going to do but we re comfortable with where the market is and our position today julio romero sidoti company analyst okay thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question will come from jay mccanless with wedbush securities please go ahead jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst hey good afternoon guys matthew j missad chief executive officer hi jay jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst so the first question with the sg a roughly 170 million this quarter is that a good run rate to use going forward especially since some of the lumber i m assuming that the lower lumber prices is the reason the commissions were down sequentially michael r cole chief financial officer yeah i think it is a reasonable run rate as long as you peel out the bonus impact of it jay i had the bonus numbers here off the top of my head but the sg a was very comparable pulling out bonus from q2 to q3 so i think it is a pretty good run rate for q4 and that is as we ve mentioned before bonuses at about 20 of pre bonus operating profit is the right rate to use jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then nice to see the growth in commercial i mean do you think that was just an easy comp or do you feel like you actually gained some business and maybe we ve heard some other companies talk about comparisons to 2019 i mean how and i understood if you don t have in front of you but answer the first question around is it easy comp or is it real growth and then maybe how did that number compared to 2019 michael r cole chief financial officer yeah that s a good question jay i don t have the 2019 numbers but i will tell you i don t believe there has been anything that s easy for that ufp commercial team and they ve really done a terrific job of kind of building back and what they ve been able to accomplish is really driving sales and for them customer analytics and rationalization of projects has been a big key they ve got a long way to go there but they are making really good progress jay as you mentioned bonus expense for the quarter was 44 million by the way jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay great and then matt not to be the dead horse but reuben kind of stole my lumber questions so maybe asked it different way we ve seen both framing lumber and saw yellow pine come pretty strongly off of the lows it set during the summer do you feel like the mills and some of the expansion that we ve heard that s going to happen in 22 do you think the easiest way for price is go is up now or i know you said something also about some transportation snafus i guess maybe which one do you think looking forward which one is going to win is it going to be the snafus or is this excess capacity going to keep lumber from going too high this coming year matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think the capacity coming online will definitely help moderate it i think one of the things that probably we should keep in mind is the amount of consolidation on the mill side over the last 10 years or so so that the common ownership they have been much more diligent about managing their returns and so there are times when they ll take production offline if need be which may or may not be typical from a historical perspective i don t know what the sweet spot is for them or what that what that price point looks like but right now i think we re in a fairly decent balance and if i look at our business the demand still is strong and stable so that probably bodes well for the market i don t know what other downward pressures might be out there jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay great that s great congrats on a good quarter thanks for taking my questions matthew j missad chief executive officer thanks jay operator thank you and we do have a follow up question from reuben garner with the benchmark company please go ahead reuben garner the benchmark company analyst thanks guys just one quick one on deckorators just to clarify matt so you re sold out i think you ve said through the end of the year when investors were looking at the volume being down year over year last year was there any i guess sell into new business or i guess drawdown of your existing inventory that made that year ago number unusually high and i guess as we move into q4 i think you ve said things have normalized maybe then we would expect to see volume growth again or you grow with the market in the fourth quarter thanks guys matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah it s a great question reuben and i guess the best way that i can look at this i try to look at the deckorators business on an annualized basis because there is quarter to quarter variations and swing so a lot of the production related issues for us is capacity as we ve reached maxed out capacity i know we can t produce more to sell it i can t really tell you for sure what our inventory positions were back in q1 of 2020 but over that over the course of the year i think that all kind of balances out as mike pointed out with the sales are up we would still expect there to be continued unit growth for 2022 but it might not track perfectly well with the quarters depending on what big box positions are what other retail positions are in their own inventories operator thank you i m showing no further questions in the queue at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks matthew j missad chief executive officer well thank you and thank you for your time today as we look ahead our list of opportunities continues to grow each business unit is expanding its product offering to bring better solutions to its customers and each ufp team mate is expanding their skill and knowledge to enhance their careers with us we believe these factors will continue to

2007 campaign website why are you seeking elective office i am a proven leader running to restore competency and respect to the city council an understanding of the policy board s proper role made me an effective city councilor and is necessary to stop the ongoing loss of the institutional knowledge portsmouth needs to stay vibrant respect has to be restored for our volunteer boards by not replacing them with partisan hacks respect has to be restored for our staff by recognizing they only work for the city manager and respect has to be restored for our residents by not overturning a unanimous ethics committee conviction like this city council did for councilor kennedy the single most pressing issue facing our board district etc is _______ and this is what i intend to do about it portsmouth s affordable housing crisis that i have lived since returning from iraq has become exponentially worse during covid the residential revaluation increases that make it difficult for many to stay stem from the strong desire to live here our severe housing shortage and new luxury condos our hot housing market negatively impacts anyone relying on fixed incomes aspiring first time home buyers and the half of our population that rent zoning must encourage our housing stock to increase until supply meets demand and incentive requirements should be adjusted so more affordable units are built we should encourage the portsmouth housing authority to build more projects like the one on court street that i voted to waive 140 000 160 000 in fees for and then city councilor becksted voted against during the previous term what are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post just like my previous campaigns i have been bicycling door to door every weekend from labor day to election day to learn your priorities from sound barriers to relocating the pan am rail yard to date i have hit over 2 000 voters doors and do not plan to stop until election day please feel free to share your thoughts with me many of my successful individual initiatives from when i previously served on the city council started from a resident informing me of an issue if you are a challenger in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community or district or constituency the urgent need to restore competency and respect is epitomized by the current city council s inability to deliver on their 2019 campaign promise to reign in development policy is set by passing ordinances for example two years ago my climate change focus pushed enacting the flood plain district zoning ordinance before any north mill pond development was submitted by contrast instead of setting policy by amending our zoning ordinances this city council harasses our talented staff that simply enforce existing ordinances this has resulted in the former deputy city manager planning director and traffic engineer all quitting in an unprecedented loss of institutional knowledge additionally this city council risks more lawsuits by replacing our thankless quasi judicial board volunteers with ones not abiding by existing zoning worse these actions by the city council have been counterproductive because the city now lacks the staff to adequately enforce the current zoning on the proposed developments they promised to reign in how do you think local officials performed in responding to the coronavirus what if anything would you have done differently the city staff especially our first responders need to be commended however the city council did very poorly in responding to the coronavirus the pandemic will persist until all elected officials listen to the science lead by example and become proactive despite overwhelming support from medical experts the current city council failed to enact a mask mandate until sept 14 of last year worse in a complete disregard for the health of all residents and staff alike mayor becksted and councilor huda not only voted against that ordinance but currently refuse to wear masks during city council meetings being the seacoast s slowest city council to allow outdoor dining resulted in last year s popup and this year they were incredibly reluctant to approve outdoor dining again if elected i will listen to the science lead by example and proactively codify outdoor dining in an ordinance to ensure that portsmouth becomes even more vibrant describe the other issues that define your campaign platform pursuing more successful climate change mitigation initiatives i previously conceived recruited and chaired portsmouth s renewable energy committee that created both our net zero energy policy and the framework to achieve it that framework led to many successes from expanding the solar power tax exemption to numerous electric vehicle initiatives if elected i would update our net zero energy policy s framework and restore the downtown electric vehicle fast chargers to our capital improvement plan that the current city council removed i am well known for having made portsmouth the first city in new hampshire that enacted a citywide styrofoam ban with my 2019 single use disposables ordinance in concert with codifying outdoor dining i would push enforcement of that ordinance that requires businesses on public property compost this ordinance built upon my previous successful curbside composting rebate and is crucial because food waste is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions what accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job my successful initiatives to assist my fellow veterans before i was elected to the city council portsmouth s longstanding 500 veterans tax credit was only allowed for veterans that served during specified times of conflict in 2017 i introduced and passed my 500 all veterans tax credit which required two 5 4 votes against the then city manager s desires in 2019 i introduced and passed a similar resolution that doubled the disabled veterans tax credit when portsmouth s vfw post was suspended this past spring i accepted the role of commander returned the post to good order and found us a new meeting location we started planning a welcome home end of the afghanistan war parade but wisely postponed it just before kabul fell i also oversaw the creation of at least one 1 000 scholarship in perpetuity in the post s name for seniors in our school system using 50 000 from the interest from the sale of our building in 2018 i have also been speaking at city council meetings since we submitted a resolution in july that would create a 500 residential tax credit during the year s members of the new hampshire national guard and reserves are called to active duty in combat service the best advice ever shared with me was be yourself what else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions i fell in love with portsmouth as a unh undergraduate thought about the city often while i was in the army and moved here upon returning from baghdad where i served as a combat adviser to an iraqi infantry battalion i have always believed in public service as a former city councilor from 2016 2020 as president of the 501 c 3 popup nh during the height of the pandemic s uncertainty in 2020 and now as the commander of veterans of foreign wars post 168 please vote for me

constantly drawing inspiration for his menus from his globetrotting adventures when it comes to inspiration both in his personal life and when creating cuisine for clients chef gabriele draws from a variety of experiences i am italian first and foremost and our culture is rooted in the art of cooking and dining chef gabriele shares we call it la dolce vita the sweet life the rise in recognition for authentic cooking and heritage recipes is a responsibility every italian has especially if you are a chef he continues chef gabriele also credits the strong female presence during his upbringing when creating his dishes i cook in the housewife s style casalinga those are the people that i learned how to cook from housewives grandmothers aunts sisters and daughters that s where i get my inspiration because italy is like that it s like mother s love it s like grandmother s love it s instantly familiar and comforting all at the same time and immediately he shares viewers of say i do feel instantly familiar and comforted with gabriele because the unscripted show is less about over the top produced reality television and more about being authentic chef gabriele explains it s a show about the importance of connection with one another and the necessary act of embracing who we fully are without apologies or explanations it s a show about the true power of love he sought to blend his culinary skills with his culture and his personal journey food is all connected to stories and culture chefs are some of the most amazing storytellers in fact one of the world s most recognized culinary storytellers was a mentor to chef gabriele anthony bourdain was someone i highly connected with and a great mentor he lives within me every single day i walk into a kitchen or embark on a new adventure he shares one common bond both bourdain and chef gabriele share story telling chefs living authentically both on and off camera during the premiere episode of say i do a groom to be disclosed his journey of living with diabetes and gabriele unexpectedly shared an intimate aspect of his life he was living with hiv he revealed the ability for marcus to open up about something very personal about his life allowed me to do the same it felt natural and needed conversations like the one i had on the show are testament to how much vulnerability is important in showing up fully for who we are it is also important for hiv people to not be ashamed about our status and story but instead being open to talk about it and break down the barriers and stigma that hiv still has in our community the world applauded chef gabriele for living in his truth and using his platform to continue to de stigmatize living with hiv along with the praise of viewers and critics for his food and candid demeanor say i do has served as a platform for the world to be introduced to the gabrielle bertaccini experience chef gabriele s bespoke events company is not just about food and drinks it is a 360 degree approach to celebrating life when i started my company i remember explaining everyone who worked with me that we were not in the business of food but in the business of creating memories i wanted every event experience and gathering to feel like a beautiful curated dream i believe the best dining experiences are the ones in which we are seated around a table sharing food and stories with others i want for our evenings to be the best dinner parties you ve ever attended he gushes although the past year and a half has been anything but a dream and with the world in a state of flux chef gabriele notes this shift has affected the way we will approach and experience our food and beverage events leading into 2022 the next year will bring two polarizing approaches to dining one that embraces the need for simpler comforting and soul nourishing cuisine and the other that functions as an escape and embraces frivolousness allowing patrons to be both fancy and indulgent he shares we are crafting more exclusive types of dining events think of tasting menus private dining experiences moments that go above and beyond with ingredients and access it s a return to the true essence and special nature of dining together around a table he continues with holiday gatherings just around the corner chef gabriele has some advice for the home cook and gift givers this time of year every home chef should start by investing in a really really good knife set it can be expensive but you buy them once and if you take care of them they ll last you a lifetime he shares i especially love japanese knives because of their light weight and sharp blades he continues everyone should also own at least one cast iron pan and a good thick wooden cutting board i still have the one my grandmother used and every time i am in the kitchen it reminds me of the times we spent together cooking up sunday dinners between running a successful catering and event planning business globetrotting and gearing up for a 2022 to remember chef gabe is booked blessed and busy beef ragu with papparedelle ingredients passata di pomodoro 2 cans 28 oz each peeled whole tomatoes 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp olive oil 1 small clove garlic smashed 1 sprig fresh marjoram 1 tsp kosher salt ragù sauce 2 ¼ lb beef chuck cut into 1 inch cubes ½ lb pork shoulder cut into 1 inch cubes 5 oz pancetta cut into 1 inch cubes 5 oz prosciutto di parma cut into 1 inch cubes 5 oz mortadella cut into 1 inch cubes 1 large yellow onion roughly chopped 4 stalks celery roughly chopped 1 carrot roughly chopped 5 oz strutto lard cut into pieces kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 ½ cups dry fruity red wine such as sangiovese 2 cups low sodium chicken stock pasta salt 16 oz or 500 grams pappardelle or tagliatelle 2 tbsp butter 1 cup finely grated parmigiano reggiano plus more for serving directions step 1 for the passata pass the tomatoes with the juices through a food mill into a large bowl or pulse in a food processor until very smooth about 1 minute step 2 in a large pot heat the oil over medium low until it begins to shimmer add the garlic and marjoram and cook stirring often until fragrant about 1 minute add the tomatoes and kosher salt and cook stirring occasionally until reduced slightly about 30 minutes discard the garlic and marjoram set aside 2 cups of the passata for the ragù let the remaining passata cool step 3 for the ragù using a meat grinder or a stand mixer and a grinder attachment fitted with a large die grind the beef into a large bowl without cleaning the grinder between batches grind the pork into the same bowl grind the pancetta prosciutto and mortadella into a separate medium bowl run the pancetta mixture through the grinder again run the onion celery and carrot through the grinder into another large bowl step 4 in a large heavy pot melt the strutto over medium high heat add the ground pancetta mixture cook stirring often until the fat renders about 4 minutes add the vegetables cook stirring often until the vegetables are golden brown about 15 minutes step 5 add the ground beef and pork season with kosher salt and pepper cook stirring often until the beef and pork release their juices 6 to 8 minutes add the wine and cook until the mixture begins to steam stir in the reserved 2 cups of passata and the stock reduce heat to low step 6 gently simmer the sauce stirring occasionally until the beef and pork are tender and the flavors are concentrated 5 to 7 hours step 7 set aside 6 cups of ragù for the pasta let the remaining sauce cool step 8 bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta salt the water and add the pasta cook until al dente step 9 in another large pot bring the reserved 6 cups of ragù to a rapid simmer over medium high heat cook until the sauce reduces slightly about 3 minutes add the butter and swirl until the sauce is smooth step 10 using a large slotted fork transfer the pasta from the cooking water to the ragù toss the pasta until coated add some of the cooking water to loosen the sauce if needed mix 1 cup cheese into the sauce serve the pasta with more cheese evan s tips for ragù buying the right tomatoes when you re shopping for canned whole peeled tomatoes look for the high quality san marzano variety i like bianco dinapoli and alta cucina brands pancetta prosciutto di parma andmortadella get thick pieces not thin slices of the cured meats at the deli counter no meat grinder ask your butcher to grind it for you olive oil vs strutto lard to keep the flavors authentically bolognese stay away from olive oil olives don t grow in bologna and stick to animal fats like lard or butter choosing your pasta homemade pasta is best but your backup is high quality dried i like spinosi brand tagliatelle or garofalo brand pappardelle which can both be found in stores or on amazon cooking the meat don t brown the ground meat searing will make it hard and dry in the sauce the opposite of your goal of tender and luscious combining the pasta and ragù butter makes the ragù glossy and helps it cling better to the pasta adding just a few splashes of starchy pasta water will loosen the sauce and let the pasta swim deliciously in the ragù photo constance higley chef chef gabriele bertaccini hiv netflix say i do television last modified october 20 2021

in an abrupt change the white house on wednesday floated new plans to pay for parts of president joe biden s 2 trillion social services and climate change package shelving a proposed big increase in corporate tax rates though also adding a new billionaires tax on the investment gains of the very richest americans the reversal came as biden returned to his hometown of scranton pennsylvania to highlight the middle class values he says are at the heart of the package that democrats are racing to finish biden faces resistance from key holdouts including sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo trump era tax breaks to help pay for it this has been declared dead on arrival from the moment i introduced it but i think we re going to surprise them because i think people are beginning to figure out what s at stake biden said in a speech at scranton s electric city trolley museum his first visit home since becoming president negotiations between the white house and democratic leaders on capitol hill are underway on what s now a scaled back package but would still be an unprecedented federal effort to expand social services for millions and confront the rising threat of climate change it s coupled with a separate 1 trillion bill to update roads and bridges get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters biden and his democratic party have given themselves a deadline to seal agreement after laboring to bridge his once sweeping 3 5 trillion vision preferred by progressives with a more limited focus that can win over party centrists he has no democratic votes to spare for passage in the closely divided congress and leaders want agreement by week s end the newly proposed tax provisions though are likely to sour progressives and even some moderate democrats who have long campaigned on undoing the 2017 gop tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy costing the federal government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality administration officials spoke with congressional leaders on the tax alternatives according to a person familiar with the private talks and granted anonymity to discuss them the changes may be needed to win over sinema who had objected to plans to raise the rates on corporations and wealthy individuals earning more than 400 000 a year said the person and several others as it stands the corporate tax rate is 21 and democrats want to lift it to 26 5 for companies earning more than 5 million a year the top individual income tax rate would rise from 37 to 39 6 for those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for married couples under the changes being floated that 21 corporate rate would stay the same however the revisions wouldn t be all positive for big companies and the wealthy the white house is reviving the idea of a minimum corporate tax rate similar to the 15 rate biden had proposed earlier this year that s even for companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains that they pay zero in taxes and there could be a new billionaires tax modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore the chairman of the finance committee who has proposed taxing stock gains of those with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans sinema has not publicly stated her position and her office did not respond to a request for comment another key democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia has said he prefers a 25 corporate rate he has been withholding his support for the bill with additional objections to its provisions on climate change and social services on the call with the administration and the white house wyden said he stressed the importance of putting an end to america s two tax codes and finally showing working people in this country that the wealthiest americans are going to pay taxes just like they do the possible shift comes as democrats appear to have made progress uniting themselves ready to abandon what had been a loftier package in favor of a smaller more workable proposal the party can unite around in the mix at least 500 billion to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free pre kindergarten a new federal program for at least four weeks of paid family leave a one year extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and funding for health care provided through the affordable care act and medicare likely to be eliminated or shaved back plans for tuition free community college a path to permanent legal status for certain immigrants in the u s and a clean energy plan that was the centerpiece of biden s strategy for fighting climate change nothing is decided until everything is decided said rep pramila jayapal d wash the leader of the congressional progressive caucus after a morning meeting of house democrats we re just trying to get it done democrats are growing anxious they have little to show voters despite their campaign promises and have had trouble explaining what they re trying to do with the massive package made up of so many different proposals it s a tall order that was leading to an all out push wednesday to answer the question what s in the damn bill as a press release from sen bernie sanders the independent from vermont put it the president especially wants to advance his signature domestic package to bolster federal social services and address climate changeby the time he departs for a global climate summit next week rep ro khanna d calif a progressive caucus member said he really believes american leadership american prestige is on the line manchin has made clear he opposes the president s initial energy plan which was to have the government impose penalties on electric utilities that fail to meet clean energy benchmarks and provide financial rewards to those that do instead biden is focused on providing at least 500 billion in tax credits grants and loans for energy producers that reach emission reduction goals on other fronts to preserve biden s initial sweep democrats are moving to retain many of the programs but trim their duration to shave costs biden wants to extend the 300 monthly child tax credit that was put in place during the covid 19 crisis for another year rather than allow it to expire in december but not as long as democrats wanted what had been envisioned as a months long federal paid family leave program could be shrunk to as few as four weeks an effort to at least start the program rather than eliminate it biden also wants to ensure funding for health care programs including for home and community based health care services supporting a move away from widespread nursing home care and a new program to provide dental vision and hearing aid benefits to people on medicare proposed by sanders is likely to remain in some fashion biden has told lawmakers that after his top priorities there would be 300 billion remaining that could lower the overall price tag or be used for other programs associated press writers kevin

in an abrupt change the white house on wednesday floated new plans to pay for parts of president joe biden s 2 trillion social services and climate change package shelving a proposed big increase in corporate tax rates though also adding a new billionaires tax on the investment gains of the very richest americans the reversal came as biden returned to his hometown of scranton pennsylvania to highlight the middle class values he says are at the heart of the package that democrats are racing to finish biden faces resistance from key holdouts including sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo trump era tax breaks to help pay for it this has been declared dead on arrival from the moment i introduced it but i think we re going to surprise them because i think people are beginning to figure out what s at stake biden said in a speech at scranton s electric city trolley museum his first visit home since becoming president negotiations between the white house and democratic leaders on capitol hill are underway on what s now a scaled back package but would still be an unprecedented federal effort to expand social services for millions and confront the rising threat of climate change it s coupled with a separate 1 trillion bill to update roads and bridges get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters biden and his democratic party have given themselves a deadline to seal agreement after laboring to bridge his once sweeping 3 5 trillion vision preferred by progressives with a more limited focus that can win over party centrists he has no democratic votes to spare for passage in the closely divided congress and leaders want agreement by week s end the newly proposed tax provisions though are likely to sour progressives and even some moderate democrats who have long campaigned on undoing the 2017 gop tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy costing the federal government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality administration officials spoke with congressional leaders on the tax alternatives according to a person familiar with the private talks and granted anonymity to discuss them the changes may be needed to win over sinema who had objected to plans to raise the rates on corporations and wealthy individuals earning more than 400 000 a year said the person and several others as it stands the corporate tax rate is 21 and democrats want to lift it to 26 5 for companies earning more than 5 million a year the top individual income tax rate would rise from 37 to 39 6 for those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for married couples under the changes being floated that 21 corporate rate would stay the same however the revisions wouldn t be all positive for big companies and the wealthy the white house is reviving the idea of a minimum corporate tax rate similar to the 15 rate biden had proposed earlier this year that s even for companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains that they pay zero in taxes and there could be a new billionaires tax modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore the chairman of the finance committee who has proposed taxing stock gains of those with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans sinema has not publicly stated her position and her office did not respond to a request for comment another key democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia has said he prefers a 25 corporate rate he has been withholding his support for the bill with additional objections to its provisions on climate change and social services on the call with the administration and the white house wyden said he stressed the importance of putting an end to america s two tax codes and finally showing working people in this country that the wealthiest americans are going to pay taxes just like they do the possible shift comes as democrats appear to have made progress uniting themselves ready to abandon what had been a loftier package in favor of a smaller more workable proposal the party can unite around in the mix at least 500 billion to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free pre kindergarten a new federal program for at least four weeks of paid family leave a one year extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and funding for health care provided through the affordable care act and medicare likely to be eliminated or shaved back plans for tuition free community college a path to permanent legal status for certain immigrants in the u s and a clean energy plan that was the centerpiece of biden s strategy for fighting climate change nothing is decided until everything is decided said rep pramila jayapal d wash the leader of the congressional progressive caucus after a morning meeting of house democrats we re just trying to get it done democrats are growing anxious they have little to show voters despite their campaign promises and have had trouble explaining what they re trying to do with the massive package made up of so many different proposals it s a tall order that was leading to an all out push wednesday to answer the question what s in the damn bill as a press release from sen bernie sanders the independent from vermont put it the president especially wants to advance his signature domestic package to bolster federal social services and address climate changeby the time he departs for a global climate summit next week rep ro khanna d calif a progressive caucus member said he really believes american leadership american prestige is on the line manchin has made clear he opposes the president s initial energy plan which was to have the government impose penalties on electric utilities that fail to meet clean energy benchmarks and provide financial rewards to those that do instead biden is focused on providing at least 500 billion in tax credits grants and loans for energy producers that reach emission reduction goals on other fronts to preserve biden s initial sweep democrats are moving to retain many of the programs but trim their duration to shave costs biden wants to extend the 300 monthly child tax credit that was put in place during the covid 19 crisis for another year rather than allow it to expire in december but not as long as democrats wanted what had been envisioned as a months long federal paid family leave program could be shrunk to as few as four weeks an effort to at least start the program rather than eliminate it biden also wants to ensure funding for health care programs including for home and community based health care services supporting a move away from widespread nursing home care and a new program to provide dental vision and hearing aid benefits to people on medicare proposed by sanders is likely to remain in some fashion biden has told lawmakers that after his top priorities there would be 300 billion remaining that could lower the overall price tag or be used for other programs associated press writers kevin
