all inclusive container rates from north and southeast asia to north america eased ahead of china s golden week holiday beginning oct 1 but lull is expected to be temporary as there has been no change to strong demand rates including premium service fees from north asia to west coast north america were mostly in the 15 000 17 000 feu range especially from major carriers but some availability was reported in the 11 000 13 000 feu range for bookings on smaller 3 000 5 000 teu capacity ships chartered by chinese freight forwarders to meet strong demand for trans pacific sailings for the southeast asia to west coast north america trade lane premium rates were heard as low as 11 500 feu compared to the lower limit of 16 000 feu a week ago other spot market quotes remained in the 15 000 20 000 feu range this week while there was a huge decline in rates to west coast north america prices to east coast north america retained more of their value sources said the all inclusive premiums from southeast asia to north america dipped to around 20 000 feu towards the end of the week against nearly 22 000 25 000 feu a week ago the discounts were partly driven by the desire of charterers and co loaders to fill up space on ships with up front payments before the china s national day festival and may no longer be available when chinese market participants return on oct 8 sources said i think there s some market resistance to the charter vessel carriers payment terms and it could be causing rates to decline a us based freight forwarder said but many expect rates to go back up after the normal holiday slowdown demand does not seem to be declining there was also greater uncertainty around cargo flows from china the golden week holiday and a shortage of power to chinese factories could slow production of export goods but increasing ship congestion around shanghai and ningbo zhoushan could prevent the ports from catching up on a huge backlog of shipments the reason for the slump in prices is not weak demand but with the current space crunch and port congestions the carriers don t see the need to increase prices when they can t offer good services a logistics provider based in hong kong said another surge expected ahead of lunar new year the weakness in prices and bookings is likely to be short lived as shipments are expected to pick up again by the end of the month and shippers may start gearing up to build stocks before lunar new year in february chinese new year is earlier this time it s on feb 1 so there is definitely going to be a rush of cargo after the golden week and the blank sailings are going to result in a higher pile up the logistics provider said in vietnam lockdown restrictions are easing but shippers continue to struggle with container shortage and backlogs the restrictions have been relaxed in most parts of the country and the movement has become better but the situation at ports is still bad we are struggling to book space and carriers continue to blank sailings a freight forwarder based in vietnam said according to sources major carriers had deployed vietnam s share of capacity in yantian and other ports to avoid the congestion and delays when the former was under a lockdown but as normalcy returns in the southeast asian country carriers are likely to ramp up capacity to meet built up demand which in turn may lead to supply reduction in china premiums an option for prompt shipments to europe premium bookings remain the exception rather than the rule itself in the asia to europe trade with some shippers heard paying above fak market value in order to load cargo more promptly there are diamond tier and sea priority rates present in the market but they are used more sparingly than on the trans pacific headhauls one logistics source said those rates are out there and we ship on those the source said noting the two tier market structure despite the mixed sentiment platts container rate 1 north asia to north continent was assessed unchanged this week at 17 500 feu holding near all time highs with expectations for stability in october source platts
her name is frances haugen that is a fact that facebook has been anxious to know since last month when an anonymous former employee filed complaints with federal law enforcement the complaints say facebook s own research shows that it amplifies hate misinformation and political unrest but the company hides what it knows one complaint alleges that facebook s instagram harms teenage girls what makes haugen s complaints unprecedented is the trove of private facebook research she took when she quit in may the documents appeared first last month in the wall street journal but tonight frances haugen is revealing her identity to explain why she became the facebook whistleblower frances haugen the thing i saw at facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for facebook and facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests like making more money frances haugen is 37 a data scientist from iowa with a degree in computer engineering and a harvard master s degree in business for 15 years she s worked for companies including google and pinterest frances haugen i ve seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at facebook than anything i d seen before scott pelley you know someone else might have just quit and moved on and i wonder why you take this stand frances haugen imagine you know what s going on inside of facebook and you know no one on the outside knows i knew what my future looked like if i continued to stay inside of facebook which is person after person after person has tackled this inside of facebook and ground themselves to the ground scott pelley when and how did it occur to you to take all of these documents out of the company frances haugen at some point in 2021 i realized okay i m gonna have to do this in a systemic way and i have to get out enough that no one can question that this is real frances haugen she secretly copied tens of thousands of pages of facebook internal research she says evidence shows that the company is lying to the public about making significant progress against hate violence and misinformation one study she found from this year says we estimate that we may action as little as 3 5 of hate and about 6 tenths of 1 of v i on facebook despite being the best in the world at it scott pelley to quote from another one of the documents you brought out we have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech divisive political speech and misinformation on facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world frances haugen when we live in an information environment that is full of angry hateful polarizing content it erodes our civic trust it erodes our faith in each other it erodes our ability to want to care for each other the version of facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world ethnic violence including myanmar in 2018 when the military used facebook to launch a genocide frances haugen told us she was recruited by facebook in 2019 she says she agreed to take the job only if she could work against misinformation because she had lost a friend to online conspiracy theories frances haugen i never wanted anyone to feel the pain that i had felt and i had seen how high the stakes were in terms of making sure there was high quality information on facebook at headquarters she was assigned to civic integrity which worked on risks to elections including misinformation but after this past election there was a turning point frances haugen they told us we re dissolving civic integrity like they basically said oh good we made it through the election there wasn t riots we can get rid of civic integrity now fast forward a couple months we got the insurrection and when they got rid of civic integrity it was the moment where i was like i don t trust that they re willing to actually invest what needs to be invested to keep facebook from being dangerous facebook says the work of civic integrity was distributed to other units haugen told us the root of facebook s problem is in a change that it made in 2018 to its algorithms the programming that decides what you see on your facebook news feed frances haugen so you know you have your phone you might see only 100 pieces of content if you sit and scroll on for you know five minutes but facebook has thousands of options it could show you the algorithm picks from those options based on the kind of content you ve engaged with the most in the past frances haugen and one of the consequences of how facebook is picking out that content today is it is optimizing for content that gets engagement or reaction but its own research is showing that content that is hateful that is divisive that is polarizing it s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions scott pelley misinformation angry content is enticing to people and keep frances haugen very enticing scott pelley keeps them on the platform frances haugen yes facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer people will spend less time on the site they ll click on less ads they ll make less money haugen says facebook understood the danger to the 2020 election so it turned on safety systems to reduce misinformation but many of those changes she says were temporary frances haugen and as soon as the election was over they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before to prioritize growth over safety and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me facebook says some of the safety systems remained but after the election facebook was used by some to organize the january 6th insurrection prosecutors cite facebook posts as evidence photos of armed partisans and text including by bullet or ballot restoration of the republic is coming extremists used many platforms but facebook is a recurring theme after the attack facebook employees raged on an internal message board copied by haugen haven t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence we looked for positive comments and found this i don t think our leadership team ignores data ignores dissent ignores truth but that drew this reply welcome to facebook i see you just joined in november 2020 we have been watching wishy washy actions of company leadership for years now colleagues cannot conscience working for a company that does not do more to mitigate the negative effects of its platform scott pelley facebook essentially amplifies the worst of human nature frances haugen it s one of these unfortunate consequences right no one at facebook is malevolent but the incentives are misaligned right like facebook makes more money when you consume more content people enjoy engaging with things that elicit an emotional reaction and the more anger that they get exposed to the more they interact and the more they consume that dynamic led to a complaint to facebook by major political parties across europe this 2019 internal report obtained by haugen says that the parties feel strongly that the change to the algorithm has forced them to skew negative in their communications on facebook leading them into more extreme policy positions scott pelley the european political parties were essentially saying to facebook the way you ve written your algorithm is changing the way we lead our countries frances haugen yes you are forcing us to take positions that we don t like that we know are bad for society we know if we don t take those positions we won t win in the marketplace of social media evidence of harm she says extends to facebook s instagram app scott pelley one of the facebook internal studies that you found talks about how instagram harms teenage girls one study says 13 5 of teen girls say instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse 17 of teen girls say instagram makes eating disorders worse frances haugen and what s super tragic is facebook s own research says as these young women begin to consume this this eating disorder content they get more and more depressed and it actually makes them use the app more and so they end up in this feedback cycle where they hate their bodies more and more facebook s own research says it is not just the instagram is dangerous for teenagers that it harms teenagers it s that it is distinctly worse than other forms of social media facebook said just last week it would postpone plans to create an instagram for younger children last month haugen s lawyers filed at least 8 complaints with the securities and exchange commission which enforces the law in financial markets the complaints compare the internal research with the company s public face often that of ceo mark zuckerberg who testified remotely to congress last march mark zuckerberg testimony on march 25 we have removed content that could lead to imminent real world harm we have built an unprecedented third party fact checking program the system isn t perfect but it is the best approach that we have found to address misinformation in line with our country s values one of frances haugen s lawyers is john tye he s the founder of a washington legal group called whistleblower aid scott pelley what is the legal theory behind going to the sec what laws are you alleging have been broken john tye as a publicly traded company facebook is required to not lie to its investors or even withhold material information so the sec regularly brings enforcement actions alleging that companies like facebook and others are making material misstatements and omissions that affect investors adversely scott pelley one of the things that facebook might allege is that she stole company documents john tye the dodd frank act passed over ten years ago at this point created an office of the whistleblower inside the sec and one of the provisions of that law says that no company can prohibit its employees from communicating with the sec and sharing internal corporate documents with the sec frances haugen i have a lot of empathy for mark and mark has never set out to make a hateful platform but he has allowed choices to be made where the side effects of those choices are that hateful polarizing content gets more distribution and more reach facebook declined an interview but in a written statement to 60 minutes it said every day our teams have to balance protecting the right of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place we continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content to suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true if any research had identified an exact solution to these complex challenges the tech industry governments and society would have solved them a long time ago facebook is a 1 trillion company just 17 years old it has 2 8 billion users which is 60 of all internet connected people on earth frances haugen plans to testify before congress this week she believes the federal government should impose regulations frances haugen facebook has demonstrated they cannot act independently facebook over and over again has shown it chooses profit over safety it is subsidizing it is paying for its profits with our safety i m hoping that this will have had a big enough impact on the world that they get the fortitude and the motivation to actually go put those regulations into place that s my hope produced by maria gavrilovic and alex ortiz broadcast associate michelle karim edited by michael mongulla

much publicity has been given to the removal of statues in richmond that glorified the military leaders who led the confederate insurrection against the union that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths during the civil war while history books will record the many attempts of white supremacists to stay in power in the south and to preserve their slave based economy there was no justifiable reason to glorify with outlandishly large statues the men who led the insurrection the statues gave these men prominence in a city that is working feverishly to get beyond a past when it was the second largest slave market in the country finally last week a new monument was unveiled in richmond resulting from the work of the dr martin luther king jr memorial commission as part of the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation named the emancipation and freedom monument the monument features two 12 foot bronze statues representing a man woman and infant with broken chains newly freed from slavery it is located on brown s island a popular park near downtown richmond situated between a canal and the james river and the location over the years of many different industries the sculptor is thomas jay warren of oregon senator jennifer mcclellan who chairs the mlk jr commission and worked to make the monument a reality for more than a decade presided over the unveiling governor ralph northam who has worked tirelessly during his administration to remove racism from virginia s laws and institutions spoke northam said that our public memorials are symbols of who we are and what we value these statues are symbols of a virginia that is reckoning with ugliness and inequality a virginia that tells the truth of our past can build a better future together he added these statues are symbols of hope and freedom and the enduring will to fight for that freedom national news outlets covered the unveiling for its significance of such an event in the former capital of the confederacy all mentioned the fact that the monument was unveiled two weeks after the enormous statue of robert e lee on monument avenue was taken down numerous other statues of confederates have been taken down in richmond charlottesville and other locations in virginia over the last couple of years a more accurate story of virginia is being portrayed in new statues and memorials on capitol grounds and throughout the commonwealth the new memorial honors those who fought against slavery before emancipation and those who fought for equality since the pedestal of the statue includes the names images and stories of ten virginians including five who fought against slavery and five who fought for equality fighting against slavery included nat turner and dred scott recognized for fighting for equality are john mercer langston virginia s first african american member of congress and rosa dixon bowser who founded the first teacher association for black teachers awardees were selected by the mlk jr commission after extensive public hearings for a full list as well as a list of finalists visit these are people worth remembering ken plum is a member of the virginia house of delegates

more than 900 of them are part of the pandora papers a hoard of almost 12 million files from 14 offshore finance service providers analyzed by investigative journalists worldwide tweet in collaboration with the philippine center for investigative journalism and the international consortium of investigative journalists more than 900 individuals and companies linked to the philippines have figured in millions of files on offshore accounts leaked from finance providers and which a broad group of journalists from 117 countries recently investigated an extremely small number of these accounts are tied to big businesses with legitimate sources and whose reasons for moving and keeping their wealth overseas may be indicative of how the philippine financial system has been slow on reforms the rest of the philippine linked accounts are mysterious at the very least some individuals who are either previously unheard of in elite circles or never found in legitimate databases turned out to be the beneficiaries of multiple accounts the purpose of many accounts could not be ascertained on a global scale the international consortium of investigative journalists icij leading 140 media outlets in 117 countries in this latest investigation found that fugitives con artists murderers and world leaders used offshore accounts to hide wealth and buy properties rappler and the philippine center for investigative journalism pcij parsed through all names and companies from documents collectively known as the pandora papers of the 14 offshore service providers whose documents were accessed by icij partners five had philippine based clients trident trust commence overseas limited overseas management company trust limited asiaciti trust alcogal we found very little information about the persons with the most links to offshore accounts found in the documents from icij check the complete list from the icij here details were scant to be able to identify the purpose of 259 offshore companies while at least 282 names from the list could not be linked to registered or active companies while rappler and pcij do not necessarily imply that illegal transactions were done through these companies of unknown individuals we raise questions on the purposes of keeping these offshore why go offshore it is legal for filipinos to set up offshore accounts these companies however operate in various shades of gray areas that are worthy of scrutiny from regulators a seasoned corporate lawyer who has wealthy clients acknowledged in an interview with rappler and pcij that companies in so called tax havens attract both high net worth individuals and criminals he requested not to be named for one the british virgin islands is an established favorable taxing jurisdiction while the philippines has recent laws which reduced estate and income taxes the british virgin islands still has significantly lower rates we have this client she s a matriarch she owns shares of high value now her concern is that she does not want to burden her children and grandchildren with taxes related to inheritance i think the tax could reach p30 million what if you re rich but not liquid where will you get that money just to inherit the shares the lawyer explained so i advised her to establish a trust because when those shares go into the trust the trust will hold the shares for the benefit of your children and effectively cut what could have been perpetual taxes once it goes down to the grandchildren and their children that saves a lot of money he added for another the territory is very lenient when it comes to disclosure of ownership of companies bvi companies can help in layering one s wealth so as not to attract too much attention the lawyer however admitted that these functions operate within gray areas that corrupt individuals can abuse it s not wrong per se but like all other things it can be used for bad purposes for example you re a politician who got kick backs then you have lodged your funds here in the philippines it s quite possible that the bank secrecy can be lifted during a litigation but if you lodge it abroad it would mean that the court may have to ask for cooperation from that country that company or bank that s a lot of steps the lawyer said we reached out to the business executives we were able to identify on the list they said that their offshore companies were either created for business deals or for cost and tax efficiency some remained dormant and were not used at all moreover corporate lawyers we spoke to pointed out that the rich have every reason to move their money out as the philippines laws unnecessarily tax wealth several times over while there have been reforms the tax laws need to be improved further a corporate lawyer said most importantly moving assets abroad also provides some security for their legally acquired wealth what s fishy what s not with the mix of the good and the bad operating within the bvi system how does one tell which account holds dirty money there really is no clear way said another corporate lawyer who also wanted to remain anonymous so as not to alarm his high profile clients i have a client whose child was almost kidnapped because of their perceived wealth setting up an offshore account hides their money in a legitimate way from people who have bad intentions while also keeping it accessible whenever they need the liquidity the second lawyer said former bureau of internal revenue commissioner kim henares shared this view saying that prominent names on the list may not be an issue as these individuals could easily justify their wealth but if a name does not come up on google but has lots of offshore accounts the second lawyer said i simply ask what are you doing there after careful investigation rappler and pcij found that the purpose of the majority of the offshore companies linked to filipinos on the pandora papers are unclear moreover the secrecy of the offshore system makes it impossible to distinguish which are tied to legitimate sources and which come from criminal activities icij also pointed out that even legal transactions have to also be put into question for instance profits of businesses from high tax countries are transferred to companies that only exist on paper in tax havens does this put the host country like the philippines at a disadvantage or are there gaps needed to be plugged in such countries and territories the philippines is not a unique case according to the paris based organization for economic cooperation and development oecd at least 13 3 trillion is held offshore who s who on the list the tree map below shows that most of the individuals on the list linked to the philippines are unknown or have scant publicly available records the chart was made by carefully checking each name on search engines and databases and matching them with a company these companies are then categorized per industry while the majority of the companies can t be traced to prominent filipino personalities or firms we were able to identify 36 offshore companies linked to conglomerates and mall operators some of which have responded to our queries the names of the sy siblings of sm investments corporation for instance showed up on the commence list and are linked to 10 offshore companies incorporated in the british virgin islands bvi their companies were created sometime between 2002 and 2015 the gaisano family which owns malls and retail outlets mostly in the visayas and mindanao are linked to 12 companies the commence list also indicated the gatchalian family of the wellex group owning 10 bvi companies some members of the aboitiz clan were named owners of 13 companies view the responses of prominent filipinos here when they become available on october 4 at 12 p m philippine time meanwhile at least 31 names on the list are lawyers some of whom are directors and corporate secretaries of publicly listed companies at least six mining companies including monte oro resources and energy have also set up offshore companies monte oro said that the offshore company was set up for an exploration project in sierra leone logistics companies notably of davao based businessman dennis uy s have also appeared on the list the name of transportation secretary arthur tugade also appears on the list read the story here when it becomes available on october 4 at 10 am philippine time mystery people the list from the offshore service providers also revealed that the individuals with the most links did not appear on search engines and other public databases a woman s name for example is identified in 21 offshore companies as their client no other details can be found about this person in any government databases or past offshore leaks the documents from the offshore service providers also did not provide other information meanwhile a 71 year old male appears in 20 companies as either a client or beneficial owner while his name appears on several websites rappler and pcij won t publish his name as we are still unable to verify his identity a network map of all filipino related companies in the pandora papers also showed that the companies of the mystery woman are linked to other individuals on the list meanwhile the companies established by the 71 year old man are only linked to one individual who could either be his wife or relative the documents were able to identify 156 filipinos 21 chinese and 9 britons but the nationalities of 160 other names on the list cannot be ascertained almost all of these names however are filipino and chinese sounding the documents from icij revealed that more filipinos started to create offshore companies in 1997 or during the asian financial crisis the crisis led to financial contagion drop in stock prices and the peso s devaluation among other economic meltdowns a total of 23 offshore companies were established by philippine based individuals and companies in 1997 alone among those who established these were the gatchalian family who are prominent businessmen and politicians in 2015 another spike in the number of incorporated offshore companies was observed among the 28 companies established during that time were owned by the gaisano and sy families to search for the names of filipinos on the pandora papers database use the search bar below a long way to go on reforms while offshore companies continue to house money of both legitimate and sketchy individuals leaks to the press have made significant improvements to somewhat lift the veil for instance the panama papers of 2016 helped persuade the united states congress to pass the corporate transparency act which requires owners of companies to disclose their identities to the treasury department meanwhile the organization for economic cooperation and development reported that nearly 100 countries carried out automatic exchange of information in 2019 enabling tax authorities to obtain data on 84 million financial accounts held offshore by their residents this represents a significant increase over 2018 the first year of such information exchange where information on 47 million financial accounts was exchanged representing 5 trillion the growth stems from an increase in the number of jurisdictions receiving information as well as a wider scope of information exchanged the oecd said the philippines however has a long way to go while leaks via the panama papers and the paradise papers of 2017 have prompted legislators in other countries to follow the rest of the world in lifting the bank secrecy law the philippines continues to keep the lid on the philippines is the only country left in the world with a law that keeps the secrecy on bank deposits end contributors to the pandora papers project carmela fonbuena miriam grace a go karol ilagan elyssa lopez pauline macaraeg ralf rivas felipe salvosa follow pcij on

former facebook product manager frances haugen has been revealed as the source behind tens of thousands of pages of leaked internal company research which she says show that the company has been negligent in eliminating violence misinformation and other harmful content from its services and that it has misled investors about these efforts in an interview with the washington post haugen said that while working at facebook in the company s civic integrity division she realized it was not disclosing important information about the harms of its products to the public and the policymakers tasked with regulation creating a situation she said posed a threat to democracy facebook in its current form is dangerous she said it became necessary to get the public involved for facebook the document leak and the public reveal of the source represents perhaps the most significant crisis in the company s history further deteriorating relationships between the company and washington politicians the company is the target of a historic federal antitrust case and is fielding document requests as members of congress investigate its role in the jan 6 riot at the u s capitol advertisement widely referred to as a facebook whistleblower responsible for leaking documents behind a wall street journal series haugen spoke publicly about her complaint to federal authorities disclosing her identity for the first time in an interview airing sunday night on 60 minutes there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for facebook and facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests like making more money haugen said in the interview a veteran of tech companies including pinterest yelp and google haugen 37 left facebook in may after developing serious reservations about the company s policies particularly surrounding the events of jan 6 before the 2020 election haugen said facebook implemented measures to prevent the spread of misinformation but the company decided to dissolve many of these protections after the election she said she stopped trusting that her employer was willing to limit growth to improve public safety advertisement as soon as the election was over they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before to prioritize growth over safety she said and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me haugen s lawyers have filed at least eight complaints with the securities and exchange commission which has broad oversight over financial markets and can bring charges against companies suspected of misleading investors resulting in fines or other penalties for companies and executives the complaints compare haugen s findings with the company s public statements according to 60 minutes the sec did not comment sunday on the documents or whether it planned to bring action against facebook facebook spokesperson lena pietsch said in a statement every day our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place to suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true advertisement sen richard blumenthal d conn whose congressional panel will hear testimony from haugen on tuesday said in a phone interview following haugen s 60 minutes appearance that the sec should take very seriously her allegations that facebook may have misled its investors and should be very likely investigating formally facebook certainly misled and deceived the public and so their investors may well have been deceived as well blumenthal added blumenthal said that in addition to delving into how facebook s products harm children lawmakers at the hearing will dig into haugen s claim that the social media giant undermined its safety efforts by disbanding the civic integrity team she worked on after the 2020 election lawmakers for years have threatened legislation they say would increase facebook s responsibility for privacy abuses or amplifying harmful or misleading content but to date congress has not passed any comprehensive social media bills into law allowing companies like facebook to flourish largely unhindered by legal restrictions advertisement a lot of what facebook is doing isn t illegal because they hid the information that politicians would have needed to create regulations that addressed it she said but you can t lie to your investors haugen who has worked in the tech industry since 2006 said she knew coming into facebook that the company had problems but she was shocked by the extent to which misinformation was fomenting violence and other problems around the world share this article share i thought i knew how bad misinformation was she said then i learned what it was doing in countries that don t speak english because of her concern for facebook s impact in developing countries she says she hopes to advance language agnostic solutions for that might reduce the spread of misinformation around the word for instance she said facebook could introduce measures to slow down the spread of posts around covid such as capping the number of times a post can be re shared advertisement i don t understand in a crisis why we can t just do that she said we should just have a little friction her plea comes as the white house and other policymakers are scrutinizing the role falsehoods on facebook may play in preventing people from getting vaccinated during the pandemic for weeks revelations from the documents which were at the center of the wall street journal s facebook files series have bolstered claims that facebook s researchers and executives have a deep understanding of the ways its products harm people beyond what had been previously known to the public and key policymakers the wide ranging documents represent an unprecedented look inside facebook s struggles with an assortment of problems including child safety political polarization human trafficking and drug cartels advertisement andrew bakaj who represents haugen at whistleblower aid said it was immediately clear that she had materials that were critical for lawmakers and regulators seeking to hold the company accountable she s a perfect example of why whistleblowers are so important without her we didn t know what we didn t know bakaj told the post the material has only added to the embattled company s woes in washington including haugen s upcoming testimony before the senate commerce consumer protection subcommittee tuesday and documents she has shared with congressional offices probing facebook haugen said she hopes the leaks will aid lawmakers to get the fortitude and motivation to go put those regulations into place facebook has sought to deny and deflect the revelations downplaying the documents even tearing into its own internal research in blog posts interviews and congressional testimony facebook s vice president of global affairs nick clegg appeared sunday morning on cnn calling allegations that the company is to blame for the violence on jan 6 ludicrous the company s top executives chief executive mark zuckerberg and chief operating officer sheryl sandberg have not addressed the reports advertisement the responsibility for the violence on january the 6th and the insurrection on that day lies squarely with the people who inflicted the violence and those who encouraged them including then president trump and candidly many other people in the media who were encouraging the assertion that the election was stolen clegg said lawmakers in the house and senate have demanded that facebook turn over documents pertaining to its handling of the jan 6 insurrection including an order from the house select committee investigating the matter to preserve communications on its platforms related to the riot at the capitol facebook spokesman andy stone said at the time that the company looks forward to continuing to work with the committee in the house but did not say whether it will fully comply with the requests lawmakers across capitol hill have at times criticized the company for not turning over documents about its policies and practices on misinformation violent rhetoric and more despite repeated pleas from lawmakers to make more of its research public so far the company has turned over two partially redacted slide decks looking at instagram s impact on children and teens mental health along with annotations downplaying their findings advertisement the company agreed to partially comply with the facebook oversight board s recommendation that the company take a comprehensive review of its impact on the events of jan 6 reflecting on the design and policy choices that may enable its platform to be abused instead facebook committed to making data available to a select group of its existing research partners clegg said despite the public backlash facebook would continue to do research into the negative impacts of its products we re going to continue to ask ourselves these difficult questions clegg said in the interview facebook has been under the microscope in washington for nearly five years for concerns ranging from foreign disinformation to privacy abuses the company is already the target of a historic federal trade commission antitrust case which it is expected to respond to on monday in 2019 it also had to pay a record setting 5 billion fine to settle with the ftc over alleged privacy abuses lawmakers on capitol hill responded last week by hauling facebook executive antigone davis before congress to testify on a wall street journal report including company research that showed that facebook owned instagram was making teen girls body image issues worse at the hearing lawmakers accused facebook of burying these findings and pledged to further investigate the matter haugen addressed the findings about social media s impact on teen girls in the 60 minutes interview as these young women begin to consume this eating disorder content they get more and more depressed haugen said and it actually makes them use the app more and so they end up in this feedback cycle where they hate their bodies more and more haugen is going public with her findings amid a growing debate about the power and influence of the world s largest tech companies and a growing push from countries worldwide to pursue regulation
durham n c and beijing oct 3 2021 prnewswire brii biosciences limited brii bio or the company stock code 2137 hk a multi national company developing innovative therapies for diseases with significant unmet medical needs and large public health burdens presented at idweek 2021 interim results from phase 3 of the activ 2 trial which showed that brii 196 brii 198 combination brii 196 brii 198 the company s neutralizing monoclonal antibody mab combination therapy for sars cov 2 virus that causes covid 19 achieved a similar reduction in hospitalization or death among patients who initiated treatment early within five days versus late six to 10 days following symptom onset these initial results suggest that combination brii 196 brii 198 may remain effective in a majority of patients who are late to treatment potentially extending its clinical benefit in a real world setting where rapid access to care can be a challenge overall brii 196 brii 198 reduced the risk of hospitalization and death over placebo by 78 in 837 outpatients at high risk of clinical progression through the 28 day primary endpoint zero n 418 deaths were observed on brii 196 brii 198 versus eight n 419 deaths on

b 1 621 mu brii 196 brii 198 were evaluated via a microneutralization assay demonstrating that there was no change in the average fold reduction in susceptibility across the pseudo variants further the phase 1 data showed that combination brii 196 brii 198 was well tolerated with no saes and no reported aes that led to study discontinuation or death the pharmacokinetic pk profiles of brii 196 and brii 198 when used in combination were consistent with those observed as monotherapies suggesting there are no interactions between the two mabs based on these findings and the growing body of

the full power of the state is behind the covid regime to alert citizens about the deadly consequences of covid 19 policy such as denying patient access to lifesaving early treatments disrupting the sacred physician patient relationship and suppressing open scientific discussion for profits and power the elites are trying to pull up the ladder erase upward mobility for large segments of the population cull political opponents and other undesirables and put the remainder of humanity on a tight leash rationing our access to certain goods and services that they have deemed high impact such as automobile use tourism meat consumption and so on naturally they will continue to have their own luxuries as part of a strict caste system akin to feudalism when those who have decided to live within the truth have been denied any direct influence on the existing social structures not to mention the opportunity to participate in them and when these people begin to create what i have called the independent life of society this independent life begins of itself to become structured in a certain way sometimes there are only very embryonic indications of this process of structuring at other times the structures are already quite well developed their genesis and evolution are inseparable from the phenomenon of dissent even though they reach far beyond the arbitrarily defined area of

specter is haunting the world the increasing prospect of a new totalitarianism unlike the specter of communism this specter originates from those in power and not from underground revolutionaries although communism may always be an undertaking of elites rather than haunting only europe this specter casts its long shadow across the future of all humanity such that one wonders how one might plan if at all for this future citizens and non citizens alike are trapped on the land mass forbidden to leave the country without a good reason and nothing seems to be a good reason large swaths of the population have been prisoners in their homes and neighborhoods for months the australian military enforcers a curfew in new south wales and the covidsafe app enforces one in south australia the state sends random texts to the homebound prisoners via the app those under house arrest have fifteen minutes to respond before the police are sent or not we don t tell them how often or when on a random basis they have to reply within 15 minutes the premiere explained just as in jeremy bentham s panopticon the prisoners are never sure if they are being watched although they know they may be those who dare to venture a block beyond the assigned perimeter are apprehended by the police and choked handcuffed slammed face down on the street sprayed in the face with noxious chemicals and hauled off to who knows where for their own good those rallying for their freedoms are hailed and struck with rubber bullets citizens are encouraged to report on other citizens for behavior that they have been told is akin to murder a man sneezed in an elevator and then left his apartment building triggering a nationwide manhunt in which the population was enlisted rescue dogs were shot dead under the false pretense of rescuing people although only slightly less draconian severe measures have been enforced in the other liberal democracies including the u s the uk germany france canada and new zealand this includes health care workers who just last month were hailed as heroes by those who now cheer on their removal they are now to be dispensed with like so many used syringes to sink the knife in deeper health care workers dismissed for vaccine disobedience are ineligible for unemployment in new york while new york and connecticut plan to replace them with the national guard we should remember that the covid regime came on the heels of an already advanced illiberalism as seen in the censorship the onslaught of non stop propaganda the proliferation of doublespeak the endless gaslighting the political witch hunts and the cancellation rituals reminiscent of the chinese cultural revolution and the stalinist purges the methods have been amplified under the covid regime to breath taking effect in fact open scientific inquiry has been deemed verboten deviationism from the science a new medical lysenkoism promoted by covid cult leaders deviant academics scientists doctors and the all the unvaccinated are falsely blamed vilified isolated shamed and punished the purges are sustained by relentless propaganda facebook s fact checker factcheck org is funded by the robert wood johnson foundation which owns 1 8 billion dollars in johnson johnson stock google s parent company alphabet inc owns the capital investment firm gv formerly google ventures gv is one of the institutional investors in the uk firm vaccitech the biotech startup behind the covid 19 vaccine developed by astrazeneca and oxford university as the pandemic rolled out in early 2020 vaccitech was one of the most valuable companies in the portfolio of the university affiliated oxford sciences innovation although it had yet to bring a single drug to market sequoia capital china also invested in vaccitech during its ipo sequoia capital meanwhile is invested in apple google linkedin oracle paypal youtube and zoom is it any wonder then that big digital corporations censor covid related content that runs counter to the official vaccine propaganda but the state is not only the government it is the entirety of the clique in power the clique includes the officials in the american and chinese politburo otherwise known as the biden administration and the ccp but it also includes powerful individuals like bill gates anthony fauci the notorious doctor wen and many others as well as nearly all major cultural and educational institutions multi national corporations non governmental organizations non profits national and supranational agencies churches synagogues and many members of the general population who are essentially enrolled as state agents of course it includes big digital yet the neo marxists and the silent liberals and conservatives do not recognize it as such to them it s just the way things are and the way things have always been this could not be further from the truth instead after a long march the woke or socialist communist infiltration of the american state is almost total the covid response is an extension of the permanent revolution which accelerated rapidly from 2016 on if not before i ve included religious bodies in the state because they have been largely co opted their beliefs were already hijacked by the woke movement before most became complicit in the covid regime which has since transmuted religious meaning and symbolism into the rituals of the covid cult this represents not only the secularization of the religious sphere but also its communization as catholic archbishop vigano stated in may the rituality of the present pandemic is quite obvious especially in the way they have wanted to give the vaccine a sacramental value on cue the unelected vaccination is apparently a sacrament instituted by god to give grace to reject the vaccine is to reject life and all that is good including god himself jesus as it turns out was a vaccine manufacturer perhaps a stockholder in pfizer or moderna we have learned that he preached that only those vaccinated and vaccinated again and again and again may enter the kingdom of heaven the covidians are the apostles sent into the world to spread the good news of salvation by vaccination and he said unto them whosoever shall not receive the vaccine and booster shots nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake the dust off your feet who are these unbelievers they are selfish people who claim individual autonomy and bodily integrity they may include the vaccinated it isn t enough to be vaccinated one must also confess and profess the almighty power of the vaccine these reprobates dare to decide whether they are injected with an experimental cocktail ad infinitum they have the temerity to think for themselves they must be excluded from society they must be condemned to die alone after living and begging in the shadows they include heretics who refuse to recite word for word the catechism of the science some of them even refuse to leap forward denying the inevitability and sanctity of the great reset it has been declared that the covid lockdowns must be followed by climate change lockdowns plus other restrictions the earth must be protected from the meat eating locomoting and unfettered procreation of the masses yes there are those who dare to suggest that this progressive and incremental mass vaccine program is akin to the progressive mass eugenics program of the last century speaking of conspiracy theories the mendacity of the covid regime essentially generates them as if spontaneously i won t attempt to adjudicate that data here i ll leave that to a growing body of medical doctors and scientists as of this writing some 7 800 have signed the rome declaration a cri de coeur so does a group of nazi concentration camp survivors a day or two after the rome declaration was posted the spartacus letter was published this audacious rebel dared to engage the science on scientific terms the letter must have contained some forbidden truth because it was immediately scrubbed by big digital although republished in several venues it remains virtually undiscoverable the esoteric language of the letter describes the effects of the virus and the vaccines in precise scientific terms that only a member of the cognoscenti could muster it may be the most detailed scientific analysis of the virus and the vaccine that i have read to date it then makes such declarations as the following it s becoming more and more difficult to resist such conclusions i have described this as part of an effort to establish corporate socialism or actually existing socialism on the ground and corporate monopolists tightly coupled with the government on top i have also called it capitalism with chinese characteristics this would explain why the elites propagate socialist ideology and rhetoric to the public while engaging in economic fascism themselves the question inevitably arises what should be done i m not going to make recommendations for what everyone should do you may decide to live in a shack in the woods and i may decide to stay in the city and do battle with the passport mandate police with the unending booster requirements and no libertarian worthy of the name should ever be complicit in quarantining the healthy whether in a camp facility institution town state or in their own homes i m talking to you now cato institute i will relay what others have done under somewhat similar conditions and speak to the possible advantages of such actions the measures i recommend are rooted in the need for pragmatic action under totalitarianism we are not living under what henry hazlitt in the road to totalitarianism called total totalitarianism not yet anyway but hazlitt continued by saying it s not dark yet but it s getting there i believe that we need to look to exemplary dissidents from the former soviet union and the eastern bloc to respond to our contemporary conditions what were the responses of such dissidents to totalitarianism as one of these dissidents the czech playwright and later president of czechoslovakia vaclav havel wrote what are parallel structures the mere mention of the phrase will stir the imaginations of those who understand what this might mean they are more or less organized communities usually built by dissidents they are sites where resistance to totalitarian bureaucracies allows for the expression of freedom and creativity their organic output has historically included samizdat books private performances seminars exhibitions periodicals alternative educational forums parallel universities parallel information networks and even embryonic parallel economies eventually these parallel structures may spawn a parallel polis and renewed political possibility in our context parallel structures may be networks of people building communities of mutual support and communications but not ideological homogeneity many such groupings and parallel structures already exist they include media and communication networks some even within the online spaces many of us already frequent and they may be formed around podcasts and podcasters websites and writers peer to peer channels and programmers and radio broadcasts and their listeners to create and sustain environments most conducive to liberty these networks must aim to be as decentralized and as independent of big digital as possible i nevertheless recommend that people retain the beachheads they have secured on mainline social media platforms and spread out from there our parallel structures include parallel education organizations and institutions like tom woods s liberty classroom and one that i co founded american scholars they include what are now called freedom cells which are local and touring communities of support and exchange both social and economic on the specifically economic front they include those empowering themselves and others to attain financial literacy independence and responsiveness bitcoin communities represent parallel structures of potential resistance and survivability especially considering the frightening prospect of a global digital currency which would mean total control over buying selling and saving the mises caucus is currently a parallel political structure it provides a political home and community for those disaffected with the legacy parties and an important niche within the libertarian party for those seeking principled economic and political policies and the unapologetic assertion of individual human rights under all circumstances i will end with a plea that those inhabiting existing parallel structures and those forming new ones otherwise our parallel structures may become isolated from others by particularism we are up against totalitarianism that is why i suggest that we understand ourselves primarily as dissidents and secondarily as party and caucus supporters as such we may become the germ of a future social economic and political renaissance
stock image photo by martin barraud ojo images st george news omaha neb ap more than a year after u s health care workers on the front lines against covid 19 were saluted as heroes with nightly clapping from windows and balconies some are being issued panic buttons in case of assault and ditching their scrubs before going out in public for fear of harassment across the country doctors and nurses are dealing with hostility threats and violence from patients angry over safety rules designed to keep the disease from spreading the hostility is making an already stressful job harder many places are suffering severe staffing shortages in part because nurses have become burned out and quit i think one thing that we have seen and heard from many of our people is that it is just really hard to come to work every day when people treat each other poorly said dr kencee graves a physician at the university of utah hospital in salt lake city if you have to fight with somebody about wearing a mask or if you aren t allowed to visit and we have to argue about that that is stressful dr stu coffman a dallas based emergency room physician said a year ago health care workers were celebrated as heroes and received rounds of applause now we re being in some areas harassed and disbelieved and ridiculed for what we re trying to do which is just depressing and frustrating coffman said cox medical center branson in missouri started giving panic buttons to up to 400 nurses and other employees after assaults per year tripled between 2019 and 2020 to 123 a spokeswoman said one nurse had to get her shoulder x rayed after an attack hospital spokeswoman brandei clifton said the pandemic has driven at least some of the increase so many nurses say it s just part of the job clifton said it s not part of the job some hospitals have limited the number of public entrances in idaho nurses said they are scared to go to the grocery store unless they have changed out of their scrubs so they aren t accosted by angry residents doctors and nurses at a coeur d alene idaho hospital have been accused of killing patients by grieving family members who don t believe covid 19 is real said hospital spokeswoman caiti bobbitt others have been the subject of hurtful rumors spread by people angry about the pandemic our health care workers are almost feeling like vietnam veterans scared to go into the community after a shift bobbitt said over labor day weekend in colorado a passerby threw an unidentified liquid at a nurse working at a mobile vaccine clinic in suburban denver another person in a pickup truck ran over and destroyed signs put up around the clinic s tent about 3 in 10 nurses who took part in a survey this month by an umbrella organization of nurses unions across the u s reported an increase in violence where they work stemming from factors including staff shortages and fewer visitor restrictions that was up from 2 in 10 in march according to the national nurses united survey of 5 000 nurses michelle jones a nurse at a covid 19 icu unit in wichita kansas said patients are coming in scared sometimes several from the same family and often near death their relatives are angry thinking the nurses and doctors are letting them die they cry they yell they sit outside our icu in little groups and pray jones said lots of people think they are going to get miracles and god is not passing those out this year if you come into my icu there is a good chance you are going to die she said the powerful steroids that have shown promise often make patients angrier it is like roid rage on people she said i ve worked in health care for 26 years and i ve not seen anything like this i ve never seen the public act like this across the u s the covid 19 crisis has caused people to behave badly toward one another in a multitude of ways several people have been shot to death in disputes over masks in stores and other public places shouting matches and scuffles have broken out at school board meetings a brawl erupted earlier this month at a new york city restaurant over its requirement that customers show proof of vaccination dr chris sampson an emergency room physician in columbia missouri said violence has always been a problem in the emergency department but the situation has gotten worse in recent months sampson said he has been pushed up against a wall and seen nurses kicked dr ashley coggins of st peter s health regional medical center in helena montana said she recently asked a patient whether he wanted to be vaccinated he said f no and i didn t ask further because i personally don t want to get yelled at coggins said you know this is a weird time in our world and the respect that we used to have for each other the respect that people used to have for caregivers and physicians and nurses it s not always there and it makes this job way harder coggins said the patient told her that he wanted to strangle president biden for pushing for vaccinations prompting her to change the subject she said security guards are now in charge of enforcing mask rules for hospital visitors so that nurses no longer have to be the ones to

durham n c and beijing oct 3 2021 prnewswire brii biosciences limited brii bio or the company stock code 2137 hk a multi national company developing innovative therapies for diseases with significant unmet medical needs and large public health burdens presented at idweek 2021 interim results from phase 3 of the activ 2 trial which showed that brii 196 brii 198 combination brii 196 brii 198 the company s neutralizing monoclonal antibody mab combination therapy for sars cov 2 virus that causes covid 19 achieved a similar reduction in hospitalization or death among patients who initiated treatment early within five days versus late six to 10 days following symptom onset these initial results suggest that combination brii 196 brii 198 may remain effective in a majority of patients who are late to treatment potentially extending its clinical benefit in a real world setting where rapid access to care can be a challenge overall brii 196 brii 198 reduced the risk of hospitalization and death over placebo by 78 in 837 outpatients at high risk of clinical progression through the 28 day primary endpoint zero n 418 deaths were observed on brii 196 brii 198 versus eight n 419 deaths on the placebo arm of those subjects who received treatment with brii 196 brii 198 within five days of symptom onset 2 4 196 progressed to hospitalization or death compared with 11 21 197 in the placebo arm similarly 2 5 222 of subjects who received treatment with brii 196 brii 198 at six to 10 days following symptom onset progressed to hospitalization or death compared with 11 24 222 of those receiving placebo grade 3 or higher adverse events aes were less common in the brii 196 brii 198 treatment arm versus placebo 3 8 16 418 versus 13 4 56 419 with no drug related severe adverse events saes or infusion reactions observed we re very encouraged by the significant reduction of hospitalizations or death among covid 19 outpatients at high risk of clinical progression with these interim phase 3 results demonstrating that brii 196 brii 198 may have clinical utility in patients presenting as late as 10 days after symptom onset providing another solution to healthcare providers and institutions that continue to deal with increasing hospital admission rates and an overburdened system said teresa h evering m d m s weill cornell medicine co lead investigator of brii 196 brii 198 in

increased incidence of disease based on current and newly emerging variants it is imperative that we prioritize and progress the development of safe and effective therapies for the prevention of severe disease said eric s daar m d lundquist institute at harbor ucla medical center co lead investigator of brii 196 brii 198 in activ 2 this growing suite of positive data for combination brii 196 brii 198 including the consistently high risk reduction and improved safety profile across an expansive set of patients with varying disease progression provides further validation of its potential to provide a novel therapeutic option for covid 19 patients said david margolis m d mph vice president and head of infectious diseases therapy at brii bio we are pleased with the improved safety profile of brii 196 brii 198 combination safety is critically important in addressing such a global public health crisis in addition to the late breaker data brii bio presented findings in a poster presentation at idweek from both preclinical and phase 1 studies the preclinical results showed that brii 196 brii 198 exhibited neutralizing activity against pseudo virus variants that contained spike mutations of a panel of ten variants of concern or interest including commonly identified variants b 1 1 7 alpha b 1 351 beta b 1 1 248 p 1 gamma b 1 429 epsilon b 1 617 2 delta c 37 lambda and b 1 621 mu brii 196 brii 198 were evaluated via a microneutralization assay demonstrating that there was no change in the average fold reduction in susceptibility across the pseudo variants further the phase 1 data showed that combination brii 196 brii 198 was well tolerated with no saes and no reported aes that led to study discontinuation or death the pharmacokinetic pk profiles of brii 196 and brii 198 when used in combination were consistent with those observed as monotherapies suggesting there are no interactions between the two mabs based on these findings and the growing body of evidence supporting the use of combination brii 196 brii 198 brii bio plans to submit an application for emergency use authorization eua to the u s food and drug administration by the end of the year

bloomberg masayoshi son has sharply accelerated the pace of his startup investments this year quintupling the number of companies in his vision fund 2 portfolio in less than nine months the founder of softbank group corp has cut 115 deals this year according to bloomberg calculations based on data released by the company that is more than the combined number of deals the first vision fund made since its start in 2017 showing son remains confident in his investing capability despite blunders with office sharing service wework and financier greensill the faster pace of deal making is sure to raise questions about whether son is risking similar missteps especially as a string of high profile departures depletes top talent at the vision fund seven managing partners have left since march of last year and last week deep nishar the sole senior managing partner and leading authority on ai said he would depart by the end of the year vision fund s track record was not great to begin with and now they are doing more with fewer people said amir anvarzadeh senior strategist at asymmetric advisors who recommends shorting softbank s stock potential failure rates are bound to be higher but you can imagine son just throwing caution to the wind and playing the percentages the total headcount at softbank investment advisers which oversees both vision funds has shrunk from about 500 people early last year to about 400 now according to a person familiar with the matter several senior people who departed grew frustrated with son s overriding influence which left them with little real authority people familiar with the matter said the vision fund s compensation structure also caused tension with executives limited in their ability to profit from successful startups they introduced to son the people said a spokesman for the vision fund declined to comment on the story the personnel cuts last year focused on reducing vision fund s support and back office staff according to a different person familiar with the matter the organization also hired three managing partners since last march and has added 40 other investors since the start of april for a total of 145 the person said asking not to be identified because the details are private softbank is stepping up investments just as venture capital activity is reaching a fever pitch funding for startups reached a global record of 156 billion in the second quarter according to cb insights son meanwhile increased the amount of money allocated to vision fund 2 from 10 billion at the start of the year to 40 billion in june the billionaire also plans invest up to 2 6 billion of his own money in the fund one concern is that there is a lot of competition from other investors and valuations already feel inflated which means smaller returns for softbank down the road said kirk boodry an analyst at redex research in tokyo another worry is about their decision making process when you invest into 30 or 40 companies in such a narrow time frame due diligence is bound to suffer softbank is speeding up in part because of the growing competition from venture capital firms one of the people said the company used to take as long as a month to make investment decisions hiring big consulting firms like mckinsey co bain co and boston consulting group inc to help with due diligence the person said now softbank has two weeks at most and typically does less due diligence reflecting the smaller size of the deals on multiple occasions founders have demanded an answer the following day prompting softbank to call an emergency gathering of its investment committee the person said son is making much smaller bets on any particular company the vision fund 2 s average funding round is about 330 million or roughly half the average size of the first vision fund s investments according to bloomberg calculations based on data from crunchbase the first fund s deals often ran into the billions more than 10 billion in didi chuxing 7 7 billion in uber technologies inc and 4 4 billion in wework vision fund 2 has made only three investments over 1 billion including a 1 3 billion bet on china s ke holdings inc which runs the beike online property service in addition to the two vision funds softbank set up a 5 billion latin america fund that has invested in 48 companies since its creation in march 2019 son earlier this month boosted the capital dedicated to the region by another 3 billion at the latest earnings briefing in august son said that softbank s portfolio totaled over 300 companies across the three different funds the investment strategy remains the same he said backing startups that rely on artificial intelligence to disrupt traditional businesses i sincerely believe that ai will revolutionize all industries son said at an earnings briefing in august as an investor in this revolutionary space in the past four years we are taking a full swing softbank started building up its vision fund staff when son planned to raise a new mammoth fund every few years he originally aimed to raise 108 billion for vision fund 2 from outside investors that included apple inc and microsoft corp those plans collapsed after the meltdown at wework in late 2019 vision fund 2 is still by far the world s biggest vc actively investing the fund has already spent 19 5 billion as of the end of june about half of its alloted capital that s more than the 19 2 billion sequoia capital raised over 30 different funds and 18 2 billion among andreessen horowitz s 20 funds according to crunchbase data tiger global management the closest rival raised a total of 23 4 billion over 8 funds while the first fund was heavily weighted toward the ride hailing and office sharing vision fund 2 has backed a broader spectrum of companies in its private company portfolio consumer startups accounted for 22 of its investments as of the end of june with enterprise and logistics segments receiving about 20 each fintech which got little attention from vf1 had a 16 share it s hard to imagine that masa s methodology has changed that much and his affinity for entrepreneurs is something that has always worried investors said boodry the hope is that the vision fund is more seasoned now and that they can gate themselves from that 2021 bloomberg l p

large banks operating in washington state will have to pay more in taxes after a court upheld a state revenue raising plan that specifically targets big financial institutions in a unanimous opinion thursday the washington supreme court rejected the argument made by banking trade groups that the 2019 tax law discriminates against out of state companies the decision overturned the ruling of a trial court that sided with the industry groups the two year old law imposes a surtax on certain financial institutions with an annual company wide net income of at least 1 billion whether they are based in washington state or elsewhere industry groups had contended that the law was nonetheless aimed at out of state banks in violation of the portion of the u s constitution that gives congress the right to regulate commerce between the states while the court ultimately disagreed with our arguments the washington bankers association and the american bankers association said in a joint statement we continue to believe that a tax that is actually only paid by banks based out of state or otherwise heavily engaged in interstate commerce violates the u s constitution the law took effect on jan 1 2020 and in the first three months of last year the only period for which data was available the washington state government received 34 million in revenue from 153 financial institutions that were subject to the new law including three companies based in the evergreen state the law covers not only banks but also certain other companies that get more than half of their gross receipts from activities that a bank would be authorized to transact under the law financial institutions that meet the 1 billion net income requirement must pay a surtax equal to 1 2 of their gross income from washington business activity the surtax for large firms is in addition to a 2 7 tax on gross state income that applies to all financial institutions regardless of their size the top five banks in deposit share in washington state bank of america jpmorgan chase wells fargo u s bank and keybank are all based elsewhere spokespeople for the five banks all of which reported more than 1 billion in net income last year declined to comment on the court s decision the state supreme court s ruling was hailed by andy nicholas a senior fellow at the washington state budget policy center one of several organizations that jointly filed a brief in support of the surtax he called the 2019 law an attempt by the legislature to remedy a tax system that exacerbates wealth inequality washington has a notoriously regressive upside down state and local tax code nicholas said the state legislature made a similar argument in a note attached to the 2019 tax law which suggested that a tax on big firms will ultimately be paid largely by wealthy individuals who are more likely than others to be invested in the stock market washington s tax system disproportionately impacts those with the least ability to pay as a percentage of household income middle income families in washington pay two to four times the amount of taxes as compared to top earners in the state the note read the legislature concludes that those wealthy few who have profited the most from the recent economic expansion can contribute to the essential services and programs all washington families need the banking industry groups in arguing that the tax discriminates against out of state banks had pointed to remarks that a key legislative supporter made about encouraging a resurgence of local banks but the state supreme court wrote that the statements were made in response to proposed amendments that were not adopted and had been taken out of context the banking groups had also cited legislative talking points in support of the tax that said the levy would not affect local banks and would help increase their competitiveness with big banks but the court wrote that those talking points offered little persuasive evidence of discriminatory intent when weighed against the explicit nondiscriminatory purpose that was outlined in the text of the law and echoed by lawmakers in their joint statement the washington bankers association and the american bankers association criticized the state legislature over its handling of the tax law the legislature considered the tax only in the last few days of its session with very little public input and debate the two trade groups stated legislation particularly complicated tax bills needs time to be adequately vetted by the public and lawmakers to avoid costing the state and taxpayers unnecessary time and money the banking industry groups said that they will be evaluating their options following the state supreme court s ruling one such option is to appeal the decision to the u s supreme court said michael lurie a tax attorney at reed smith who represents financial institutions that will likely be subject to the washington state surtax another potential path according to lurie is for an out of state bank that is subject to a tax to file an administrative challenge before the washington state department of revenue on the grounds that it is paying more

a federal judge last week ordered the u s army corps of engineers to revisit its decision that a dairy farm recently constructed in the kankakee river basin in newton county was not subject to the clean water act the hoosier environmental council indiana audubon society and several residents of lake village filed a clean water act citizen lawsuit against texas based natural prairie dairy and the army corps of engineers in july 2019 the organizations said natural prairie dairy violated the clean water act when it installed drainage tiles and filled ditches some of which flow into the kankakee river while building its concentrated animal feeding operation natural prairie dairy did not contact the army corps to determine if the land and ditches were subject to federal regulation until nearly two years after the work was completed following complaints from residents and the hoosier environmental council the organizations said the army corps summarily concluded that the land is not a wetland and the ditches were not jurisdictional waters effectively legitimizing natural prairie s activities after the fact and eliminating the need for natural prairie to obtain a federal permit to build its cafo said kim ferraro senior staff attorney for the hoosier environmental council u s district judge damon leichty determined the corps administrative jurisdictional determination was arbitrary and capricious because it was not supported by facts in the administrative record he remanded the decision to the corps for further consideration the district court s 37 page opinion is a decisive legal victory for the protection of wetlands which the court rightly acknowledged are among the most productive ecosystems in the world comparable to rain forests and coral reefs not simply moist patches of earth ferraro said the army corps gave natural prairie a free pass for attempting to evade regulation by destroying sensitive wetland areas and tributaries of the kankakee river and then asking for permission only when its activities were later discovered and brought to light by hec the court s decision makes clear that such conduct is not ok and that the army corps cannot just look the other way but must do its job the area where natural prairie dairy built its operation which includes 4 350 cows and a 9 acre waste lagoon is in one of the most ecologically sensitive and historically significant areas in the state the organizations said the land is in the former lakebed of beaver lake which was the largest natural lake in indiana until it was drained in the early 1900s to create farmland the area was part of the grand kankakee marsh dubbed the everglades of the north which once stretched nearly a million acres across northern indiana and illinois the organizations said in recent years the nature conservancy restored wetlands and native prairie at the nearby kankakee sands which borders natural prairie dairy s property kankakee sands is composed of more than 7 000 acres and is home to about 87 rare threatened or endangered species the judge wrote to drain beaver lake several large ditches and drainage canals were constructed to move water into the kankakee river leichty wrote two of the ditches lawler ditch and bogus island ditch and several small ditches are on natural prairie dairy s land natural prairie s filling activities were so invasive that when the inspector came to see the site and meet with natural prairie s owner and his attorney he was able to access only one small portion of a lateral ditch left unfilled the judge wrote though the inspector noted the historical existence of wetlands at the site and reviewed 14 aerial photographs taken between 1938 and 2017 he went on to find no wetlands at the property the corps assumed without seeming support or analysis that natural prairie s land was prior converted cropland the judge wrote leichty determined the inspector failed to describe the previous drainage system natural prairie s new drainage system how the systems were designed to function and whether they were effective in removing wetland hydrology from the area the conclusion was reached without any consideration of the hydrology of the land before natural prairie s alteration the judge said the court s review of the administrative record leaves substantial gaps from the data the corps used to the conclusion the corps made leichty wrote these gaps are so significant that the court is left with the firm conviction that the corps did not follow its own guidance and procedures when it concluded that natural prairie s land was prior converted cropland before natural prairie s alterations

how marginalized communities in the south are paying the price for â green energyâ in europe published july 9 2021 andrea macklin never turns off his tv itâ s the only way to drown out the noise from the wood mill bordering his backyard the jackhammer sound of the plant piercing his walls and windows the 18 wheelers carrying logs rumble by less than 100 feet from his house all day and night shaking it as if an earthquake has taken over this tranquil corner of north carolina heâ s been wearing masks since long before the coronavirus pandemic just to keep the dust out of his lungs some nights he only sleeps for two or three hours breathing is a chore â i havenâ t had proper rest since theyâ ve been here â he said that was eight years ago when the worldâ s largest biomass producer enviva opened its second north carolina facility just west of macklinâ s property in garysburg the operation takes mostly hardwood trees and spits out biomass or wood pellets a highly processed and compressed wood product burned to generate energy enviva is one of nearly a dozen similar companies benefiting from a sustainability commitment made 4 000 miles away more than a decade ago â itâ s like we donâ t matterâ green energy loophole has devastating impact on community in 2009 the european union eu pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions urging its member states to shift from fossil fuels to renewables in its renewable energy directive red the eu classified biomass as a renewable energy source â on par with wind and solar power as a result the directive prompted state governments to incentivize energy providers to burn biomass instead of coal â and drove up demand for wood so much so that the american south emerged as europeâ s primary source of biomass imports earlier this year the eu was celebrated in headlines across the world when renewable energy surpassed the use of fossil fuels on the continent for the first time in history but scientists and experts say itâ s too early to celebrate arguing that relying on biomass for energy has a punishing impact not only on the environment but also on marginalized communities â perpetuating decades of environmental racism in predominantly black communities like northampton county where macklin and his family have lived for generations macklinâ s elderly aunt lives right behind him a tall magnolia tree provides shade to both their homes his motherâ s house is just down the street they used to have large family cookouts in his garden while the kids played on the lawn but they havenâ t done that in years between the noise and the sawdust from the plant his home is no longer a safe place to gather but itâ s the pollution that worries him most â you donâ t know whatâ s coming out of the smokestack â said macklin â thatâ s my main concern â eu directive left major loophole to say cutting down trees and burning them for power is a renewable energy source feels counterintuitive and in reality it is burning wood is less efficient than burning coal and releases far more carbon into the atmosphere according to almost 800 scientists who wrote a 2018 letter to the european parliament pushing members to amend the current directive â to avoid expansive harm to the worldâ s forests and the acceleration of climate change â president joe biden and other world leaders received a similar letter from hundreds of climate scientists earlier this year the eu directive that encouraged the pivot to biomass also left a loophole â it did not prevent the leveling of rooted trees for wood pellet production â i canâ t think of anything that harms nature more than cutting down trees and burning them â said william moomaw professor emeritus of international environmental policy at tufts university yet by burning wood european power plants can reduce their carbon footprint â at least on paper in 1996 scientists at the united nations devised a method to measure global carbon emissions to simplify the process and avoid double counting they suggested emissions from burning biomass should be calculated where the trees are cut down not where the wood pellets are burned the eu adopted this methodology in its renewable energy directive allowing energy companies to burn biomass produced in the us without having to report the emissions the accounting method â which was never intended to assign national responsibility for carbon emissions according to climate experts â has created a lot of discussion and disagreement among advocates scientists and policymakers but ultimately it is not the accounting of carbon that is the problem itâ s the emissions â it doesnâ t change the physical reality â said tim searchinger senior research scholar at princeton university â a law designed to reduce emissions that in reality encourages an increase in emissions â has to be flawed â he said referring to europeâ s directive ultimately europe is not reducing emissions by burning american trees â itâ s just outsourcing them to the united states â the idea was to curb our addiction to fossil fuels â said bas eickhout dutch politician and member of the european parliament biomass was an attractive option for eu countries at the time he explained because it was much cheaper than solar or wind power and could be â mixed inâ when burning coal however european decision makers didnâ t fully consider the repercussions of importing biomass eickhout said adding they â were too naã ve â â the production of biomass has become an industrial process which means something has gone fundamentally wrong â he said â the professionalization of the biomass industry is a problem that needs attention â â the math doesnâ t add upâ the directive led to troubling consequences across the atlantic by failing to restrict biomass to the byproduct from manufacturing paper furniture or lumber europe created a strong incentive to cut down whole trees and turn them into wood pellets encouraged by government subsidies european power plants began importing biomass from the largest wood producing region in the world the american southeast north carolina has been â ground zeroâ for the wood pellet industry said danna smith co founder and executive director of the environmental advocacy group dogwood alliance one hundred and sixty four acres of the stateâ s forests are cut down by the biomass industry every day according to an analysis by key log economics us based enviva which owns four wood pellet plants in north carolina says their product is fighting climate change â when sourced responsibly wood based biomass is recognized by the leading international organizations and scientists as climate friendly renewable and carbon neutral energy source â enviva wrote in a statement adding that they require the forests they source from â will regenerate either naturally or through planting â yet the intergovernmental panel on climate change â the un body that came up with the carbon accounting methodology â states its guidelines â do not automatically consider or assume biomass used for energy as â carbon neutral â even in cases where the biomass is thought to be produced sustainably â and north carolinaâ s clean energy plan notes that biomass â does not advance the stateâ s clean energy economy â the plan goes on to acknowledge that most of the wood pellets produced in the state are exported to europe and even that â the science regarding carbon neutrality and accounting methods are contentious issues â biomass is renewable only in the sense that trees can grow back said grant domke who leads a team researching and reporting on carbon stocks and changes on forest land at the us forest service â but that is different than it being carbon neutral â when it comes to europe reducing carbon emissions by burning american biomass â the math doesnâ t add up â still the biomass industry is not showing any signs of slowing down drax a british company that operates the largest uk power plant has acquired several wood pellet plants in the american south and is developing others enviva too is building new facilities and is expanding existing ones â including the plant in northampton county north carolina where macklin and his family live â weâ ve been disrespected all our livesâ itâ s here where once grand country homes stand dilapidated overrun with weeds and abandoned in a jigsaw puzzle of cotton grain and sprawling pine plantations strip malls restaurant chains and expansive parking lots comprise the commercial landscape gas stations line the roads but grocery stores are few and far between the temperature was already scorching in may â residents kept their curtains drawn and many stayed inside the hum of air conditioning providing the only sign of life for the last decade the population in northampton county has been declining and despite a clear need for health care there was only one primary care physician serving the entire county with a population of just under 20 000 in 2018 northampton county enviva plants north carolina median household income percent black population 43 000 51 000 61 000 6 16 26 42 sources us census 2019 5 year

department asked residents if they had ever been diagnosed with certain ailments the report showed more than 60 of the participants said they had high blood pressure more than half said they were overweight and over 20 said they suffered from depression or diabetes nearly 11 of residents said they had heart disease the latest data from the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc showed that more than one in 10 adults in northampton had asthma in 2018 asthma hospitalizations in the county however are lower than in the state as a whole according to the nc department of environmental quality macklin a father of two and lifelong northampton resident is living these statistics two years ago the 44 year oldâ s heart condition worsened requiring him to quit his job at a meat packaging plant and leaving him with a disability like more than 16 of county residents under 65 macklinâ s wife and 21 year old son both suffer from asthma a condition that macklin said is exacerbated by the pollution and dust coming from envivaâ s plant behind his house since the plant started operating he said his wife and son canâ t spend more than five minutes outside without coughing before enviva opened its northampton mill the 551 square miles that make up the county were already home to three major air pollution sources â facilities required to a request a permit under title v of the clean air act for emitting large amounts of air pollutants another three such facilities are located within two miles of the northampton border in neighboring halifax county in 2013 enviva became the fourth title v permit holder in northampton county emitting tons of dangerous fine particles or pm2 5 carbon monoxide and a number of what the environmental protection agency calls â hazardous air pollutantsâ â including formaldehyde and methanol â all of our plants operate in compliance with their permits and federal and state prescribed emission legal standards under the permits presenting no risk or issue to public health or environment â enviva said in a statement adding that a state air quality monitor five miles from its facility found that pm2 5 levels did not â present a health riskâ to county residents yet federal standards for fine particulate matter are too high and do not protect public health according to twenty scientists who served on an epa panel on particulate matter in 2018 and urged the administration to impose tougher pollution standards the epa did not take action at the time but announced last month it is taking another look at the federal standards for pm2 5 saying â scientific evidence and technical information indicate that the current standards may not be adequate to protect public health and welfare as required by the clean air act â exposure to year round pm2 5 pollution â particles at least 20 times thinner than a strand of human hair â has been linked to asthma and slowed lung function in children and increased risk of cancer heart attacks strokes and death from cardiovascular disease according to the epa the health problems in macklinâ s community have not been directly linked to the title v facilities in the county the population of northampton â which according to cnnâ s analysis has one of the highest numbers of major air polluters per capita in the state â is predominantly black underscoring long standing concerns over environmental racism the north carolina department of environmental quality the agency tasked with granting air quality permits in the state declined to comment for this story â weâ ve been disrespected all our lives â said resident belinda joyner 68 who has been fighting environmental racism in her community for decades â and weâ re still being disrespected â pm2 5 polluters in the united states â disproportionately and systemically affect people of color â according to a recent study that noted this type of exposure is responsible for up to 200 000 excess deaths in the united states every year when there is â degradation of the air and the land we simultaneously see degradation of the community â said smith of the dogwood alliance â they canâ t sleep at nightâ all but one of envivaâ s nine operating plants in the country are located in communities that have higher percentage of black residents than their states as a whole according to a cnn analysis of census tract data from the american community survey the only exception was the companyâ s plant in southeast georgia in addition all of envivaâ s plants are in census tracts that have lower median household incomes than their states and eight of the nine â all except the one in southern virginia â are in tracts with higher poverty rates than their states as a whole to some like macklin envivaâ s presence has hardly benefitted the community â they just feel like they come in and do what they want to do â said macklin adding later â all the noise and the dust and stuff it was never like that itâ s always been quiet around here â that plant is on 24 hours a day it donâ t stop seven days a week â kathy claiborne 59 who lives on the other side of the enviva plant in northampton anticipates the sleepless nights by trying to take a nap when she gets home from work the noise is worst around 2 a m she said â i never really thought about noise as being a health hazard until i talked to the communities that live next to the enviva facilities and they say they canâ t sleep at night â said smith â not being able to sleep is depriving people of one of the most important foundations of human health â in its response to cnn enviva said the company takes â environmental justice concerns raised with respect to our operations very seriously and we work closely in our communities and community leaders to ensure our operations bring both positive economic and environmental impact â the company also said it had not received noise complaints other than â generic complaintsâ at a recent hearing raised by â the same activists weâ ve heard from before â enviva pointed to an environmental justice analysis for its operations in northampton done by the north carolina department of environmental quality claiming the report ensures â there is no negative impact on disadvantaged or minority communities from out plants or operations â however the 2019 environmental justice impact statement merely describes the demographics around the plant â noting high disability and poverty rates in a majority black population â it does not give recommendations or reach conclusions about the impact the industry would have on the community still in june the county chamber of commerce awarded enviva with the â corporate business of the yearâ award â noting the company â continuously supported donated and invested their time and talents into local organizations and causes â though the relationship between local officials and enviva is â good now â inviting them in had drawbacks said franklin williams the countyâ s economic development director the company wants to be â good partners â he said applauding its outreach efforts and noting that enviva has provided school supplies to local schools and helped sponsor food banks in the community during the pandemic joyner and the claibornes recalled a christmas when enviva sent some residents hams â but the outreach felt almost insulting â the next thing you know that plant is up and running and weâ re getting a ham â said claiborneâ s husband earl â it was a good gesture but you know youâ re getting pulled into something â to joyner school supplies and holiday meals do little to counter the impacts envivaâ s operation has had on the people of northampton this is where her mother bought the land that her house sits on â itâ s where she raised her two daughters â all i want to do is take care of it â she said â i donâ t have the privilege to get up and move where am i going this is home â â we arenâ t renewing thousand year old ecosystemsâ just across the border in virginia â less than an hour from joynerâ s house â sits a rare protected ancient wetland forest â weâ re looking at trees around us that are over a thousand years old â said smith as she maneuvered her kayak through the cypress trees pointing out different species and identifying birds whose habitats are threatened by industrial logging itâ s an â incredible jewel of an ecosystem â she said itâ s a humbling place in stark contrast with the hot and dusty clear cuts â land where trees have been leveled and not replaced â and rows of newly planted pine trees that make up macklin and joynerâ s neighborhood cypress trees some with trunks wider than a sedan stand tall between lily pads and beaver dams in the winter the water rises and hides those massive cracked and often hollow tree trunks that are visible in the warmer months noise from the nearby highway is drowned out by an orchestra of birds fish jump out of the water as if in an animated film itâ s peaceful green and surprisingly cool on an otherwise sweltering summer day the 535 acre forest â surrounded by hundreds of thousands of acres of pine plantations and clear cuts â is a precious needle in a haystack â the forestry industry and the wood pellet industry says that trees are renewable â said smith but â we arenâ t renewing thousand year old ecosystems theyâ re renewing forests for commercial production so youâ ll see trees on the landscape that are maybe you know 30 years old thatâ s not an ecosystem â thatâ s a fiber farm â as long as trees are replanted enviva and supporters of the biomass industry argue burning them can be considered renewable energy but the reality is not so simple when trees are cut down and burned all the carbon they stored is immediately emitted into the air moomaw the professor at tufts university explained for a new tree to grow and re absorb the same amount of carbon takes decades â making the worldwide attempts at going carbon neutral on deadline like the eu wants to by 2050 a daunting goal at best planting a seedling for every downed tree keeps carbon emissions neutral over time â itâ s not removing any more carbon out of the atmosphere moomaw stressed â it s preventing us from getting worse but it s not making it better â he said or as smith put it ominously â weâ re losing decades of time every time forests are clear cut â time we donâ t have â traveling back to northampton from the protected cypress wetlands smith points out clear cuts along the way a 50 acre plot of decades old trees cleared in the fall still bore the smell of pine â serving a jarring image less than an hour from the lush wetland forest to the east enviva received 15 of those once living standing trees â deemed â lower value woodâ by the biomass industry because it doesnâ t meet the specifications for lumber â this is our nationâ s sacrifice zone for unsustainable consumption of wood products and products we donâ t need â smith said â these wood pellets arenâ t even producing electricity here â this is completely unnecessary â â we bring positive economic impact to rural communitiesâ thomas garner has been logging â cutting down trees and loading them onto trucks â since he was 16 years old he remembers pulling logs onto his back and loading the trucks by hand big machines â aptly called log loaders â have made his work much easier but even at 83 he drives fully stocked 18 wheelers to wood and paper mills all over northampton county and beyond enviva has been good for his business as an independent contractor he said a sentiment echoed by others who spoke to cnn but the jobs come at a hefty price for northampton county local officials eager to pull northampton out of its tier one status â a designation by the state for its 40 lowest ranking counties in terms of economic well being â lured companies including enviva to the area with financial incentives but these incentives actually set northampton back said williams the current director of economic development in the county in envivaâ s case among the conditions the company agreed to was the creation of 62 full time jobs williams said adding that in return northampton county would pay the company 360 556 70 each year in addition to 120 acres of land and upwards half a million dollars toward water sewer and gas lines among other support but instead of boosting the economy out of the lowest tier the five year agreement was among the drivers of higher property taxes in the community â i think they over incentivized their efforts to get these businesses here and it caused the tax rate to go up in order to meet the budget â said williams between 2011 and 2019 the property tax rate in northampton county increased nearly 6 the county has had the third highest property tax rate in the state for the past five years itâ s a burden many residents canâ t shoulder northampton has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state â which almost doubled during the covid 19 pandemic â and nearly 22 of its residents are living in poverty â if the wood products industry and biomass were a way of growing strong rural economies in the southeastern region these rural communities should be some of the wealthiest on the planet â said smith â we are in the worldâ s largest wood producing region but you donâ t see any evidence in these rural communities of thriving rural economies the opposite is actually true â enviva currently employs 98 people at their northampton facility and pay roughly 37 more than the average wage in the county the company told cnn in a statement adding that they strive to hire locally if workers have the right qualifications the salary is one of the reasons that even macklin applied for jobs at enviva most recently about two years ago he said he worked in wood mills before and had hoped for a job close to home but he never heard back from the company macklin who recently had major heart surgery said he wonâ t apply again out of concern for his health â i wouldnâ t want to be around all that dust â macklin said â i donâ t want to be inhaling it â â we don t recognize the costs of this destructionâ on a hot wednesday morning at the end of may joyner and fellow community activist richie harding drove an hour and a half to raleigh to protest against the wood pellet industry and deliver a petition to the governorâ s office asking him to keep future biomass operations out of north carolina at a news conference joyner stressed that her community was a â dumping groundâ for industries that nobody else wants to live near harding another lifelong northampton county resident called out what he perceives to be environmental racism targeting his hometown â if black lives matter why is my community the desired location for a facility that would not only shorten my life but the lives of my children â despite wide ranging arguments against biomass enviva has received more than 7 million in subsidies since 2013 from federal state and local agencies to produce wood pellets for export to europe throughout the south the biomass industry continues to grow twelve new plants across six states including two proposed enviva facilities in alabama and mississippi have requested permits according to data from the southern environmental law center existing plants like the enviva operation in northampton are expanding the eu which aims to be climate neutral by 2050 is set to revise its renewable energy directive this summer and is expected to update sustainability criteria for biomass critics hope they will restrict biomass imports from overseas exclude whole living trees as â waste productâ and properly account for carbon emissions from cutting and burning wood but a draft document that surfaced this past spring does not suggest substantial changes are coming for europeâ s directive none of the options offered will address the two main problems with biomass burning wood for energy is worse than burning coal and cutting down trees â profoundly damages ecosystems and biodiversity â mary booth scientist and director at the partnership for policy integrity wrote in a critique of the draft document the european commission declined to comment on the draft but confirmed the revised directive will be published on july 14 in the us federal policymakers have not yet determined the fate of wood pellets â biomass is categorically incompatible with our climate justice and health goals â democratic sen ed markey of massachusetts who successfully opposed the permitting of a biomass energy plant in his state said in a statement to cnn neither the planet nor the united states he said can â afford to make the same â mistake that allowed the european union to put biomass on the exact same level as truly renewable energy sources like wind and solar â under former president donald trump the environmental protection agency planned to follow in europeâ s footsteps and classify biomass as a carbon neutral energy source but that never happened despite the biden administrationâ s commitment to fight global warming activists worry they wonâ t acknowledge the threat of biomass and industrial logging â it s almost like in the us all we see of value in a forest is a dollar bill â smith said â we don t recognize the costs of this destruction â back in northampton macklin feels just as defeated

according to the april vaccine preventable disease report from children s hospital colorado the state falls below average in vaccination coverage for young children stock image health care officials know routine medical and immunization visits for children dropped during the covid 19 pandemic and that adds to the fact that childhood vaccination rates in general in colorado fall below the rest of the country according to the vaccine preventable diseases report released by children s hospital colorado in april colorado falls below average in vaccination coverage for young children only 64 of coloradans born in 2017 completed the recommended seven vaccine series by 24 months which ranks colorado 43rd out of 50 states the report noted 78 of colorado children born in 2017 had completed the recommended vaccine series by 35 months which ranks colorado 25th in routine immunizations for that age in 2019 colorado children experienced more than 14 000 hospitalizations and emergency department visits due to vaccine preventable diseases the report noted with the most common reasons for those medical trips due to influenza pneumococcal disease varicella disease chickenpox and pertussis whooping cough the children s hospital colorado report encourages parents to call pediatrician or primary care providers to make sure children and adolescents are up to date on their vaccinations if we do not make up for these missed doses thousands of colorado children may be left vulnerable to vaccine preventable diseases the april report noted the consequences of this period of under vaccination may only become clear as social distancing measures decrease in the coming year routt county public health director roberta smith wants to make sure all children in the county receive regular childhood vaccinations and she hopes attention paid to covid 19 and flu vaccines do not hinder other necessary childhood vaccines that is one of the reasons the routt county public health department is joining the long list of local medical offices and pharmacies that already offer vaccines for free to eligible children through the federally funded vaccines for children program vcf offers vaccines at no cost for children through age 18 who are either uninsured underinsured on medicaid or medicaid eligible and or american indian or alaskan native the county s relatively new public health department will provide an added safety net for immunizations when the department begins providing childhood vaccine appointments later this month smith said routine immunizations for children will be given by appointment in the same small location where covid 19 vaccines are currently administered at the department in the routt county courthouse annex building in downtown steamboat springs currently the department provides that service in a converted breakroom but smith is looking forward to the fact the department will have two new clinic rooms in the county s health and human services building when it is completed in 2023 with the pandemic a lot of people may not have kept up so well with childhood immunizations so there is a focus statewide that children continue to be up to date smith said the director said statistics show 78 7 of routt county children ages 19 35 months were up to date on the childhood gold standard of seven vaccinations from jan 1 to june 30 2020 smith said some 850 children in routt county are eligible for the free vaccines for children eligible children can receive immunizations for free at many different vaccines for children locations across the county ranging from south routt medical center in oak creek to northwest colorado health to pediatrics of steamboat springs including the satellite office in hayden to memorial regional health family practice on curve court in steamboat springs more vfc information is available at cdc gov vaccines programs vfc index html childhood shots can be given and information recorded from multiple locations into the statewide colorado immunization information system ciis so colorado parents do not have to carry a paper record for immunizations parents from outside colorado moving into the state do need to bring their children s immunizations records from the other state to the first vaccine appointment in colorado smith said smith recommends that families find a medical home or primary care provider for their children for sick and well child visits which is why local medical providers participate in the free vaccine program smith said payment should not be a barrier to immunizations smith said we always need to educate people that programs exist with a lot of coverage in our county and to take advantage of them to make sure kids are fully vaccinated routine childhood immunizations should always be on the radar of parents families who want to check if their children are colorado medicaid eligible can view online at benefits gov benefit 1621 one

anyone recognize him the police in winter haven florida asked on facebook last month photos with the post showed a man walking out of a walmart without paying for his items after several of his credit cards were declined police said among the items in his cart were boxes of diapers when your card is declined and you try another one with the same result that is not license to just walk out with the items anyway read the facebook post which was later deleted the winter haven police department drew swift criticism for the post from people wondering why the department had gone after a man who had stolen basic necessities for his children also pictured in the surveillance photos that s a good father in a hard spot one facebook user said in response to the department s follow up post have some empathy after the incident which was previously reported by wfts tv in tampa florida the store asked the police not to prosecute the man according to a waiver of prosecution the winter haven police department provided to the new york times walmart and the man did not respond to requests for comment it s possible the man was among the 1 in 3 american families who struggle with diaper need according to a february 2020 report by the national diaper bank network an organization that provides diapers to children joanne samuel goldblum the network s founder and ceo said she suspects that figure probably rose during the coronavirus pandemic as diaper prices increased and supply plummeted diaper need is a topic that s so swept under the rug she said friday covid really laid it bare for us the pandemic has upended global supply chains and created a run on many products including diapers kimberly clark and procter gamble two of the country s largest diaper manufacturers increased the prices of baby products this year a typical package of 100 diapers costs 30 to 50 from most online retailers even a small price increase can put a strain on families many of whom pay around 75 for a month s worth of diapers for one baby according to the national diaper bank network many parents have to choose between buying diapers or other necessities and some will leave their child in a soiled diaper because they can t afford a replacement for the families who make it to the store diapers aren t always in stock amanda trussell the mother of a 2 year old boy said that diapers had been hard to find near her home in junction city kansas even before the pandemic started and that store shelves had only gotten emptier in the past year and a half at one point we went to three or four different stores to find a pack and had to settle on a size bigger because there were just none in his size she said saturday when her family runs low on diapers trussell 24 puts her son in a reusable cloth diaper that s why she hasn t had to go to a diaper bank which offers supplies to low income parents diaper banks across the country have reported recent surges in families who couldn t afford diapers westside baby which is based in seattle distributed 2 4 million diapers last year up 60 from 1 5 million in 2019 according to sarah cody roth the organization s executive director westside baby is on track this year to meet or exceed last year s total she said diaper banks in oklahoma and pennsylvania have reported similar trends many banks give families 50 diapers per month which covers about two weeks said cathy battle executive director of the western pennsylvania diaper bank that is often not enough for families who can t afford diapers a lack of diapers can seriously harm a family s physical and mental health said megan v smith the senior director of community health transformation at the connecticut hospital association many parents who can t afford diapers feel like ineffective caregivers she said if you have to worry about where you re going to get the next diaper you can t focus on singing and reading and playing with your child said smith who has researched diaper need and maternal mental health many day cares require parents to supply their children with enough diapers to get through the day that means mothers and fathers who can t buy diapers have to miss work to watch their child smith said which makes them even less likely to have money for diapers the federal government does not provide funding for diapers but that may change if congress passes the end diaper need act of 2021 which would funnel grant money to social services that support low income families and adults with disabilities states have taken different approaches to get diapers into the hands of parents a colorado law passed this summer earmarked 2 million to create a statewide diaper distribution program connecticut allocates part of its state budget to the diaper bank of connecticut california which leads the country in diaper funding efforts is one of several states that do not tax the product and it offers diaper reimbursements to parents participating in calworks the state s welfare to work program assemblywoman lorena gonzalez who shepherded the calworks diaper reimbursement into law said that diaper need was just as important an issue as hunger insecurity there s a number of women that can at least breastfeed their child she said friday you can t have a child and not diaper them

from the lush foggy hills rolling through the scottish isles to the primordial peaks of glorious hawaii and all the way across the globe to the wild rainforests of indonesia evidence of a little people dwarf species is emerging from the depths of prehistory it s difficult to decipher the difference between myth legend folklore and historical fact when objectively delving into these island dwelling short people the easy way out is to hop onto the rigid biased academic bandwagon and belittle such concepts as nothing more than ancient fiction but this position is textbook flawed reasoning when these ancient accounts of ancient little people are approached with true objectivity a peculiar pattern presents itself skara brae the neolithic little people of the orkney islands skara brae is a small cluster of very strange ancient stone dwellings found on the scottish orkney archipelago and the only thing stranger than the ruins themselves are their suspicious treatment by archaeologists originally these eight neolithic houses were subterranean hidden beneath a mysterious mound that was wiped away by a violent storm in 1850 ad eighteen years later the first amateur excavation occurred after which the ruins were abandoned then the site was allegedly looted of many artifacts in 1913 ad and it was not officially studied until 1927 ad by the university of edinburgh professor gordon childe came to the feeble conclusion that this site dated to 500 bc but this was obviously incorrect and in the seventies material from the site was carbon dated to 3180 bc one of the skara brae locations showing evidence of little people based on the size of the stone furniture found there vinx83 adobe stock skara brae little people enigmas and controversies these eight little dwellings came complete with stone beds a central hearth shell midden insulation and indoor toilets draining outwards from the structures but most interesting of all are the dimensions of the doors and beds the doorways and beds barely reach four feet 1 2 meters and so the only logical conclusion to make from these dimensions is that the inhabitants were indeed diminutive in stature in other words these were little folk living underground this fascinating oddity is deliberately overlooked by the academics who have also managed to neglect and misplace precious artifacts over nearly two centuries of haphazard excavations and biased studies equally enigmatic is the inescapable fact that these dwellings were suddenly abandoned these wee inhabitants seem to have been in a terrible rush to flee their homes vanishing into history leaving behind all manner of possessions for example stone spheres equal in weight and circumference with three dimensional designs on them and whose purpose is a complete mystery orkney little people megalithic sites are interlinked skara brae is one of a related group of anomalous sites now designated collectively as the heart of neolithic orkney world heritage site the standing stones of stenness are a nearby collection of twelve enormous standing stones nearly twenty feet tall six meters with a central hearth stone this ancient henge predates stonehenge and there is a growing consensus even among mainstream scholars that this is the oldest henge in britain the ring of brodgar is another spellbinding site within the neolithic cluster this site contains an astonishing thirteen artificial mounds not properly excavated alongside thirty to sixty more gigantic standing stones all astronomically aligned the final site in this anomalous cluster is maeshowe a supposed burial chamber mound containing massive stones and aboriginal runic inscriptions and all these sites are connected by a series of low roads which proves beyond any doubt they were built by the same dwarfish little people who inhabited skara brae one of the few images of a clurichaun who are the neolithic little people of mainland scotland public domain little people terms trows trolls dwarves and clurichauns certain regions are world famous for their concentrated cultural beliefs regarding ancient races of little people who often possessed supernatural abilities a mischievous disposition and guarded hoards of treasure ireland also home to megalithic mysteries similar to those of the orkney islands is probably the most notorious of regions for harboring the iconic leprechaun tradition and close behind is iceland whose modern citizens are often ridiculed for their persistent beliefs in the existence of an ancient race of little people the scottish trow for instance are a nocturnal race of diminutive hairy and typically malevolent hominins that loved music and kidnapping homo sapiens they lived in trowie knowes which are earthen mound dwellings this tradition is virtually identical to the scandinavian belief in dwarves trolls or elves and the scottish clurichauns are essentially the same as the irish leprechauns sharing with them their small size heavy drinking and treasure hoarding habits it is worth noting that processed barley was discovered within the ruins of skara brae which can be interpreted to mean that these little people were drinkers from early on a statue of a menehune guardian at the hilton hawaiian village that clearly proves a belief in these little people since ancient times verygreen cc by sa 3 0 the menehune the little people of hawaii deep in the dark blue heart of the pacific ocean on the sublime islands of hawaii a similar pattern of little people beliefs also exists and the extreme remoteness and distance of this location proves that the little people theory is not a case of cultural conflation in the hawaiian tradition the menehune are described as an ethnic group of dwarf people who were nocturnal master craftsman and responsible for building many of the artificial fishing ponds and platform temples that dot the islands another crucial aspect of this tradition is the insistence of the hawaiian people that the menehune predated the arrival of their polynesian ancestors and were driven away upon their arrival the menehune fishponds and platform temples are not primitive creations there are approximately 360 fishponds and two dozen temples attributed to these little people and all of them show evidence of highly sophisticated construction methods for example some of the ponds have sluice gates designed to channel nutrient rich seawater and small fish through the porous lava rock coral walls allowing for algae cultivation essentially an advanced self sustaining fish husbandry aquaculture system legends of the menehune little people conventional academics and so called scholars often attempt to explain away the menehune as either an antiquated caste system regarding the menehune as figuratively diminutive i e commoners or as projected imports of european folklore however this dismissal has been easily debunked as many of the fishponds and landmarks bear names relating to the menehune confirming their existence in a longstanding oral tradition this oral tradition holds that the menehune would come out at twilight singing and chanting as they worked on their building projects which if they did not finish in a single night would remain incomplete it was also said that they were fond of bananas fish and would remain hidden from homo sapiens with the rare exception being children who would occasionally see them only to be met with disbelief from their elders hawaiian archaeology or the lack thereof there are very few if any thorough in depth archaeological studies exploring the ancient history of the islands of hawaii this is no doubt partially due to continuing tensions between the indigenous population and the modern western world the hawaiians are a proud and fearless people who consider themselves a sovereign state and generally consider the american presence unjust unfortunately this mild yet fundamental tension is a major factor in the lack of archaeological pursuits on the islands particularly those involving sacred sites or archaic human remains however despite these tensions one very obscure artifact has managed to be discovered that is directly related to the little people pattern of the orkneys mysterious basically perfect stone spheres an artist s impression of what an orang pendek little person might look

rainforests of indonesia the little people pattern is repeated orang pendek literally translated from indonesian as short person are a legendary small and hairy species of human hiding away deep in the forests of sumatra for over a century reports have been made by locals dutch settlers and scientists all claiming to have seen what is variously described as a little people perhaps the most infamous of all such reports comes from dutch colonist van heerwarden who claimed to glimpse an orang pendek little person while surveying on sumatra in 1923 ad he wrote i discovered a dark and hairy creature on a branch the sedapa was also hairy on the front of its body the color was a little lighter on the back the very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder blades or even almost to the waist had it been standing its arms would have reached to a little above its knees they were therefore long but its legs seemed to me rather short i did not see its feet but i did see some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner there was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face nor was it at all apelike evidence of obscure indonesian megalithic sites indonesia does not immediately jump to mind as a location rich with neolithic megalithic sites but it does indeed contain ancient stone sites that rival the most mysterious in all the world lore lindu national park on the island of sulawesi is one such site the site is classified as a unesco biosphere preserve which in it of itself is suspicious because the rarity of the ecological system pales in comparison to the spectacularly bizarre megaliths located there among the oddities lore lindu s most mesmerizing feature is a very large standing stone carving representing a dwarf with large eyes and an erect phallus in west java mount padang is home to a 10 000 year old mind boggling megalithic site comprised of thousands of standing stones scattered over the landscape there s really no published archaeological work to speak of on these sites and the simple fact is academics do not have any clue who built them for what purpose or how these sites could have been constructed thousands of years ago the flores little people ignored by science locked away in 2003 on the indonesian island of flores fragmented skeletons of nine archaic hobbit like individuals were discovered in a cave along with stone tools the most intact skeleton referred to as homo floresiensis stood at three feet seven inches tall 1 1 meters and the controversy was immediate initially the studies reported that the remains dated to about twelve thousand years ago needless to say this was problematic to the human history narrative so it was subsequently changed to fifty thousand years ago today there are theories that indicate the right dating could be as much as 190 000 years ago the remains were whisked away and kept under lock and key for some time before they reappeared in 2005 severely damaged specifically the pelvis had been destroyed which is the bone key to arguments regarding gait and differences between apes and humans in 2005 ad indonesian officials shut down all access to the cave and this restriction was not lifted until 2007 ad in 2006 ad two separate teams allegedly attempted to retrieve dna from the little lady of flores or flo for short apparently both these teams failed to successfully harvest viable genetic material and even though great strides have been made in the last fourteen years still no dna analyses have been published on these mysterious little people remains homo luzonensis little people of the philippines in 2007 in a cave at the northern end of the philippine island of luzon more remains of potentially pigmy archaic hominins were discovered the locals immediately equated the bones with a being known to them for centuries as ubag which is their version of the little people dwarf legend once again controversy and contradiction swiftly took hold as the initial reports claimed these were modern human remains but this was just as swiftly disproven and for lack of a better option a new taxonomical species was invented as was the case for flo homo luzonensis and homo floresiensis respectively the scientists involved refused to speculate on the precise size stating that more remains needed to be analyzed to determine verify size however they did suggest that these archaic humans may have shrunk as a result of insular dwarfism that seems to be present in endemic non human species on the island dna extraction just like with flo is supposed to have failed due to the material being degraded by humidity and while this was a valid excuse two decades ago the quantum leaps made in genetic analysis make it hard to swallow that bone marrow dentine or cementum all extremely well protected encased within bone enamel cannot be successfully harvested an illustration from little people stories maybel powers 1917 ad orally passed on by the iroquois indians of north america which adds to the belief in these remarkable dwarves and their feats public domain reasonable conclusions about neolithic little peoples microcephaly insular dwarfism laron syndrome and or congenital hyperthyroidism all medical conditions or genetic disorders resulting in some form of dwarfism are all reasonable initial speculations due to the fact that isolated populations have limited gene pools however these are all starkly contradicted by the fact that there are cultural parallels in other words insular dwarfism does not inspire populations of little people to become master craftsman erect megaliths aligned with the stars or create enigmatic stone spheres there s another dimension to this pattern volcanism these islands are all either volcanically active or have extensive volcanic remnants of geological upheaval and this is quite relevant because it means that beneath these islands are vast labyrinthian cave systems ideal for subterranean dwelling travel it goes beyond myth and into the realm of scientific fact that thousands of years ago races of little people did exist and that they were indeed master craftsman who lived underground and built wonderous stone masterpieces in his history of animals aristotle states the case for ancient little peoples plainly these birds migrate from the steppes of scythia to the marshlands south of egypt where the nile has its source and it is here by the way that they are said to fight with the pygmies and the story is not fabulous but there is in reality a race of dwarfish men and the horses are little in

paris afp advertising read more one month out from the cop26 climate summit world leaders are under unprecedented pressure to decarbonise their economies and chart humanity s path away from catastrophic global warming but in the midst of a pandemic still raging in parts of the globe and with countries already battered by climate driven calamities pleading for help and money the negotiations in glasgow are likely to be fraught the summit already delayed a year by covid 19 comes as the gap between what science says is needed to avert disaster and what governments are doing is larger than ever addressing around 50 ministers on thursday at the start of a pre cop gathering in milan un secretary general antonio guterres laid out the choice facing delegates in glasgow we can either save our world or condemn humanity to a hellish future cop26 host britain says the summit s main aim is to keep in play the 1 5 degree celsius temperature goal enshrined in the 2015 paris agreement in august the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change dropped a bombshell report warning that the 1 5c threshold by far the most ambitious target of the paris deal would be reached as soon as 2030 by 2050 earth will be 1 5c hotter than pre industrial times no matter what is done about planet warming carbon emissions in the meantime it said with a little over 1c of warming so far

asia africa and northern europe billions of people vulnerable to climate change simon malfatto afp trust deficit the paris deal requires nations to renew their plans to cut domestic emissions known as national determined contributions or ndcs every five years far from limiting warming to 1 5c the un says countries latest submissions over the last year put earth on course to heat a catastrophic 2 7c this century britain s boris johnson summed up his hopes for glasgow as coal cars cash and trees meaning deals for global phaseouts of coal power and internal combustion engines funding for climate vulnerable nations and mass tree planting but the actual to do list for delegates at cop26 is not quite so concise for starters six years after the paris agreement was struck countries still have not finalised the deal s rulebook that specifies how its goals are reached and progress measured long festering disputes include those over how carbon markets are governed and a common timeframe for an interim stock take to see how each country s action stacks up poorer nations are demanding that richer ones finally make good during cop26 on a decade old promise to provide 100 billion each year to

countries and in this context we have experienced rich nations who were unwilling to stand in solidarity with poor nations to supply the vaccine she told afp essop said there was a huge trust deficit between nations already battling climate change and the historic emitters that helped to cause it the spectre of vaccine inequity is likely to loom large in glasgow with many representatives of poorer nations unable to afford a trip that would include expensive hotel quarantines sonam wangi chair of the least developed countries negotiating bloc said as much this week tweeting that he was still concerned about the possibility of getting our delegates to cop26 drought risk worldwide gal roma afp china g20 key cop26 president alok sharma this week sought to allay such fears by saying there had been a very healthy registration in participants and that more than 100 world leaders had already confirmed they would attend observers say there are some positive signs with the us announcing a doubling of overseas climate aid and china saying it will cease new coal production abroad both in recent weeks but for alden meyer a veteran of un climate talks and a senior analyst at the eg3 think tank in terms of emissions cuts everyone is waiting to see what china will do president xi jinping announced last year his country s aim for carbon neutrality by 2060 and for domestic emissions to peak around 2030 the nation responsible for more than a quarter of manmade emissions has yet to submit a renewed ndc although one is expected before glasgow a g20 summit in rome days before cop26

in an interview with face the nation anchor margaret brennan on sunday dr anthony fauci was at it again it should surprise no one that mr doom and gloom is trying to kill christmas already welcome to the never ending pandemic advertisement according to the cdc 75 7 of americans over the age of 12 have received at least one dose of a covid 19 vaccination the agency s conservative estimate is that 100 million americans have had covid 19 and recovered however brennan opened by invoking the 700 000 dead worst pandemic ever narrative even if you grant that all currently recorded deaths are due to covid 19 it equates to approximately 0 21 of the u s population in 18 months covid 19 also disproportionately impacts the elderly as of june 1 2021 31 of all deaths occurred in nursing homes despite only 4 of covid 19 cases occurring there children and young adults have had minuscule rates of severe disease and death yet fauci spent the entire interview acting as if every case of covid 19 carries an equal risk of serious illness and death no matter your age or other risk factors the failure to honestly discuss who is at risk from covid 19 is one of the driving factors for the mass hysteria we are living through by contrast in 1918 the spanish flu killed 675 000 americans or about 0 65 of the population in fact when you look at the population between 1917 and 1918 it is the only year in a century when the country s total population declined the spanish flu hit all age groups and reduced the life expectancy in the country by 12 years brennan needs to brush up on statistics or history she then asked fauci if america should prepare for another wave of covid 19 fauci noted that cases were dropping and went straight back to his line about not getting complacent it would have been better if he explained that covid 19 is a seasonal virus that will impact different regions at different times of the year in recent weeks the most significant case jumps have been in the northeast and midwest as many predicted they would be covid does not care if your governor is a democrat or a republican it spreads best when people spend more time indoors advertisement then fauci quoted population level vaccination rates children under 12 are not eligible and as a recent study from the uk demonstrated they are not significant drivers of spread it also showed that children are most likely to catch covid 19 from an adult in their household not the other way around yet brennan specifically asked if families should decide not to gather over the holidays if there are unvaccinated children another adult is acting as if children are a mortal threat to adults it is disgusting recommended doctor rand paul absolutely torches hhs secretary becerra on natural immunity fauci responded well margaret i believe just the way the cdc has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamics of virus in the community where there s clearly a lot of spread even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting a congregate setting it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations unless of course you are attending the emmys barack obama s birthday party or the met gala or if you are san francisco mayor london breed then you can drink nosh and dance maskless to your heart s content brennan then asked if americans could gather for christmas or if it was too soon to tell fauci responded you know margaret it s just too soon to tell we ve just got to concentrate on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we re going to do at a particular time let s continue to focus like a laser to get those cases down advertisement going back to measuring the pandemic by cases is absurd fauci and other health agency bureaucrats tell us vaccination significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization and death that should mean hospitalization for covid 19 and deaths from covid 19 are the measure of the pandemic severity fauci then went on to say that vaccination diminishes infection yet we know from the cdc that vaccines do not prevent infection and transmission they halt disease severity brennan asked fauci if biden s vaccine mandate was just a stunt since the message s urgency has not been matched by the speed of enforcement from osha fauci noted that universities and some businesses were moving ahead with mandates anyway then his inner authoritarian came out when you do that when you tell people that their alternative is that if you don t get vaccinated you re not going to be able to work or you re not going to be able to go to school i think that the emergent nature of what we re dealing with actually does justify that then he proceeded to endorse vaccine mandates for children in school when they aren t even approved for emergency use in that age group that could be because covid 19 is not an emergency for children we should be rejoicing at this outcome instead it has been turned on its head as if children are the root of the current waves no data support that and plenty of data contradict it advertisement covid 19 emerged in january of 2020 nothing is emerging now except a political problem for joe biden he told voters he was not going to shut down america he was going to shut down the virus however it appears that unless you shut down mask and restrict the movement of americans the virus is going to do what viruses do and that is the problem the virus that causes covid 19 is not going away and the optics on that are not good when vaccines became available the covid 19 death toll was approaching 300 000 an additional 400 000 have died since then mainly under joe biden s watch daily deaths have exceeded the rate for the same date in 2020 since august 19 perhaps that is why biden implored more americans to get vaccinated in a statement on friday maybe the administration needs to come clean and develop a plan for living with covid communicate it clearly and admit it will be a seasonal visitor along with a host of other seasonal illnesses we live with every year in his statement he noted that 94 of seniors have received at least one dose of the vaccine according to the available data on vaccines preventing severe illness and death this statistic should mean strong protection for the most vulnerable among us we have effective outpatient treatment with monoclonal antibodies and a range of steroids and other medications used with inpatients studies have documented robust and durable protection for recovered patients instead of restricting americans it is time to stock up and use all the tools at our disposal and give them back their freedoms advertisement this article has been updated to reflect the correct percentages on the death rates from covid 19 and the spanish flu 700 000 out of approximately 329 5 million have died from covid 19 which is 0 21 of the u s population in 1918 approximately 675 000 of 103 268 000 americans died in the spanish flu pandemic equaling 0 65

conservatives are increasingly looking for alternatives to mainstream products and services as we re getting kicked out of society we ve been kicked off of social media platforms hosting providers payment providers domain name registrars fundraising sites and more that s defensive mode advertisement but we should also be in offensive mood aggressively avoiding progressive companies as much as we can the left has become so hostile toward us that we can no longer just kick back and react like we used to progressive companies are actively funding the woke agenda now like critical race theory and suppressing free speech so we re essentially paying them to defeat ourselves obviously it s not practical for everyone to boycott everything but one area that has become very easy to make a change is investing american conservative values etf started an exchange traded fund in october that basically mirrors the s p 500 which is composed of the stocks from 500 leading large u s companies without all the lefty companies included the founders of acv noticed a proliferation of environmental social and corporate governance funds that are focused on clean energy or being against fossil fuels and wanted to start an alternative these funds have become so prevalent on the left there is now a term for them esg funds which stands for environmental social and governance anyone can invest in acv even if they re just a poor student with a small amount of money by going through an app like robinhood granted some conservatives have been critical of robinhood so there are similar platforms available the acv fund can be purchased just like any other stock its ticker is acvf co founder and ceo bill flaig observed that acv is combating a double problem since politically active companies negatively impact their shareholder returns as well as supporting issues and causes which conflict with our conservative political beliefs and values once companies become politically active they are no longer maximizing shareholder returns but are instead putting a higher priority on misallocating shareholder resources to push their pet causes tom carter acv s other co founder said companies shouldn t be involved in politics at all maximizing shareholder value and customer quality should be the primary premise although acv doesn t include high performing stocks like apple starbucks bank of america disney and nike the company makes up for it by weighting a few other high performing stocks double and leaving few stocks in that mostly stay out of politics such as microsoft so it really does perform similarly to the s p 500 founder bill gates despite his own activism has little left to do with microsoft carter explained if you got rid of every tech company that leaned left you re not going to have much of a sector because of the similar track to the s p 500 the active risk is only plus or minus 2 acv can t guarantee it will track the s p 500 closely but it s predictable performance since acv launched it has swung both ways with some periods beating the s p 500 and some periods underperforming it advertisement about 27 of the companies in the s p 500 are left off acv s exchange for aggressively seeking a progressive agenda google and apple were removed for pulling the parler app from their app stores amazon was removed for kicking parler off its web servers facebook and twitter are excluded due to internet censorship the founders humorously refer to big tech as faang facebook apple amazon netflix and google delta and coca cola were removed after they condemned georgia s new election law consumers may not realize their money is being invested in companies opposed to their values but acv has figured it out for example many people may not know when it comes to media companies disney owns abc at t owns cnn and comcast owns nbc carter explained how acv is different from ave maria a catholic provider of mutual funds besides the fact consumers can purchase mutual funds directly without going through a brokerage financial advisor or app like robinhood their selection is slightly different since ave maria s focus is faith based christian values for example ave maria might be more likely to cut a fund related to gaming or healthcare acv s founders are very qualified in the investment area carter has been in the exchange traded fund industry for 25 years almost since the beginning he s developed etfs raised money and was with an etf company for 23 years flaig has been in the financial services and investment management for 30 years on the portfolio management side where he balances portfolios and runs money other similar funds to acv include maga and 2ndvote advertisement flaig says acv stays on top of the news cycle always looking out to see if another company has gone woke however they are reasonable about it sometimes a corporation makes a political statement for effect but doesn t follow through with its money the lefty who invented the esg concept tariq fancy admitted in truth sustainable investing boils down to little more than marketing hype pr spin and disingenuous promises from the investment community the acv fund is doing well it began with 1 million at startup and is now up to 26 million flaig told fox business that since the 10 largest etfs manage hundreds of billions worth of assets it makes sense to direct half of that huge amount toward conservative companies

inquirer in partnership with pennlive the patriot news triblive pittsburgh tribune review and witf public media sign up for our free newsletters harrisburg the u s securities and exchange commission has widened the federal scrutiny of pennsylvania s mammoth public school pension plan demanding records that could show whether the fund s staff improperly traded gifts with any of hundreds of wall street consultants and investment managers the sec s new 30 page subpoena comes six months after the u s attorney s office in philadelphia and the fbi opened a criminal investigation into possible bribery linked to exaggerated investment returns and harrisburg land deals at the agency the commission gave psers the state agency that invests 70 billion to fund pensions for half a million working and retired school staff until oct 8 to produce all documents and communications concerning any compensation remuneration reimbursement money gifts gratuities trips or anything of any value exchanged between psers officials and the agency s money managers and consultants in its ethics policy for its 500 staffers psers says flatly that employees shall not directly or indirectly solicit accept or receive for personal use any gift gov tom wolf has imposed a similar ban on all state workers edward siedle a former sec attorney who specializes in forensic examination of pension plans said thursday that he was surprised by the agency s inquiry into a public retirement plan it s unprecedented he said the sec usually focuses on trading firms and securities markets the subpoena was sent to psers chief counsel jackie lutz last friday it did not reveal which firms might be under suspicion instead it asks about the pension fund s dealings with its sprawling roster of 180 exterior money managers investment houses hedge funds private equity firms and financial consultants in fact the sec mirrored a public six page psers list of these outside firms in its subpoena as an attachment psers pays such firms more than 500 million in fees annually most are investment managers ranging from industry giants such as blackrock to small pennsylvania venture capital outfits that invest psers billions in private and public companies around the globe a smaller number serve as intermediaries between psers and the money managers helping the agency evaluate their performance the commission s investigation doesn t mean that we have concluded that psers or anyone else has violated the law or that the agency has a negative opinion of anyone senior sec enforcement counsel heidi m mitza wrote in the subpoena we are trying to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws psers has declined to comment on the sec investigation as it has on the criminal probe several firms from the list in the subpoena also declined to comment besides the retirement plan the sec is also known to have served a subpoena on at least one leading fund consultant hamilton lane a conshohocken firm that specializes in private equity investments not available on the stock market unfortunately we can t discuss this matter said kate mcgann a spokesperson in large part the sec demands repeat those made previously by federal prosecutors in their initial flurry of subpoenas served on psers the taxpayer funded public school employees retirement system the sec like the prosecutors demanded all documents reports and emails about the botched decision of the board in december to adopt too rosy a number for fund profits in april the board disavowed that figure as mistaken and adopted a new lower one for profits the profit performance was downgraded just enough to trigger a state law forcing 100 000 school staff with less seniority on the job to pay an extra 26 million into the pension system the sec demanded information about the original adoption of the mistaken number and the fund s internal inquiries into how it made the error in the first place before the panel adopted the mistaken number then state treasurer joseph torsella a leading critic on the psers board warned that its staff was relying on unaudited figures to gauge performance his warnings were dismissed as groundless by fund executive director glen grell and chief investment officer james h grossman jr in the subpoena the sec demands any documents or communications about the decision to use unaudited financial information to calculate psers average rate of return it seeks material from jan 1 2020 to the present the inquirer and spotlight pa first reported the filing of the subpoena on saturday bloomberg news later obtained a copy of the document followed by the news organizations the original subpoenas from federal prosecutors also obtained by the inquirer said that the criminal investigation was focusing on possible honest services fraud and wire fraud under key u s supreme court rulings prosecutors in effect need to prove bribery or kickbacks to charge officials with the crime of not providing honest service the federal subpoenas unlike the sec one also asked about psers purchase of parking lots and industrial buildings along four blocks of central harrisburg for redevelopment the sec does not file criminal charges or jail anyone its remedies include fines and reform edicts at times the agency bans violators from working in the financial industry in its subpoena the commission takes pains to ask not only about fund employees receiving gifts but also about any gifts that staff may have given outsiders it specifically seeks information about trips taken by staff in april the inquirer for the first time revealed the heavy spending by 40 or so members of the fund s elite investment office as its financial experts traversed the world to check on investments the article detailed hotel charges that included a 1 178 overnight stay in new york a 1 144 overnight stay in boston and a 955 overnight stay in beverly hills plane costs were even more expensive with 15 fares exceeding 11 000 between 2017 and 2019 under a complex arrangement outside money managers booked all travel arrangements for psers staff and paid the costs initially more than 100 psers contractors a majority did so in 2019 according to fund data because the managers later billed the pension plan for the expense the fund argues the trips were not gifts psers abandoned this method of handling travel in july and now says it will pay its own way from the start in testimony before the u s senate earlier this month gary gensler president joe biden s pick for sec chairman called for enhanced scrutiny of the private investment managers that handle billions of dollars in retirement plan money and in particular the conflicts of interest their managers may have while you

company regulators like the securities and exchange commission of pakistan secp businesspersons say they need such entities to conduct their international financial affairs but such practices have

former facebook product manager frances haugen has been revealed as the source behind tens of thousands of pages of leaked internal company research which she says show the company has been negligent in eliminating violence disinformation and other harmful content from its services and that it has misled investors about these efforts for facebook the document leak and the public reveal of the source represents perhaps the most significant crisis in the company s history further deteriorating relationships between the company and washington politicians the company is the target of a historic federal antitrust case and fielding document requests as members of congress probe its role in the jan 6 riot widely referred to as a facebook whistleblower responsible for leaking documents behind a wall street journal series haugen spoke publicly about her complaint to federal authorities disclosing her identity for the first time in an interview airing on 60 minutes sunday night there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for facebook and facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests like making more money haugen said in the interview a veteran of tech companies including pinterest yelp and google haugen left facebook in may after realizing that it puts profits over the public good she said before the 2020 election haugen said the company implemented key measures to prevent the spread of misinformation but after the election she said the company decided to dissolve these key civic integrity measures she said she stopped trusting her employer was willing to limit growth to improve public safety as soon as the election was over they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before to prioritize growth over safety she said and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me advertisement haugen s lawyers have filed at least eight complaints with the securities and exchange commission which has broad oversight over financial markets and has the power to bring charges against companies suspected of misleading investors resulting in fines or other penalties for companies and executives the complaints compare haugen s findings with the company s public statements according to 60 minutes the sec did not immediately comment sunday on the documents or whether it planned to bring action against facebook for weeks revelations from the documents which were at the center of the wall street journal s facebook files series have bolstered claims that facebook s researchers and executives have a deep understanding of the ways its products harm people beyond what had been previously known to the public and key policymakers the wide ranging documents represent an unprecedented look inside facebook s struggles with an assortment of problems including child safety political polarization human trafficking and drug cartels andrew bakaj who represents haugen at whistleblower aid said it was immediately clear that she had materials that were critical for lawmakers and regulators seeking to hold the company accountable she s a perfect example of why whistleblowers are so important without her we didn t know what we didn t know bakaj told the washington post the revelations have only added to the embittered company s woes in washington including haugen s upcoming testimony before the senate commerce consumer protection subcommittee tuesday haugen has also shared some of the documents with congressional offices that have been probing facebook facebook has sought to deny and deflect the revelations downplaying the documents even tearing into its own internal research in blog posts interviews and congressional testimony facebook head of global affairs nick clegg appeared on cnn sunday morning proactively calling allegations that the company is to blame for the violence on jan 6 ludicrous the company s top executives ceo mark zuckerberg and coo sheryl sandberg have not addressed the reports at all advertisement the responsibility for the violence on january the 6th and the insurrection on that day lies squarely with the people who inflicted the violence and those who encouraged them including then president trump and candidly many other people in the media who were encouraging the assertion that the election was stolen clegg said lawmakers in the house and senate have demanded that facebook turn over documents pertaining to its handling of the jan 6 insurrection including an order from the house select committee investigating the matter to preserve communications on its platforms related to the riot at the capitol facebook spokesman andy stone said at the time the company looks forward to continuing to work with the committee in the house but did not say whether it will fully comply with the requests lawmakers across capitol hill have at times criticized the company for not forking over documents about its policies and practices on misinformation violent rhetoric and more despite repeated pleas from lawmakers to make more of its research public so far the company has turned over two partially redacted slide decks looking at instagram s impact on children and teens mental health along with annotations downplaying their findings the company agreed to partially comply with the facebook oversight board s recommendation the company take a comprehensive review of its impact on the events january 6 reflecting on the design and policy choices that may enable its platform to be abused instead facebook committed to making data available to a select group of its existing research partners clegg said despite the public backlash facebook would continue to do research into the negative impacts of its products we re going to continue to ask ourselves these difficult questions clegg said in the interview advertisement facebook has been under the microscope in washington for nearly five years for harms ranging from foreign misinformation to privacy abuses the company is already the target of a historic federal trade commission antitrust case which it is expected to respond to on monday in 2019 it also had to pay a record setting 5 billion fine to settle with the federal trade commission over alleged privacy abuses lawmakers on capitol hill responded last week by hauling facebook executive antigone davis before congress to testify on a wall street journal report including company research that showed instagram was making teen girls body image issues worse at the hearing lawmakers accused the facebook of burying these findings and pledged to further probe the matter haugen addressed the findings about social media s impact on teen girls in the 60 minutes interview as these young women begin to consume this eating disorder content they get more and more depressed haugen said and it actually makes them use the app more and so they end up in this feedback cycle where they hate their bodies more and more haugen is going public with her findings as there is a growing debate about the power and influence of the world s largest tech companies and a growing push from countries around the world to pursue regulation it s important because big tech is at an inflection point bakaj her lawyer said it touches every aspect of our lives whether it s individuals personally or democratic institutions globally with such far reaching consequences transparency is critical to oversight and lawful whistleblowing is a critical component of oversight and

donald trump shows the executive order withdrawing the united states from the trans pacific partnership tpp on january 23 2017 photo by ron sachs pool getty images getty images removing the united states from the asia pacific trade pact designed to promote u s economic and strategic interests over china s will go down as one of the worst decisions by an american president in the past 50 years according to trade and foreign policy analysts now that china has applied to join the comprehensive progressive trans pacific partnership donald trump s decision looks even worse than it did in 2017 background president george w bush proposed a trade agreement with like minded asia pacific countries in 2008 while quick to embrace tpp and successful in concluding an agreement among the parties president barack obama fatally delayed pushing for trade promotion authority from congress in 2014 writes matthew p goodman senior vice president for economics at the center for strategic and international studies and in one of his first catastrophic acts as president donald trump withdrew the united states from the unratified tpp not understanding that it was one of the most powerful tools he had to compete with his nemesis china the latest developments on september 16 2021 china submitted an application to join what is now called the comprehensive progressive trans pacific partnership cpttp the group of countries in the trade pact currently includes australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam china s notification was sent to new zealand s trade minister the designated cptpp member for such matters notes wendy cutler a vice president at the asia society policy institute new zealand s trade minister is well aware of the stakes it was february 2017 and president trump s first address to a joint session of congress according to tim groser who served as new zealand s trade minister 2008 15 and ambassador to the u s 2016 18 as the president announced the u s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership i was thinking about a conversation i d had with a particularly astute asian ambassador he d suggested to me that if a book on the decline of american influence in asia and the indo pacific were ever written and he hoped it never would be its first chapter would be an account of the withdrawal of the u s from tpp will china be accepted into the trade pact china has prepared for gaining admittance to the cptpp even though the criteria and its poor relations with some of its members make the country s entry less than certain despite concerns over its inward looking dual circulation strategy china has spent the past few months tearing down trade and investment barriers to make it easier to negotiate its entry to the 11 member trans pacific trade pact write henry gao an associate professor of law at singapore management university and the author of a national foundation for american policy analysis on a proposed u s strategy to address china trade issues at the world trade organization wto and weihuan zhou director of research at the herbert smith freehills cibel centre at the law and justice faculty at unsw sydney at the international level such a move is a continuation of china s strategy of being more active in international rule making following the conclusion of the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement rcep with its asian neighbors last year and the comprehensive agreement on investment with europe last december according to gao and zhou this is in marked contrast to the approach taken by the biden administration which despite its rhetoric that america is back has not been able to conclude or even initiate any major international trade agreement in its first eight months in office moreover domestic political considerations are likely to keep the u s from returning to the cptpp anytime soon this creates a perfect window of opportunity for china to maneuver its way into a trade pact that was ironically created by the u s in order to contain china the impact on the united states china s latest actions and the u s government s poor policy choices concern american companies first china would have to overcome formidable obstacles to join the cptpp it would have to win over current cptpp governments that have ongoing differences with china or that question its readiness to join said john murphy senior vice president for international policy at the u s chamber of commerce in an interview it would need to undertake deep reforms to its system of state capitalism and regulation to meet the pact s terms and convince the other parties that it had done so however if beijing managed to clear these hurdles chinese firms would win substantial advantages over their u s competitors in terms of access to markets across the asia pacific murphy notes the united states would face a significant setback in its efforts to shape the international economic landscape to support our values and interests these dynamics show the risk that washington s inaction on trade could deal a severe blow to u s competitiveness and to the long term prospects for american workers and companies joining the asia pacific trade pact is a priority for china s leadership china s application to join the cptpp is not a spontaneous decision but has been long in the making according to gao and zhou since 2013 china has been carefully studying the cptpp including its predecessor the trans pacific partnership tpp last november president xi formally confirmed china s intention to join the pact in the long run china s accession could further cement the asia pacific s role as the world s leading economic bloc with cptpp and rcep playing complementing roles to further boost growth in the region the trump administration s trade policy was a story of inflicting great harm and achieving few successes the administration levied tariffs on 350 billion worth of imports from china the congressional budget office estimated the trump tariffs cost the average u s household more than 1 200 a year the biden administration has maintained the tariffs trump s trade policies particularly tariffs on steel and aluminum cost many manufacturing workers their jobs the tariffs also resulted in companies listed on the u s stock market losing an estimated 1 7 trillion in market value according to research by mary amiti an economist at the federal reserve bank of new york and columbia university economists sang hoon kong and david weinstein the trump administration s

with president joe biden s approval ratings in decline and his 3 5 trillion spending package losing key democratic support his administration has resorted to making up a new definition of income as a way to scare the public and congress into supporting his job killing tax hikes in a new report produced by the white house the administration claims that the wealthy have only paid 8 2 of their income in federal income taxes between 2010 and 2018 this is blatantly untrue how did the white house come up with this figure it certainly wasn t using irs data which show that the top 1 of earners pay an average tax rate of 25 4 and pay 40 1 of all income taxes instead the biden administration changed the definition of income to include the appreciation of unsold assets something america has never defined as income in its history the biden administration s study treats unrealized gains as income this means that if a person s stock or house increased in value during the calendar year the administration counts this as income even though nothing was ever sold and the taxpayer pocketed no money from the assets the u s tax code has never recognized unrealized gains as income assets only count as income when they re sold for cash what the administration is describing is wealth not income here it becomes clear why the white house s study is aimed at the wealthy alone it s not just the top 1 who have wealth in america if biden s study were applied to the middle class we d see that they too are escaping their fair share of taxes they have homes retirement accounts and traditional stocks that all increase in value every year and they are not paying taxes on this appreciation but noting this wouldn t serve the administration s purposes of trying to justify its job killing tax plan by blaming the wealthy the claim that the u s should force taxpayers to pay taxes on increases in wealth when they may not have the cash to pay the taxes is absurd on its face and economically dangerous this kind of taxation which has also been proposed by sen ron wyden of oregon would destroy jobs by discouraging investment and encouraging people to consume rather than grow capital to boost wages and expand the economy the incentive to invest for the future significantly decreases if people are taxed on the appreciation of their investments value every year ultimately the proposal to tax unrealized gains is dead in congress this study is just an attempt to distract people from biden breaking his promise not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than 400 000 biden breaks his pledge in a number of ways first the democrats current tax proposal in the house doubles the tax rate on cigarettes and raises taxes on other nicotine products such as vapes taxes on cigarettes and nicotine notoriously affect low income earners the most for example a smoker in new york who smokes one pack a day and earns only 35 000 a year would pay nearly 20 of his income in cigarette taxes under this proposal hiking taxes on cigarettes is a blatant violation of biden s pledge and shows that it won t be the wealthy who pay for his spending spree second the house s tax proposal raises the corporate tax rate to 26 5 an increase the public will feel through lower wages recent studies suggest that between 75 and 100 of the corporate tax is borne by labor through lower wages ultimately businesses do not pay taxes people do this corporate rate increase would make america s corporate tax rate higher than in communist china which would encourage american companies to move their profits jobs and investments abroad the white house s bogus study is just a big distraction to hoodwink the public into thinking that taxes need to be raised because the wealthy pay fewer taxes than the average hardworking american this is simply not true and if the democrats tax plan becomes law it ll be everyday people who pay in the form of fewer jobs lower wages and fewer economic opportunities

more than 900 of them are part of the pandora papers a hoard of almost 12 million files from 14 offshore finance service providers analyzed by investigative journalists worldwide tweet in collaboration with the philippine center for investigative journalism and the international consortium of investigative journalists more than 900 individuals and companies linked to the philippines have figured in millions of files on offshore accounts leaked from finance providers and which a broad group of journalists from 117 countries recently investigated an extremely small number of these accounts are tied to big businesses with legitimate sources and whose reasons for moving and keeping their wealth overseas may be indicative of how the philippine financial system has been slow on reforms the rest of the philippine linked accounts are mysterious at the very least some individuals who are either previously unheard of in elite circles or never found in legitimate databases turned out to be the beneficiaries of multiple accounts the purpose of many accounts could not be ascertained on a global scale the international consortium of investigative journalists icij leading 140 media outlets in 117 countries in this latest investigation found that fugitives con artists murderers and world leaders used offshore accounts to hide wealth and buy properties rappler and the philippine center for investigative journalism pcij parsed through all names and companies from documents collectively known as the pandora papers of the 14 offshore service providers whose documents were accessed by icij partners five had philippine based clients trident trust commence overseas limited overseas management company trust limited asiaciti trust alcogal we found very little information about the persons with the most links to offshore accounts found in the documents from icij check the complete list from the icij here details were scant to be able to identify the purpose of 259 offshore companies while at least 282 names from the list could not be linked to registered or active companies while rappler and pcij do not necessarily imply that illegal transactions were done through these companies of unknown individuals we raise questions on the purposes of keeping these offshore why go offshore it is legal for filipinos to set up offshore accounts these companies however operate in various shades of gray areas that are worthy of scrutiny from regulators a seasoned corporate lawyer who has wealthy clients acknowledged in an interview with rappler and pcij that companies in so called tax havens attract both high net worth individuals and criminals he requested not to be named for one the british virgin islands is an established favorable taxing jurisdiction while the philippines has recent laws which reduced estate and income taxes the british virgin islands still has significantly lower rates we have this client she s a matriarch she owns shares of high value now her concern is that she does not want to burden her children and grandchildren with taxes related to inheritance i think the tax could reach p30 million what if you re rich but not liquid where will you get that money just to inherit the shares the lawyer explained so i advised her to establish a trust because when those shares go into the trust the trust will hold the shares for the benefit of your children and effectively cut what could have been perpetual taxes once it goes down to the grandchildren and their children that saves a lot of money he added for another the territory is very lenient when it comes to disclosure of ownership of companies bvi companies can help in layering one s wealth so as not to attract too much attention the lawyer however admitted that these functions operate within gray areas that corrupt individuals can abuse it s not wrong per se but like all other things it can be used for bad purposes for example you re a politician who got kick backs then you have lodged your funds here in the philippines it s quite possible that the bank secrecy can be lifted during a litigation but if you lodge it abroad it would mean that the court may have to ask for cooperation from that country that company or bank that s a lot of steps the lawyer said we reached out to the business executives we were able to identify on the list they said that their offshore companies were either created for business deals or for cost and tax efficiency some remained dormant and were not used at all moreover corporate lawyers we spoke to pointed out that the rich have every reason to move their money out as the philippines laws unnecessarily tax wealth several times over while there have been reforms the tax laws need to be improved further a corporate lawyer said most importantly moving assets abroad also provides some security for their legally acquired wealth what s fishy what s not with the mix of the good and the bad operating within the bvi system how does one tell which account holds dirty money there really is no clear way said another corporate lawyer who also wanted to remain anonymous so as not to alarm his high profile clients i have a client whose child was almost kidnapped because of their perceived wealth setting up an offshore account hides their money in a legitimate way from people who have bad intentions while also keeping it accessible whenever they need the liquidity the second lawyer said former bureau of internal revenue commissioner kim henares shared this view saying that prominent names on the list may not be an issue as these individuals could easily justify their wealth but if a name does not come up on google but has lots of offshore accounts the second lawyer said i simply ask what are you doing there after careful investigation rappler and pcij found that the purpose of the majority of the offshore companies linked to filipinos on the pandora papers are unclear moreover the secrecy of the offshore system makes it impossible to distinguish which are tied to legitimate sources and which come from criminal activities icij also pointed out that even legal transactions have to also be put into question for instance profits of businesses from high tax countries are transferred to companies that only exist on paper in tax havens does this put the host country like the philippines at a disadvantage or are there gaps needed to be plugged in such countries and territories the philippines is not a unique case according to the paris based organization for economic cooperation and development oecd at least 13 3 trillion is held offshore who s who on the list the tree map below shows that most of the individuals on the list linked to the philippines are unknown or have scant publicly available records the chart was made by carefully checking each name on search engines and databases and matching them with a company these companies are then categorized per industry while the majority of the companies can t be traced to prominent filipino personalities or firms we were able to identify 36 offshore companies linked to conglomerates and mall operators some of which have responded to our queries the names of the sy siblings of sm investments corporation for instance showed up on the commence list and are linked to 10 offshore companies incorporated in the british virgin islands bvi their companies were created sometime between 2002 and 2015 the gaisano family which owns malls and retail outlets mostly in the visayas and mindanao are linked to 12 companies the commence list also indicated the gatchalian family of the wellex group owning 10 bvi companies some members of the aboitiz clan were named owners of 13 companies view the responses of prominent filipinos here when they become available on october 4 at 12 p m philippine time meanwhile at least 31 names on the list are lawyers some of whom are directors and corporate secretaries of publicly listed companies at least six mining companies including monte oro resources and energy have also set up offshore companies monte oro said that the offshore company was set up for an exploration project in sierra leone logistics companies notably of davao based businessman dennis uy s have also appeared on the list the name of transportation secretary arthur tugade also appears on the list read the story here when it becomes available on october 4 at 10 am philippine time mystery people the list from the offshore service providers also revealed that the individuals with the most links did not appear on search engines and other public databases a woman s name for example is identified in 21 offshore companies as their client no other details can be found about this person in any government databases or past offshore leaks the documents from the offshore service providers also did not provide other information meanwhile a 71 year old male appears in 20 companies as either a client or beneficial owner while his name appears on several websites rappler and pcij won t publish his name as we are still unable to verify his identity a network map of all filipino related companies in the pandora papers also showed that the companies of the mystery woman are linked to other individuals on the list meanwhile the companies established by the 71 year old man are only linked to one individual who could either be his wife or relative the documents were able to identify 156 filipinos 21 chinese and 9 britons but the nationalities of 160 other names on the list cannot be ascertained almost all of these names however are filipino and chinese sounding the documents from icij revealed that more filipinos started to create offshore companies in 1997 or during the asian financial crisis the crisis led to financial contagion drop in stock prices and the peso s devaluation among other economic meltdowns a total of 23 offshore companies were established by philippine based individuals and companies in 1997 alone among those who established these were the gatchalian family who are prominent businessmen and politicians in 2015 another spike in the number of incorporated offshore companies was observed among the 28 companies established during that time were owned by the gaisano and sy families to search for the names of filipinos on the pandora papers database use the search bar below a long way to go on reforms while offshore companies continue to house money of both legitimate and sketchy individuals leaks to the press have made significant improvements to somewhat lift the veil for instance the panama papers of 2016 helped persuade the united states congress to pass the corporate transparency act which requires owners of companies to disclose their identities to the treasury department meanwhile the organization for economic cooperation and development reported that nearly 100 countries carried out automatic exchange of information in 2019 enabling tax authorities to obtain data on 84 million financial accounts held offshore by their residents this represents a significant increase over 2018 the first year of such information exchange where information on 47 million financial accounts was exchanged representing 5 trillion the growth stems from an increase in the number of jurisdictions receiving information as well as a wider scope of information exchanged the oecd said the philippines however has a long way to go while leaks via the panama papers and the paradise papers of 2017 have prompted legislators in other countries to follow the rest of the world in lifting the bank secrecy law the philippines continues to keep the lid on the philippines is the only country left in the world with a law that keeps the secrecy on bank deposits end contributors to the pandora papers project carmela fonbuena miriam grace a go karol ilagan elyssa lopez pauline macaraeg ralf rivas felipe salvosa follow pcij on

the international consortium of investigative journalists icij opened a pandora s box a massive trove of private financial records dubbed pandora papers on sunday night naming national and international personalities among 700 pakistanis including cabinet members allegedly hiding financial secrets via offshore companies the icij stated that key members of prime minister imran khan s inner circle including cabinet ministers their families and major financial backers have secretly owned an array of companies and trusts holding millions of dollars of hidden wealth the icij said that military leaders have also been implicated but the documents contain no suggestion that khan himself owns offshore companies in line with his narrative of anti corruption and accountability premier imran welcomed the pandora papers and vowed to investigate all those pakistanis named in it saying if any wrongdoing is established we will take appropriate action political temperature was high since the announcement was made that the details about leaked papers would be shared on sunday night political commentators were quick to add that former prime minister nawaz sharif s name was also not included in the panama papers but it would be interesting to see if the opposition parties would be able to take any advantage of the pandora papers just like imran took against the previous government after panama papers scandal had emerged my govt will investigate all our citizens mentioned in the pandora papers if any wrongdoing is established we will take appropriate action i call on the international community to treat this grave injustice as similar to the climate change crisis imran khan imrankhanpti october 3 2021 among those whose holdings have been exposed are imran s finance minister shaukat fayaz ahmed tarin and his family and the son of imran s former adviser on finance and revenue waqar masood khan the records also reveal offshore dealings of a top pti donor arif naqvi who is facing fraud charges in the united states journalist umar cheema who along with his colleague from a local newspaper fakhar durrani was part of the icij investigations revealed that over 700 pakistanis were named in the pandora papers and they secretly moved millions offshore saying utmost efforts were made to ensure accuracy in the report and it was now up to the authorities concerned to move ahead apparently much of the space in the icij s story on pakistan is given to explaining background and efforts have been made to connect dots however several names of pakistanis allegedly involved in the scandal came through the pakistani journalists working with icij when they appeared on television the icij story doesn t reveal all the names or provides any link of all the pakistanis whose names have claimed to be found in the secret documents the journalists told a private news channel that the exposé named tarin senator faisal vawda pml q s moonis elahi ishaq dar s son ali dar ppp s sharjeel memon the brother of minister for industries and production khusro bakhtiar pti leader abdul aleem khan mir shakeelur rehman axact ceo shoaib sheikh among others who allegedly have links to offshore companies it is unfortunate that in pakistan accountability is very selective and people are targeted the aim is not to hold people accountable but to remove opponents from one s path cheema said adding that the panama papers which led to the downfall of former pm sharif had also taken the world by storm but the matter later fizzled out the icij files show that the ruling party s key political ally chaudhry moonis elahi planned to put the proceeds from an allegedly corrupt business deal into a secret trust concealing them from pakistan s tax authorities they said that omer bakhtiar the brother of khusro bakhtiar transferred a 1 million apartment in the chelsea area of london to his elderly mother through an offshore company in 2018 the son of waqar masood khan co owned a company based in the british virgin islands the report said that the former pti minister for water resources faisal vawda set up an offshore company in 2012 to invest in uk properties icij said the icij claimed that naqvi the financier and major donor of imran s 2013 campaign owned several offshore companies and another leading businessman and another pti donor tariq shafi held 215 million through offshore companies the pandora papers reveal that in 2007 the wife of gen shafaatullah shah then one of pakistan s leading generals and a former aide to president pervez musharraf acquired a 1 2 million apartment in london through a discreet offshore transaction the pandora papers also reveal that raja nadir pervez a retired army lieutenant colonel and former government minister owned international finance and equipment ltd a bvi registered company another influential former military leader who shows up in the leaked documents is maj gen nusrat naeem the isi s onetime director general of counterintelligence he owned a bvi company afghan oil and gas ltd which was registered in 2009 shortly after his retirement we welcome the pandora papers exposing the ill gotten wealth of elites accumulated through tax evasion corruption laundered out to financial havens the un sg s panel facti calculated a staggering 7 trillion in stolen assets parked in largely offshore tax havens imran khan imrankhanpti october 3 2021 while naming close relatives of three senior military figures the report said umar and ahad khattak sons of the former head of pakistan air force abbas khattak in 2010 registered a bvi company to invest what documents call family business earnings in stocks bonds mutual funds and real estate the icij reiterated that the pandora papers reveal that pm imran has surrounded himself with people cabinet ministers and their families donors and other political allies who have holdings hidden offshore the icij s investigation is a result of 600 journalists in 117 countries studying for months roughly 11 9 million documents that leaked from the offshore environment the project named the pandora papers is in reference to the greek mythology s character in whose box would be all the ills of humanity
