new york city s economy surged back to life in october as rising vaccination rates and falling infection numbers spurred a wave of hiring still new data underscores deeply embedded inequality in the city even as the biden administration struggles to pass a social spending bill that would help new york s less well off residents and as mayor elect eric adams pledges to tackle disparities the city gained 83 500 jobs in october the largest boost since the early months of the pandemic recession recovery in 2020 the increase reached 2 or twice the rate of the nation as a whole it marked the first time in months that the city s job creation outpaced the rest of the country the local unemployment rate dropped slightly to 9 4 from the 9 8 recorded in september while still much higher than the national rate the number of unemployed city residents has declined for nine consecutive months new york city infection rates fell from mid september to the end of october said james parrott an economist at the new school as the virus infection rate goes so goes the job rebound in the opposite direction virtually every major sector showed employment gains led by private colleges and universities business services health care and the arts broadway performers stage a pop up show in times square credit ben fractenberg the city one particularly important sign of things to come the addition of almost 7 000 jobs in child care in the last two months with schools back to in person learning many economists believe the lack of affordable and plentiful child care is keeping many parents especially women from rejoining the workforce the promising job numbers come ahead of the economically crucial holiday season the first since the widespread availability of vaccinations and on the cusp of a critical year that will bring a new mayoral administration and a fierce race for governor the one percent thrives new reports though show how new york remains one of the most unequal cities in the nation the top 1 of taxpayers in new york accounted for some 35 of all the taxable income in the city in 2019 according to data the independent budget office updates annually some 55 of taxpayers made less than 40 000 accounting for less than 10 of all the taxable income in the city all signs point to the gap between the rich and the poor growing rapidly in the pandemic to the point where it may rival 2007 when the 1 accounted for more than 45 of all income that was also a year in which the stock market boomed and wall street handed out big bonuses a construction worker

bank of new york shows how difficult making economic gains are for black and hispanic new yorkers even at an institution widely touted as a pathway to the middle class black students are more likely than white students to take on debt and to be delinquent on student loans while lagging in completing degrees according to the study data on consumer debt shows black and hispanic graduates from cuny are less likely to buy a home or car and to have smaller credit card debt they also have higher rates of delinquencies than white cuny alumni in addition to racial disparities women at cuny do better in school than men but that doesn t translate into more spending power you can see a lot of gender and racial inequality in the data said rajashri chakrabarti senior economist at the new york fed there is inequality in household debt as well as in delinquencies inequality in educational attainment is an important contributor to racial inequality for gender inequality structural factors also play a role the great equalizer while city and state governments have limited ability to influence the trends widening inequality in new york the biden administration s embattled 1 7 trillion social spending bill would substantially help poorer residents in the city said rep ritchie torres d the bronx rep ritchie torres d the bronx credit ben fractenberg the city two provisions in particular would have a major impact in the city he contends expanding home care for seniors and lifting pay for home care workers would both improve the finances of seniors and the women of color who largely provide the care while earning poverty wages making the doubling of the refundable child tax credit permanent would essentially provide social security for families with children lifting those families out of poverty it is the great equalizer torres said while watered down a global minimum tax for corporations and funding aggressive irs enforcement of the tax laws would also mean companies and the rich would pay their fair share he added adams meanwhile pledged to attack inequality by fighting covid effectively and investing in infrastructure job training help for struggling business and incentives for new industries to move to the city the new jobs data is a good sign that our city is ready to rebound but we have work to do to ensure that our comeback is equitable sustainable and prioritizes those who have been most impacted by the covid 19 pandemic and historic inequality he said in a statement to the city
menafn zex pr wire singapore 18th nov 2021 zexprwire during its peak cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for gpus graphics processing units gpu manufacturers showed impressive financial results in terms of stocks and shares finest trading over a decade however this race for crypto mining finished rapidly regardless of the increased demand for gpus it is because of increased difficulty in mining top cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin yet cryptocurrency mining can still be lucrative hence what is crypto mining filecoin investment filecoin v s btc mining and how one can get started the article will help you with all these confusions what is crypto mining it is often a misunderstanding that crypto mining is a mode of generating new coins it also includes validating cryptocurrency transactions over a blockchain network while adding them to a distributed ledger most prominently crypto mining makes it preventable for the digital currency to double spend over a distributed network unlike physical currencies digital currencies are easily manipulated because transactions occur on digital platforms therefore they often go through security issues giving miners the added responsibility to secure the network from double spending in the meantime miners get rewards of new coins for securing the network the mining process might get crucial when validating the transactions because of centralized authority issues with distributed ledgers it is why miners earn newly minted coins a proof of work pow consensus protocol has been established to verify the authorized crypto miners responsible for validating and mining transactions also pow s job is to secure the network from external attacks the native cryptocurrencies compensate these miners sometimes these miners are in charge of contributing storage capacity with clients to store their data instead of contributing computational power what is a filecoin filecoin is a decentralized file storage system that opens up vast opportunities for users by leveraging the power of blockchain technology these decentralized file sharing systems have become quite a thing for some time outside of financial applications the filecoin mining system serves as another use case for blockchain technology as the users can bid on available storage presented by miners it is quite profitable as it is not very familiar among the countries like china korea singapore malaysia and japan how to buy filecoin one can purchase filecoin from the following exchanges binance users residing in canada australia the uk singapore and most of the world can purchase filecoin from binance however residents of the usa are restricted to buy fil uphold us residents have one of the top exchanges in the face of uphold they can also claim a

adam beam associated press sacramento california is on track to have so much money that state officials will likely have to give even more of it back to taxpayers to meet constitutional limits on state spending according to a new forecast from the state s independent legislative analyst s office the state s annual fiscal outlook released wednesday predicts a 31 billion surplus for the 2022 budget year that begins july 1 the analyst s office says state is on pace to have so much money that it could exceed a constitutional limit on state spending by 26 billion over three years that could require gov gavin newsom and state lawmakers to either cut taxes spend more money on infrastructure or perhaps the most popular choice in an election year give rebates to taxpayers and spend more on public schools we think it will turn out to be a pretty significant issue for the legislature to consider in this coming budget process legislative analyst gabe petek said newsom won t reveal his budget proposal until january but on wednesday the governor indicated his favored giving some of the money back to taxpayers that s what he and the state legislature did earlier this year approving rebates totaling 12 billion for some taxpayers in a state budget that was also projected to exceed the spending limit how we framed that historic surplus last year similarly we will frame our approach this year newsom said during a news conference at the port of long beach i m very proud of the historic tax rebate last year and i look forward to making the decision that i think is in the best interests of 40 million californians california s tax collections have continued to soar despite the pandemic from april through june of this year california businesses reported a record high 216 8 billion in taxable sales a 38 8 increase over the same period in 2020 and a 17 4 increase over those months in pre pandemic 2019 nick maduros director of the california department of tax and fee administration said it is a sign that business owners found creative ways to adapt during a difficult year in september collections from taxes on income sales and corporations were 40 higher than september of last year and almost 60 higher than september 2019 that s because retail sales have seen double digit growth this year and stock prices have doubled from their low point at the start of the pandemic last spring but the lao said it s impossible to know whether these gains are sustainable prices for goods and services are going up because of inflation in october the nationwide growth in retail sales of 1 7 was mostly because prices rose 0 9 during that same time period according to new data from the u s census bureau gas prices grew even faster while most of the state s wealthier workers kept their jobs and kept paying taxes during the pandemic the state s lower wage workers were hit hard by government ordered closures of restaurants and other public spaces more than 18 months into the pandemic california is tied for the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 7 5 there s something wrong when the state is flush with extra cash 750 for every man woman and child while ordinary people have to choose between putting food on the table and filling their gas tank assembly republican leader marie waldron said california s budget year runs from july 1 to june 30 during the first three months of this budget year california tax collections are more than 10 billion ahead of projections the lao predicts that by june 2022 california will have collected 28 billion more in taxes and transfers than officials had expected this means there will likely be a significant increase in spending on public schools the state constitution requires lawmakers to spend about 40 of state tax collections on public education each year the lao said wednesday that means public schools and community colleges could see an 11 billion increase california s strong fiscal health is not an accident it is the direct result of a decade of responsible budgeting by democratic legislators and governors that enabled the state to survive the pandemic downturn said state senate president pro tempore toni atkins a democrat from san diego despite california s wealth atkins said too many families struggle just to get by she said the legislature will work to craft transformative priorities that put california s wealth to work building a more equitable economy and a stronger middle class newsom said wednesday he d like to put most of the surplus either in the state s savings account or spend it on one time items that don t require ongoing funding so that we re not caught flat footed when the economy contracts when the markets begin to adjust we are going to substantially increase our one time investments in infrastructure newsom said that s one budget preview you can count on the legislative analyst s office says most economic forecasters predict inflation will slow down by next year but conceded that prediction comes with significant uncertainty while the lao is predicting a 31 billion surplus it could be as low as 10 billion or as high as 60 billion depending on how much money the state collects from taxes if the numbers hold the lao says california could have as much as 21 billion in its main savings account or about 10 of all general fund revenues and transfers

this story was updated to reflect responses from the city of san antonio a new report out from the university of texas austin school of law says san antonio uses code enforcement aggressively in communities of color removing people from homes at rates hundreds of times higher than other major cities combined the report out thursday said the city issued vacate orders and orders to demolish 626 single family homes that had been occupied between 2015 2020 a rate nearly 4000 higher than houston dallas and fort worth combined in that same period in total it issued 1 000 orders during the window i ve been doing this work for about 25 years and i have never heard of this happening at this level in these large texas cities and houston and dallas definitely have lots of poverty and they still have a pretty large stock of older substandard housing said heather way author of the report and co director of the entrepreneurship and community development clinic at ut austin a building at the corner of north mesquite and east crockett streets dominic walsh the report said the city often bypasses the hearing process when issuing these orders there were 337 orders to vacate issued outside of a hearing process a dubious honor the report says the city holds alone among other major texas cities we disagree with the conclusions reached by this report said michael shannon director of development services at the city of san antonio due process is the keystone to all code enforcement actions on a systematic and consistent basis as required with the enabling statutory authorities and local city code ordinances the processes in other cities are different and it wasn t clear to city staff if this analysis was apples to apples notices to vacate are used only when a structure is determined to be unfit for human occupancy and constitutes a threat to the health safety and welfare of its residents as required in the san antonio property maintenance code our overriding priority is and always will be the health and safety of our residents shannon said generally the city uses a hearing to determine that a structure is unsafe for residents and for the community before it demolishes them the report said this was skirted at times the past five years it found 86 demolition orders where no hearing was held and it said the city only held hearings for vacate orders 17 of the time when it did hold hearings the report cites direct observation of hearings where residents were treated disrespectfully at one buildings and standards meeting on june 13 2019 the report said an impoverished resident was pleading for understanding the cost of repairing her home was too great for her the chair of that board responded ma am do you know how stressful it is for us to look at this property and know that human beings are living here that s very stressful on us too the city using city code enforcement through pro active drive bys from city staff seems to target homes in urban core neighborhoods they write up homes with overgrown junk filled yards and structures that appear unsafe the report argued these measures are being used disproportionately in areas adjacent to downtown that have older housing stock high poverty and long standing communities of color it pointed to census tracts in district 2 on the city s east side a rapidly gentrifying community that has been historically african american as well as many in district 5 one of the poorest in the city the so called decade of downtown launched by former mayor julián castro has been cited by many as displacing people from downtown adjacent neighborhoods a feeling the report supports many of the most affected areas are in downtown adjacent tracts whose property values have been affected in recent years and could be prime targets of redevelopment the report pointed to the city s own findings that aggressive use of code enforcement in these communities could lead to exacerbated gentrification but the author stopped short of saying there was a connection between the dovetailing of the development community s interest and city actions those connections could be made by some who read this report said way further the report argued the city is breaking state law by not offering relocation costs to people it displaces a practice they find well established in cities like fort worth the city disputes the idea that it has violated state law saying it adheres to all of them staff consistently provide information on all resources available for assistance to come into compliance to property owners including relocation services a city staffer said in an email it wasn t clear if san antonio provides monetary compensation for people displaced but the law seems to indicate they should here is a passage from the texas property code section 21 046 which deals with relocation assistance if a person moves or discontinues the person s business moves personal property or moves from the person s dwelling as a direct result of code enforcement rehabilitation or a demolition program the person is considered to be displaced because of the acquisition of real property in the last year the city has spent tens of millions of dollars on rental assistance and home maintenance programs but the programs met the needs of too few said the report wednesday night the city s housing committee met for hours formulating a 150 million affordable housing bond that could pour money into programs devoted to these communities keeping people in their homes through repair and rehabilitation programs city workers clear out unhoused people from under a downtown overpass many displaced people are highly vulnerable to becoming homeless says the report ballot language for the 2022 housing bond should explicitly target funds for extremely low income housing development and preservation said rebecca flores a resident of district 5 speaking at the bond meeting wednesday night tax breaks and other incentives awarded to developers for the decade of downtown have used our public revenue of millions of dollars while not building affordable housing for low income residents flores said ultimately the report provides many recommendations for the city concluding it should cease issuing vacate orders and doing emergency demolitions outside without a hearing and increase support and assistance programs and counsel in any hearings in an email the city said the report represented simply the opinions not a law review article or scientific study of the authors who they said did not engage meaningfully with city staff for this report there was no real attempt to engage with city staff tasked with implementing policy and procedures said a city staffer way disagreed saying she and her co authors sought to discuss the study with city staff a number of times and ultimately did have several phone calls and conversations with them we tried very hard to connect with staff she said and initially they weren t responsive but we learned alot from those conversations when they finally did respond

this is the second of a two part series on the contents of the biden administration s build back better program and what montana s two u s senators are saying about it helena montana s democratic u s senator jon tester is supportive of president biden s ambitious social program package known as build back better but says it can t increase the federal debt and that means some tax increases which tester says should fall primarily on the wealthy i m open to anything as long as it doesn t hit medium and low income folks he told mtn news this week i think that applying more taxes to the rich who have so many opportunities out there for tax avoidance is really important but montana s republican u s senator steve daines is strongly opposed to the measure and maintains that while its tax provisions may be targeted at wealthy taxpayers and corporations the impact will be felt by everyone and ultimately hurt the economy mike dennison mtn news u s sen steve daines r mont believe me if you start raising taxes on businesses those tax increases will get passed on to the consumer he said in a recent interview any time we can allow hard working americans to keep more of their dollars in their pockets it s the right thing late thursday the congressional budget office said the current version of the bill does not pay for itself and increase the deficit by 367 billion over the next decade but cbo score doesn t include all of the revenue raisers included in the bill and the biden administration said it believes the costs are covered the bill s price tag is 1 75 trillion over 10 years some of the major tax and revenue increases and changes in its current version include corporate minimum tax a 15 percent minimum tax on corporate profits for companies that earn more than 1 billion a year it also includes a global minimum tax on international corporations together these two provisions are estimated to raise 450 billion to 600 billion over the 10 years period surcharge and increases for wealthy individuals a 5 percent income tax surtax on individual earnings above 10 million and an 8 percent surtax on earnings above 25 million it also increases the taxation of some investment income for wealthy taxpayers together these changes will raise about 480 billion stock buy back surcharge a 1 percent surcharge on corporate stock buy backs which are used to increase the value of a company for shareholders it s estimated to raise 50 billion to 125 billion increased irs enforcement the bill would add 80 000 agents to the internal revenue service primarily for auditing those earning 400 000 or more supporters of the bill note that the irs auditing workforce has been greatly diminished in recent years leading to fewer and fewer audits of wealthy taxpayers and less pursuit of tax scofflaws this change is expected to raise an addition 125 billion prescription drug prices the measure gives the federal government through medicare and other means more power to limit the price of some prescription drugs that could result in a savings of 250 billion tax cuts payments for middle and lower income families it extends through 2022 a 250 per month per child payment 300 for children under 6 years old and continues this payment as a refundable tax credit in future years for families under a certain income level it also extends an expanded earned income tax credit which will lower federal taxes for an estimated 78 000 montana taxpayers mtn news u s house speaker nancy pelosi u s senate majority leader chuck schumer and other congressional democratic leaders daines however notes that the bill also includes a substantial tax break for wealthy individual taxpayers by increasing the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted on your federal income taxes from 10 000 to 80 000 benefiting people who live in high tax states it cuts taxes for the coastal elites he says you ve gotta laugh about this tester says if that provision makes it out of the house he d like to see it removed in the senate because any tax reductions should be going to those who need it and not wealthy taxpayers but tester says he expects many changes to the bill including its tax structure will be debated in the senate and that he s not yet drawing lines in the sand on any of its specific tax proposals just yet john riley mtn news u s sen jon tester d mont in the end i m going to take a look at it and see how it works for montana families he says there may be better proposals come down the pike that are better for rural america better for a state like montana we ll take a look at them and draw our conclusions based on that but there s one thing for certain this bill needs to be paid for late thursday the congressional budget office said the current version of the bill does not pay for itself and increase the deficit by 367 billion over the next decade tester also says he doesn t have a problem with additional irs agents auditing the wealthiest taxpayers or going after people who aren t paying their taxes the bottom line is if you pay your taxes you got no problems you got no problems at all unless you re advocating for only certain people to pay the bills for our defense and pay the bills for our programs that help the poor and educate our kids he says if that s where you re at i think you re living in the wrong country daines points to an analysis released this week by the congressional joint committee on taxation that says the bill will lead to higher taxes for some people earning less than 100 000 in the coming years contrary to claims by the president and democrats that same analysis however also says the bulk of the tax increases in build back better fall on the wealthy daines says he simply opposes raising taxes to fund a huge expansion of government here s the fundamental question should we allow the people of our country to make the decision of where to invest those dollars he says or do we raise taxes and allow the federal government to make those decisions you lower tax rates allow the american people to keep more money in their pocket it actually spurs economic expansion and it increases wages for the american

researchers have found covid 19 antibodies and active infections in deer across the united states but a north carolina expert says not to panic moriah boggess a deer biologist at the n c wildlife resources commission said the risk to both humans and the animals appears low at the moment but that more research is needed to understand the situation no covid antibodies have been detected yet in any north carolina deer but boggess said testing in the state has been limited and localized so far in other states including iowa and ohio he said researchers have found deer capable of contracting the virus and spreading it to one another boggess said there have been no confirmed transmissions from deer to humans how did deer catch the virus though it hasn t been confirmed boggess said it s likely deer caught the virus from humans researchers looked at the lineage of the virus in those deer and it very closely matched the current strains circulating in the human population he said a couple months later it was a different strain in the human population and it was a different strain showing up in deer one study by the u s department of agriculture tested 481 white tailed deer from illinois michigan new york and pennsylvania of those 33 had antibodies another found antibodies in more than 80 of white tailed deer in iowa with 33 of all deer testing positive it s highly likely that deer are catching it from humans boggess said but we don t understand yet how that s happening and although deer are able to transmit it to one another he said it doesn t appear to pose a threat to them it appears that they re a host for the disease not necessarily an animal affected by it he said researchers have not yet found any deer that were killed by the virus or displayed symptoms of it boggess said as of right now it doesn t appear to be a population issue or anything that we really expect to turn into a population issue for deer he added what danger does this pose boggess said the risk to humans is low and that people should follow ordinary precautions when it comes to the wild animals though humans could theoretically contract the virus through droplets from a live animal s mouth or nose boggess said people should be avoiding wild deer anyway people should not be handling wildlife he said people should not be interacting with live deer for hunters boggess advised wearing protective gear when field dressing deer and processing meat individuals should wear rubber or latex gloves and wash their hands after handling the animal guidelines that he added are always advised to protect them against possible diseases on top of that for someone who is concerned about potentially contracting the virus from a deer we would also recommend wearing a mask he said and also being vaccinated is of course one of the best ways to avoid risk of a severe infection from the disease if you plan to eat venison current guidance points to it being safe according to the centers for disease control and prevention there is currently no evidence to support transmission of the virus through food but boggess stressed that research on covid risks associated with deer has been very limited this is all working off of what we know about the virus transmitting through humans he said

about 14 000 kroger workers in the houston area could go on strike within the next week as they fight america s largest grocery chain over wages health care and staffing levels negotiations between kroger and the united food and commercial workers ufcw local 455 have continued throughout the pandemic after the union contract expired in april 2020 the union said the company s proposals do not provide workers with adequate pay or health care a kroger store sign photo by wikimedia commons mcsquishee cc by nc sa 4 0 union officials held a vote on kroger s most recent proposal at over 100 houston locations this weekend the union reported that a record breaking number of members had cast votes and 97 percent of them had rejected the contract and authorized the union to call a strike with this vote kroger grocery workers are sending a clear message that they are ready to stand up for the good pay lower prescription costs and quality healthcare they have earned on the frontlines of this pandemic ufcw local 455 president brandon hopkins said in a statement hopkins also went on to say to be clear a strike is always a last resort our hope is that kroger will do the right thing and put houston families first by returning to the negotiating table workers also overwhelmingly voted to strike last november but union officials decided to continue fruitless negotiations at the time the union said they wanted to give workers another opportunity to weigh in before taking the step to strike these empty gestures are clearly not aimed at pressuring management but at confusing and wearing down the resistance of workers earlier this week kroger s houston division posted a notice to its website telling workers that it s business as usual strike authorization does not mean a strike report to work according to your regular schedule kroger said in a statement it was focused on reaching an agreement and claimed it has already proposed 56 million in wage increases in response to negotiations we have offered a contract that respects our associates by significantly investing in their total compensation industry leading healthcare and seeks zero concessions said clara campbell kroger s regional corporate affairs manager this is the third time ufcw local 455 has asked its members to authorize a strike and potentially disrupt their lives during the middle of a pandemic campbell said the most productive thing the union can do is to work with the company to reach an agreement and end the bargaining deadlock kroger has done exceptionally well during the pandemic according to the company s website its total sales grew by over 10 billion from 2019 to 2020 excluding fuel and asset dispositions total sales grew 14 2 percent rather than channeling this money into higher wages or better working conditions kroger returned 1 9 billion to shareholders and repurchased 1 32 billion of its own shares in 2020 under its board authorizations a move aimed at inflating its stock price the company saw its fourteenth consecutive year of dividend increases in 2020 resulting in a payout of 534 million to its shareholders kroger ceo william rodney mcmullen was given a compensation package of more than 20 6 million along with a 6 4 million raise the ufcw has played a pivotal role in this throughout the pandemic the union has worked to keep kroger and other grocery and food processing workers on the job at whatever the cost to workers health while it stonewalls strike action the union has seen a 66 million increase in the value of its financial investments since the pandemic began kroger workers should take a warning from the treacherous role the ufcw played in the strike by 400 workers at the heaven hill distillery in kentucky who faced management demands they give up a traditional 5 day workweek and accept increases in insurance premiums after five weeks on strike the ufcw called a snap vote on a new contract without allowing workers a proper chance to review the agreement even though workers voted by a majority to reject the deal the ufcw declared it ratified because it did not meet the required two thirds super majority required for rejection to win their fight kroger workers need to take their struggle into their own hands by forming their own independent rank and file committees democratically elected and controlled by workers themselves workers must link their struggle with that of other workers such as striking kellogg workers and kroger and other food workers nationally and internationally the world socialist web site will assist workers who want to take up this fight

rebuffed u s requests to speed up oil supplies with gasoline prices and other costs rising u s president joe biden also faces political pressure ahead of midterm elections next year opec plans to meet on dec 2 the group has taken a deliberate approach to boosting output viewing the economic recovery as too fragile to justify more supply oil prices sank about 4 to a six week low after reuters reports about the u s request and china s decision to release some crude before recovering some ground later on thursday oil prices have retreated from recent highs in anticipation that world supply will rise brent is now under 80 bucks said john driscoll managing director at consultancy jtd energy in singapore it s having a short term effect on oil markets it s probably good for at least a 5 correction china s state reserve bureau told reuters it was working on a release of crude oil reserves but declined to comment on the u s request the united states has the largest strategic reserve at more than 600 million barrels the u s spr was set up in the 1970s after the arab oil embargo to ensure the nation had adequate supply to weather an emergency in the last several years the shale boom has pushed u s output to rival that of saudi arabia and russia a challenge to opec by involving china for the first time this proposal is an unprecedented challenge to opec the cartel that has influenced oil prices for over five decades china is the world s no 2 oil consumer and largest importer there was no immediate official reaction from opec members the group has been raising output by 400 000 barrels per day per month gradually unwinding record production cuts made in 2020 when the pandemic sank fuel demand this week secretary general mohammad barkindo said opec expects an oil supply surplus to begin building next month read more one opec source who asked not to be named said it would be surprising to see consuming countries release stocks to lower prices rather than to meet a supply shortage however several large world energy consumers have been pressing opec to boost supply china elected to release reserves in september to try to stabilize prices india has expressed frustration for months and sharply cut purchases from saudi arabia in the spring due to rising costs read more somebody may turn around and say well if i m a producing country why don t i take advantage of high prices well you can it s your choice you re a sovereign country you re a member of a cartel hardeep singh puri india s oil minister told a conference in dubai on wednesday this is not a case of supplies not being available there are 5 million barrels a day of supplies available which have not been released for whatever reason china in iea out the united states and its allies have coordinated strategic petroleum reserve releases before such as in 2011 when supplies were hit by a war in opec member libya that coordination has been handled through the paris based energy watchdog the international energy agency whose membership includes the united states japan and numerous european nations the united states however did not ask the european union for its participation according to a source familiar with discussions saying europe s primary problem has been related to higher natural gas prices the iea on its web site said such releases are not meant for price intervention both japan and south korea were contacted by the united states and both said they do not release reserves simply to deal with rising prices if china is doing its release in coordination with other nations it would be the first such time said sengyick tee analyst at beijing based consultancy sia energy us crude oil in strategic petroleum reserves reporting by tim gardner in washington

new york nov 18 2021 prnewswire today prominent investor rights law firm bernstein litowitz berger grossmann llp blb g filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws in the u s district court for the southern district of new york against peloton interactive inc peloton or the company and certain of its senior executives collectively defendants on behalf of investors in peloton common stock between december 9 2020 and november 4 2021 inclusive the class period blb g filed this action on behalf of its client city of hialeah employees retirement system and the case is captioned city of hialeah employees retirement system v peloton interactive inc no 1 21 cv 9582 s d n y the complaint is based on an extensive investigation and a careful evaluation of the merits of this case a copy of the complaint is available on blb g s website by clicking here peloton s alleged fraud headquartered in new york new york peloton offers interactive internet connected exercise equipment including bicycles and treadmills designed and marketed for use in customers homes along with subscriptions that allow users to access exercise classes while using their peloton equipment or with their own home equipment for most of 2020 and 2021 as the covid 19 pandemic and related stay at home orders and business closures largely kept individuals out of the gym the demand for in home exercise options increased dramatically against that backdrop in the months leading up to the class period peloton experienced unprecedented demand for its products and services the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants repeatedly falsely assured investors that the company s positive results and growth would continue after the pandemic in addition during the class period defendants made false and misleading statements about the amount of inventory that peloton held and touted the company s ability to keep its inventory levels in line with substantial sustained demand as a result of defendants misrepresentations peloton common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the class period the truth about the plummeting demand for peloton s products was revealed through two disclosures first after the market closed on august 26 2021 the company disclosed that it had identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting with respect to identification and valuation of inventory in its annual report filed with the sec on form 10 k on august 27 peloton explained that this material weakness arose because our controls were not effectively designed documented and maintained to verify that our physical inventory counts were correctly counted and communicated for reporting in our financial statements however at the same time that peloton disclosed the weakness in its internal controls defendants continued to misrepresent and conceal the unsustainable nature of peloton s financial results and growth post covid issuing guidance of 5 4 billion of total revenue for fiscal year 2022 representing 34 year over year growth then on november 4 2021 the company announced second quarter financial results that fell far short of expectations and reduced its total revenue guidance for fiscal 2022 by a staggering 1 billion peloton further disclosed that inventory had skyrocketed to 1 27 billion 91 of which comprised finished products that the company still held on peloton s november 4 earnings conference call with investors defendants admitted that peloton overestimated demand and underestimated the impact of gyms

doug stensland can t always trust that the semi trucks filled with the supplies he needs to run his family dairy farm and processing plant in larchwood will show up on time after one truck carrying milk jugs arrived a little late stensland said he shifted how he runs his operations after that it was like boy we have to keep everything ordered way ahead stensland said we used to be able to order and keep a real lean inventory but now we ve gotten to a point where we have to stock up a lot of inventory just to make sure we don t order it and it s not available nationwide supply chain disruptions have impacted businesses across the country and iowa s dairy industry is no exception transportation and logistics issues have touched all levels of dairy production from local farmers to large dairy exporters in most cases agriculture economist for iowa state university chad hart said supply isn t the major issue the problem is connecting the supply to the demand and the chain link between many products has been disrupted if the feed additive is in china but the need for it is here in an iowa dairy herd then that doesn t help you unless you can deliver it where it s needed hart said on the local level farmers are facing obstacles in receiving the tools they need to continue business at milk unlimited dairy a farm in atlantic with 34 000 cows owner christy cunningham said the first shortage she noticed was in personal protection equipment used for milking cows at the start of the pandemic not only were we not able to get them but when we were the inflation of the price was enough to make you take notice cunningham said now equipment like dry tubes ear tags feed additives and packaging for milk products are more difficult to stock and require a lot more planning between shortages and rising prices stensland said the last two years have been very hard for his business everything s gone up stensland said it s cut into profits there s no doubt about it it s just a matter of how far we can be able to grab that back our sales are tough anyway right now it s kind of a hard balancing act labor shortages waldemar brandt unsplash local iowa dairy farmers are facing higher prices and fewer hands to help with work cunningham usually employs around 30 to 35 people on her farm but right now she s about three to four employees short that s after giving two rounds of raises just this year milking cows probably isn t the sexiest of jobs out there cunningham said iowa state university dairy specialist fred hall said labor has become one of the largest issues for dairy farmers around the state many farmers are competing with higher wages at manufacturing jobs at places like tyson foods or seaboard triumph foods you don t want to lose an employee because it costs too much to train folks hall said there s only so much farmers can do to increase wages before it costs more to produce than what they re getting out of the business it s cut into profits there s no doubt about it it s just a matter of how far we can be able to grab that back doug stensland at stensland family farms workers wages have increased throughout the year to keep employees from leaving for jobs at nearby manufacturing plants in sioux county lyon county and sioux falls so far it s been a successful tactic for keeping employees on the farm but he s not sure he can continue to raise wages and keep them competitive we had our labor budget figured out back in 2020 and now we ve just blown that out of the water stensland said it took us a lot of dollars to make sure we kept our people moving products overseas supply chain disruptions have also affected how much dairy can move overseas exporting milk products is becoming a bigger challenge for large dairy processors in the dairy industry shipping containers are in high demand and in short supply hart said the perishable nature of the products puts them in a tough position they often tend to have a fairly short shelf life meaning we can t wait for months to get a shipping container in order to ship a container full of yogurt you need to move that in days hart said even when dairy exporters can book a shipping container oftentimes the containers may be too far to help move products that need to be moved quickly blocked ports and a shortage of truck drivers to haul products all impact the amount of product the dairy industry is able to move the national federation of milk producers estimated a nearly 1 million loss due to shipping disruptions in the first six months of the year executive director of iowa state dairy association mitch schulte said the iowa dairy industry has felt this loss he said transportation concerns have resulted in a loss of opportunity for many state dairy producers anything that impacts our export market impacts the price on our dairy farms even one container being delayed is an issue let alone more than that schulte said

its car development plans the tech giant is exploring a fully self driving electric car and a vehicle with fewer self driving capabilities however its main focus is the complete self driving option the four year time frame is fast tracked from its original estimate of six years to meet this goal it will need to ensure its technology is completed in time even tesla hasn t fully developed its fully autonomous vehicle to go public we continue to believe it s a matter of when not if apple enters the ev race wedbush analyst dan ives wrote after bloomberg s report about apple came out ives sees a 60 to 65 chance that apple puts out its own standalone car by 2025 and it is likely to be in partnership we would rather see apple partner on the ev path than start building its own vehicles

holiday deadline director of benham and reeves marc von grundherr commented these latest figures certainly show the last of the stamp duty sizzle as homebuyers made a final push to secure a saving ahead of the extended deadline for almost every region of the uk to see annual growth hit double figures is quite remarkable and this uplift is being driven as much by first time buyers as it is existing homeowners this phenomenal rate of growth is likely to slow over the coming months not only in the wake of the stamp duty holiday but as the usual festive lethargy starts to build and many home buyers and sellers now look beyond the christmas period with a view to moving managing director of barrows and forrester james forrester commented there s no denying the huge impact of the stamp duty holiday on house prices and it s only natural that this may start to subside slightly now the final curtain has fallen however any predictions of a market crash are unlikely to come to fruition as the market remains in very good health we re still seeing buyers enter the market at mass and with such high demand for limited stock sellers are continuing to achieve a very good price for their property head of corporate partnerships at sirius property finance kimberley gates said to date the bank of england have refrained from an increase in the base rate of interest and while this may materialise in a month s time the likelihood is that interest rates will remain close to historic lows for the majority of 2022 if not longer this means that while the cost of borrowing may start to climb marginally and slow the huge rates of house price growth seen in recent months it s unlikely to spook the market and deter homebuyers from transacting altogether we re yet to see any notable knee jerk reactions from lenders in anticipation and there remains a wide range of products available for those considering a purchase as always the recommended approach is to put your best foot forward in the form of a sizable mortgage deposit understand what additional fees you may incur and refrain from over borrowing to ensure you can easily stomach any increase in monthly repayments

jinping have discussed jointly releasing strategic reserves to increase supply and lower prices brent crude fell below 80 barrel for the first time since october 1 joshua mahony senior market analyst at ig a global leader in online trading commented crude oil has suffered sharp losses over the past 24 hours with biden s calls for a release of strategic reserves overshadowing the decline in us stockpiles announced yesterday while biden has had little success in attempting to force opec members into raising production to drive down energy prices his latest ploy to push for a multilateral release of strategic reserves appears to have found support in china a simultaneous release of stocks from both the us and china certainly brings some short term relief given today s declines but there remains plenty of questions over whether the lack of new investment will ultimately lead to a long standing supply deficit that pushes up energy prices for years to come

shoppers to acceptable alternatives we anticipate there will be more than 60 b in revenue captured by those with strong inventory allocations with other retailers likely facing bloated inventories post holiday as stocks continue to flow steve vielmetti managing director at creo advisors states retailers and manufacturers who have taken more risk with advanced builds or have more nimble supply chains in guiding the consumer to acceptable alternatives or reacting faster to reposition orders or stock will win this season steve adds beyond the holiday companies must move toward a smart supply chain defined by properly positioned partners and assets along with the adoption of advanced planning tools which leverage data such as web inquiries mobility and other external signals to drive real time execution and agility shopping experience our survey shows that over 85 of consumers plan to go into stores for some part of their shopping journey this holiday but they are rather tepid about the experience senior associate owen clark says consumers anticipate in store experiences to be a 4 5 out of 10 this holiday retailers who can elevate consumer experience to beat these low expectations will see greater success in converting sales additionally the store environment has become more complex over time with bopis curbside covid protocols and numerous other factors winning the season while many decisions have already been made merchants still have an opportunity to drive results for the remaining 75 of holiday sales optimizing digital algorithms placing traditional advertising driving consumer engagement and loyalty ensuring adequate store labor and positioning available inventory strategically will help drive stronger top and bottom line results this season such actions are enabled by nimble leadership organizational coordination agility and analytics given the combination of strong consumer demand and widespread inventory and staffing challenges

washington reuters the number of americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell close to pre pandemic levels last week as the labor market recovery continues though a shortage of workers remains an obstacle to faster job growth the weekly unemployment claims report from the labor department on thursday the most timely data on the economy s health also showed jobless benefits rolls declining to a 20 month low in early november the economy is regaining momentum following a lull over the summer as a wave of covid 19 infections driven by the delta variant battered the nation demand for labor is very strong and workers are in short supply so layoffs are very low right now said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial in pittsburgh pennsylvania initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1 000 to a seasonally adjusted 268 000 for the week ended nov 13 that was the lowest level since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the united states more than 20 months ago economists polled by reuters had forecast 260 000 applications in the latest week the smaller decline was because the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data was less generous last week unadjusted claims dropped 18 183 to 238 850 the decrease was led by kentucky likely due to automobile workers returning to factories after temporary layoffs as motor vehicle manufacturers deal with a global semiconductor shortage there were also big declines in michigan tennessee and ohio states that also have a strong presence of auto manufacturers the decreases offset a surge in filings in california the seventh straight weekly decline left claims just above the 256 000 level in mid march 2020 and in a range that is associated with a healthy labor market claims have declined from a record high of 6 149 million in early april 2020 jobless claims the improving economic tone was matched by other data from the philadelphia federal reserve on thursday showing an acceleration in manufacturing activity in the mid atlantic region this month factories in the region that covers eastern pennsylvania southern new jersey and delaware reported strong order growth they were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months and anticipated maintaining a strong pace of capital expenditures in 2022 but labor and raw material shortages persisted leading to a rapid piling up of unfinished work even as manufacturers increased hours for workers factories continued to face higher prices for inputs which they passed on to consumers we look for voracious goods demand and a plethora of unfilled orders to keep factories pumping out goods at a very healthy pace said oren klachkin lead u s economist at oxford economics in new york we also expect that businesses will continue to face major supply chain problems next year though headwinds should start to ease in the second half of 2022 stocks on wall street were lower the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies u s treasury yields dipped philly fed tight labor market the reports added to a surge in retail sales in october and a sharp rebound in production at factories in suggesting that economic activity accelerated early in the fourth quarter after gross domestic product increased at its slowest pace in more than a year in the july september period stronger growth could spill over into 2022 with a third report from the conference board showing its index of leading economic indicators jumped 0 9 in october after gaining 0 1 in september leading indicators the labor market is getting tighter the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 129 000 to 2 080 million in the week ended nov 6 the claims report showed that was also the lowest level since the mid march in 2020 a total 3 185 million people were collecting unemployment checks under all programs during the week ended oct 30 shrinking unemployment rolls raise hopes that more people will return to the labor force soon millions of unemployed americans remain at home even after the expiration of generous federal government funded benefits the reopening of schools for in person learning and companies raising wages the claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of november s employment report claims have dropped since mid october which would suggest stronger employment growth this month but workers are scarce with 10 4 million job openings as of the end of september there is some uncertainty as a key to monthly job growth is labor supply and the delta variant said ryan sweet a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania the good news is that the delta variant s impact on the labor market in november will be less than that seen during the teeth of the recent wave the economy created 531 000 jobs in october employment growth has averaged 582 000 jobs per month this year and the labor force is down 3 million from its pre pandemic level reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci by lucia mutikani

u s district court for the southern district of new york against peloton interactive inc peloton or the company and certain of its senior executives collectively defendants on behalf of investors in peloton common stock between december 9 2020 and november 4 2021 inclusive the class period blb g filed this action on behalf of its client city of hialeah employees retirement system and the case is captioned city of hialeah employees retirement system v peloton interactive inc no 1 21 cv 9582 s d n y the complaint is based on an extensive investigation and a careful evaluation of the merits of this case a copy of the complaint is available on blb g s website by clicking here peloton s alleged fraud headquartered in new york new york peloton offers interactive internet connected exercise equipment including bicycles and treadmills designed and marketed for use in customers homes along with subscriptions that allow users to access exercise classes while using their peloton equipment or with their own home equipment for most of 2020 and 2021 as the covid 19 pandemic and related stay at home orders and business closures largely kept individuals out of the gym the demand for in home exercise options increased dramatically against that backdrop in the months leading up to the class period peloton experienced unprecedented demand for its products and services the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants repeatedly falsely assured investors that the company s positive results and growth would continue after the pandemic in addition during the class period defendants made false and misleading statements about the amount of inventory that peloton held and touted the company s ability to keep its inventory levels in line with substantial sustained demand as a result of defendants misrepresentations peloton common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the class period the truth about the plummeting demand for peloton s products was revealed through two disclosures first after the market closed on august 26 2021 the company disclosed that it had identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting with respect to identification and valuation of inventory in its annual report filed with the sec on form 10 k on august 27 peloton explained that this material weakness arose because our controls were not effectively designed documented and maintained to verify that our physical inventory counts were correctly counted and communicated for reporting in our financial statements however at the same time that peloton disclosed the weakness in its internal controls defendants continued to misrepresent and conceal the unsustainable nature of peloton s financial results and growth post covid issuing guidance of 5 4 billion of total revenue for fiscal year 2022 representing 34 year over year growth then on november 4 2021 the company announced second quarter financial results that fell far short of expectations and reduced its total revenue guidance for fiscal 2022 by a staggering 1 billion peloton further disclosed that inventory had skyrocketed to 1 27 billion 91 of which comprised finished products that the company still held on peloton s november 4 earnings conference call with investors defendants admitted that peloton overestimated demand and underestimated the impact of gyms

the ev revolution is well and truly underway and the sector continues setting new records a recent report by the korea automotive technology institute kaii shows that global ev sales exceeded 3 million units in the first three quarters of 2021 a run rate that puts it on course to break 4 million units a year for the first time ever bloombergnef is even more sanguine and expects global sales of electric passenger vehicles this year to clock in at 5 6 million units good for an impressive 8 of new vehicle sales china remains by far the biggest buyer of electric vehicles with 1 76 million units sold in the country during the period the united states comes in a distant second with 272 554 units followed by germany 243 892 units uk 131 832 units france 114 836 units and norway 84 428 units ev sales accounted for 9 4 of new vehicle sales in china but just 2 3 in the usa on a company basis tesla inc nasdaq tsla remains the most popular model after moving 625 624 units china s saic motor sold 413 037 units volkswagen 287 852 units and china s byd corp nyse byd with 189 751 units back in october tesla reported that it delivered 241 300 electric vehicles during the third quarter of 2021 more than 70 higher than last year s deliveries for the same period and significantly better than the 220 900 deliveries predicted by wall street sales figures for the fourth quarter are already looking great with xpeng inc nyse xpev and byd co nyse byd reporting that october sales tripled vs a year earlier while li auto nasdaq li has reported that sales have doubled while these are very impressive numbers by any yardstick investing in ev stocks is anything but simple or straightforward to wit those rosy growth numbers have not stopped a cross section of wall street from raising serious concerns about the stratospheric valuations in the space according to bernstein analysts the 15 largest ice manufacturers command a collective market cap of 1 2t compared to the 1 1t collective valuation of pure play ev vendors despite the fact that the former sell 99 of all new vehicles globally while the latter manage a minuscule 1 and that could prove problematic for ev stocks steep valuations bernstein s tony sacconaghi makes a pretty succinct point about how the market values evs versus traditional ice makers the thinking of course is that pure play ev vendors will ultimately come to dominate the automotive world in 2014 they accounted for 15 of all bevs sold today they account for 28 however even if they ultimately were to account for 50 of all evs sold by 2030 which may be aggressive it remains difficult to justify their current valuations bernstein is worried that the market is assuming that traditional oems will not be able to deliver competitive ev offerings in the future or they will be very delayed in doing so further the market appears to think that ev upstarts will be able to generate significantly more profit per car mainly by taking advantage of better distribution and autonomy add on services the analyst points out that this assumption is not entirely without merit since full autonomous driving priced at 10k per car would radically change the margin and valuation profile of the industry but sacconaghi begs to differ with the assumption that pure evs like tesla will always maintain a huge operational advantage over their late to the party ice rivals that said our contention is that the automotive industry is an increasingly global and hypercompetitive industry and we believe that surplus profits and technology innovation will likely be competed away over time as has been the case historically further ev companies remain vulnerable to short term headwinds including valuation concerns and supply chain bottlenecks with newer pure play ev upstarts such as fisker nyse fsr faraday future intelligent nasdaq ffie lordstown motors nasdaq ride nikola nasdaq nkla lucid motors nasdaq lcid nio nyse nio xpeng nyse xpev li auto nasdaq li canoo nasdaq goev and rivian rivn more vulnerable indeed whereas tsla boasts an impressive 54 3 ytd return many ev startups are struggling ffie 15 6 ride 74 5 nkla 12 3 xpev 12 8 li 11 6 goev 21 7 and wkhs 65 7 fisker and lucid motors are outliers in this category with ytd returns of 46 1 and 425 respectively lithium boom investing in the lithium sector appears like a safer way to play the ev boom with the energy transition in full swing wall street experts have predicted that metals that power the clean energy sector such as lithium copper nickel and cobalt are poised to become the oil of the future according to a recent eurasia review analysis prices for the four metals could reach historical peaks for an unprecedented sustained period in a net zero emissions scenario with the total value of production rising more than four fold for the period 2021 2040 and even rivaling the total value of crude oil production in a net zero emissions scenario the metals demand boom could lead to a more than fourfold increase in the value of metals production totaling 13 trillion accumulated over the next two decades for the four metals alone this could rival the estimated value of oil production in a net zero emissions scenario over that same period making the four metals macro relevant for inflation trade and output and providing significant windfalls to commodity producers last year mining com launched the ev battery metals index a tool that tracks the value of lithium cobalt nickel and other battery metals flowing into the global ev industry at any given point in time the index combines two main sets of data prices paid for the mined minerals at the point of entry into the global battery supply chain and the sales weighted volume of the raw materials in electric and hybrid passenger car batteries sold around the world according to an august mining com report the ev metal index clocked in at 2 68 billion by the end of june which in effect means that more ev battery metal business was done in h1 2021 than all of 2020 itself a record year lithium continues to lead the way with average lithium on a per vehicle basis including hybrids was up 30 year over year in june jumping from 14kg to just over 18kg according to benchmark mineral intelligence lithium prices have doubled year to date and now tops 16 500 a tonne hydroxide ex works china mid august jiangxi ganfeng lithium the world s largest lithium mining company with a market capitalization of 19 billion has predicted that lithium prices will continue to rally as lithium production struggles to keep up with massive demand for evs the chinese company has some decent street cred after all it counts leading ev automakers such as tesla inc and bmw otcpk bmwyy among its customers source mining com investors who entered the lithium space a few years ago jumped the gun then partly out of poorly timed over enthusiasm and partly because the logic ran like this any new lithium mines that could contribute to the ev battery onslaught would take years to bring online from scratch so best to get started in advance now with the ev boom squarely in the front view mirror and with battery gigafactories promising to be heavy hitting purchasers we can finally see the much anticipated supply crunch forming battery grade lithium carbonate prices started to buck a three year downturn during the second half of 2020 thanks to robust ev demand roaring back from the coronavirus lithium carbonate prices have gained 91 so far in 2021 that s mainly thanks to the postponement of lithium project expansions in south america due to previous demand forecasts as well as the impact of the pandemic this is expected to slow down the short term supply of the lithium compound and improve pricing according to ganfeng here are some top stocks to play the ongoing lithium and ev boom 1 albemarle corp market cap 32 3b ytd returns 85 3 albemarle corporation nyse alb is

in manti holdings the delaware supreme court affirmed a decision that a corporation can enforce an advance waiver of appraisal rights against its stockholders in a stockholders agreement the petitioners agreed to refrain from the exercise of appraisal rights the delaware supreme court concluded that both the delaware general corporation law dgcl and public policy permitted an ex ante waiver of appraisal rights in a stockholder agreement specifically as opposed to in a company s charter or bylaws finding that the dgcl is a broad enabling act that allows immense freedom for businesses to adopt the most appropriate terms for their enterprise the court also found that the agreement the petitioners signed did in fact waive their appraisal rights even though the language did not use the word waive one justice dissented concluding that appraisal rights cannot be waived generally and that the specific agreement here was not a valid waiver in 2008 authentix inc entered into a transaction pursuant to which it became a wholly owned subsidiary of authentix company inc as part of that transaction all stockholders including the petitioners entered into a stockholders agreement the stockholders agreement one provision of the stockholders agreement provided that the stockholders would refrain from the exercise of appraisal rights the refrain obligation in 2017 authentix merged with a third party entity the merger in connection with the merger the petitioners stock was cancelled and converted into a right to receive merger consideration pursuant to a waterfall provision based on the application of the waterfall provision however the petitioners received little to no compensation as a result the petitioners sent appraisal demands to authentix and subsequently filed a petition for appraisal against authentix the petition the court of chancery granted authentix s partial motion for summary judgment finding that the petitioners waived their appraisal rights under the stockholders agreement the petitioners sought reargument which was denied and the court of chancery then issued a final decision to address fee shifting issues both sides subsequently appealed to the delaware supreme court on appeal the delaware supreme court affirmed the lower court s opinion in its entirety first the delaware supreme court agreed that the petitioners had waived their appraisal rights the court rejected the petitioners arguments that 1 the refrain obligation was not triggered because the petitioners common stock was being treated differently from certain preferred stock 2 the termination provision in the stockholders agreement extinguished all provisions including the refrain obligation and 3 authentix could not enforce the stockholders agreement because it was not an intended beneficiary the court also found that the use of the word refrain did not undermine the validity of the waiver because refrain made sense in the context of the stockholders agreement generally and the refrain obligation specifically second the delaware supreme court found neither the dgcl nor public policy prohibited a corporation s enforcement of a waiver of appraisal rights against its own stockholders the court considered several arguments notably the court rejected the petitioners argument that a waiver of appraisal rights if any had to be in the corporation s certificate of incorporation per dgcl 151 a because it was a limitation or restriction on stock the court found instead that the refrain obligation was not a restriction on stock but a personal obligation to which the petitioners agreed the court did not address here the additional question of whether an ex ante waiver in a charter or bylaws also would operate as a waiver the delaware supreme court also rejected the argument that section 262 a s use of shall prevents appraisal rights from being waived finding instead that even mandatory rights can be waived by agreement under delaware law third the delaware supreme court agreed that the petitioners had an equitable interest in the merger consideration and that authentix was not entitled to pre judgment interest on an award of attorneys fees one justice dissented finding that the refrain obligation was ambiguous because it used refrain rather than waive that such a waiver should occur in a certificate of incorporation or bylaws if at all and that mandatory rights like appraisal should not be subject to waiver

attending her first parliamentary session since returning from her visit to the uk for the un climate change conference incorporating a short bilateral to france prime minister sheikh hasina claimed bangladesh is capable of producing the covid 19 vaccine and exporting the jabs to other countries provided it gets the go ahead she said this while participating in a discussion on a resolution to thank unesco for introducing the unesco bangladesh bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman international prize for the creative economy the prime minister said during her recent tour of the uk and france she told the world leaders that bangladesh wants to manufacture coronavirus vaccines and to allow the country to do so i told them to remove all barriers to produce coronavirus vaccine in bangladesh this the vaccine is the right of the people of the whole world and it should be declared as a global public good hasina said she mentioned that if bangladesh gets the chance it would produce the vaccine as it has that capability and the government has already allotted a piece of land for the purpose of an international vaccine institute we can also supply vaccines to the world she said adding that bangladesh got global recognition for its success in tackling the covid 19 pandemic she also said government to government negotiations on transferring technology were underway with countries that had developed vaccines hasina said the capacity of three companies incepta pharmaceuticals popular pharmaceuticals and healthcare pharmaceuticals to produce covid 19 vaccines had already been assessed while globe biotech was working on such vaccines too she mentioned the vaccine developed by globe biotech was now at the trial stage the prime minister s statement was probably buoyed by news that broke the previous week that a slew of bangladeshi pharmaceutical companies led by beximco pharmaceuticals will soon begin selling the world s first generic version of merck s covid 19 pill molnupiravir which has been touted as a potential game changer in the fight against the pandemic beximco pharmaceuticals will first sell the generic version of molnupiravir in bangladesh before considering exports based on global regulatory approvals it said on tuesday november 9 the generic version has received emergency use authorisation from bangladesh s drug regulators generic drugs like beximco s are less expensive versions of brand name pharmaceuticals and help expand access to treatments in poorer countries however none of the companies that have made vaccines for covid 19 till now have allowed any generic versions of their product to be made causing a fierce debate in international circles potential game changer molnupiravir developed by merck and ridgeback biotherapeutics received its first regulatory approval globally in the uk last week it is under regulatory review in the united states and europe we believe generic molnupiravir could play an important role in combating the pandemic especially in low and middle income countries where access to vaccines has been limited beximco managing director nazmul hassan said in a statement the medicine will have a maximum retail price of tk 70 us 0 82 per capsule or tk 2 800 us 33 for a full course a beximco representative said adding it was trying to lower prices the us government is buying 1 7 million courses of molnupiravir at us 700 per course many asian countries have agreements to buy the drug at cheaper prices a number of companies are racing to develop drugs to combat the pandemic beyond vaccines but only a few are developing easily ingestible oral pills molnupiravir has been closely watched since data last month showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of developing severe covid 19 experts hailed the results as a potential breakthrough meanwhile pfizer inc said last week its experimental pill cut by 89 percent the chance of hospitalisation or death for adults at risk of severe covid 19 the news boosted pfizer s share price while plummeting merck s the beximco representative said the company does not have an agreement with merck but can sell generic molnupiravir under a world trade organization waiver of intellectual property rules for covid 19 drugs in developing countries beximco cannot export to most western countries as the waiver only allows it to sell generics to less economically developed countries that do not have a patent protection scheme the spokesperson said merck has licensing agreements with at least eight indian drugmakers for molnupiravir aiming to turn the south asian nation into a manufacturing hub for the drug to supply low and middle income nations it also has a licensing deal with the united nations backed medicines patent pool to allow more companies to make generic molnupiravir beximco said it does not expect sales of generic molnupiravir to significantly boost revenues given currently low covid 19 infections in bangladesh the treatment which is based on a molecule first studied at emory university as a treatment for influenza targets an enzyme that the coronavirus uses to make copies of itself introducing errors into its genetic code by doing so molnupiravir prevents the virus from replicating so keeping the viral load low in the body and reducing the severity of the disease merck said that approach should make the treatment equally effective against new variants of the virus as it evolves in the future bangladeshi firms got the formulation for molnupiravir from the medicines patent pool a united nations backed non profit that works to make medical treatment and technologies globally accessible following concerns that poor countries could be shut out of access to the medicine much as they have been for vaccines in october merck ridgeback biotherapeutics and emory university granted a royalty free licence for the pill to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool has deep experience in working with a network of global drugmakers that can meet high quality standards including those required for the world health organization prequalification the deal allows the drug to be made and sold cheaply in around a hundred developing nations with no fee required from the sublicensing company this week pfizer inc signed a deal with the medicines patent pool to allow other manufacturers to make its experimental covid 19 pill a move that could make the treatment available to more than half of the world s population in a statement pfizer said it would grant a license for the antiviral pill to the geneva based medicines patent pool which would let generic drug companies produce the pill for use in 95 countries making up about 53 of the world s population the deal excludes some large countries that have suffered devastating coronavirus outbreaks for example while a brazilian drug company could get a license to make the pill for export to other countries the medicine could not be made generically for use in brazil still health officials said the fact that the deal was struck could help to end the pandemic quicker it s quite significant that we will be able to provide access to a drug that appears to be effective and has just been developed to more than 4 billion people esteban burrone head of policy at the medicines patent pool said he estimated that other drugmakers would be able to start producing the pill within months but acknowledged the agreement wouldn t please everyone we try to strike a very delicate balance between the interests of the company the sustainability required by generic producers and most importantly the public health needs in lower and middle income countries burrone said under the terms of the agreement pfizer will not receive royalties on sales in low income countries and will waive royalties on sales in all countries covered by the agreement while covid 19 remains a public health emergency earlier this month pfizer said its pill cut the risk of hospitalization and death by nearly 90 in people with mild to moderate coronavirus infections independent experts recommended halting the company s study based on its promising results pfizer has asked the u s food and drug administration to authorise the pill since the pandemic erupted last year researchers worldwide have raced to develop a pill to treat covid 19 that can be taken at home easily to ease symptoms speed recovery and keep people out of the hospital at the moment most covid 19 treatments must be delivered intravenously or by injection britain authorised merck s covid 19 pill earlier this month and it is pending approval elsewhere in a similar deal with the medicines patent pool announced in october merck agreed to let other drugmakers make its covid 19 pill molnupiravir available in 105 poorer countries doctors without borders said it was disheartened that the pfizer deal does not make the drug available to the entire world noting that the agreement announced tuesday nov 16 also excludes countries including china argentina and thailand the world knows by now that access to covid 19 medical tools needs to be guaranteed for everyone everywhere if we really want to control this pandemic said yuanqiong hu a senior legal policy adviser at doctors without borders the decisions by pfizer and merck to share their covid 19 drug patents stands in stark contrast to the refusal of pfizer and other vaccine makers to release their vaccine recipes for wider production a hub set up by the world health organization in south africa intended to share messenger rna vaccine recipes and technologies has not enticed a single pharmaceutical to join fewer than 1 of pfizer s covid 19 vaccine shots have gone to poorer countries robbie silverman of oxfam america welcomed pfizer s agreement to let other makers produce its covid antiviral but he noted that billions would still be left without access including to the company s vaccine this move also begs the important question if pfizer can share data and intellectual property on a medicine why have they so far categorically refused to do so for their covid vaccine silverman said raking in the profits the u s government will pay drugmaker pfizer 5 29 billion for 10 million treatment courses of its potential covid 19 treatment if regulators authorize it the nation s largest purchase agreement yet for a coronavirus therapy pfizer asked the food and drug administration to authorize emergency use of the experimental pill which has been shown to significantly cut the rate of hospitalisations and deaths among people with coronavirus infections the fda is already reviewing a competing pill from merck and will hold a public meeting on it later this month the price for pfizer s potential treatment amounts to about 529 per course the u s has already agreed to pay roughly 700 per course of merck s drug for about 3 1 million treatments in bangladesh the directorate general of health services dghs has given the approval to use molnupiravir or its generic versions for treating covid 19 dghs gave the approval after directorate general of drug administration dgda authorised the manufacture of the oral medicine bangladesh this week became the second country in the world to approve the potentially game changing covid 19 antiviral pill while britain became the first last week the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency of the uk recommended that the drug which will be branded lagevrio be used as soon as possible following a positive covid 19 test and within five days of the onset of symptoms uk health secretary sajid javid said the treatment had raised hopes for the frail and immunosuppressed media reports said the uk had agreed to purchase 480 000 courses with the first deliveries expected in november it was the first oral antiviral treatment for covid 19 to get approved with the green light coming ahead of potential us regulatory clearance us advisers will meet this month to vote on whether molnupiravir should be authorised an oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game changing said amesh adalja senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security in comments to the associated press in bangladesh dghs stated patients who test positive for covid 19 showing mild to moderate symptoms will be able to use the medicine for treatment the notice signed by dghs director hospital and clinics dr farid hossain mia warned that the medicine cannot be used on patients who are showing severe symptoms of covid 19 the medicine should not be administered to patients who are over 60 have diabetes high blood pressure cardiovascular disease or other comorbidity the notice further clarified according to dgda director general major general mahbubur rahman the drug will help to reduce hospitalisation and mortality rates by at least 50 the pandemic helped the bangladesh pharmaceuticals industry achieve a staggering 18 56 growth in the 2020 21 fiscal year the annual growth of the pharmaceutical industry

institute of india sii the world s biggest vaccine maker according to the agreement beximco pharmaceuticals would be the sole distributor of the vaccine responsible for supplying the doses in

attending her first parliamentary session since returning from her visit to the uk for the un climate change conference incorporating a short bilateral to france prime minister sheikh hasina claimed bangladesh is capable of producing the covid 19 vaccine and exporting the jabs to other countries provided it gets the go ahead she said this while participating in a discussion on a resolution to thank unesco for introducing the unesco bangladesh bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman international prize for the creative economy the prime minister said during her recent tour of the uk and france she told the world leaders that bangladesh wants to manufacture coronavirus vaccines and to allow the country to do so i told them to remove all barriers to produce coronavirus vaccine in bangladesh this the vaccine is the right of the people of the whole world and it should be declared as a global public good hasina said she mentioned that if bangladesh gets the chance it would produce the vaccine as it has that capability and the government has already allotted a piece of land for the purpose of an international vaccine institute we can also supply vaccines to the world she said adding that bangladesh got global recognition for its success in tackling the covid 19 pandemic she also said government to government negotiations on transferring technology were underway with countries that had developed vaccines hasina said the capacity of three companies incepta pharmaceuticals popular pharmaceuticals and healthcare pharmaceuticals to produce covid 19 vaccines had already been assessed while globe biotech was working on such vaccines too she mentioned the vaccine developed by globe biotech was now at the trial stage the prime minister s statement was probably buoyed by news that broke the previous week that a slew of bangladeshi pharmaceutical companies led by beximco pharmaceuticals will soon begin selling the world s first generic version of merck s covid 19 pill molnupiravir which has been touted as a potential game changer in the fight against the pandemic beximco pharmaceuticals will first sell the generic version of molnupiravir in bangladesh before considering exports based on global regulatory approvals it said on tuesday november 9 the generic version has received emergency use authorisation from bangladesh s drug regulators generic drugs like beximco s are less expensive versions of brand name pharmaceuticals and help expand access to treatments in poorer countries however none of the companies that have made vaccines for covid 19 till now have allowed any generic versions of their product to be made causing a fierce debate in international circles potential game changer molnupiravir developed by merck and ridgeback biotherapeutics received its first regulatory approval globally in the uk last week it is under regulatory review in the united states and europe we believe generic molnupiravir could play an important role in combating the pandemic especially in low and middle income countries where access to vaccines has been limited beximco managing director nazmul hassan said in a statement the medicine will have a maximum retail price of tk 70 us 0 82 per capsule or tk 2 800 us 33 for a full course a beximco representative said adding it was trying to lower prices the us government is buying 1 7 million courses of molnupiravir at us 700 per course many asian countries have agreements to buy the drug at cheaper prices a number of companies are racing to develop drugs to combat the pandemic beyond vaccines but only a few are developing easily ingestible oral pills molnupiravir has been closely watched since data last month showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of developing severe covid 19 experts hailed the results as a potential breakthrough meanwhile pfizer inc said last week its experimental pill cut by 89 percent the chance of hospitalisation or death for adults at risk of severe covid 19 the news boosted pfizer s share price while plummeting merck s the beximco representative said the company does not have an agreement with merck but can sell generic molnupiravir under a world trade organization waiver of intellectual property rules for covid 19 drugs in developing countries beximco cannot export to most western countries as the waiver only allows it to sell generics to less economically developed countries that do not have a patent protection scheme the spokesperson said merck has licensing agreements with at least eight indian drugmakers for molnupiravir aiming to turn the south asian nation into a manufacturing hub for the drug to supply low and middle income nations it also has a licensing deal with the united nations backed medicines patent pool to allow more companies to make generic molnupiravir beximco said it does not expect sales of generic molnupiravir to significantly boost revenues given currently low covid 19 infections in bangladesh the treatment which is based on a molecule first studied at emory university as a treatment for influenza targets an enzyme that the coronavirus uses to make copies of itself introducing errors into its genetic code by doing so molnupiravir prevents the virus from replicating so keeping the viral load low in the body and reducing the severity of the disease merck said that approach should make the treatment equally effective against new variants of the virus as it evolves in the future bangladeshi firms got the formulation for molnupiravir from the medicines patent pool a united nations backed non profit that works to make medical treatment and technologies globally accessible following concerns that poor countries could be shut out of access to the medicine much as they have been for vaccines in october merck ridgeback biotherapeutics and emory university granted a royalty free licence for the pill to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool has deep experience in working with a network of global drugmakers that can meet high quality standards including those required for the world health organization prequalification the deal allows the drug to be made and sold cheaply in around a hundred developing nations with no fee required from the sublicensing company this week pfizer inc signed a deal with the medicines patent pool to allow other manufacturers to make its experimental covid 19 pill a move that could make the treatment available to more than half of the world s population in a statement pfizer said it would grant a license for the antiviral pill to the geneva based medicines patent pool which would let generic drug companies produce the pill for use in 95 countries making up about 53 of the world s population the deal excludes some large countries that have suffered devastating coronavirus outbreaks for example while a brazilian drug company could get a license to make the pill for export to other countries the medicine could not be made generically for use in brazil still health officials said the fact that the deal was struck could help to end the pandemic quicker it s quite significant that we will be able to provide access to a drug that appears to be effective and has just been developed to more than 4 billion people esteban burrone head of policy at the medicines patent pool said he estimated that other drugmakers would be able to start producing the pill within months but acknowledged the agreement wouldn t please everyone we try to strike a very delicate balance between the interests of the company the sustainability required by generic producers and most importantly the public health needs in lower and middle income countries burrone said under the terms of the agreement pfizer will not receive royalties on sales in low income countries and will waive royalties on sales in all countries covered by the agreement while covid 19 remains a public health emergency earlier this month pfizer said its pill cut the risk of hospitalization and death by nearly 90 in people with mild to moderate coronavirus infections independent experts recommended halting the company s study based on its promising results pfizer has asked the u s food and drug administration to authorise the pill since the pandemic erupted last year researchers worldwide have raced to develop a pill to treat covid 19 that can be taken at home easily to ease symptoms speed recovery and keep people out of the hospital at the moment most covid 19 treatments must be delivered intravenously or by injection britain authorised merck s covid 19 pill earlier this month and it is pending approval elsewhere in a similar deal with the medicines patent pool announced in october merck agreed to let other drugmakers make its covid 19 pill molnupiravir available in 105 poorer countries doctors without borders said it was disheartened that the pfizer deal does not make the drug available to the entire world noting that the agreement announced tuesday nov 16 also excludes countries including china argentina and thailand the world knows by now that access to covid 19 medical tools needs to be guaranteed for everyone everywhere if we really want to control this pandemic said yuanqiong hu a senior legal policy adviser at doctors without borders the decisions by pfizer and merck to share their covid 19 drug patents stands in stark contrast to the refusal of pfizer and other vaccine makers to release their vaccine recipes for wider production a hub set up by the world health organization in south africa intended to share messenger rna vaccine recipes and technologies has not enticed a single pharmaceutical to join fewer than 1 of pfizer s covid 19 vaccine shots have gone to poorer countries robbie silverman of oxfam america welcomed pfizer s agreement to let other makers produce its covid antiviral but he noted that billions would still be left without access including to the company s vaccine this move also begs the important question if pfizer can share data and intellectual property on a medicine why have they so far categorically refused to do so for their covid vaccine silverman said raking in the profits the u s government will pay drugmaker pfizer 5 29 billion for 10 million treatment courses of its potential covid 19 treatment if regulators authorize it the nation s largest purchase agreement yet for a coronavirus therapy pfizer asked the food and drug administration to authorize emergency use of the experimental pill which has been shown to significantly cut the rate of hospitalisations and deaths among people with coronavirus infections the fda is already reviewing a competing pill from merck and will hold a public meeting on it later this month the price for pfizer s potential treatment amounts to about 529 per course the u s has already agreed to pay roughly 700 per course of merck s drug for about 3 1 million treatments in bangladesh the directorate general of health services dghs has given the approval to use molnupiravir or its generic versions for treating covid 19 dghs gave the approval after directorate general of drug administration dgda authorised the manufacture of the oral medicine bangladesh this week became the second country in the world to approve the potentially game changing covid 19 antiviral pill while britain became the first last week the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency of the uk recommended that the drug which will be branded lagevrio be used as soon as possible following a positive covid 19 test and within five days of the onset of symptoms uk health secretary sajid javid said the treatment had raised hopes for the frail and immunosuppressed media reports said the uk had agreed to purchase 480 000 courses with the first deliveries expected in november it was the first oral antiviral treatment for covid 19 to get approved with the green light coming ahead of potential us regulatory clearance us advisers will meet this month to vote on whether molnupiravir should be authorised an oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game changing said amesh adalja senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security in comments to the associated press in bangladesh dghs stated patients who test positive for covid 19 showing mild to moderate symptoms will be able to use the medicine for treatment the notice signed by dghs director hospital and clinics dr farid hossain mia warned that the medicine cannot be used on patients who are showing severe symptoms of covid 19 the medicine should not be administered to patients who are over 60 have diabetes high blood pressure cardiovascular disease or other comorbidity the notice further clarified according to dgda director general major general mahbubur rahman the drug will help to reduce hospitalisation and mortality rates by at least 50 the pandemic helped the bangladesh pharmaceuticals industry achieve a staggering 18 56 growth in the 2020 21 fiscal year the annual growth of the pharmaceutical industry may go as high as 15 16 this decade which has been 12 1 for the last five years beximco pharmaceuticals square pharmaceuticals and renata have raked in more than tk500 crore profit among the dozens of companies listed on the country s stock market during the pandemic these companies all reported a sharp rise in profits beximco pharmaceuticals profit grew by 46 in fy21 its consolidated earnings per share eps stood at tk11 49 which was tk7 88 in the previous fiscal year officials at the company said profit increased from its organic growth of business and part of this is attributable to the income from vaccine distribution and increased cash incentive from exports in november 2020 bangladesh signed an agreement to buy 30 million doses of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine from the serum institute of india sii the world s biggest vaccine maker according to the agreement beximco pharmaceuticals would be the sole distributor of the vaccine responsible for supplying the doses in bangladesh some 7 million doses were supplied before india banned exports of the vaccine in the face of a lethal second wave of the virus earlier this year square pharmaceuticals the industry leader posted a 19 increase in profit in fy21 and its eps rose to tk17 99 from tk15 07 in the previous year it said in an annual declaration the growth is in its core business the sales of pharmaceutical

together with the aspiration and talents of local entrepreneurs has created an over tk27 000 crore pharmaceutical industry in bangladesh which is meeting almost the entire domestic demand alongside exporting to over 100 countries in a research report on the outlook for the pharmaceutical industry over the next decade ucb asset management recently said the industry would reach the milestone of tk 1 lakh crore valuation mainly riding on the growing local market demand alongside a local market boom the country s pharmaceutical sector is expected to rake in over 1 5 billion or around tk13 000

menafn zex pr wire singapore 18th nov 2021 zexprwire during its peak cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for gpus graphics processing units gpu manufacturers showed impressive financial results in terms of stocks and shares finest trading over a decade however this race for crypto mining finished rapidly regardless of the increased demand for gpus it is because of increased difficulty in mining top cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin yet cryptocurrency mining can still be lucrative hence what is crypto mining filecoin investment filecoin v s btc mining and how one can get started the article will help you with all these confusions what is crypto mining it is often a misunderstanding that crypto mining is a mode of generating new coins it also includes validating cryptocurrency transactions over a blockchain network while adding them to a distributed ledger most prominently crypto mining makes it preventable for the digital currency to double spend over a distributed network unlike physical currencies digital currencies are easily manipulated because transactions occur on digital platforms therefore they often go through security issues giving miners the added responsibility to secure the network from double spending in the meantime miners get rewards of new coins for securing the network the mining process might get crucial when validating the transactions because of centralized authority issues with distributed ledgers it is why miners earn newly minted coins a proof of work pow consensus protocol has been established to verify the authorized crypto miners responsible for validating and mining transactions also pow s job is to secure the network from external attacks the native cryptocurrencies compensate these miners sometimes these miners are in charge of contributing storage capacity with clients to store their data instead of contributing computational power what is a filecoin filecoin is a decentralized file storage system that opens up vast opportunities for users by leveraging the power of blockchain technology these decentralized file sharing systems have become quite a thing for some time outside of financial applications the filecoin mining system serves as another use case for blockchain technology as the users can bid on available storage presented by miners it is quite profitable as it is not very familiar among the countries like china korea singapore malaysia and japan how to buy filecoin one can purchase filecoin from the following exchanges binance users residing in canada australia the uk singapore and most of the world can purchase filecoin from binance however residents of the usa are restricted to buy fil uphold us residents have one of the top exchanges in the face of uphold they can also claim a debit card which earns crypto and cashback european and uk residents cannot buy fil from uphold bitpanda they forbid other residents except for europe to buy filecoin investing in filecoin simple steps to understand the investing process of filecoin step 1 make an account with a regulated cryptocurrency exchange step 2 use a debit credit card e wallet like paypal or regular bank transfer to fund your account step 3 fill in the amount of filecoin you want to purchase step 4 confirm your selection step 5 withdraw filecoin and store it in a safe crypto wallet till you need to cash out your investment comparison between filecoin and bitcoin mining currently filecoin has refunded some 87 ytd it has become the26th largest crypto coin in the industry now that we know about filecoin we

last february killeen texas and most of north america experienced one of the craziest acts from god we witnessed a snowstorm that left millions frozen in place and took people s electricity out leaving many struggling to keep warm with firewood piles of blankets generators or whatever they had at hand the water froze as well and some people are still fixing up the plumbing in their homes as a proud texan i know as well as you do that we were not prepared for an act of nature that extreme to impact us the cold weather expected overnight tonight and into friday morning won t be anywhere near as severe but it ll be a chilly reminder that winter is on the way and we ve got to make sure we re properly prepared get our free mobile app get our free mobile app getty images istockphoto our partners at kwtx tv report that a freeze warning will go into effect for areas of central texas from midnight tonight through 8am friday morning lows will be in the mid 30 s so if you commute to work early please be careful on the roads and give yourself plenty of time to warm up the car defrost your windows and get to work safely again this won t be a catastrophic blizzard like we experienced earlier this year but it s winter knocking on the door and letting us know she s coming i remember when the ice storm happened and how stressful it was trying to not only keep the house warm but to find clean running water during and after the storm heck many cities ran entirely out of gas i didn t even consider that possibility as i m sure many didn t leonid ikan getty images with colder weather coming and memories of the big freeze still fresh in my mind i can only recommend you stock up on plenty of water and canned goods and grab some fire wood or other safe reliable heating methods in case we see a repeat this winter season we texans don t see massive snowfall very often once the magic wares off and we spend several days freezing our butts off we re completely over it so grab your space heaters and plenty of blankets and make sure you prepare yourself for whatever mother nature has in store for us as the temps start to go down look we loved your central texas snow day pics
as we grow older we embrace more of our past remembering family celebrations from our youth traditions that perhaps we set aside for contemporary convenience for me it s learning and practicing more of the traditions and cultures of my tribe from using its real name isanti dakota instead of santee sioux when i tell someone my history to including traditions and culture one thing i ve done in recent years is to learn more about the foods our ancestors ate on the plains and to incorporate them into meals especially around holidays thanksgiving has always been a difficult holiday for me and native americans in general having been raised by a white mother and then married to white women the holiday has always been part of my life while my mom always had dinner i don t believe we celebrated it in the sense of others takes on it my wives families approached it differently too basically most native americans don t celebrate thanksgiving like non natives it s just another day however families gather some people have a thanksgiving dinner like you see in a norman rockwell painting others mix traditional indigenous dishes with the turkey stuffing and mashed potatoes i thought it d be interesting to include a few native american dishes that would complement the american standards this thanksgiving with a couple of exceptions these dishes are based on foods our ancestors would find or grow dragon_fly shutterstock com 1 roasted vegetables plains tribes such as the lakota and dakota would use root vegetables for dishes taking advantage of the vegetables they d find or raise our grandmothers would clean them cut them up and cook them over a fire some of the root vegetables included beets turnips and squash while there are cooks today who will use these vegetables to create their roasted dishes i favor other root vegetables i prefer using sweet potato which was a popular vegetable in central and south america first as well as beets and brussels sprouts i use a recipe found in the cookbook sioux chef s indigenous kitchen by sean sherman the lakota chef is based in minneapolis and recently opened owamni restaurant which offers traditional native american fare his dishes are based on food found in nature or that would have been used before european relationships so you won t find sugar yeast or any other european influenced ingredients as for the roasted vegetables cook them in the oven for 40 45 minutes meanwhile create a maple dressing using a teaspoon of sunflower oil and maple vinegar and two tablespoons of maple syrup add more if you desire mix then remove the vegetable pan from the oven and brush the maple dressing over the vegetables to create a sweet glaze when finished put the pan back in the oven for about 10 minutes you ll want this dish for every holiday going forward bba photography shutterstock com 2 three sisters succotash stories resonate about the three sisters legend and how they came together to work for the common good however they were in the beginning bickering jealous uncooperative to some and loving and nurturing to others they eventually became the three sisters of corn beans and squash the three crops were planted together because they supported one another s nutrients and growing season today they continue to support each other and provide us with valuable nutrient rich foods such as succotash it s probably the easiest recipe to make if you do it the traditional way and avoid getting fancy with add ons boil two cups of lima beans and two cups of corn in separate pots until they re tender drain and combine them in a pot add half a cup of turkey or vegetable stock and bring to a boil serve as a tasty side dish xuan gdd shutterstock com 3 fried corn my sister in law makes the best fried corn i ve ever tasted i ve tried to replicate it to no avail but to be fair she s cooked it for a long time and i m new to trying it regardless i love fried corn while kernels picked off a cob best for crispy fried corn or cut from it are the best for fried corn frozen or even canned corn can be used though if you take one of these shortcuts you d probably be looked at with scolding eyes from the ancestors coat a large frying pan cast iron preferred with butter or lard then add all the corn stir and put on a simmer while cooking time will vary based on the amount of corn you use it s safe to assume 20 30 minutes stirring often you ll love the taste of fried corn and it may find its way onto the table more often than just holidays photo credit devon mihesuah university of kansas 4 green tomatoes long before miss jessica tandy and miss kathy bates sat down for a plate full of fried green tomatoes the cherokee were making the dish as part of their dining routine a staple in south america the tomato found its way to the southwest united states long before european settlement of turtle island the name given to north america because it resembles a giant turtle eventually finding its way eastward to the cherokee late in harvest season knowing tomatoes didn t have enough time to ripen into their redness cherokee cooks took the green tomatoes and created fried green tomatoes it

be dried like salal berries which would later be used for preserves or added to cooking today creating a dish using berries such as huckleberries raspberries blackberries and strawberries could be a healthy pre dinner snack before a smorgasbord of rather heavy and unhealthy dishes a side dish or even a dessert option though you will want to go euro american and add a scoop of whipped topping i

controversial topic among some native americans it s not an indigenous food to north america frybread came about during early reservation life as government commodities included flour so our grandmothers made the best of a difficult situation seeking ways to make enough food to last until the next delivery or feed others in need of a meal they created the bread it developed a life of its own and is now considered a traditional native american staple popular at social gatherings such as community events ceremonies and powwows you ll often find frybread paired with soup indian tacos are definitely a popular food at gatherings with typical taco ingredients topping the bread but it s good as a side or even with jelly on it how about topping with buffaloberry pudding you can make frybread the traditional way from flour water and other ingredients or you can do it the cheaty way as i like to call it by using frozen bread or dinner rolls if you use frozen dough let it thaw for 5 6 hours when the dough is ready regardless of which you use let it rise for a couple of hours add cooking oil to your pan cast iron skillet preferred take a ball of dough flatten it and then stretch it at the edges working all angles once you have a hand sized piece place it in the hot oil cook it for a few minutes on each side you want a golden crust on each side of the bread once done place the bread on a plate with a paper towel on it to absorb any extra oil serve the frybread with your thanksgiving dinner as you would dinner rolls or any other bread item want more native american

this is the second of a two part series on the contents of the biden administration s build back better program and what montana s two u s senators are saying about it helena montana s democratic u s senator jon tester is supportive of president biden s ambitious social program package known as build back better but says it can t increase the federal debt and that means some tax increases which tester says should fall primarily on the wealthy i m open to anything as long as it doesn t hit medium and low income folks he told mtn news this week i think that applying more taxes to the rich who have so many opportunities out there for tax avoidance is really important but montana s republican u s senator steve daines is strongly opposed to the measure and maintains that while its tax provisions may be targeted at wealthy taxpayers and corporations the impact will be felt by everyone and ultimately hurt the economy mike dennison mtn news u s sen steve daines r mont believe me if you start raising taxes on businesses those tax increases will get passed on to the consumer he said in a recent interview any time we can allow hard working americans to keep more of their dollars in their pockets it s the right thing late thursday the congressional budget office said the current version of the bill does not pay for itself and increase the deficit by 367 billion over the next decade but cbo score doesn t include all of the revenue raisers included in the bill and the biden administration said it believes the costs are covered the bill s price tag is 1 75 trillion over 10 years some of the major tax and revenue increases and changes in its current version include corporate minimum tax a 15 percent minimum tax on corporate profits for companies that earn more than 1 billion a year it also includes a global minimum tax on international corporations together these two provisions are estimated to raise 450 billion to 600 billion over the 10 years period surcharge and increases for wealthy individuals a 5 percent income tax surtax on individual earnings above 10 million and an 8 percent surtax on earnings above 25 million it also increases the taxation of some investment income for wealthy taxpayers together these changes will raise about 480 billion stock buy back surcharge a 1 percent surcharge on corporate stock buy backs which are used to increase the value of a company for shareholders it s estimated to raise 50 billion to 125 billion increased irs enforcement the bill would add 80 000 agents to the internal revenue service primarily for auditing those earning 400 000 or more supporters of the bill note that the irs auditing workforce has been greatly diminished in recent years leading to fewer and fewer audits of wealthy taxpayers and less pursuit of tax scofflaws this change is expected to raise an addition 125 billion prescription drug prices the measure gives the federal government through medicare and other means more power to limit the price of some prescription drugs that could result in a savings of 250 billion tax cuts payments for middle and lower income families it extends through 2022 a 250 per month per child payment 300 for children under 6 years old and continues this payment as a refundable tax credit in future years for families under a certain income level it also extends an expanded earned income tax credit which will lower federal taxes for an estimated 78 000 montana taxpayers mtn news u s house speaker nancy pelosi u s senate majority leader chuck schumer and other congressional democratic leaders daines however notes that the bill also includes a substantial tax break for wealthy individual taxpayers by increasing the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted on your federal income taxes from 10 000 to 80 000 benefiting people who live in high tax states it cuts taxes for the coastal elites he says you ve gotta laugh about this tester says if that provision makes it out of the house he d like to see it removed in the senate because any tax reductions should be going to those who need it and not wealthy taxpayers but tester says he expects many changes to the bill including its tax structure will be debated in the senate and that he s not yet drawing lines in the sand on any of its specific tax proposals just yet john riley mtn news u s sen jon tester d mont in the end i m going to take a look at it and see how it works for montana families he says there may be better proposals come down the pike that are better for rural america better for a state like montana we ll take a look at them and draw our conclusions based on that but there s one thing for certain this bill needs to be paid for late thursday the congressional budget office said the current version of the bill does not pay for itself and increase the deficit by 367 billion over the next decade tester also says he doesn t have a problem with additional irs agents auditing the wealthiest taxpayers or going after people who aren t paying their taxes the bottom line is if you pay your taxes you got no problems you got no problems at all unless you re advocating for only certain people to pay the bills for our defense and pay the bills for our programs that help the poor and educate our kids he says if that s where you re at i think you re living in the wrong country daines points to an analysis released this week by the congressional joint committee on taxation that says the bill will lead to higher taxes for some people earning less than 100 000 in the coming years contrary to claims by the president and democrats that same analysis however also says the bulk of the tax increases in build back better fall on the wealthy daines says he simply opposes raising taxes to fund a huge expansion of government here s the fundamental question should we allow the people of our country to make the decision of where to invest those dollars he says or do we raise taxes and allow the federal government to make those decisions you lower tax rates allow the american people to keep more money in their pocket it actually spurs economic expansion and it increases wages for the american people
vancouver british columbia nov 18 2021 globe newswire standard lithium ltd standard lithium or the company tsxv sli nyse sli fra s5l is issuing the following statement in response to the false and misleading report the report from blue orca capital the report contains numerous important inaccuracies and misunderstandings which standard lithium believes are misleading and clearly intended to benefit blue orca capital which itself has disclosed that it stands to profit in the event that the stock price of standard lithium declines standard lithium cautions investors not to make decisions based on this report and instead strongly encourages them to consult credible and informed sources including standard lithium s filings with the canadian securities regulatory authorities and the u s securities and exchange commission prior to making investment decisions arkansas oil and gas commission data standard lithium notes that the report misunderstands the scope of the data reported to the arkansas oil and gas commission aogc the demonstration plant operated by standard lithium under normal conditions continuously produces lithium chloride solution which is then mixed back into the waste brine stream and reinjected back into the geological formation via lanxess existing brine disposal system these large volumes of lithium chloride that were produced are not included in the data reported to the aogc to be clear the only data reported to the aogc in compliance with the requirements of the aogc were those volumes of lithium chloride solution that were temporarily stored on standard lithium s site and these have no correlation with actual lithium recovery rates observed in the plant a portion of this lithium chloride was sent off site for conversion to lithium carbonate on four separate occasions when conversion work was scheduled the reported data forms only a small portion of the total lithium chloride recovered in the process blue orca capital s interpretation of lithium recovery rates is incorrect and underestimates lithium extraction efficiencies similarly the report s claims that recovery is reducing over time also misinterprets the aogc data standard lithium has only stored lithium chloride product on site when required and the periods when it is stored do not correlate with actual lithium recovery rates observed in the plant at the time points of clarity the lithium chloride solution reported under the category the output of lithium carbonate lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide on the aogc website only represents that portion of lithium chloride solution which was temporarily stored on site and not the much larger volume that is continuously reinjected back into the brine formation the conclusions of the report prepared by blue orca capital are incorrect and based on misinterpretation of the information and excludes the much large volumes of lithium chloride solution that was produced at the demonstration plant and blue orca capital has opportunistically issued this report with partial and incomplete information and without consultation or clarification by the company demonstration plant the report also fundamentally misunderstands the necessity and purpose of the demonstration plant the demonstration plant was designed to continuously process an input tail brine flow of 50 gallons per minute gpm or 11 4 m3 hr which is the equivalent of 100 150 tonnes per annum of lithium carbonate one of the objectives of the demonstration plant to date has been to produce sufficient quantities of solid lithium carbonate product off site to validate that battery quality materials can be produced it has never been the intent to store on site all of the lithium chloride produced and then convert all of that to lithium carbonate product the principal purpose of the plant is to optimize the process to allow for design and scale up of a commercial plant in preparation for a feasibility study in accordance with national instrument 43 101 the company is confident in its lithium extraction technology and demonstration plant and will maintain its focus on executing its strategic plans and progressing towards definitive feasibility and commercialisation at the lanxess facility the company will not be providing further comment on the report at this time about standard lithium ltd standard lithium is an innovative technology and lithium development company the company s flagship project is located in southern arkansas where it is engaged in the testing and proving of the commercial viability of lithium extraction from over 150 000 acres of permitted brine operations the company has commissioned its first of a kind industrial scale direct lithium extraction demonstration plant at lanxess s south plant facility in southern arkansas the demonstration plant utilizes the company s proprietary listr technology to selectively extract lithium from lanxess s tail brine the demonstration plant is being used for proof of concept and commercial feasibility studies the scalable environmentally friendly process eliminates the use of evaporation ponds reduces processing time from months to hours and greatly increases the effective recovery of lithium the company is also pursuing the resource development of over 30 000 acres of separate brine leases located in south west arkansas and approximately 45 000 acres of mineral leases located in the mojave desert in san bernardino county california standard lithium is jointly listed on the tsx venture and the nyse american exchanges
