unaudited non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitdap adjusted net income and adjusted eps the company provides the non gaap financial measures of its performance called adjusted ebitdap adjusted net income and adjusted eps the company uses these metrics to measure its operating and total company performance the company believes that for management and investors to effectively compare core performance from period to period the metrics should exclude items that are not indicative of or are unrelated to results from the ongoing business operations such as retirement benefits pension and

impact is calculated using the federal and state statutory rates in the corresponding period free cash flow the company also provides the non gaap financial measure of free cash flow free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow should not be considered in isolation as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes or as an alternative to cash flows from operations presented in accordance with gaap the company uses free cash flow both in presenting its results to stakeholders and the investment community and in the company s internal evaluation and management of the business management believes that this financial measure is useful because it provides supplemental information to assist investors in viewing the business using the same tools that management uses to evaluate progress in achieving the company s goals the following table summarizes free cash flow three months ended march 31 2022 2021 in millions

while leaks do escape the court the extent of monday s breach has major consequences for how the court functions both internally and as an institution of society example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington the monday night leak of a preliminary draft opinion from the supreme court to overturn roe v wade sent shockwaves not just through the country but through the halls of the court a traditionally secretive and confidential institution for washington standards with chief justice john roberts confirming the authenticity of the draft the head of the supreme court also signaled that the leak was a singular and egregious breach of trust and ordered the court marshal to launch a formal investigation into the source of the breach the court has cautioned that no final decision on the case has been made the dramatic escalation of events has many wondering why exactly the court is reluctant to be more public about their inner workings and what the leak means for the future of the court why does the supreme court value confidentiality one of the big reasons for confidentiality is that the court values its candor of deliberations according to american university law professor stephen wermiel in other words public awareness and perception of opinions may push justices to not consider all legal arguments fairly if you are locked into an initial view because it s made public you won t be willing to consider other arguments or possibly changing your mind wermiel said i think they consider that quite integral that it really is necessary to have confidentiality to guarantee forthright consideration of issues in other cases leaks could give leeway for affected parties to act before a ruling said josh blackman a prominent court watcher and professor of law at the south texas college of law houston for example a draft leak involving a publicly traded company might cause investors to sell stocks preemptively what will happen to the whistleblower the probe into the leak signals the supreme court is determined to figure out who exactly released the draft people familiar with the internal workings of the court could identify around 70 people who might have access to a draft first of course are the nine justices themselves then there is the small group of staff that work for each justice finally there are the justices clerks young lawyers who work with the justices for a year in a highly prized position each justice has four clerks and secrecy is part of their job politico said it received the copy from a person familiar with the court s proceedings leading to speculation that a dissenter among the justices or their staff wanted to make it public however it s also possible that someone who liked the draft hoped that releasing the document would harden support for it wermiel said he could see the whistleblower being prosecuted for breaking federal law if their identify is discovered i think they will probably follow through on this whether that be theft of confidential material or dissemination of such material he said but it remains unclear whether such leak is considered a crime in a lengthy twitter feed law professor orin kerr at the university of california berkeley said that there is no law prohibiting the distribution of draft opinions but suggested prosecutors could charge the whistleblower against a broadly written statute that prohibits the misuse of government owned things of value if it were a justice that leaked the draft the consequences are even less limited according to jonathan peters professor of media law at the university of georgia he said that there are no code that would reign under these circumstances and beyond although articles of impeachment could be brought forward by congress what does this mean for the court going forward it is unclear what behind the scenes changes will occur in the court but many legal experts believe that this leak will negatively impact the both the public s trust in the supreme court and the professionalism among justices and clerks the collegiality in this the friendship of the court has to be at a low level right now said josh blackman i don t know how the justices will rebound from this it was such a simple decision that was done that will salt wound for decades stephen wermiel adds that while this is only a draft opinion and there could be changes down the road the leak negatively impacts the credibility of the court there s been a lot of criticism that the court is becoming more and more political and i think this does confirm the impression that the court is acting more politically every year jonathan peters added that the supreme court could and likely will also make internal changes to how justices and staff review and handle cases but it is unlikely these changes will ever be revealed to the public he also said that while that this leak certainly is equivalent to the sausage making process and the public may be dissuaded by the partisan nature of the court some may see this is a step in the right direction if they believe transparency is better for government

manitoulin island article content from new york city i regularly catch up by phone with my irascible friend everett mudge whom i affectionately call unca mudge and he takes it a pal and my severest critic for 30 years he and his dear sister aunt molly reside on maple drive in their home overlooking mudge bay advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your

about life and the stock market back to video you know the mudges were among the first settlers on manitoulin i helped my grandfather carry the small upright piano off the boat to shore that s the one you ve played over the years when you visit aunt molly and me article content but you ve never tuned it course not i depend on you to come and complain he says chuckling we ve depended on regular conversations through the years catching up on the news laughter and his opinions give me news any news truth is not a requirement i say waiting for unca mudge s spring 2022 wisdom which he readily shares observing the changes happening in our world fifty years ago i had to have someone to play chess with a great advance is the computer that plays chess now i don t need anybody to play with yet that dang computer beats me nearly every time once in a while when i do beat it i m the happiest man on manitoulin advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content unca mudge are you drinking enough water i ask i have a new doctor who tells me i must keep hydrated six glasses of water a day hey bonnie i m the healthiest 95 year old on manitoulin he brags of course our bodies need to be water replenished when i wake after i brush my teeth i have a tall glass of water two cups of coffee water in the afternoon then vodka and ice all take care of all my water requirements it s well known that unca mudge is a successful long time investor in the stock and commodity markets and this is his topic today investing hasn t changed over the years because human nature was the same 50 years ago as it is today it ll continue to be the same 50 years from now people are people he pauses to alert me advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content remember neither you nor i are financial advisers nor financial planners so this is for entertainment only understood absolutely remember that one can lose money when investing you must be very careful in what you buy and sell the first loss is the best loss that way you don t lose any more money if the stock keeps going down before you buy anything decide how much you want to lose and put a stop order in so that you sell immediately if that point is reached just like at the casino money is lost by people trying to get even after a small loss if what you buy goes up buy more but on a smaller scale than the original investment for instance if you start with 500 shares add 50 shares every time it rises by five per cent advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content you should hope that the stock goes up and fear that it goes down most people sell when they have a small profit and buy more when it goes down to try to get even you should do the opposite sell when you have a loss and buy when you have a gain i have made more money by sitting still than by trading meaning that when my stock is going up i do not take short term profits i sit with it riding out any reaction one must have the patience to sit tight when an investment is going your way i ve found that the markets are manic depressive when prices are crazy high people refuse to sell and when prices are very low everybody is scared to death and they give away good stocks at low prices i try to sell at the crazy high prices and buy bargains when the market is depressed advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but mudge doesn t this only happen every 10 years or so when the market is in a bubble or a crash when do you normally sell a stock because nothing goes up forever bonnie it s easy another one of my rules i watch the two hundred day average which is the average price of the stock over 200 consecutive days as long as the two hundred day average is going up i stay with the stock once the stock starts to fall and drops below the two hundred day average and the average is now sloping down rather than up i sell right away this method has saved me from being in a stock when it has made a waterfall decline which happens during bear markets most people lose money when interest rates go up and bonds go down when this starts it s best to stay in cash because as the rates go up you re making more money sitting with cash when the interest rates begin to level off you can buy bonds and get a higher return than you would have sitting with bonds losing money instead of cash advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content how ve you learned all this the hard way over the years unca mudge what do you do with all your money it s the game he says money s just a way of keeping score and keeping my mind active besides playing chess with the computer aunt molly comes to the phone bonnie dear if you write this there ll be a big crowd looking for him in kagawong if you print this he yells i ll go up to hudson bay and hide unca

turn the call over to dave david lamp thank you richard good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our earnings call yesterday we reported first quarter consolidated net income of 153 million and earnings per share of 0 93 ebitda for the quarter was 278 million we posted higher results in both segments on a year over year basis as fundamentals in refining and fertilizer sector continued to improve during the first quarter we are pleased to announce that the board has authorized the first quarter dividend of 0 40 per share which will be paid on may 23 to shareholders of record at close of market on may 13 at yesterday s closing price this annualized dividend would be 1 60 per share representing a dividend yield of over 6 which is currently the highest annual dividend yield among independent refiners for our petroleum segment the combined total throughput for the first quarter of 2022 was approximately 197 000 barrels per day with wynnewood undergoing its planned turnaround during the month of march this compares to 186 000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2021 which was impacted by some weather related outages the planned turnaround at wynnewood began at the end of february and was completed on schedule in the first week of april we also completed the conversion of the hydrocracker to renewable diesel service the renewable diesel unit has begun operations and is currently running at half rate as we work out and work towards certification of renewable diesel product benchmark cracks increased through the quarter the group 3 2 1 1 crack averaged 22 20 per barrel in the first quarter as compared to 16 33 in the first quarter of 2021 based on the high end of the proposed 2022 rvo levels rin prices averaged approximately 6 11 per barrel in the first quarter an increase of 13 over the first quarter of 2021 the brent ti differential averaged 2 89 per barrel in the first quarter compared to 3 18 in the prior year period diesel cracks surged in march and averaged 39 25 per barrel for the month light product yield for the quarter was 99 on crude oil processed our distillate yield as a percentage of total crude throughput was 42 and we continue to operate our refineries in max distillate mode in total we gathered approximately 114 000 barrels per day of crude oil during the first quarter of 2022 compared to 112 000 barrels per day for the same period last year as we have stated we have excuse me we have started to see an increase in drilling activities in our area and our gathering rates have been above 120 000 barrels per day recently although supply chain issues remain a hurdle in increasing production quickly it is encouraging to see producers starting to ramp up activity in the mid con in the fertilizer segment we faced some unplanned downtime at both plants during the quarter with consolidated ammonia utilization coming in at 88 during the upcoming turnarounds at both facilities this summer we expect to address the issues that caused some of the unplanned outages at the last over the last 2 quarters price realizations for the first quarter of 2022 increased again reflecting the latest price increases that began in the fall with the onset of the energy crunch in europe and asia the recent conflict in ukraine has driven increased concern over global fertilizer and grain supply and has strengthened prices further and increased our confidence in the longevity of this ag cycle now let me turn the call over to dane to discuss additional financial highlights dane neumann thank you dave and good afternoon everyone for the first quarter of 2022 our consolidated net income was 153 million earnings per share was 0 93 and ebitda was 278 million our first quarter results include a negative mark to market impact on our estimated outstanding rin obligation of 19 million unrealized derivative gains of 6 million and favorable inventory valuation impacts of 136 million as a reminder our estimated outstanding rin obligation is based on the original 2020 rvo the high end of the proposed 2021 and 2022 rvo levels and exclude the impact of any waivers or exemptions excluding the above mentioned items adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 155 million the petroleum segment s adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2022 was 48 million compared to 27 million for the first quarter of 2021 i would like to highlight that within our adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2022 we recognized a 12 million expense related to potential future legal obligations that shows up in the other expense line the year over year increase in adjusted ebitda was driven by higher throughput volumes and increased product cracks offset somewhat by elevated rin prices in the first quarter of 2022 our petroleum segment s reported refining margin was 16 75 per barrel excluding favorable inventory impacts of 7 51 per barrel unrealized derivative gains of 0 28 per barrel and the mark to market impact of our estimated outstanding rin obligation of 1 08 per barrel our refining margin would have been approximately 10 04 per barrel on this basis capture rate for the first quarter of 2022 was 45 compared to 51 in the first quarter of 2021 rins expense excluding mark to market impacts reduced our first quarter capture rate by approximately 22 compared to a 24 reduction in the prior period rins expense for the first quarter of 2022 was 107 million or 6 per barrel of total throughput compared to an expense of 178 million or 10 62 per barrel for the same period last year as a reminder our reported rins expense does not include the impact of any waivers or exemptions our first quarter rins expense includes a million mark to market impact on our estimated accrued rfs obligation which was mark to market at an average rin price of 1 37 at quarter end compared to 1 34 at the end of 2021 for the full year 2022 we forecast an obligation based on the high end of the proposed 2022 rvo of approximately 175 million rins which includes approximately 105 million rins generated from renewable diesel production but does not include the impact of any waivers or exemptions derivative gains in the petroleum segment totaled 8 million for the first quarter of 22 which includes unrealized gains of 5 million primarily associated with crack spread derivatives in the first quarter of 2021 we had total derivative losses of 32 million which included unrealized losses of 43 million primarily associated with the crack spread hedges that were closed at the end of the third quarter the petroleum segment s direct operating expenses were 5 57 per barrel in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 5 89 per barrel in the prior year period on an absolute basis direct operating expenses were flat with the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to increased share based compensation and labor expenses offsetting other operating expense reductions for the first quarter of 2022 the fertilizer segment reported operating income of 104 million net income of 94 million or 8 78 per common unit and ebitda of 123 million this is compared to first quarter 2021 operating losses of 14 million a net loss of 25 million or 2 37 per common unit and ebitda of 5 million there were no adjustments to ebitda in either period the year over year increase in ebitda was primarily driven by higher uan and ammonia sales prices and higher sales volumes the partnership declared a distribution of 2 26 per common unit for the first quarter of 2022 the cvr energy owns approximately 37 of cvr partners common units and will receive a proportionate cash distribution of approximately 9 million total consolidated capital spending for the first quarter of 2022 was 50 million which included 19 million from the petroleum segment 5 million from the fertilizer segment and 26 million on the renewable diesel unit environmental and maintenance capital spending comprised 23 million including 18 million in the petroleum segment and 5 million in the fertilizer segment we estimate total consolidated capital spending for 2022 to be approximately 209 million to 239 million of which approximately 131 million to 146 million is expected to be environmental and maintenance capital our consolidated capital spending plan excludes planned turnaround spending which we estimate will be approximately 80 million to 85 million for the year for the recently completed planned turnaround at wynnewood and in preparation for the planned turnaround at coffeyville in 2023 cash provided by operations for the first quarter of 2022 was 322 million and free cash flow was 281 million significant cash uses in the quarter included 41 million for capex and turnaround spending 30 million for interest 65 million for the remaining redemption of the remaining cvr partners 2023 senior notes 36 million for the noncontrolling interest portion of the cvr partners fourth quarter distribution and 12 million for cvr partners unit repurchases turning to the balance sheet at march 31 we ended the quarter with approximately 676 million of cash our consolidated cash balance includes 137 million in the fertilizer segment as of march 31 excluding cvr partners we had approximately 755 million of liquidity which was primarily comprised of approximately 539 million of cash and availability under the abl of approximately 371 million less cash included in the borrowing base of 155 million during the quarter cvr partners redeemed the remaining 65 million of 2023 9 25 senior notes outstanding completing its targeted 95 million debt reduction plan with the refinancing of the senior notes in june of 2021 and the 95 million debt paydown the annual debt service costs at cvr partners will be reduced by approximately 26 million per year a reduction of over 40 looking ahead to the second quarter of 2021 for our petroleum segment we estimate total throughput to be approximately 195 000 to 210 000 barrels per day we expect total direct operating expenses to range between 95 million and 100 million and total capital spending to be between 30 million and 40 million for the fertilizer segment we estimate our second quarter 2022 ammonia utilization rate to be between 92 and 97 direct operating expenses to be approximately 55 million to 60 million excluding inventory and turnaround impacts and total capital spending to be between 12 million and 17 million for renewables we estimate second quarter 2022 total throughput to be approximately 3 500 to 4 500 barrels per day and direct operating expenses to be between 2 million and 4 million with that dave i ll turn it back over to you david lamp thank you dane in summary refining market fundamentals have improved considerably since the beginning of the year with the conflict in ukraine further tightening what was already becoming a tight market in the united states refining product demand is essentially in line with 5 year average levels while inventories for gasoline distillate jet fuel are nearly 10 below 5 year averages exports of refined products have increased over the past month to over 2 5 million barrels a day an increase of over 1 million barrels per day from the beginning of the year as we approach the driving the summer driving season and a fairly heavy maintenance period for the industry in the second half of the year we believe the near term outlook for refining products is constructive the combination of natural gas advantage of the u s versus europe and asia the loss of russian distillate exports and the rationalization of global refining capacity has resulted in significantly improved cracks particularly diesel cracks despite near record high rin prices with the mid con demand for gasoline and diesel is in line with pre covid levels and inventories have tightened since the beginning of the year which has significantly improved the basis in the group 3 distillate inventories in the magellan system are nearly 25 below the 5 year average levels pushing group 3 distillate cracks to near 60 per barrel for the month of april we are also seeing a pickup in the drilling activity in our gathering area supply chain issues remain a constraint on the faster ramp up of new drilling but we re encouraged to see the level of interest increasing as i have stated a number of times the key to sustained widening of the brent ti differentials is an increase in shale oil production in the united states with conversations starting to turn to the need for u s energy independence and a call for increased domestic crude production we believe our assets are well positioned to benefit from higher shale oil production the outlook for the fertilizer business continues to be very positive also the conflict in ukraine is further tightening the market that was already struggling with low inventories and supply issues since the fall with low fertilizer inventories in the united states ongoing export constraints from china and russia and europe continuing to face high energy costs that are driving up the cost to fertilizer production we do not see an easy fix for fertilizer supply issues in the near term over the past 4 quarters cvr partners has paid down 95 million of high interest debt and bought back 12 million of units and announced the distribution of over 12 per unit our net 37 interest in cvr energy s share of the distributions for the past 4 quarters is nearly 50 million as i previously mentioned during the turnaround at wynnewood we completed the conversion of the hydrocracker to renewable diesel service and we continue to make progress on the pretreatment unit we have ordered long lead equipment and are currently in the permitting phase due to the ongoing supply chain issues we are now targeting for the pretreater in the second quarter of 23 we are also continuing to develop our overall renewables strategy beyond these 2 projects including the reorganization of the company to segregate the renewables business as i discussed in our last earnings call the reorganization plan has been approved by the board and new entities have been created for the various assets we have completed definition on the potential wynnewood renewable diesel conversion project which could be could include the production of sustainable aviation fuel the future of that conversion will depend on among other factors the development of expansion of the lcfs program to other states or the conversion of the renewable fuel standard to an lcfs type regulation overall we are looking at any economic opportunity within our existing refining and fertilizer business that can drive a reduction of carbon emissions and we believe our geographical location in the farm belt provides us with a unique position long term looking at the second quarter of 2022 quarter to date metrics are as follows group 3 2 1 1 cracks have averaged 43 25 per barrel with the brent ti spread of approximately 14 19 per barrel and a midland differential of 0 88 per barrel over wti the wtl differential has averaged 0 27 under wti and the wcs differential has averaged 14 24 per barrel under wti fertilizer prices remained strong as well the ammonia prices are over 1 200 per ton and uan prices are over 550 per ton as of yesterday group 3 2 1 1 cracks were 57 42 per barrel brent ti was 2 41 per barrel and wcs was 15 03 under wti assuming the high end of the proposed 2022 rvo rins were approximately per barrel group iii diesel cracks are over 83 per barrel in april epa made a seemingly symbolic yet unlawful announcement to revoke small refinery exemptions granted for 2018 however epa is not requiring those refineries to purchase or redeem rins to meet the 2018 obligation this announcement had no impact on the price of rins which remains stubbornly high as we continue to wait for epa to rule on small refinery exemptions for 19 20 and 21 as well as finalizing the rvo for 2021 and 22 we continue to be perplexed by how a federal agency can repeatedly obligations under the law to rule on small refinery waiver exemption and issue rvos in a timely manner as we have continually stated we believe wynnewood s obligation should be exempt under the rfs we have filed positions for small refinery exemptions for 2019 2022 excuse me 2020 and 2021 and will soon be filing for 22 these outstanding issues until these outstanding issues are resolved by epa or the courts we will continue will likely continue to carry rin obligation on our balance sheet as we believe we are legally entitled to relief and we ll continue to prepare to assert our rights wherever and whenever possible the chaos caused by epa s persistent refusal to comply with the rfs rule as intended by congress does not only hurt small and merchant refiners while we disagree with epa on which participants in the value chain are able to pass through the cost of the program epa has stated repeatedly that it is the driving public who ultimately foots the bill for higher prices at the pump we estimate this cost to be as much as 30 billion for 2021 alone as much as 0 30 per gallon which isn t even paid to the government we believe high rin prices help no one but wall street traders big oil and big retail blenders some of who have publicly admitted to holding rins until prices rise and only selling to obligated parties opportunistically hopefully consumers will take notice and demand that epa and the administration lower gasoline prices immediately by fixing the broken rfs meanwhile our focus is on safe reliable operation of our assets and environmentally responsible manner to ensure we are ready to capture market opportunities as they develop with that operator we re ready for questions question and answer session operator our first question comes from the line of phil gresh with jpmorgan philip gresh first question is just on the announcement of the dividend here you talked about obviously the annualized rate which would be pretty high so is that to suggests that that dividend is going to be the new kind of run rate from here or and or just any thoughts on just the general return of capital framework that you re trying to achieve david lamp well i think you ve heard us say many times that our business model is to return cash to shareholders in as many ways as we possibly can and any available cash and i think this just demonstrates that strategy the board will look at it every month every quarter and make a decision but obviously we wouldn t have reinstated if we didn t have some confidence in the business and the shape of the curve going forward looks very positive to us so i think we went back to our original strategy of returning money to shareholders philip gresh yes understood okay and then the second question i just wanted to ask you you gave the update on the ptu and the delay there but i was hoping you could just talk a little bit more broadly about your view of fundamentals now as you start up the facility without the ptu do you feel comfortable with the margin environment here there are so many moving pieces right now between what s happening at diesel prices prices lcfs just curious what your latest thinking is on the fundamental picture david lamp well i think it s a very interesting market when we made the call to make the conversion it was a much different picture than what it is today on the other hand we where the price of rins are right now it appears to us that we could make money with the current structure we are giving up an opportunity cost in refining because as you know we re cutting a little bit of crude rate to be to accommodate this the rdu in general it looks profitable to us and you got to remember we bought a lot of this feedstock that we re running now several quarters ago because we did delay that the conversion probably 6 months in the original piece so a lot of what we re processing now was bought quite a while ago of course how that will flow through the p l is yet to be seen but the unit the good news is the unit is up and running and very stable and we re very close to certification of the material as carbon dated as you have to do various paperwork you have to file is almost complete whether we ll ramp up the rate or not is still an open question and how fast we ll do that but right now i think we re firmly in the camp that we re going to run it through this cycle of catalyst life and then take a look at it again when we have to order and replace another load of catalysts philip gresh yes that makes sense and i guess just to kind of clarify as i think about where lcfs prices are now obviously they ve come down a lot do you feel like the economics of running rd have appropriately accounted for that lower lcfs price such that you feel aside from the inventory that you re getting at the lower price that you feel good about the run rate potential of the business david lamp well it s a lot better with the pretreater in service i think but there s still we re projecting that between 10 million and 30 million of something this year exactly what it will be i don t know because the thing is moving around like it s even worse than the oil business frankly it is just the swings in the market are just incredible and a lot of it is right now is driven by the diesel differentials and what s happening there on the cracks but i will tell you that this business is commoditized a whole lot quicker than i thought it would have it s you re looking at feedstock prices that are almost pricing just i don t it doesn t matter which one it is they re almost pricing with bean oil and some of the ci is being given up into those prices as what it appears to be and as low carbon fuel standard credits go down what s happening is the basically the d4 values have gone up and kind of offset that what happens when the blender tax credit runs out and whether that gets extended or not is still an open issue we re still positive on the business we put a fair amount of money into it and we re going to give it a run and see how we do we do we re still pretty confident we re going to be able to source some other feedstocks that are going to be advantaged just because of our location and we re not ready by any stretch of the imagination to ready to throw in the towel on it philip gresh i appreciate the volatility and the complexity and thank you for your thoughts dave operator our next question comes from the line of carly davenport with goldman sachs carly davenport i wanted to just touch briefly on kind of the cost environment opex came in a touch higher this quarter than we had expected so can you just talk a bit about what you re seeing from an inflation perspective out there whether that s on the opex side or also on the capex side and how you re working to manage any of those cost pressures david lamp sure i ll make a couple of comments and maybe dane can elaborate some more we did have a onetime charge in our opex this time that is not reoccurring that was about 12 million other than that natural gas is a headwind i ll remind you it s about every dollar is worth about 11 million to us in ebitda on a run rate basis so we re up almost double in the first quarter what it was in the previous quarter and we also probably had some stock based adjustments that since our stock has run up and particularly our uan stock unit prices has gone up quite a bit that runs through the p l dane i don t know if you have anything to add dane neumann yes i ll just clarify the accrual that was made was another income line item the escalation that we saw in opex was primarily associated with the run up of both uan and in opex and sg a carly davenport understood and then the follow up was just on kind of the operational side the guidance for volumes for 2q looks strong as you guys don t have the lack of the maintenance at wynnewood coming through 2q so can you just talk about how things are trending from an operational perspective at refining and ultimately to the extent that you run well and can capture these strong margins that we re seeing on the screen kind of where you think ebitda power could be as we think about the 2q 3q setup david lamp sure as far as operations goes we ll be running our plants wide open as much as we can subject to other things that are thrown at us like weather and other events we do have we did build some inventory during the wynnewood turnaround that we ll have to work off before we fully up raise the crude rates at our wynnewood refinery but other than that there s nothing else planned going forward for the rest of the year our next turnaround there really in the 23 which is a small turnaround at coffeyville and mainly on the coker so that s the only other impact that s there as far as i mentioned where crack spreads are today we re in an area that i haven t seen in my career in a long time if ever i think i saw a couple of times during the hurricane and only lasted 2 weeks or so but structurally the market is very constructive it s it appears we re short refining capacity worldwide if you look at the margins in singapore and in europe they re also equally wide so it s pretty much a worldwide event and the world s big time and eventually that s going to have a pull on gasoline as the driving season comes and it s going to have to pull out either you have to raise crude rates or which i don t think the world has the capacity to do or you have to carve into diesel to make more gasoline so it just looks very very strong operator our next question comes from the line of manav gupta with credit suisse manav gupta dave first of all congrats for reinstating the dividend it s good to see that the dividends which had disappeared kind of pre pandemic or during the pandemic from the refining coverage are all coming back so thank you for reinstating it it just helps the overall sector my question here is for those of us who are more of refining analyst and less of fertilizer analyst help us understand every quarter we are seeing fertilizer prices move up what s driving that how long can this super cycle environment for the fertilizer remain in place and how are you guys benefiting from it david lamp well i think if you just take the numbers and look at it prices are up over the first quarter of 2021 over 250 just about on ammonia as well as uan we make a fair quantity of ammonia and we make even a higher quantity of uan and that margin is even higher than the ammonia margin so really the structural thing that s happened here is plants in europe have shut down because of the high natural gas price if you look at the price i think i looked at it yesterday with the natural gas where it is in europe it s 1 500 a ton just in natural gas cost on ton of ammonia and that is what s basically driving it you also had some hoarding going on with china and russia and basically and that was before ukraine they re hoarding their own production to make sure they can feed their people and have enough fertilizer for themselves and that they were both big exporters and so when you put those altogether it s just and the u s is an import market so net import market so the world is just short fertilizer frankly and if you look at crop prices they re very very strong world is also short grain soybean corn and wheat so it s kind of a perfect storm i d call it and it s it takes probably 5 years now to build a new fertilizer plant and probably 5 billion or 3 billion to 5 billion depending on where you build it and you haven t heard too many announcements too many of those happening but you know as well as i do the best cure for high prices is high prices so this is a cycle that tends to get solved eventually manav gupta perfect my quick follow up here is on look everybody is obviously bullish on the gulf coast and the export potential and everything but when you look at the cracks mid contracts are incredibly good so i understand the bullishness on the gulf coast but can you talk about the strength in the refining fundamentals as it relates to like a pure mid con refiner that you re seeing right now and i ll leave it there david lamp yes as i mentioned on previous statements the demand has not been it s back to pre covid levels across the board in our markets magellan inventories are on the low side we came out of the winter with gasoline on the high side and that s been whittled away so i m very constructive on what the group looks like it all depends on what the turnaround cycles will be and who runs well and who doesn t and any other weather impacts that occur but right now our market looks wonderful operator our next question comes from the line of matt vittorioso with jefferies matthew vittorioso i guess just a couple of quick ones just on as we progress through the second quarter in the third quarter that 2 1 1 crack averaging 45 so far obviously it s going to be a solid second quarter just wondering if you could give us any sort of directional commentary on captures first quarter capture on that 2 1 1 was 45 or so any sort of just high level guidance on sort of how that should progress in the second quarter david lamp well i don t have any reason to see it changing much if you look at the basis on gasoline it s still sub nymex distillate is above nymex premium moves around like and those are the way we really impact our capture rates of course the big headwind is rins and that carves out up to 25 of the capture right there if you put that back in we re in our historical range typical we have done a lot to increase premium make and we ll continue to capture that as going forward which is a big change and we re also back in the jet business a bit which is not only in the military but in the commercial aviation area and those margins have been quite remarkable also for the year matthew vittorioso that s helpful then i guess just on the i think you mentioned in the press release that the sort of corporate restructuring that s going to carve out or create some new subsidiaries around the green stuff just from a bondholder s perspective i just want to confirm that you re not moving assets out of any restricted group or moving assets away from bondholders this is just creating like realigning the existing asset set up is that fair dane neumann that is correct in terms of the notes all will be moved within the construct of the cvi notes matthew vittorioso okay and then lastly for me just thinking about cash flow given where cracks are today and just what could be a very strong couple of quarters here you re also getting distributions from uan who s also generating very strong cash flow just maybe if you could talk about your cash flow priorities you ve reinstituted the dividend and i presume you ll sort of assess what size of that dividend should be each quarter but away from that any capital allocation thoughts and on the back of that when you came with your bond deal you did 1 billion to refi 500 with the thought that maybe you would do some m a at some point i know you ve kind of moved away from m a so i guess i m thinking as those 25s there s still a couple of years away but as they get closer do you think about just a straight refi there or is 1 billion of debt the right level for you guys just how are you thinking about that stuff dane neumann yes i think we re comfortable with the 1 billion level of debt at the time being as we get to the refi point we ll of course look for opportunities to look for green funds and maybe split some of that up between the various entities at that time but for the time being we want to make sure that we re taking it as advantage of the green funding as we can in terms of other capital allocation as you said we ll assess it each quarter and then take a look at what s in front of us and determine what the best path is operator our next question comes from the line of paul cheng with scotiabank paul cheng maybe that i have to apologize i came in maybe late or maybe i didn t catch it correctly did you say that you guys are looking at the potential option of converting like a full conversion of wynnewood into a renewable plant that will also produce david lamp no we were talking about coffeyville at that time as i think we announced some time ago that we were doing an engineering study to find the scope for coffeyville conversion of one of its hydrotreaters to renewable diesel and within that we have the option of adding a module to make sustainable jet fuel at the same time paul cheng okay so that because that has been on the table for some time when is that you guys going to make that decision david lamp well as i mentioned in the prepared remarks paul we re not going to make that decision until some kind of expansion on the low carbon fuel standard regulation to other states that market is getting oversupplied or will be soon and or the conversion of rfs to a low carbon fuel standard credit which the epa has been talking about a little bit i don t know i don t hold my hope is very high that they ll do it but if they were smart they would because it s that s really what the goal of reducing carbon is and the rfs is very inefficient at it compared to what the lcfs is paul cheng and realistically i mean for the lcfs market even if we have a large number of states going to be adopting that given the rd under construction since anyway we re going to be structurally low and need to export so under that circumstances will that be will you guys look at that and say okay i mean export market is fine because we believe that europe canada every place a lot of places that is going to adopt some kind of market like that as such that there s a strong export market for rd so will you make the conversion or that the project that tailored for the export market or that you say no i mean that this is really just if i can t see the domestic demand supply is in good shape i m not going to build it i mean how from a fundamental standpoint or strategically how do you look at the market david lamp well i think paul from our location the export would be difficult at best i think you would see the coastal plants doing the exporting and the internal plants doing mainly the railing to wherever the lcfs market is i will point out if you look at our cost to rail to california is probably in that 0 30 a gallon range lcfs credits right now where they re priced depending on what feed you run let s just do it on a soybean basis are about 0 38 credit so you re getting close to where it s the push to whether you rail it or just dump it into your base pool of and that s always a variable that s there paul cheng i m sorry i m not referring that you re going to export it yourself but i mean the whole market other people are exporting then you re going to tighten the domestic market so that s why i asked that if in order for the market to balance we need to export rd will that a condition that still make you comfortable to fid david lamp well i don t know i don t think to make a conversion to coffeyville i think it s we d have to look at that specific point it s unclear to me how you really monetize going to canada at this point you lose the blender tax credit there s no rin that s associated with it i don t see a mechanism to make that happen at this point even for those close to it paul cheng the second question is for dane i probably may have missed some of your prepared remarks did you talk about what is the rvo currently on your balance sheet and also that whether you have been for the 2022 and then finally that let s assume in june 3 the epa essentially status quo haven t done anything to change the current program in terms of as well as the rvo then revise it for 2021 22 at that point will the company start looking for a pathway to settle your obligation or that i mean what is the next step for you guys dane neumann the current rvo obligation on the balance sheet is 585 million keep in mind that represents we have outstanding waivers for 19 20 and 21 for wynnewood and as dave mentioned we ll be soon filing 22 we legally believe that we re entitled to those waivers and as such we re comfortable carrying that balance sheet or that liability on our balance sheet david lamp and your second question paul i didn t quite catch it paul cheng no i was asking that whether for 2022 you guys have been current on your rvo or that that has been added to your balance sheet david lamp yes we re still short of a little 22 and 21 our plan is to settle coffeyville and remain short on wynnewood in essence because we believe we re entitled to the small refinery waiver at wynnewood and we ll be litigating all that as epa acts paul cheng right so dave that s my final part of the question is that on june 3 if the epa didn t change so the next step is that you guys are going to sue them again david lamp well it depends on what they do on june 3 of course i anticipate that they re going to just based on what they did with 18 small refinery waivers those what appears to me to be illegally and then try to apply a change in the way they interpret the regulation at something that s so far past when it was created it s kind of ridiculous the approach they ve taken but that said i think we re still fairly certain and quite certain that we ll be successful in litigating the wynnewood exemption and there s no reason for us to do anything more but to litigate at this point operator our next question comes from the line of matthew blair with tudor pickering holt matthew blair dave just trying to circle back to your comments that you expect rd to make i think it was 10 million to 30 million this year and i was wondering if you can extrapolate that 4 000 barrel per day renewable volume guidance for q2 if you can extrapolate that for q3 and q4 when i do so it looks like you d make around i guess 46 million gallons for the year and so that 10 million to 30 million range should be anywhere from like 0 22 ebitda per gallon to 0 65 ebitda per gallon and just wanted to run those numbers by you and see if there s anything else we need to take into consideration or if that s the range that you re trying to guide to david lamp well as i m sure you know matthew the way you buy feedstock here is usually a quarter ahead or even 2 quarters so we ll and the volatility in the hobo spread has been incredible so it s somewhat of it looks like an equation for hedging strategies and other things that we re still working out how exactly we re going to do it but i don t think your numbers are far off you just look at the margin today on an rbd soybean and we do run a mix of soybean oil and corn oil in varying percentages that you would come up with those kind of margins that you mentioned you d be very close matthew blair great great sounds good and thanks for providing the opex yes go ahead david lamp yes just 1 second one other point i d make to you is that that we haven t decided what exactly rate will run so whether it will be we ll ramp it up or not will depend on what those margins are matthew blair right right and it s a pretty volatile environment and then i just had a question on sg a so that 39 million in q1 was that impacted by the stock comp expense or that onetime accrual and really what i m trying to get at is is that 39 million is that a good run rate for q2 or do you expect to be closer to like the low 30 million or even high 20 million range like you used to be dane neumann yes so there was a stock based comp impact in the sg a figures as well and then in addition as we go about this restructuring we re picking up some ancillary costs there as well helping inflate that but nothing that we see that would dramatically change what our typical run rates are that project and any volatility in the stock price matthew blair okay so that means coming down to low 30 million range for q2 david lamp it should be a pretty good number i mean the 12 million for sure was a onetime charge dane neumann that was the other income david lamp that was another income but or other expense but that s never going to that s not going to repeat itself hopefully the rest of it is stock based tell us what our stock is going to do and tell you where that s going to impact how it s going to impact but it should be onetime unless it goes continues up hopefully it does but other than that the restructuring does cost us a little bit of money but that s the only other thing in there that expect it to go back to where it was after a couple of quarters matthew blair okay very helpful and then last question so a lot of focus on the current diesel cracks but i mean the 2023 curve has really moved up as well and so just wondering if you re looking at any sort of product crack hedging and how appealing that might be and whether you start to layer any product crack hedges on david lamp no we look at that all the time and we have we do occasionally do a certain percentage of our volume and some of the crack of course if you would have locked them in last week they were low compared to where they are today but it s heavily backward dated the first 2 months out you re back down into that like you said 23 and i think 23 was about 43 you could do in the group actually not even nymex and even looking at 24 it was 38 and those are very strong numbers so i don t know that we ll do anything yet but i think i always say the best cure for high prices is high prices but those numbers are very attractive if you look at history whether we ll do that or not you re operator we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments david lamp again i d like to thank you all for your interest in cvr energy additionally i d like to thank our employees for their hard work commitment towards safe reliable and environmentally responsible operations we look forward to reviewing our second quarter 2022 results in our next earnings call thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day
editor s note desert rose collective is permanently shutting its doors on jan 13 2023 but online shopping will be available shortly after from sustainable homes to repair cafes the zero waste movement continues to expand its eco friendly reach across tucson with a new type of green shop popping up in recent years refilleries zero waste refilleries allow individuals to bring in reusable containers to refill with environmentally friendly products including soaps shampoos and conditioners laundry detergent and cleaning products the goal help reduce waste sent to landfills by cutting back on plastic usage says local refillery owner alena straus in the last three years tucson has seen a growth in refilleries and sustainable shops including cero which started in 2019 and straus shop desert rose collective which opened right around the start of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 desert rose collective initially opened its doors near south stone avenue and east mccormick street but recently moved to its current downtown location at 135 s fifth ave an area with more foot traffic leading to more accessibility for others to live more sustainably i want to help people get around the stigma of zero waste and eco friendly because i think that if you say you know zero waste people kind of have like a knee jerk reaction says straus who is both vegan and zero waste herself sometimes it s like oh that s so hard or oh you know you re like elitist in some kind of way so helping people understand that it s like really quite easy and you can just like save your pasta jars and start with whatever you want to start with so it s about just giving people an approachable starting point desert rose collective offers more than just refilling stations at its brick and mortar location they offer biodegradable loofahs shampoo and conditioner bars laundry detergent pods and handmade soap from local soapmaker gigglestars soap co one of the more unique items at the shop includes an environmentally friendly alternative to paper towels a swedish dishcloth composed of cellulose and cotton that you can wash up to 200 times in the washing machine or dishwasher the reusable dishcloth can save up to 17 rolls of paper towels according to desert rose collective s website but if you just want to stop by for a quick refill on your favorite cleaning product or shampoo they can do that too just bring whatever reusable container you have on hand straus says the 25 year old shop owner has filled everything from amber jars to dial soap dispensers to even a regular coffee mug we have mostly closed loop refill options straus says so that s going to be your big carboys large containers full of shampoo conditioner floor cleaner glass cleaner dish soap all that kind of stuff that people can refill in their own containers so through those means we re kind of attacking and hopefully helping people cut back on their plastic use according to data from the environmental protection agency landfills received 27 million tons of plastic in 2018 refilling the family legacy although straus isn t a native tucsonan her father and his family are from the old pueblo making tucson a place she holds near and dear to her heart she moved to tucson from boulder colorado in 2019 i was always kind of in love with the area and started visiting here as an adult again after my grandma had passed and it s just so cool here and it s a great place to start a business too there s a ton of resources here straus says and i always had wanted to move to tucson and i knew that there was a need for it refilleries here so i brought it with me while working at a zero waste shop in boulder straus saw the community s affluent people live sustainable lives with ease due to their financial status which made straus decide that living sustainably shouldn t be a hard bubble to burst into register for more free articles log in sign up that was kind of my lens of like i want to make this something that more people can participate in and that there s not as much of a bar to entry as far as like pricing goes straus says so i do try to like find and keep brands in stock that are more affordable options but yeah that was kind of the bigger focus for me was you know bringing it to more people straus comes from a line of family run businesses in tucson throughout the 1950s to the 1970s her grandfather milton straus operated a warehouse near east toole and north stone avenues that distributed beers including pabst the warehouse offered a bottle take back and collection service straus said in a follow up email so in a way closed loop recycling and refills have been a family legacy so picking up where her ancestors left off came naturally when straus opened desert rose collective in 2020 the name desert rose collective was inspired by the work of local artist marcy ellis who creates artwork inspired by flora the natural world and the femme according to her etsy page straus decided collective was the best addition to the name desert rose as she had plans for collaborating with other local sustainable businesses before the pandemic struck a lot of people asked like so is it a cooperative what does that mean and originally the idea was that the collective would be kind of an umbrella under which i could welcome in other sustainable businesses straus says but then i signed my lease and covid hits i was like ok well i just need to do whatever i can do to open and then figure out the rest later so i m still working on the figuring out the rest part alena kala and papaya when chatting with straus about the shop she uses terms like we and us and one could easily assume that she is referring to the employees who help her keep the shop afloat while the shop does have two other employees they re not your typical workers you can find one of them occasionally knocking over three full gallon containers of dish soap allover the shop floor and another employee taking a nap during the workday or at the shop s monthly events these two employees are straus furry companions and shop pets papaya the sassy cat and kala the shy dog who you will probably see when visiting the downtown shop we have the cutest pets in the world that work for us straus says i think it s a good icebreaker and because i m not necessarily an extrovert being in like the shopkeeping realm is a challenge sometimes but having the kids around you know it gives us something to talk about but you can talk about more than just the furry friends at desert rose collective especially during the new final fridays monthly events that straus hosts at the shop on the last friday of each month this summer desert rose collective will host a sustainable business and educator to help shine a spotlight on living sustainably in the community there s also some form of music and snacks at the free monthly event it s kind of like a networking opportunity for people to come and meet other sustainable people straus says and then just kind of have fun and shop or listen to music or whatever it is that you re coming for the new monthly events aren t the only thing coming to desert rose collective this summer straus plans to start selling her own sustainable vegan skincare line including a salve and all purpose oil this summer too i spend my life in this world so i think that it s important on like a very micro level of like what am i putting on my body what am i consuming what am i cleaning with what are my pets going to be smelling on the floor that part of it is like very micro and very important of making sure you re getting clean good products straus says and then at a macro level of course like keeping plastic out of the landfills but i would also say that i think more and more people are voting with their dollars and understanding that what is local matters what s sustainable matters

pleased across both our corporate strategies in the first quarter of 2022 here is a summary of our first quarter software results revenues declined 3 year over year and were flat on a constant currency basis we saw some revenue headwinds in q1 this included a more challenging macroeconomic environment due to war in ukraine a tough comparison in q1 2021 where we saw license revenue grow 69 and total revenue grow 10 year over year and ongoing cloud growth which has a short term negative impact on product license and total revenue our cloud business continues its momentum with subscription revenue growing 28 year over year and current subscription billings growing 18 year over year our eighth straight quarter of double digit growth we had several large cloud deals slipped from q1 due to macroeconomic uncertainty which caused billings growth to decline sequentially turning now to our bitcoin strategy we had another active and successful quarter we purchased 215 million of bitcoin at an average purchase price of 44 645 per bitcoin net of fees and expenses we have not sold any bitcoin to date these purchases were funded by excess cash in our business as well as through a 205 million first ever public company bitcoin back term loan i ll discuss the terms of the loan in more detail in our financial section in total we have raised an aggregate of 3 4 billion in new debt and equity capital that we ve deployed in support of our bitcoin acquisition strategy to reiterate our strategy we seek to acquire and hold bitcoin long term we view our bitcoin holdings as long term holdings and we do not currently plan to engage in sales of bitcoin as of march 31 2022 the company own an aggregate of 129 218 bitcoins that we acquired for a total cost of 3 97 billion or 30 700 per bitcoin net of fees and expenses the market value of our bitcoin holdings was 5 9 billion at march 31 2022 reflecting 1 9 billion of unrealized gains or nearly 50 appreciation when compared to the original cost basis of our bitcoin at march 31 2022 the carrying value of our bitcoin holdings as of march 31 2022 was roughly 2 9 billion reflecting 1 1 billion in cumulative impairment charges we continue to see opportunities for microstrategy to target a multibillion dollar software market that is at an early stage of moving off of legacy tech into the cloud we re well positioned to meet the demands of enterprise customers with our modern analytics platform as we discussed in detail on our last earnings call we see three key areas of growth for us enterprise analytics embedded analytics and cloud where we will seek to grow by developing our pipeline making our customers successful and continuing to innovate automate and simplify our technology stack next i would like to

speaking of security microstrategy also separated itself from the competition recently by way of our fast transparent and effective response to the high profile log4j and spring for shell on their abilities our customers benefited from rapid mitigation and remediation of these issues solidifying the peace of mind they have come to expect from our partnership those customer of microstrategy cloud has 0 day fixes installed over the weekend and updates and patches installed in a week microstrategy continues to be growing a growing part of the mix microstrategy cloud continues to be a growing part of the mix of our business we are on track to accelerate the subscription billings momentum in 2022 we expect to grow by migrating on prem customers to the cloud expanding the footprint for existing cloud customers and defaulting deployment of as many new customers as possible to the cloud we also expect to have our microstrategy fedramp compliant version of our software available in q3 this year for those customers that are not yet ready to move to cloud such as those in highly regulated industries or countries we remain committed to supporting them also our underlying cloud architecture is also improving leveraging containers and micro services this architecture is built to deliver highly scalable multi tenant saas solutions across tens of thousands of users and provide developers with a streamlined experience to leverage continuous integration and continuous development overall i m very pleased with the pace of product innovation and we are confident in our ability to achieve our long term growth targets while maintaining profitability finally our annual user conference microstrategy world was another tremendous success world 22 was our second virtual world event and enable us to reach a bigger broader audience with customer success stories product presentations thought leadership keynotes and a hugely popular bitcoin for corporations event held in tandem our content was available to all for free via an online event platform the key notes including the michael saylor jack dorsey keynote were simulcast live on youtube all in all we had nearly 14 000 registrants on the event platform and over 180 000 viewers of the content across all mediums replays for the sessions are available on our website turning to our first quarter 2022 financial results in more detail revenues for the quarter were 119 3 million down 3 year over year were almost flat on a constant currency basis on a trailing 12 month basis total revenues are up 3 year over year product license revenues were 16 5 million down 22 year over year or down 20 on a constant currency basis the decline is mainly due to a large transaction included in q1 2021 and that contributed the majority of the year over year differential on a trailing 12 month basis product license revenues are up 2 year over year subscription services revenues were 12 8 million an increase of 28 year over year or up 30 on a constant currency basis the growth in subscription services revenues reflects the increased portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform our current subscription billings in the first quarter of 2021 were 11 4 million an increase of 18 year over year the growth was lower than expected for the first quarter as some deals slipped out of the first quarter in part caused by the ongoing war in ukraine impacting the purchasing patterns of customers in europe and worldwide we see strong demand and pipeline for our cloud licenses and the potential for our future for further growth going forward product support revenues were 67 2 million in the quarter a decrease of 5 year over year or 3 on a constant currency basis the decline was partially driven by certain existing customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term licenses offerings and partially by an impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange as we see more on premise conversions to our cloud offering we would anticipate product support revenues will experience a modest decline over time that said our in quarter product support renewal rates for q1 continue to be among the highest we ve ever experienced finally other services revenues which largely reflect our consulting services were 22 8 million in this quarter an increase of 9 year over year or 13 on a constant currency basis primarily driven by an increase in billable hours worldwide partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact and a decrease in average billing rates we believe that growth in consulting revenues is an indication of continued engagement from our customers to modernize retain and grow their deployment of the microstrategy platform shifting to our cost total non gaap expenses include share based compensation expenses were 275 million which excludes share based compensation expenses were 275 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 298 million in the first quarter of 2021 of this amount 170 million were bitcoin impairment charges in q1 2022 and 194 million in q1 2021 as a reminder on the treatment of bitcoin impairment charges our bitcoin holdings are considered indefinite lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our carrying value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges during the first quarter we incurred digital asset impairment charges of 170 million as discussed on the last earnings call on a go forward basis any non gaap financial measures we may present in future filings will retain the impact from bitcoin impairment charges this change in the presentation of our non gaap financial measures does not impact our strategy operations or gaap financial statements or previous sec filings we ll continue to report the bitcoin impairment charges separately now starting from the bottom of the chart moving up non gaap cost of revenues were 25 million in the first quarter of 2022 an increase of 2 4 million or 11 year over year as a percentage of total revenues this reflects an increase of 2 6 driven by increases in cloud customer hosting fees and personnel costs from additional headcount as we continue to accelerate our shift to cloud we expect increases in infrastructure costs and headcount to support additional customers and over time for our cloud business to scale decreasing costs as a percentage of total revenue non gaap sales and marketing expense was 29 million a decrease of 6 9 million or 19 year over year the decline is primarily driven by a decrease in variable compensation mainly due to higher capitalized commissions and decreases in bonus and personnel costs as a percentage of product license and subscription revenue the charge reflects a decrease the change reflects a decrease of 16 which in part reflects improved productivity of our sales and marketing teams non gaap research and development expense was 30 million an increase of 2 8 million or 10 year over year as a percentage of total revenue this reflects an increase of 3 driven by headcount increases cost of hiring and wage inflation the technology sector has experienced significant wage inflation and competition for resources and we anticipate that trend will continue in 2022 and that we ll continue to invest in r d to retain our talented engineers and develop sophisticated innovative products we re also shifting some headcount to lower cost regions which we expect will result in some cost efficiencies over time non gaap general and administrative expense was 21 million an increase of 2 1 million or 11 year over year as a percentage of total revenue this reflects an increase of 2 3 overall we feel comfortable with our cost structure and our ability to generate cash flow sustainably total non gaap operating loss in the first quarter of 2022 was 155 6 million inclusive of impairment charge related to bitcoin and 170 1 million the carrying value of our bitcoin holdings as of march 31 2022 was 2 9 billion which reflects 1 1 billion in cumulative impairment charges have also been reflected as losses on our gaap income statements in the period incurred our non cash bitcoin impairment charges will remain subject to market volatility of bitcoin market prices as one of the leading advocates for digital assets we ve been working with peer companies and various policy setting agencies in the us to try to develop an alternative accounting framework for digital assets currently companies that aren t investment companies report bitcoin as intangible assets this means bitcoin is initially recorded on balance sheet so that is the store cost and then is deemed impaired at the market price of the company s principal exchange for bitcoin drops below the carrying value at any time however the carrying value can never conversely be revised upward at the price of bitcoin increases in the fourth quarter of 2021 the financial accounting standards board or fasb announced that it had added a project to their research agenda to explore accounting for exchange traded digital assets as the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin in the world we believe we have a responsibility to share what we ve learned since embarked on this strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this new asset class next i ll discuss the terms of our first ever bitcoin backed term loan with silvergate bank we raised 205 million as an interest only loan for a term of three years which is collateralized by bitcoin the loan matures on march 23 2025 it bears monthly interest at a floating rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate or sofr 30 day average as published by the federal reserve bank of new york s website plus 3 70 with a floor of 3 75 the low may be prepaid at any time subject to modest prepayment premiums the loan had an initial loan to collateral value of 25 which was thus collateralized closing by bitcoin with a value of approximately 820 million while the loan is outstanding we are required to maintain an ltv ratio of 50 or less which essentially allows for an approximately 50 drop of bitcoin prices from the time of transaction closing before we re required to post any incremental collateral we re also allowed to proactively manage the ltv ratio by posting any desired value of additional collateral if we choose to if bitcoin appreciates in price and the ltv ratio is less than 25 at any time weâ re entitled a return of excess collateral so long as the ltv ratio would not exceed 25 after such additionally we have established a 5 million cash reserve account with silvergate to serve as additional collateral for the loan that can be used towards the interest payments for the last six months of the long term also we have held back approximately 9 million from the loan proceeds as cash and macro strategy that can be used towards general corporate purposes including paying interest for this loan or buying additional bitcoin this loan is not guaranteed by any party the agreement does not restrict us from incurring additional debt permits additional lean so long as such liens are not on the asset serving as collateral for the loan and permits us to sell assets so long as they are not serving as collateral for the loan there are no restrictions on utilizing bitcoin that is not a part of the collateral for this loan thus this loan would be accretive to shareholders as long as bitcoin appreciates more than the issue expense and cumulative interest expense to be occurred incurred over the term of the loan microstrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of enterprise s treasury policy which has generated incremental value for our shareholders as a snapshot into our current bitcoin holdings by entities as of march 31 2022 of the total of 129 218 bitcoins held by the company roughly 14 100 bitcoins are held at the microstrategy entity all of which are held as collateral securing our 2028 secured notes the remaining approximately 115 100 bitcoins are held at the macrostrategy subsidiary of the macrostrategy of bitcoins approximately 19 500 bitcoins are pledges collateral towards the bitcoin back term loan and over 95 600 bitcoins remain unpledged and unencumbered we may consider additional opportunities to utilize the strategic asset in the future for example subject to market conditions we may enter into additional bitcoin back financings we seek to lend our bitcoin to third parties to generate yield we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and determine whether to engage in any such transactions and may ultimately decide not to pursue any of these transactions next i would like to emphasize the strength of our robust capital structure from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective we re insulated from the near term market volatility at bitcoin prices since we currently do not have any debt principal maturities coming due until march 2025 the total annualized interest expense today is approximately 44 million which equates to a blended interest rate of approximately 1 82 on our entire debt obligations of 2 4 billion we expect cash flows generated from our software business to be sufficient to cover interest obligations as they become payable additionally we maintain a certain minimum amount of cash balance to fund our regular working capital needs as of the first quarter we had 95 million in cash on our balance sheet going forward we ll continue to evaluate debt or equity capital raising and other financing opportunities that we believe will be accretive to shareholders subject to market conditions and that further our bitcoin acquisition strategy or optimize our capital structure is needed we believe that the further adoption of bitcoin globally will have a positive effect on bitcoin prices which has the potential to offer asymmetric upside to our shareholders our 2022 outlook remains positive with our continued transition to cloud and our expectation of a sustained increase in subscription billings our cloud transition will result in increased subscription revenue and billings with the continued growth of our subscription billings it is possible that our product license revenue and total revenue growth will decelerate in the near term even as our cloud software business even as our overall software business expense this will depend largely on the mix of new sales between cloud and on premise licenses this is because of a new cloud contract which may have a higher total contract value than an on premise license still results in lower recognized revenue in the first year overall we feel we are well positioned to achieve our long term sales growth target of greater than 10 and increased free cash flows over time finally i d like to share an update with you regarding the appointment of our new cfo i d like to welcome andrew kang who will be joining microstrategy as our new cfo effective on a start date which we expect to be on or around may 9 i m thrilled to see him step into this new critical leadership role where he will be able to contribute from his wealth of experience andrew has over 20 years of experience in banking and consumer finance and most recently served as cfo for greensky inc a publicly traded fintech company prior to greensky andrew served as the corporate treasurer for santander holdings usa the 150 billion us bank holding company under banco santander sa andrew has also held leadership positions in capital markets finance and treasury at santander consumer usa hsbc finance and capital one following andrew s appointment i look forward to having more time to focus on my role as president running the day to day operations of microstrategy as well as strategically planning for our long term health and growth for both bi and bitcoin strategies i ll now turn the call over to michael to discuss observations for the microstrategy world event comments on our bitcoin acquisition strategy as well as regulatory outlook for the digital asset space michael saylor thank you phong and i want to thank everybody for being with us at here today i thought i d start with a few observations of global developments in q1 we saw some fairly seminal events the trucker crisis in canada the ukrainian war russian sanctions continued inflation supply chain chaos concerns about food and energy shortages all of those things have been combined with a weakening currency environment the chinese currency the japanese currency south africa south america and african currencies and a lot of asian currencies were all collapsing against the dollar in fact just about every currency in the world except for two i think are collapsing against the dollar right now this is creating a very challenging macroeconomic environment it s going to continue to create uncertainty and challenges for all businesses i think that it has had the impact of increasing awareness of and the understanding of the need for a digital asset like bitcoin and so the silver lining is that hundreds of millions if not billions of people are now becoming aware of the need for non sovereign store value digital asset like bitcoin the negative is it creates a very challenging operating environment over the last few months in the world of bitcoin the interesting developments worth highlighting are the executive order coming out of the biden white house on march 9th which was really a first as long as anyone can remember the first time that we had the executive branch in the united states in essence highlighting and endorsing an asset class as being critical to the future of the nation and so i thought that that was extraordinarily auspicious janet yellen gave a speech on april 7th at american university equally auspicious we had the secretary of the treasury of the united states laying out the case for decentralized networks the theory of digital property talking about the need for digital currencies what the innovations in the crypto economy and suggesting that the administration is going to do enthusiastically move forward to provide responsible regulations to allow this economy to grow i thought that was very critical too i think if you put all of these macroeconomic developments together with the regulator signal what you have is a world that s a bit insecure about currencies and insecure about property rights and then secure about 20th century banking systems and 20th century payment systems and aware that they need to find a solution but you also have another big development which is that the deniers of bitcoin and digital assets in general are now being silenced by the administration of the united states one of the early crippling criticism was this is just a panty scheme where this is intangible or there s nothing here and i think that with now the head of the sec the head of treasury the president of the united states acknowledging that there is something here and it s an important priority for the entire government i think that that really isolates the deniers and if not making them look silly at this point because it s pretty clear that 250 million people know that there is something here and it s growing like wildfire and it s pretty clear that the government recognizes this so we have another classification of bitcoin investors after deniers that will be the skeptics the skeptics acknowledge that it exists they acknowledge that it s good they may even acknowledge that it s better than gold and it s better than other sorts of money or property and then they follow up with the observation that since it s so good the politicians will ban it or the government will ban it and that was that s been articulated by a number of fairly well known credible sources over the past two years but of course with the march 9th executive order and the ellen speech of april 7th it gets increasingly difficult to maintain the skeptical stance because you would have to in essence put yourself in opposition to the white house right it s not the policy of the united states demand bitcoin so in fact it s not the policy of anyone in the western world to band bitcoin so the deniers and the skeptics are being silenced and now the entire bitcoin market is evolving to be controlled by the traders the technocrats and the maximal list and clearly the volatility of the market right now is driven by the fact that the traders are trading bitcoin as a correlated asset to the nasdaq and technology investors that are nasdaq heavy are selling or shorting technology assets as a risk off trade as the federal reserve raises interest rates so i would say that if we look at the last three months although the macroeconomic environment is difficult and macroeconomic winds are blowing in the face of all risk assets and all operating companies i would say the fundamental developments the political developments and the market awareness of bitcoin has made enormous strides â and if you compare where we were today on where we are today versus two years ago the asset class has matured dramatically awareness has matured dramatically and the risk of holding the asset class has decreased and specifically i think the skeptics in the past 24 months are increasingly disappearing and everyone is migrating to either a trader or a technocrat or a maximus i had a chance to attend the bitcoin conference in miami beach this april i noted a massive surge of interest in bitcoin among politicians among media and among investors and there are a lot of politicians that hadn t heard of it and weren t interested in it a year ago both international and domestic and now it s on their radar and they realize they need to pay attention to it it s probably not uncorrelated to the executive order of march 9 i think there s a lot more media coverage and we ve seen a change in the media tone i think the media tone two years ago was nonexistent in fact people used to lament that bitcoin was not being covered by mainstream media at all it wasn t until february of 2021 after tesla bought bitcoin that bitcoin got on to the radar of mainstream media but i think that over the past few months the tone has evolved from skeptical or amused to respectful and in fact i almost noticed now that that mainstream journalists across the major papers and the major cable news networks are all much much more aware of the entire crypto economy much much more aware of bitcoin in its value proposition and much less skeptical much more interested in engage and i think the environment has moved from disinterested through skeptical to now neutrally intrigued or even i would say intrigued intrigued would be the right word in the media also seen a bunch of investors credible investors that are well respected in the space speaking much more freely about bitcoin in the marketplace and actually becoming much more vocal and much more supportive in their words and i think that that s a big move forward over the past 12 months examples of that we see our carlos salinas piaggio becoming much more vocal becoming much more vocal paul tudor jones becoming much more vocal and orlando bravo becoming much more vocal so i think you ll continue to see this develop over the next 12 months i think advances in the lightning network are pretty relevant maybe one of the bigger developments in the past 12 months is lightening is maturing and lightning is the open permissionless non custodial layer 2 network in essence if bitcoin represents protocol for sound money lightning represents a protocol for transaction and money transfer that s open permissionless and since it s it could in theory scale to hundreds of millions or billions of transactions an hour this is in essence the internet of money two years ago the lightning network was really just developmental in the past year it s come to life and so we re now entering into early part of the year two of the internet for money coming to life major milestones there block integrating lightning into the cash app was a major milestone the release of specifications for the taro protocol on top of lightning is a major milestone what it means is that lightning will in time not just move satoshis back and forth at the speed of light to billions of people lightning will also move other digital assets like stable coins tether or a circle or any other digital currency or any other digital token could or an nfc or another asset could move over the lightning network at extraordinary high speeds extremely scalable while taking advantage of the security assurances of the bitcoin network so that s pretty compelling kraken also incorporated lightning into their exchange and that s a very compelling breakthrough so i think in time all the competitive digital assets exchanges and all the competitive applications of money transfer and the like are going to have to build lightening as a protocol into their applications and we ve got a number of years of development there but the significance of lightning is it takes bitcoin from being viewed just as an asset and as a low frequency high volume a low frequency high value settlement network and it takes it to the next level which is becoming a high frequency high volume very very functionally rich scalable transaction network and there will be i think an explosion of applications on top of the bitcoin network that are empowered by lightning another big development in bitcoin this last quarter is the launch of fidelity s 401 k offering we re very enthusiastic about that and of course we re an early anchor partner with them on that launch bitcoin is better than gold to call it digital gold is an understatement it really is the hardest money in the history of the world but if you re thinking about generational wealth and if you wanted to leave something for your grandchildren or if you wanted a retirement fund it s obviously a very very compelling element of a 401 k we just saw just on television today one of the world s great macro investors paul tudor jones said in the current economic environment i certainly wouldn t be owning stocks and bonds i mean people are very skeptical of owning equities and owning bonds in an environment where you have hyperinflation and macroeconomic wins so if i can t on stocks and i can t own bonds and what am i supposed to put in a 401 k and this is where bitcoin comes what have i wanted to hold some kind of commodity money that s better than a commodity because no one can make any more of it and bitcoin is that thing so i do think that the world is evolving rapidly it s probably evolving faster than regulators and the mainstream media can keep up with it kind of like a shock wave when you start moving through the civilization at a faster rate than people can educate themselves on the consequences you ll see sparks but the 401 k launch was kind of the shot heard around the world here because what s going on here is people are going to have to stop and think about this and either this is the least risky thing you can put in a retirement portfolio or it s too risky to put in a retirement portfolio and of course as soon as you think about it and study it you ll realize that it s the least risky thing you could put in a retirement portfolio at least that s the opinion of people that have studied bitcoin for a while so the 401 k offering from fidelity is a massive educational event it s going to put this front and center on the table for financial advisers retirement planners the entire big finance industry and i think ultimately it s going to introduce bitcoin to an entirely new class of investors and broaden fill the asset class so i d like to move on to talk about our bitcoin strategy we re going to continue to pursue a strategy which offers our investors spot exposure with leverage to bitcoin so if you want to buy a security and you would like that security to own bitcoin and then you would like to and you think it would be a reasonable idea to borrow money at 1 8 interest and buy that bitcoin then microstrategy looks like a rational company to invest in we re going to work to increase our bitcoin holdings over time in an accretive fashion so we re not trading bitcoin we re not selling bitcoin we re holding bitcoin and from time to time when we can we ll buy more bitcoin if we focus upon the strategy then we believe that we can offer a security to the market and be an operating company that in essence is superior to the security that you would get if you were to buy a spot etf we won t be an etf we re an operating company and we have the software business but for an investor that s thinking about buying an etf that holds spot bitcoin they ll think about that it will probably have no leverage they ll probably pay a fee and our goal will be to offer them the same bitcoin holding but without charging that fee and to use intelligent leverage from time to time when the opportunity presents itself i was very very pleased with the bitcoin backed loan that we were able to acquire this quarter we ll obviously use that mechanism sparingly because generally we re not going to want to develop a large set of obligations where we might have to post additional collateral on a price fluctuation of bitcoin so managing our balance sheet versus the risk in the volatility of bitcoin is primary concern we re always thinking about we will slow down our bitcoin acquisitions when market conditions don t present us with any good opportunities and when the market presents us with lots of good opportunities we may speed up and you ll just have to tune in quarter by quarter to see what we do there we have the option to do nothing and if the market doesn t give us a good option or we have the option to do things you can see at this point we ve now bought bitcoin with senior secured debt we bought bitcoin with a tender offer we bought bitcoin with cash flows from the core business we bought bitcoin with convertible debt we bought bitcoin with at the market equity issuance and we bought bitcoin with an asset backed financing and we pursued each of those initiatives at the time we did it because we thought that they would be accretive to our common stock shareholders and beneficial to our long term strategy my last point i ll make before we take questions are we will continue to pursue a mission of education and advocacy on behalf of bitcoin to the general market as the largest public holder of bitcoin it makes sense for us to educate regulators it makes sense for us to educate other corporations it makes sense for us to educate anyone in the media or any politicians that are interested and what this means to the world and why it s good for the world why it s good for the united states why it s good for their corporation their institution and then how they can benefit and plug bitcoin into their p l or plug it into their balance sheet if you don t follow me on twitter please do i now just cross 2 4 million followers and i try to share thoughts about the current environment on a pretty routine basis i m pleased to say that by the end of the day today or tomorrow a podcast i did with lex friedman on youtube will have crossed 2 million views so i sat down with lex in my study at my home in miami beach and we talked for four hours about digital transformation and the bitcoin imperative and our strategy and of course macroeconomics and geopolitics and it s not easy to put 2 million people into your living room but 2 million people listening for 4 hours is a lot of education and we ll continue to do more of it i feel that where there s an enormous thirst for knowledge about digital assets there s enormous thirst for knowledge about the implications of bitcoin to the world and the entire crypto economy there s a lot of education to do we re nowhere near done we re really just starting but we have established a platform to do that and we will get more and more opportunities to communicate this message and educate the world i ll continue with our efforts working with bitcoin miners through the bitcoin mining council and the entire bitcoin community to address misperceptions about mining to explain the benefits of bitcoin the benefits of coin mining we just had another quarterly release of bitcoin mining information where we were able to show the world for the fourth quarter in a row bitcoin mining is running on more than 50 sustainable energy in fact 58 58 sustainable energy usage makes the bitcoin mining industry the cleanest most sustainable industry in the world of all industries and that was a surprise to many people it continues to be a surprise to many people but it s a delightful surprise bitcoin mining in general is 63 more efficient year over year and a lot of people don t realize that the bitcoin network is secured not just by energy but by technology and that technology is getting exponentially more efficient overtime so i m really pleased that we re able to educate the world on the efficiencies of the bitcoin network and the benefits of bitcoin and bitcoin mining i think that there is a lot more education to do our leadership role in acquiring and holding bitcoin as a publicly traded company it s afforded us a platform to do a lot of that education and we ll continue to do that in the coming year so with that i want to thank everybody for your support and we ll go ahead and answer questions question and answer session a shirish jajodia thank you michael we re going to jump right into questions we have received a lot of good questions and we ll try to cover as many as we can so the first question is for fun on the software business clearly you have been through a few economic cycles over the years how discretionary is bi software and do you see the current macro just pushing deal cycles out or do you think there are certain deals that will be put on hold for a while phong le yes thanks for the question jo the short answer is there is a portion of bi spend as discretionary and i ll call that speculative try out new things without necessarily a concrete use case or operational outcome and then there s a portion that s required and that s the piece that is required to operate and run an enterprise and fortunately microstrategy falls more into the latter than the former so that kind of spending might get pushed out one quarter when there s uncertain macroeconomic conditions like we had in q1 but it isn t permanently shelved for the whole year or multiple years so generally speaking i feel good about our ability to weather macroeconomic downturns better than we ve seen in some of our newer competitors who ve joined the market recently shirish jajodia thank you fang the next question is for michael when you purchase bitcoin how much do you consider dollar cost averaging into the purchase during the quarter versus a more oled once purchase strategy michael saylor yes we try to be thoughtful about the way that we acquire bitcoin and we do it in such a way that we wouldn t impact the market and we ll spread it over a time period sometimes a long time period sometimes a shorter time period depending upon our perception of the market and the volatility as a practical matter because we purchased bitcoin on many many different occasions over the past two years we are dollar cost averaging as we acquire more capital and i guess i that s what i would say to that shirish jajodia and one more question for michael are you comfortable with the leverage level and what is your long term debt strategy michael saylor yeah i think we re comfortable with our leverage level and our long term debt strategy is not to take on more debt than we can reasonably manage phong le i can add to that a little bit you saw us share a little bit earlier right now our interest expenses are around 44 million annually which compared to last year s earnings before interest tax depreciation if you were to adjust out the bitcoin depreciation is about half of that and so i think we have plenty of earnings and cash flow to cover our interest expense so we re in a pretty comfortable place right now with our leverage shirish jajodia thank you next question is for phong how far does bitcoin have to fall for microstrategy to receive a margin call on the silver gate done and was this loan needed for cash flow purposes phong le i ll take the second part first no the loan was not needed for cash flow purposes we took out the loan primarily so that we could continue to invest more in bitcoin and also really to create a market for a bitcoin backed term loan so being the first company to do that in the public markets is consistent with what mike said which is really us being a leader in the bitcoin space in general as far as where bitcoin needs to fall we took out the loan at a 25 ltv the margin call occurs 50 ltv so essentially bitcoin needs to cut in half or around 21 000 before we d have a margin call that said before it gets to 50 we could contribute more bitcoin to the collateral package so it never gets there so we don t ever get into a situation of march call also shirish jajodia and continue with the next question for phong as well are there any risks of bitcoin collateral being liquidated due to extreme market volatility regarding the silvergate loan phong le it sort of related to just that last question the risk of really are that we would have to contribute more bitcoin as you can see we mentioned previously we have quite a bit of uncollateralized bitcoin so we have 95 643encumbered bitcoin so we have more that we could contribute in the case that we have a lot of downward volatility but again we re talking about 21 000 before we get to a point where there needs to be more margin or more collateral contributors so i think we re in a pretty comfortable place where we are right now shirish jajodia next question is for michael what would be the company s strategy if the price of bitcoin stays flat for a prolonged amount of time phong le we ll continue with our strategy we ll keep generating cash flow in the core business and from time to time we ll acquire more bitcoin shirish jajodia and i ll follow up one more for michael can microstrategy provide any details on exploring the yield generation opportunities on unencumbered macro strategy bitcoins phong le no shirish jajodia is there anything else on that phong le yes i mean we re looking at a lot of different things out there it s sort of part of our role that we ve been playing as a as a leader in the market but what we re going to do when we re going to do it the and with deal generation there is a lot more to it in terms of accounting implications et cetera so they are all things we look at from time to time shirish jajodia next question is perform how did you get comfortable including bitcoin in your 401 k program can you please provide some details on the plan and whether it s already active phong le yes it s similar to the question of how do we get comfortable with bitcoin in general right and mike talked about this a little bit first of all i think it s great what fidelity is doing as a leader in the market as one of the leading retirement savings plan providers it s great to see what they re doing from a leadership perspective we got comfortable because the executive team the board leadership employees has spent the last two years learning about studying understanding details about bitcoin especially as a store value especially as an investment and so the idea that it s a great long term historic value which is why we put so much of our investment into bitcoin would make sense for a certain number of employees it doesn t make sense for everyone and ultimately it will be something that s voluntary we have not rolled this out yet it s something we plan on doing in the second half of the year and we re still working through details as exactly how we re going to go about it shirish jajodia thank you phong i ll ask one more question for phong how much longer do you expect product license revenue to face headwinds how large will be the segment â will the segment be by the time it stabilizes phong le yes so as we go through this transition to cloud product license revenues start to decline as we replace that with faster growing subscription revenues i can imagine last year was a pretty big increase from the previous year and that we wouldn t expect to see that level of growth on a go forward basis on a year over year basis for product license revenue as we replace that with cloud and subscription revenues over time that will be the engine of growth in the organization and our revenue line shirish jajodia thank you phong next question is for michael can you provide any thoughts into if it s better to buy microstrategy stock or the comparison of buying microstrategy stock versus buying bitcoin direct michael saylor i think that there are some companies in some situations where people literally can t buy the bitcoin like either legally or by charter they can t buy the bitcoin but they can buy securities there are other situations where people can t or don t wish to buy securities but they wish to buy property so there are very different things one of them is digital property the other is a security that happens to hold on its balance sheet digital property so i think that those are the primary issues for those people that prefer to own securities and their portfolio but want bitcoin exposure then will be one of their options and for those that prefer to own property than bitcoin s digital property and i think that s the right way to think of it shirish jajodia thank you michael i think one last question for phong is the top line miss this quarter driven by a faster than expected migration to the cloud or is it a reflection of weaker demand due to macroeconomic risk phong le i think it s more of the latter and i think that is primarily manifested in slippages of both cloud and perpetual deals into the second quarter so i don t think this is a permanent change or impact we do have a little bit of the impact coming from stronger cloud but i think it s more on the macroeconomic side in the war in ukraine shirish jajodia great so i think we are at the top of the time now so thank you everyone for your questions this concludes the q a portion of the webinar i will now turn the call over to michael for any closing remarks michael saylor i want to thank everybody for being with us today and thanks for your support we wouldn t be here without you so we ll continue with our strategy and we look forward to speaking with you again in 12 weeks wishing you the best shirish jajodia thank you
years of underinvestment in drilling activity have taken their toll on the offshore industry with news that germany is no longer a hold out on eu wide russian oil import restrictions the oil market supply crunch is looking to get even worse if the eu decides on a full ban while hungary remains a potential holdout sources cited by the wall street journal indicate the 27 member bloc is discussing ways to help the country manage oil supplies without flows from russia the eu sends 450 million a day to russia for oil and 400 million per day for natural gas with europe importing 138 million tons of russia s oil last year good for 53 of its total oil exports meanwhile opec s production woes never seem to end opec production for march climbed by a mere 40kb d badly missing the group s production growth target of 254kb d according to a reuters survey the miss was largely attributable to declining production in libya and nigeria with serial declines in nigeria a persistent headwind a week ago goldman sachs expressed optimism that the industry has reached a turning point in the oil and gas capex cycle with seven years of declining activity about to come to an end goldman reckons that oil and gas capex could triple from recent lows the good news a production ramp is already underway in the offshore drilling sector according to bloomberg a new wave of oil platforms is sweeping

energy are expected to start production in two years related the calm before the storm in oil markets once complete the six platforms will be capable of pumping up to 560 000 barrels of crude per day the gulf of mexico has been a u s crude hub with its deep trove of reservoirs responsible for about 14 of the u s s crude production in january gulf production clocked in at 1 7 million barrels of oil per day shy of the pre pandemic record of 2 million barrels a day u s oil production is currently clocking in at 11 8 million barrels a day a distance away from the pre pandemic record of 13 1 million barrels a day unfortunately the global picture is not pretty with analysts predicting that it will take many years for the global industry to fully recover if ever the number of new offshore discoveries worldwide has fallen to a 75 year low after oil companies slashed their budgets for deepwater exploration the oil market crash of 2020 was brutal on major oil producers forcing global oil and gas companies to cut capex by 100b or roughly 30 to 13 year lows however it s offshore drillers who bore the full brunt of the cuts with just a fifth of projects earmarked as potentially going ahead in 2021 proceeding on schedule some of the high profile offshore drilling deferrals included the suspension of exxonmobil s nyse xom multi billion dollar rovuma lng project in mozambique

highest profits ever in 2022 but even as the industry recovers from the pandemic offshore investment globally is set to rise only 7 to 155 billion this year compared with an 18 increase in shale investments according to rystad energy a consulting firm the big problem here is that offshore projects cost billions and rarely come online in less than a decade worries that today s high crude prices won t last coupled with the fact that offshore drilling is expensive and time consuming makes offshore projects a tough sell regulatory overhang does not make things any easier it remains unclear when or if offshore producers will be able to secure new gulf leases from the biden administration when the current five year program expires on june 30 according to the national ocean industries association gulf production could be halved by 2040 if leases remain suspended gulf producers are however changing tack to cope with the new realities advertisement first off producers are increasingly shifting to smaller designs and subsea tiebacks instead of launching megaprojects to explore in ever deeper waters farther from shore according to colin white an offshore analyst with rystad operators are shifting to an infrastructure led exploration strategy because the gulf of mexico already has so much infrastructure in place further many offshore giants are increasingly looking

very good start to the year in terms of financial results as well as some exciting strategic announcements i will cover some highlights from the quarter before turn the call over to our chief commercial officer brandon perthuis to discuss products and go to market updates then dr larry weiss will provide an update our csi expansion strategy finally paul will cover our financial results and outlook in detail taking a look at our first quarter results which again exceeded our guidance for both core and covid revenue revenue totaled at 320 million down 11 versus 359 million in the first quarter last year and up 27 compared to fourth quarter of 2021 we ve delivered approximately 3 2 million tests in the quarter up about 31 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 though down from 3 8 million in the fourth quarter of last year the volatility we have seen in total revenue is a direct result of the fluctuating demand environment for covid testing which was again strong in the first quarter but the scenes code meaningfully in the second quarter paul will cover the breakdown between our core and the covid business in more detail but the other highlight level our core business have grown 59 year over year to 25 million we continue to drive strong profitability and generated 4 93 per share in gaap eps and 188 4 million in operating cash flow in the quarter we had a strong start to the year with the fourth quarter results that exceeded our expectations at the same time we re most excited about the strategic update we announced that most recently this input acquisition of inform diagnostics which closed just last week and the opening of our new oncology lab in southern california which we announced today as demand environment for covid 19 continued cool off our team is much busier than ever working on growing number of initiatives that will drive long term sustainable growth for our core genetic testing business brandon will cover our street strategy around informed diagnostics in more detail but this acquisition is our largest today and created meaningful expansion opportunities for fulgent while adding our topline on day one there are multiple compelling strategic benefits of this acquisition including commercial infrastructure they have built to support a nationwide footprint which gives us a seamless entry point to sell full suite of fulgent testing services including newly launched liver cleanser liquid biopsy test we ve seen this aggregation as a highly complementary to our existing test menu and sales force and believe the investment can drive meaningful returns for our core business over the long term the second initiative i would like to highlight is opening our new oncology folks lab in southern california this new lab gave us an opportunity to bring lab and oncology testing capabilities that occurred with csi to our clients on the west coast we look forward to scaling on capabilities that cause cancer testing to our west coast customer base dr weiss who has been always seen the integration of csi into fulgent we are also oversee the operation of this lab these announcements notable steps forward in our strategy to drive long term sustainable growth in our core genetic testing business a key element of success of this strategy is a team of experienced leaders within fulgent who are executing on this vision every day we helped build a relatively lean but extremely knowledgeable group of executives and who have become instrumental to our success for execution while the team has continued to grow in recent quarters it remains a cohesive and highly effective group of leaders who are able to accomplish what they set up to do our rapid scaling of covid testing during the pandemic is a prime example over the determination of our team the acquisition and integration of csi labs is another notable proof point of our ability to execute successfully on our merger and acquisition strategy i have a high level of confidence that our team was able to effectively execute on the integration of uniform diagnostics to drive outsized growth in our core businesses in the year ahead we ll continue to look at additional m a opportunities in science technology that could contribute to our long term growth we recognize that whether we should call the healthcare landscape have come even more attractive aimed at the reason of market volatility and it will remain extremely well capitalized to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise the future look were bright for fulgent i am very excited about the growing number of opportunities ahead to capitalize in the near future i now turn over the call over brandon perthuis our chief commercial officer brandon brandon perthuis thanks ming we have a lot of great things to talk about today while we saw another wave of covid 19 in the first quarter which drove further cash generation we remain diligent in our efforts to build upon our core business and we re pleased to recently announce the opening of our new cancer lab and the acquisition of inform diagnostics starting with the exciting news of our acquisition of inform diagnostics inform diagnostics was founded in 1996 and has grown to be one of the largest national outpatient pathology laboratories in the united states in large part thanks to the rigor of their quality the comprehensiveness of their solution offerings and the experience expertise and dedication of their professional staff inform dx brings expertise in hematopathology anatomic pathology and neuro pathology key service areas that complement our vision of becoming a one stop shop for a wide range of healthcare specialty looking at the anatomic pathology business we offer products in dermatology guidance urology and breast each of these areas have seasoned subspecialty trained pathologist on staff which is a key differentiator and selling feature the anatomical pathology sales team has approximately 20 sales managers spread throughout the united states and no individual state contributes more than 10 to overall anatomical pathology sales we see an immediate opportunity to expand this teams to further penetrate the market in addition one of the more exciting areas for us is the ability to cross sell for example inform dx has over 600 active gi clients which are a focal call point for our new liver cancer liquid biopsy test while we have built a specialized sales team to call on hepatologist in gi which i will speak to momentarily the informed dx sales managers have these existing relationships and can walk us through the front door in addition the csi division has existing client relationships that also send out anatomical pathology services which could be cross sold and economically included in existing daily pickups with other tem in surgical work other synergistic sales opportunities to inform dx clients include hereditary cancer to their breath clients and molecular testing for uti to their gu clients these are just some examples and with the speed at which fulgent can launch new products and services we will be looking at other tests our account utilize and it makes sense we ll be launching those tests to increase our revenue per customer as well as better serve our clients on the heme side this acquisition is a perfect fit for our oncology strategy inform dx currently has four heme sales reps and we ve already started expanding this with the addition of three new hires on the west coast with the intention of hiring more we believe our current menu and turnaround time is very competitive and we will continue to launch new hem onc services such as mrd and other heme panels and additional area of synergy is around managed care contracting informed dx has done an impressive job of obtaining contracts that collectively represent over 300 million covered lives these contracts layered on top of csi strengthen our in network coverage in most states in addition we believe the combined entity of fulgent plus csi plus inform diagnostics creates a unique multi state laboratory offering and subspecialties that provide an excellent value proposition to manage care we hope to be able to use this to build stronger relationships with existing payers and obtain additional contracts and relationships moving forward switching to our new liquid biopsy test for liver cancer since launching the test late last year we have made significant progress with our go to market strategy this includes building out the sales team and that release to drive consumer awareness launching a redesigned website publication of the on core data continued progress in the client clinical trial and onboarding over 50 new accounts 50 new accounts in this short amount of time it s significant we believe this shows enthusiasm for the test and represents execution by our new sales leaders and their team the enthusiasm is understandable considering the top has the potential to transform how we screen and diagnose patients for liver cancer leading to improve patient outcomes changing the way medicine is practiced take time but we are excited to see the early momentum we have with our tests another area of focus moving forward will be to continue to grow our organic core business specifically a pediatric testing bolden has built one of the largest most comprehensive menus for pediatric genetic testing now offering testing over 5700 conditions and phenotypes with over 19 000 tests and for many of these tests we are one off if not the only provider in the united states this has allowed us to build a large national customer base though we believe there is still work to be done to increase awareness across this customer base over the recent months we ve been built an inside sales team who will be deployed to help grow these accounts by focusing on the higher volume tests such as exome sequencing genome sequencing in neurological panels we believe we have the test menu tat and quality to drive additional volume for pediatric and rare disease testing over the next several months we will be connecting with this customer base and educating them on the full breadth of our services and as we bring csi in form diagnostic together we can better serve these clients over time within network managed care contracts on the sales team front we have expanded in a big way which we said we would do on previous calls we now have a team of over 50 individuals segmented into five sub specialties pediatric and reproductive health anatomical pathology oncology hepatology and biopharma these teams are currently functioning independently to ramp our recent investments in inform diagnostics and csi but there are clear synergies across the organization and we are beginning to take steps to cross train and integrate the teams across common platforms to maximize efficiency in just a few quarters we ve been able to transform our business in a big way fulgent is now one of the largest providers of genetic testing and anatomical pathology services in the united states we believe our investments have come at the right time and at the right price and are set up full just to see significant growth over the coming years that said we re still only at the very beginning of our story as we continue to leverage our ai technology and execute on our post covid 19 strategy that will include additional investment in organic growth m a and other strategic initiatives we look forward to keeping our investors updated on our progress and we appreciate their support i ll now turn the call over to our chief medical officer dr larry weiss larry larry weiss thanks brandon as you know oncology diagnostic testing is a major strategic area for fulgent as we focus our efforts on driving long term sustainable growth in our core business we executed on a strategy in a meaningful way in august of last year with the purchase of csi laboratories in alpharetta georgia csi is a strong regional laboratory offering diagnostic services to a pathologist client base for both hematopathology and surgical pathology using immunohistochemistry flow cytometry cytogenetics fish and single gene molecular testing using csi as resources as a model and a source of validation assessments our goal was to build a state of the art laboratory on the west coast to offer diagnostic services to an oncologist client base as well as to supplement csis test menu with next generation sequencing somatic tumor offerings starting from literally empty walls i am very pleased to announce that we have already been able to build a state of the art laboratory in el monte california which has been clia approved the two labs will be complementary and not strictly duplicative to each other as while our georgia lab has a pathologist client base our new lob lab in el monte will have a hematologist oncologist customer orientation the new laboratory includes about 25 000 square feet of wet lab space including large r d areas as well as additional dry lab space for analysis and pathologist activities currently able to offer immunohistochemistry flow cytometry cytogenetics fish and single gene testing we are actively validating and submitting a suite of next generation sequencing tests for reimbursement approval including tissue and liquid biopsy tests for both hematology and solid tumor specimens for assessment of tumors as well as detection of minimal residual disease the new symmetric ngs testing in addition to fulgentâ s current capabilities in germline ngs testing will also supplement both csis inform dx test menu as an aside germline testing is already important in breast cancer colon cancer pancreatic cancer pediatric cancer and many others and is included in many consensus guidelines for cancer patients our goal is to serve cancer patients and their families at all stages of their disease early as well as late and to become a meaningful contributor to revenue by the end of the year i will now turn the call over to our chief financial officer paul kim paul paul kim thanks larry revenue in the first quarter totaled 320 million compared to 359 million in the first quarter of 2021 well exceeding our original guidance of approximately 245 million billable tasks in the quarter totaled 3 2 million compared to 3 8 million in q1 of last year the year over year decline was again due to covid testing dynamics the omicron wave since getting of the first quarter create a tremendous demand for covid testing and early in the quarter now that s tapered off through the end of march and has since returned to much more normalized levels breaking down the revenue that further roughly 295 million came from covid 19 testing in q1 which exceeded our expectations the revenue from our core business totaled 25 million which also exceeded our guidance of 22 million and grew 59 year over year as a reminder our core revenue includes our ngs business contributions from our china jv contribution from csi and it excludes ngs covid testing from the cdc as demand for covid testing remains volatile and unpredictable we continue to take a conservative stance on expected revenue from covid testing we remain focused on executing on our post covid growth opportunities which include the integration of informed diagnostics expanding the reach of csis capabilities executing on additional investment and partnership opportunities ongoing work on joint commercialization opportunities and growing the footprint of our international operations our asp in the first quarter was 99 slightly lower than 103 million we saw in the fourth quarter of last year our asp has remained relatively stable in the last few quarters fluctuating higher and lower as covid testing as in spikes cost for tests for the quarter was 24 slightly lower than the 25 in the fourth quarter of last year due to shoring up reserves and the write off of some excess inventory to your end gross margin was 75 7 down 370 basis points year over year and up 40 basis points sequentially turning now to operating expenses total gaap operating expenses were 40 6 million in the first quarter up from 38 7 million in the fourth quarter of last year non gaap operating expenses totaled 35 5 million up from 34 million last year our operating expenses increased primarily due to ongoing investments in strategic headcount across our organization fees and services associated with our heightened m a activity additional credit losses for provision and the accounts receivable due to the high revenues in the first quarter our non gaap operating margin increased 280 basis points sequentially to 65 1 our expense structure remains very lean enabling us to drive significant profitability from revenue outperformance that being said our investments in people and business our operating margins in the near term ultimately we believe these investments will drive outside the future growth as a core business and we remain pleased with the consistent operating leverage we are able to demonstrate even through m a adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was 213 5 million compared to 271 9 million in the first quarter of 2021 on a non gaap basis and excluding equity based compensation expense and intangible asset amortization income for the quarter was 158 7 million or 5 08 per diluted share on 31 2 weighted average diluted shares outstanding turning over to the balance sheet we ended the first quarter with approximately 1 1 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we generated 188 4 million of cash from operations during the quarter further adding to our cash balance now moving on to our outlook starting with covid revenues as demand for covid testing continues to taper off we expect to see ongoing declines in our revenue from covid testing our expectations for covid revenue for the full year remain unchanged we expect at least 480 million in covid revenues for the year inclusive of the 295 million we did in the first quarter letâ s breaks out into roughly 85 million in q2 and 50 million each q3 and q4 clearly revenue from covid testing has been hard to predict admit volatile spikes and outbreaks so we remain prudent with our expectations for covid revenue contribution moving on to our core revenue guidance which will include contributions from informed diagnostics as the transaction closed on april 26 we have continued to see strong growth across our organic business while csi and inform diagnostics will drive incremental growth we expect core revenues will be approximately 180 million in 2022 representing growth of 94 year over year which is slightly better than the guidance we provided during the announcement of the acquisition of inform diagnostic only a little over a week ago what 480 million in covid revenue and 180 million in core revenues we expect total revenues will be approximately 660 million for the year we expect there will be continued volatility with covid testing and remained focused on executing our strategy to drive momentum in our core business from a profitability standpoint we remain focused on investing in our business to drive sustainable long term growth that being said we expect to see meaningful pressure on operating margins in the quarters ahead as we integrate and further invest resources of our recent acquisition in addition our conservative assumption of a dramatic decline in covid testing demand will result in lower growth and operating margins relative to the record high margins we experienced during the covid crisis long term our foundational technology platform supports a strong margin profile and we will continue to manage our spending with discretion to drive operating leverage for the full year 2022 utilizing our 28 tax rate and share count of 32 4 million we now expect non gaap income to be approximately 6 per share for shareholders excluding stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets versus our previous guidance of 7 per share while acquisition of inform diagnostics is accretive from an adjusted ebitda standpoint and on a standalone basis we re also anticipating heightened operating expenses due to integration costs associated with the transaction aggressive investments in our organic business such as the build out and sales ramp of our west coast oncology lab as well as lower gross margins at the mix of covid testing decreases in the coming quarters for the second quarter 2022 specifically we expect total revenues of 125 million this breaks down into core revenues of at least 40 million representing growth of 78 year over year and as i mentioned we expect approximately 85 million in covid testing our updated guidance is posted in our slides on our investor relations website which shows a detailed breakdown i just discussed thank you for joining our call today operator now you can open it up for questions question and answer session operator and we ll take our first question from the line of kevin degeeter please go ahead your line is now open kevin degeeter hey great guys thanks for the comprehensive update maybe just can you talk about the continued sales force build out appreciate the update in terms of 50 reps just kind of really two questions as we look towards the end of the year how should we think about target either headcount number or just sort of infrastructure build and then with regard to kind of integration of the commercial team is that should we think about that process is substantial and maturing through the balance of 2022 you re really being at 2023 and beyond priority brandon perthuis yes thanks kevin itâ s brandon and the integration is ongoing and a top priority right now the acquisitions of csi inform diagnostics was meaningful increases in headcount across our sales organization so priority one integrate them into the fulgent system get them on common platforms get them into the posing culture and weâ re doing that in a very very rapid fashion that said while the sales team has grown in a big way we now have a much larger tam than we ve ever had before the sheer number of call points for some of these new markets we ve been able to enter both through organic expansion as well as m a is tremendous so i don t think we have a right side sales team so to speak i think there s tremendous opportunity for us to continue to increase that but in typical fulgent fashion we ll do it the smart way use the methodology we ve always had grown responsibly but like i said the tam that we now have is it s a big one and when youâ re looking forward to optimizing productivity out of the existing sales team leveraging those cross selling opportunities the team s coming together to work together to serve these clients but long term it s going to continue to grow kevin ming hsieh yes adding brendan s the comments as with the foreign current financial and products and service capabilities where are tracking a lot of new sales talents to our organization we receive a lot of inbound calls for this as a new time to join us and we will make the announcements as we continue to record the payments during the quarter kevin degeeter no great thanks for that and i appreciate the update on helio liver i mean i guess my question there though is really what is the most meaningful near term metric to choose think predicts ultimate commercial traction i think you called out if i were around 50 new accounts but what sort of a recurring metric we should look for the company disclosing to be able to track progress there brandon perthuis that s a good question kevin as i mentioned in the call we re trying to change the way the coalition coalition s practice medicine and especially in the hepatology space for liver cancer there s been no change in the way medicine has been practiced in a very long time right so they have their protocols and procedures now we know the test that we have is a big improvement over the standard of care that doesn t make it that much easier to change their thought process so they have to hear it a lot so we re proud of the fact that we ve on boarded 50 new accounts and that s kind of what we re tracking right now i think near term meaning sort of quarter in the next few quarters i d like to see us begin to sort of track volume and utility and maybe more importantly the volume would be the positivity rate we know in early data so far we have detected liver cancer that was going myth undiagnosed by standard of care so i think going forward we want to track volume and we want to track the utility of the test by tracking the positivity rate for ultrasound myth in early stage hepatocellular carcinoma ming hsieh but kevin adding on the brandon comment this is oncology centers the physicians they do recognize that this is a good test they do recognize that we re in the leading position to provide the better diagnosis and the cancer screenings so even though we see that we got traction from this physicians in terms of the liquid biopsy test but they also were interested in the full trade of gene so the products and service offerings it gave us were a good entry point for this physicians to explore our products and services and they will provide the one stop shopping for their test selections kevin degeeter that s great thank you ming i ll get back into queue thank you operator we ll take our next question from the line of david westenberg please go ahead your line is now open david westenberg hi thanks for the question questions and congrats on some good numbers here and there s a lot earnings going on so sorry if i missed this but it looks like on the guide you added 5 million just in the last two weeks which is pretty impressive on the core business kind of can you walk us through the difference did you find you know maybe inform is doing more revenue than you anticipated or is it maybe heating up of business trends that you know just you saw in the last two weeks brandon perthuis yes so thank you for taking notice that we raised our guidance even within the course of a week the reason why we guided hire isn t the strength of our overall core business it has nothing to do inform diagnostics because the outperformance that we had was for the first quarter we anticipated that we do we would do about 22 million in revenues during the quarter even with omicron and everything that was going on the actual numbers came in a little bit north of 25 million if you combine the momentum that we re seeing within our core business in addition to the contribution from inform dx we feel very comfortable with achieving at least 180 million of core revenues in this year david westenberg got it appreciate and paul i got another one for you you mentioned some commentary around asps going down with a decrease in covid testing relative to your prior guidance can you talk walk us through maybe quantitatively like what we re looking at in terms of the gross margins in the subsequent quarters i mean q2 and q3 are i mean i do think of as being maybe covid lights i wouldn t think any impact there but just walk us can you walk us through on kind of a new implied gross margin impacts paul kim sure so i ll talk about growth as well as operating margins so we made a very conservative assumption about covid testing demand because quite frankly nobody can predict what the virus is going to do so we re anticipating in q2 q3 and q4 a drastic drop off in terms of covid testing demand we re also making assumptions about a greater mix coming from our core part of our business and the other thing that we re also doing is we re investing heavily into our operations or facility we announced the opening of the oncology lab that is just one example so when you combine the conservative assumptions and the mix changes we re anticipating the gross margins to be at our historical levels of between 50 and 60 depending on which quarter you re looking at and if we have higher covid revenues because of the scale our gross margins everything being equal will slightly be higher that s the gross margins and then as far as the operating margins i talked about the heavy investments that we re making in our facilities we re also making capital investments or making investments in people across all departments of the company because of the foundation technology that we have now within operating expenses we anticipate an increase in r d spending and but proportionately less because the foundation technology that we have has so much efficiency and leverage behind it where we do believe we re going to be having the highest amount of operating expenses is in sales and marketing brandon talked about the size of the sales organization ming made some commentaries in sales and marketing you re going to see heavy investments that we re going to be making by hiring just a wide set of people because basically acquisitions and our enhanced capabilities we can address that much wider market we believe that we re in a position with the foundational technology which really gives us a leverage and the performance of making these aggressive investments doing m a also having a stock buyback program all these things we believe will enhance shareholder value david westenberg got it no thank you very much and actually that s a good segue to my last question here on m a can you talk about maybe some of the timing in terms of m a do you anticipate doing it this year and you mentioned the stock buyback program i mean is there a kind of an expiration date on making an acquisition where you know you maybe move to to stock buybacks i mean how do we think about a capital deployment from here on out recognizing that inform diagnostics really only was 170 million near billion dollars in cash paul kim i ll make a few commentaries and i ll turn it over to ming who can talk about the philosophy of enhancing shareholder value we believe that all these options that we have opened for us gives us a unique opportunity to address the market to set the pacing for the marketplace as to how we want to be able to penetrate certain spaces it gives us the flexibility to hire people and invest in our business and by the way if you take a look at the m a landscape the valuations of the assets that we have been paying attention to they re all coming in aligning themselves to business prospects and what we re willing to pay so from an approach standpoint we think that we re going to be busier than ever and the success that we re seeing and the synergies it s actually getting the team more excited about engaging some of these targets but i ll turn it over to ming who can talk about the usage of our cash the philosophy behind m a and our investments organically thank you paul thank you david for the question i think as in my paragraph during the discussion i focus on the science and technology i do believe fulgent has tremendous benefit in this market with the already existing team for the ai technology we want to be the leader in this area that becomes the forefront of the digital pathology using the ai technology we have a cumulative fight our existing teams but the addition will also focus on the other adjacent areas in a science and technology will give us the much much bigger a differentiator for us using the power platform the insurance payers infrastructure national sales team to penetrate even further and distinct from the current competitors that were competing elevate us to a new level and the premium generator better attractive than both the margins and for our shareholders david westenberg thank you ming thank you paul have a great job on the quarter paul kim thank you dave operator at this time there are no further questions this concludes today s call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect

2 million on sales of 212 255 ounces of gold gold ounces sold and revenues are comparable to q1 2021 the decrease in ounces sold from q4 2021 to q1 2022 was mainly due to decreased production at los

environmental agency minas gerais permitting the next tsf raise at rdm is delayed discussions with regulatory authorities are ongoing if the company is not able to achieve satisfactory resolution prior to the need to start the next raise in q2 2022 operations at the mine may be temporarily suspended commencing in q2 or q3 2022 the rdm tsf is raised on an intermittent basis throughout the mine life to store additional tailings produced from ongoing operations the tsf has been designed and is operated to industry best practices and is regularly inspected and audited by independent parties a design alteration was filed with supram in 2017 to change from a centreline to a downstream design which is considered the safest construction method and since 2018 each raise has been completed using a downstream design permits to raise the tsf using a downstream design were granted in 2019 and 2020 in 2020 the company requested a raise method formalization as an addendum to the license to operate confirming the change to a downstream design and in early 2021 supram granted the permit to raise the tsf to its current level in 2021 the company applied for a permit for the next tsf raise which has not been granted to date non ifrs measures the company s financial and operating results are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs this news release includes the

considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs numbers presented in the tables below may not sum due to rounding cash costs and cash costs per oz sold cash costs is a common financial performance measure in the gold mining industry however it has no standard meaning under ifrs the company reports total cash costs on a per oz sold basis the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs certain investors use this information to evaluate the company s performance and ability to generate operating income and cash flow from mining operations cash costs include mine site operating costs plus lease principal payments but are exclusive of depreciation and depletion reclamation capital and exploration costs and net of by product sales and then divided by ounces sold to arrive at cash costs per oz sold the measure is not necessarily indicative of cash flow from operations under ifrs or operating costs presented under ifrs aisc per oz sold the company is reporting aisc per oz of gold sold the methodology for calculating aisc was developed internally and is calculated below readers should be aware that this measure does not have a standardized meaning current ifrs measures used in the gold industry such as operating expenses do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover develop and sustain gold production the company believes the aisc measure provides further transparency into costs associated with producing gold and will assist analysts investors and other stakeholders of the company in assessing its operating performance its ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall value in calculating aisc the company includes silver by product credits as it considers the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by product sales incidental to the gold production process thereby allowing management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production the following table provides a reconciliation of cash costs per oz of gold sold and aisc per oz of gold sold to the most directly comparable

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video while leaks do escape the court the extent of monday s breach has major consequences for how the court functions both internally and as an institution of society washington the monday night leak of a preliminary draft opinion from the supreme court to overturn roe v wade sent shockwaves not just through the country but through the halls of the court a traditionally secretive and confidential institution for washington standards with chief justice john roberts confirming the authenticity of the draft the head of the supreme court also signaled that the leak was a singular and egregious breach of trust and ordered the court marshal to launch a formal investigation into the source of the breach the court has cautioned that no final decision on the case has been made the dramatic escalation of events has many wondering why exactly the court is reluctant to be more public about their inner workings and what the leak means for the future of the court why does the supreme court value confidentiality one of the big reasons for confidentiality is that the court values its candor of deliberations according to american university law professor stephen wermiel in other words public awareness and perception of opinions may push justices to not consider all legal arguments fairly if you are locked into an initial view because it s made public you won t be willing to consider other arguments or possibly changing your mind wermiel said i think they consider that quite integral that it really is necessary to have confidentiality to guarantee forthright consideration of issues in other cases leaks could give leeway for affected parties to act before a ruling said josh blackman a prominent court watcher and professor of law at the south texas college of law houston for example a draft leak involving a publicly traded company might cause investors to sell stocks preemptively what will happen to the whistleblower the probe into the leak signals the supreme court is determined to figure out who exactly released the draft people familiar with the internal workings of the court could identify around 70 people who might have access to a draft first of course are the nine justices themselves then there is the small group of staff that work for each justice finally there are the justices clerks young lawyers who work with the justices for a year in a highly prized position each justice has four clerks and secrecy is part of their job politico said it received the copy from a person familiar with the court s proceedings leading to speculation that a dissenter among the justices or their staff wanted to make it public however it s also possible that someone who liked the draft hoped that releasing the document would harden support for it wermiel said he could see the whistleblower being prosecuted for breaking federal law if their identify is discovered i think they will probably follow through on this whether that be theft of confidential material or dissemination of such material he said but it remains unclear whether such leak is considered a crime in a lengthy twitter feed law professor orin kerr at the university of california berkeley said that there is no law prohibiting the distribution of draft opinions but suggested prosecutors could charge the whistleblower against a broadly written statute that prohibits the misuse of government owned things of value if it were a justice that leaked the draft the consequences are even less limited according to jonathan peters professor of media law at the university of georgia he said that there are no code that would reign under these circumstances and beyond although articles of impeachment could be brought forward by congress related articles supreme court chief justice confirms draft abortion opinion is authentic what does this mean for the court going forward it is unclear what behind the scenes changes will occur in the court but many legal experts believe that this leak will negatively impact the both the public s trust in the supreme court and the professionalism among justices and clerks the collegiality in this the friendship of the court has to be at a low level right now said josh blackman i don t know how the justices will rebound from this it was such a simple decision that was done that will salt wound for decades stephen wermiel adds that while this is only a draft opinion and there could be changes down the road the leak negatively impacts the credibility of the court there s been a lot of criticism that the court is becoming more and more political and i think this does confirm the impression that the court is acting more politically every year jonathan peters added that the supreme court could and likely will also make internal changes to how justices and staff review and handle cases but it is unlikely these changes will ever be revealed to the public he also said that while that this leak certainly is equivalent to the sausage making process and the public may be dissuaded by the partisan nature of the court some may see this is a step in the right direction if they believe transparency is better for government institutions the answer to public trust is what roles leak play peters said do they act as a prophylactic in showing us what institutions are really like for people to read more about them and be critical of them or do you prefer to operate in a system where less is more and you don t know us a much but that allows you to have this false space within the institution

call over to mr sam ramraj vice president of investor relations mr ramraj you may begin your conference sam ramraj 00 29 thank you dextor and welcome everyone our speakers today are president and

update presentation 01 01 during this call we ll make forward looking statements about the outlook for edison international and its subsidiaries actual results could differ materially from current expectations important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our sec filings please read these carefully the presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non gaap measures to the nearest gaap measure 01 28 during the question and answer session please limit yourself to one question and one follow up i will now turn the call over to pedro pedro pizarro 01 37 thank you sam edison international reported core earnings per share of 1 07 compared to 0 79 a year ago we are reiterating our 2022 core eps guidance range of 4 40 to 4 70 and our longer term eps growth target of 5 to 7 through 2025 resulting in core eps of 5 50 to 5 90 maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks 02 08 over the last year iâ ve been updating you on sceâ s substantial reduction of wildfire risk relative to pre 2018 levels sce estimates it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfire by 65 to 70 and continued investments will further reduce this risk 02 26 when we look across all 17 000 circuit miles of distribution lines in sceâ s high fire risk area the utilityâ s grid hardening measures are focused on the roughly 10 000 miles that are above ground with the other 7 000 already being underground the cornerstone of sceâ s grid hardening measures is the wildfire covered conductor program a key benefit is how quickly it reduces wildfire risk 02 52 through the end of the first quarter sce has over 3 200 miles of covered conductor this is nearly double what was covered at the same time last year sce continues to drive this program forward and expects to have covered 40 of its overhead distribution lines or 4 000 of its 10 000 miles in its high fire risk areas by year end 03 15 the utility continues to adapt and update its wildfire mitigation plan to build on successes and learnings from the field most importantly sceâ s wmp is immediately actionable and the execution results in real risk reduction today and each day that sce hardens its grid in addition sce is preparing for this wildfire season by prioritizing its inspections and vegetation management programs 03 40 sce focuses its annual inspections on equipment that makes up 97 of total wildfire risk in 2022 and plans to accelerate completion of the vast majority of these inspections before september 1 03 54 today 166 cameras provide visibility to about 90 of high fire risk areas and planned installations in 2022 and beyond will increase coverage to nearly all of the utilityâ s hfra to enhance early fire detection sce is increasing installed weather stations by over 10 and using machine learning to further advance forecasting and target psps events more precisely taken together all of these efforts give sce confidence in its ability to mitigate wildfires associated with its equipment 04 29 turning to wildfire related settlements sce made substantial progress resolving 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events claims in the first quarter sce resolved over 700 million of claims driven by this progress and given sceâ s current assessment of claims the utility revised the best estimate of total losses higher by 416 million to a total of 7 9 billion 05 01 i would like to share the two factors that contributed to this revision first during the quarter there were a handful of exceptionally large claims that were settled based on new information that became available during settlement negotiations second as the statute of limitations for the woolsey fire approaches sce saw a higher than expected increase in the number of plaintiffs making claims 05 26 sce reviewed its estimate and determined it was appropriate to revise the best estimate which includes new provisions for future potential exceptionally large claims in total the utility has resolved over 80 of its best estimate of expected losses and continues to make steady progress in resolving claims 05 47 i would like to be clear that sce currently expects to seek full cpuc cost recovery of claims payments excluding amounts recoverable from insurance or ferc or foregone under the agreement with the safety enforcement division a related question weâ ve heard from the investment community is â when does sce expect to make that filing â 06 09 well based on the current pace of settlements sce anticipates filing its first application for cost recovery by late 2023 i strongly believe that sce operated its system prudently and will make a solid case in its filing the considerations sce will take into account in deciding the timing of its filings are described on page 4 06 31 another action i want to highlight is sceâ s recent legal challenge to inverse condemnation in the thomas and koenigstein fire litigation we have mentioned in past discussions that sce will always seek opportunities to challenge the doctrine of inverse condemnation 06 48 to that end in april the utility filed a notice of appeal with the california court of appeals challenging inverse condemnation cases like this generally take one to two years to reach a conclusion and we will keep you apprised of any meaningful developments 07 03 on the regulatory front sce recently filed its application for the 2023 cpuc cost of capital requesting a return on equity of 10 53 while maintaining its authorized equity layer at 52 as we have outlined since publishing the pathway 2045 vision economywide electrification is necessary to meet californiaâ s policy goals 07 27 sce will be a key enabler of the clean energy transition and will invest significant amounts of capital in its infrastructure we believe that sceâ s requested roe will support attracting this capital necessary to meet its obligations to provide safe reliable and resilient service and enable the stateâ s climate change adaptation and decarbonization goals separately sce is awaiting resolution of whether the cost of capital mechanism will operate for 2022 we have summarized sceâ s outstanding cost of capital applications on page 5 08 01 let me conclude by saying that we strongly believe edison international is the best investment vehicle to participate in californiaâ s clean energy transition sceâ s approach to wildfire mitigation has shown positive results over the last three wildfire seasons and the utility is expeditiously hardening the grid every day to the benefit of both our customers and our investors 08 25 as an electric only wires focused utility sceâ s ongoing investment in the grid will enable an electric led future by integrating clean resources while enhancing resilience and broader climate adaptation economywide electrification is the most affordable path to achieving californiaâ s climate goals 08 45 with that maria will provide her financial report maria rigatti 08 49 thank you pedro and good afternoon my comments today will cover first quarter 2022 results our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts sceâ s cost of capital applications and 2022 eps guidance 09 03 edison international reported core earnings of 1 07 per share for the first quarter an increase of 0 28 per share from the same period last year core eps increased year over year primarily due the adoption of the 2021 grc final decision in the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by interest expense from increased borrowings 09 26 on page 6 you can see sceâ s key first quarter eps drivers on the right hand side iâ ll highlight a few authorized revenue from the 2021 grc was higher by 0 35 for two reasons first the escalation mechanism for 2022 contributed 0 18 to the variance second because sce did not have a grc final decision in the first quarter of last year it was recording revenue at 2020 levels this timing difference contributed 0 17 to year over year q1 revenue growth 10 00 other cpuc revenue was 0 51 higher primarily related to the approval of grc track 2 with this approval sce recognized revenue for costs previously deferred to memo accounts note that this revenue increase was fully offset primarily by the recognition of 0 46 of o m resulting from the track 2 decision at eix parent and other the core loss was 0 06 higher in the first quarter this was primarily due to dividends on the preferred equity issued last year 10 33 now letâ s move to sceâ s capital expenditure and rate base forecasts page 7 shows sceâ s updated capital forecast to reflect its upcoming grc track 4 application which will be filed on may 13 track 4 covers funding for 2024 which is the third attrition year of sceâ s 2021 grc 10 54 in addition to requesting a revenue increase driven by the grc attrition mechanism and inflation sce will propose continued deployment of covered conductor beyond the over 5 000 miles expected to be installed by the end of 2023 11 10 i would like to reiterate pedroâ s earlier comment on sceâ s wildfire mitigation plan it is immediately actionable and the execution of the work results in real risk reduction today and each day that sce hardens its grid as shown on page 8 our capital forecast continues to result in projected rate base growth of 7 to 9 from 2021 to 2025 11 34 the forecast reflects sceâ s current view of the requests to be made in grc track 4 the 2025 grc and other applications we continue to see strong potential for sce to continue deploying capital and achieving 7 to 9 rate base growth through 2025 11 53 turning to guidance pages 9 and 10 show our 2022 guidance and the key assumptions for modeling purposes we are affirming our 2022 core eps guidance range of 4 40 to 4 70 sce is recording revenue based on its currently authorized cost of capital and will reflect the final decision in the 2022 cost of capital proceeding in the quarter in which it is received 12 19 as pedro mentioned we are awaiting resolution of whether the cost of capital mechanism will operate for 2022 after receiving a final decision from the cpuc we will provide an update on guidance to incorporate any changes in the roe and our outlook for the rest of the year 12 36 also embedded in our guidance is eixâ s 2022 financing plan which we disclosed last quarter and remains unchanged the revision to the best estimate of total expected losses does not change our plan also iâ ll remind you that the claims payments themselves are funded with debt issued by sce 12 55 iâ d like to provide some additional insight into two of sceâ s recent applications to the cpuc first sce filed a request to extend its cpuc capital structure waiver with respect to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events you may recall that the cpuc previously approved a waiver through the earlier of may 2022 or resolution of the 2017 and 2018 events 13 20 the waiver allows sce to exclude certain charges and debt when calculating compliance with its 52 authorized cpuc equity ratio sce has requested an extension of the waiver period until the cpuc resolves the last of sceâ s cost recovery applications for the 2017 and 2018 events 13 41 the current waiver remains in place until the cpuc rules on the recently filed application this provides sce with the flexibility to finance itself in a way that is efficient for customers and shareholders second in sceâ s 2023 cost of capital application it requested an roe of 10 53 consistent with its recently filed off cycle application this roe is at the upper end of the reasonable range estimated by sceâ s expert witness 14 12 we believe sce made strong arguments justifying its request and remind you that in sceâ s last cost of capital decision the cpuc concluded sceâ s roe should be at the upper end of the range under sceâ s proposed schedule the proceeding would conclude with a final decision by the end of the year 14 32 turning to page 11 i want to reiterate our growth opportunities that drive strong core earnings growth from 2021 through 2025 and highlight eixâ s potential to achieve double digit total shareholder return during that period a key component of our total return proposition is our common dividend which currently yields approximately 4 14 54 iâ m proud of our track record of 18 consecutive years of dividend growth and look forward to building on that history our eps growth of 5 to 7 is driven by sceâ s significant capital expenditure opportunities including investments in the safety and reliability of the grid sustainable rate base growth results from the investments necessary to reduce wildfire risk and investments to support infrastructure replacement and load growth 15 20 affordability is also a key consideration and i would like to emphasize that sce has the lowest system average rate among californiaâ s large ious this is in large part driven by our strong culture of excellent cost management that has been a cornerstone of the utility for more than a decade 15 38 that concludes my remarks thank you sam ramraj 15 40 dextor please open the call for questions as a reminder we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions question and answer session operator 15 52 our first question comes from shar pourreza of guggenheim partners shar your line is open shar pourreza 16 08 hey guys pedro pizarro 16 09 hi shar maria rigatti 16 10 hi shar shar pourreza 16 12 pedro first sort of in terms of the initial filings coming in 2023 itâ s obviously it is a great start to a resolution and it obviously implies that you would be filing multiple times for recovery how do we plan to separate the tranches is it kind of based on the percentage of value settled just want to get some clarity on the process from your standpoint how long the recovery regulatory recovery could take and if you donâ t have 90 of the claims settled are you still going to file in late 2023 and even why not file even sooner in 2022 if these are going to be in step functions pedro pizarro 16 49 shar all good part to the question we shared before that we expected the cpuc and expects to have this piece substantially complete our any given case before we go for cost recovery so weâ ve also said in the past that we see the 2017 thomas and koenigstein mudslide cases as one bundle and the woolsey case from 2018 as a separate bundle 17 15 so i think it would be natural to expect this â to see those as individual cost recovery packages and so we talked about being what we think will need to be at least 90 complete itâ s for any one of those packages before we then go file the application just to make sure our came across clearly based on the current track and pace with the litigation and settlements we would expect that earliest bundle to be at that 90 plus level by the end of 2023 so that ends our expectation we will be making a filing in late 2023 but again that is premised on continuing on the track that weâ ve been and if we donâ t expect this to be the case we currently expect to be there by late 2020 but if something happened you know that significantly delayed us from being off of that track 18 16 i donâ t know what that would be i know the round of covid that really led to shut down so something like that or might recall the early period of covid really put a halt on the piece of discussions donâ t expect it to happen but it is that kind of thing that could then throw the timing of the 2023 donâ t currently expect that to be the case shar pourreza 18 36 got it and then just i guess the was weâ re getting questions on â because you have 80 already almost resolved it seems like it is â substantialâ so why not file sooner but it makes sense it makes sense pedro and then just may be a question for maria as i was sort of thinking about potentially more cost increases as sort of the incremental 20 gets resolved what s the trigger for more equity back and as we think about the balance sheet capacity sort of other rating agencies comfortable with the current metrics and the approach you guys are taking how is the dialogue going i guess what s their sense of patients in anticipation of multiple filings for recovery thanks maria rigatti 19 17 sure thanks shar and i think generally our financing framework is 15 to 17 ffo is debt i think weâ re approximately at those levels right now i think as we go into next year i would say weâ re generally going to be sort of around the middle of that range i think the rating agencies first and foremost are interested in our risk reduction and that s the first order of any conversation we have with them 19 40 and so we ve been able to emphasize with the rating agencies that 65 to 70 risk reduction because of the hardening of the grid we continue to talk to them about the strong support we get from ab 1054 and so those are all the things that really are part and parcel of our rating agency discussions 19 57 you know from the comments we ve already made today that the change in the best estimate currently is not us to change our financing plan we re still on track with advancing plan we announced in q4 for 2022 and if we move forward subject to any changes â further changes in the estimate really it s going to depend on sort of the timing where we are etcetera but since we are in a good spot in our metrics i think that we ll continue to have constructive conversations with the rating agencies shar pourreza 20 27 got it that s what i wanted to sort of get if there s incremental cost increases you think you have enough cushion in your balance or thresholds not have to hit the equity markets that s the impetus maria rigatti 20 40 yes so we played out our longer term equity plan as well that follows our growth in the company and as we move through and into that 15 to 17 range that will just give us some more support in the balance sheet shar pourreza 20 53 okay terrific thank you guys so much pedro pizarro 20 56 thank you shar operator 20 57 our next question comes from steve fleishman wolfe research steve your line is open steve fleishman 21 06 yeah hi good afternoon thank you so just on the prudency cases any sense pedro maria how long those cases might take to adjudicate pedro pizarro 21 22 hard to predict in advance i would say first of all it starts with having a strong showing so we expect that our team will have a very strong showing put together when we file and as you can imagine the team has been working on that all along 21 37 once you go into a cpuc proceeding itâ s hard to estimate what that would be i d say typical time frames for cpuc proceedings can be and the short end something very fast maybe the 12 months 15 months sometimes it can take a little a little longer so we ll just have to see and i have a better gauge for how long it might take once we file and once we see what kind of initial set of intermediary actions are filed steve fleishman 22 06 okay that s helpful and then just related the estimate change this quarter you mentioned the exceptionally large claims and also the statute limitations hitting for woolsey like any reason why can t those things happen again i guess is there another statute of limitations on any of the fires still to come pedro pizarro 22 36 so for the 2017 and 2018 cases the remaining statute of is just we ll see that i thought it to to your broader question as we go along that uncertain count continues to narrow right because we have more settlements under our belt and you heard 80 number as you ll see in other disclosures we acknowledge it is possible we may see further changes because the reality is every individual case is different and frankly there can be new insights and new kinds of cases etcetera that show up 23 19 in this particular quarter as we mentioned we made great progress steve but frankly there was a small number of outlier cases where the ultimate claims were significantly larger than what we had expected based on the neighborhood these were in what you would expect for an average case in those and sale one thing that you are going to be saying is that we have now made provisions not only increasing the reserve for what we have seen but we also added a provision in the reserve now now expecting some of that previously unexpected right based on the experience we had we ve added provision or potential other exceedingly large individual claims exceeding what we had initially thought might be an average claim size so we try to learn from the continuous information we ve gotten make the provision for that but at the end of the day under gaap we would provide what we believe is our best estimate at this point in time maria rigatti 24 26 maybe iâ d just add one other thing steve because i think as we go through our best estimate exercise it is important we are looking at it every quarter and we ll continue â itâ s going to continue to be one of the big areas of management judgment but as i think about it i also think about all the things you ve accomplished that have brought us to this point we started with the public entity settlements we went to the tkm subrogation settlements 24 46 we went then to the subrogation claim settlement over the course of that time the attorney general has closed both of the increase into both woolsey and the tkm in just the last quarter q1 2022 we did 700 million in settlements so that s what brought us to this point where we made the revision but it s also what brought us to this point in terms of being able to highlight by late 2023 going in for a prudency review and filing an application 25 13 so i think all of that also factors into sort of how we thought about the quarter and how we re thinking about the go forward pedro pizarro 25 21 i think also maria and basically we keep taking uncertainty off the table steve fleishman 25 28 thank you for all that added color thank you pedro pizarro 25 31 yes thanks steve operator 25 33 our next question comes from ryan levine citi ryan your line is open ryan levine 25 39 hi good afternoon hi everybody two questions what s the status of the battery supply chain and execution and do you still see the august first date as realistic and i guess more broadly how do you viewing resource adequacy going into the remaining portion of the year pedro pizarro 25 56 yeah i ll kick off on that and actually i can also turn it over to steve powell in a minute here so ceo of the utility i think the headline on this is that as you know contractor for the sce 535 megawatt utility on storage project we are working with them under the contract there have been constraints in terms of the development of the whole supply chain as you can imagine what conditions in â particularly in china 26 31 we do see the potential for a portion of the project being online by august first but steve let me turn it over to you to provide some more commentary on this steve powell 26 42 sure so hey ryan the â like we talked about for the increased risk of delivery some of that s come through and at this point based on the project delays we re trying to get work with ameresco to ensure we get as many megawatts online as possible at this point we expect that there could be up to 300 megawatts online in august still subject to continued covid and shipping restrictions out of china but on the ground here work is progressing 27 16 with respect to the broader battery supply chain and really to your other question around resource adequacy as we look at this summer we feel that the state is in a slightly better position than it s been the last couple of summers with respect to capacity we re definitely focused on bringing our batteries online and ensuring other projects are getting online for this summer but still there ll be a lot of caution going into summer and there s is a lot effort going into ensuring we get more resources available 27 47 as you project beyond this year as we know the state is focused on bringing more than 11 000 megawatts of resources online by 2026 sceâ s portion of that is about 4 000 megawatts and so we continue to procure resources for 2023 2024 and then we ll be focused on 2025 and 2026 next 28 07 we re working on everything from interconnection to securing supplies and with all of our third parties to ensure that we can get enough resources in the state to ensure the liability and that s sceâ s job as well as the other entities within the state so this summer we ll be in a better position than the last few summers pedro pizarro 28 26 and steve iâ ll give a lot of credit not only to other load serving entities like sce but the cpuc the governorâ s office i think everybody is very focused on continuing to reduce the risk in california ryan levine 28 40 thanks and i guess one follow up in terms of the cost recovery if you re going to file that in late 2023 how are you currently looking at use of proceeds maria rigatti 28 52 hey ryan it s maria i mean obviously we have some â upon recovery we have some de levering to do sce has issued a bunch of debt to support the claims payments and eix has as well issued press to support the balance sheet so when we get through that and we ll figure out what the next steps are with the use of proceeds ryan levine 29 12 appreciate the color thank you pedro pizarro 29 14 thanks much ryan operator 29 16 our next question comes from sophie karp keybanc sophie your line is open sophie karp 29 22 hi good afternoon thank you for taking my question so to follow up on this battery project right so i think your equity needs for this year were a little higher to accommodate the cost of this project versus kind of like 250 run rate that you communicated for other periods should we expect that to sort of come down because of the potential delays with this project or should we not expect that maria rigatti 29 50 sophie we still plan to deploy the full capital plan this year so it would impact on our financing plan sophie karp 29 57 got it thank you and then could you talk a little bit more about the reason that you will challenge to inverse condemnation that we discussed in your prepared remarks i guess question is where could this go and given the potential outcomes what are the implications for the current legal proceedings or the framework in the state and how should we view this help us pedro pizarro 30 22 let me turn this over to adam umanoff whoâ s our general counsel sophie adam umanoff 30 26 hey sophie good afternoon so the utility had the opportunity to enter into a settlement with a particular plaintiff that we now are able to appeal to an court here in california the issue is the application in inverse condemnation to investor own utilities and as we said before we think that the existing law is misguided that investor on utilities should not be strictly liable for damages arising from wildfires that are ignited by their equipment 31 01 and there s an imbalance in the way the court has imposed strict liability against investor on utilities versus the fact that we need to ship prudence in cost recovery proceedings with our regulator so if we are successful in winning an appeal we would no longer be subject to strict liability in a wildfire case rather plaintiffs would need to show that we were negligent in the construction and operation of our equipment to pursue damages that would be a significant improvement in the liability exposure than investor on utilities have in california sophie karp 31 43 so would that apply to only like prior cases of wildfire damages or prospectively as well adam umanoff 31 51 it would only apply respectively as a practical matter we live with the current law that we have for cases that have been settled those would not be reopened but for even current cases that have not yet been resolved if we were to win an appeal that would be new law and that law would apply to pending cases but the appeal process is likely to take some time so i wouldn t expect an immediate answer from an sophie karp 32 20 right so if you won would that sort of greatly diminish the need for the current i guess wildfire framework or in the states adam umanoff 32 31 well there s a question of what the utilities liability is on the one hand a separate issue is recovering costs in a wildfire case under a prudence review which would still happen under ab 1054 pedro pizarro 32 49 i think sophie said another way inverse condemnation really is about speaking here but thatâ s another avenue for cases and surcharges against the utility ab 1054 is really about defining the the most important part in our view is really finding the prudency framework under which utilities can seek cost recovery or fire damages that have to the utility 33 19 so doing away with interest condemnation by reduce the â potentially the exposure for utilities but once those exposure for utility ab 1054 is all about how the utility first pays for those damages in the first instance right in terms of accessing the fund and then more importantly over time the utility makes the case for cost recovery and demonstrating that it s been prudent so that is important i think in any scenario and we re glad to have that strong piece of legislation sophie karp 33 52 alright thank you for the color pedro pizarro 33 54 yes thanks very much sophie sophie karp 33 55 thank you operator 33 57 our next question comes from jonathan arnold vertical research partners jonathan your line is open jonathan arnold 34 02 hi good afternoon guys just a quick one on these larger claims pedro you re talking about and if i understood you correctly you have some that you ve already seen that were much bigger than you thought they would be and then you ve also made a provision for potentially others that might come in larger can you give us any more color of these sort of claims you kind of know are coming and that you have the identified is just a question of how big is it going to be or is it more a case of new claims are just popping up you might not have had on your radar i donâ t know if you can share anything there pedro pizarro 34 46 no so as you might imagine jonathan i can t share anything about the radar because that would be active litigation or settlement discussions but maybe i can give you an illustration of one case without getting view any sort of detail these are personal property cases right and that s by and large where we are seeing some these larger than expected cases 35 11 and so as i mentioned earlier the way we developed the best estimate and the first instance was we understand what the neighbor head is when we are what the average value of homestays we make provisions for the average value of contents in that average home but not on home average and we know right and i think the average expense accounts and it will be a little higher so will be a little bit lower 35 33 well in the case of this last quarter we saw a handful â a number of cases that were exceedingly large and one of them to illustrate it one example is make sure that adam is okay with my as i speak but there was a case of an individual homeowner who happened to have a very expensive automobile production into the garage 35 59 well above and beyond what the kinds of cars that people keep in very often neighborhood this was an exceptional case where you basically had and you see them quality collection with lots and lots of cars 36 14 very hard to predict that upfront we did not build a provision for that kind of amazing car collection in anybodyâ s garage when we built the best estimate and so the reserve now includes our provisions for what we paid and it also has included our provisions for business statistical analysis some number and i m not going to be very specific about this obviously because we are in active mitigation but we now have included in our provision for some number of additional exceptionally large cases in the that we re working for does that help illustrate it jonathan jonathan arnold 36 55 i think so yeah thank you for that pedro and if i may just on that tail and how â it is my follow up the new best estimate is 7 9 youâ ve got 1 3 sort of unresolved which is actually sort of closer to 85 really in round numbers 37 16 so and if you continue to â you obviously resolved 700 million in this quarter given what you re saying about timing and the 90 target it feels like you must be anticipating quite a slowdown and pace of resolution here maria rigatti 37 33 actually jonathan this is maria i think i mean you could see some slowdown because obviously as cases progress people may decide to come in more slowly but i d think it is about a couple of things it s 90 plus we ll see what s in that last 10 or so the complexity of those cases that in the form timing regardless of quantum there are a couple of other things related to the litigation that we are also tracking one of them is includes where the intravenous case around the safety important division settlement stands 38 07 so we took a few things related to litigation it s the individual plaintiff claims settlement process for sure there are few other things that are going to inform our timings but we think based on all of those different components that we be filing for our first application by late 2023 jonathan arnold 38 23 great thank you for all that pedro pizarro 38 26 thanks jonathan operator 38 29 our next question comes from michael lapides goldman sachs michael your line is open michael lapides 38 34 hey guys thank you for taking my question just curious can you remind me your eps compound growth rate that 5 to 7 annual growth that doesn t incorporate any outcome as part of 5 2 billion cost recovery is that right maria rigatti 38 54 that s correct so â because it seems now recovery michael lapides 38 58 it assumes you re a recovery so your rate base growth is still faster than your eps growth and this â i assume those proceeds if there were any regardless of how much mostly would go to debt reduction and therefore would reduce interest expense maria rigatti 39 16 so yeah our rate based growth exceeds our earnings growth partly because of the investment to have that growth to the eix financing plan but also the debt associated with those wildfire claims payments is a drag on the growth rate so to the extent we get recovery and reduce those are able to reduce that then we will certainly have lower interest expense michael lapides 39 39 got it okay that s super helpful and just curious when we think about if you were to get proceeds in does it all go to kind of pay down debt that s at the utility or would you think about some being used to pay down any capitalization on top of the holding company level maria rigatti 39 59 sure well i think we could do a mix of things right there is definitely the dollars of the utility eix elected to use prep last year because it is more flexible if you think about in five years weâ ll have an opportunity to call it reset it what have you so that we can do a mix of things to the extent we get the recovery michael lapides 40 19 got it thanks guys much appreciate it maria pedro pizarro 40 23 yes michael operator 40 24 our next question comes from gregg orrill ubs gregg your line is open gregg orrill 40 30 yeah thank you i was wondering â sorry if youâ ve covered this i was wondering if you could review the sort of recovery mechanism how it gets into rate base the incremental covered conductor miles above that 4 500 level maria rigatti 40 52 sure so in grc track 1 we were authorized for covered conductor including a balancing account that allows us to go up to the 4 500 mile level for amounts up above that level we would file an application and the commission would review the resemblance of that we re already contemplating going beyond the 4 500 and when we file our â we have about 5 000 plus by the end of 2023 so there will be an application associated with that and then in track 4 which is for 2024 we will be proposing additional covered conductor miles and it would be approved as part of track 4 gregg orrill 41 38 okay thank you operator 41 42 our next question comes from richard sutherland jpmorgan chase richard your line is open richard sutherland 41 50 hi good afternoon thank you for the time just wanted to circle back to the financing outlook now that there is the late 2023 target on the wildfire liability application for cost recovery in that timeframe meaning from now through late 2023 what is your capacity to carry incremental claims without associated incremental equity need maria rigatti 42 18 so i think i ll go back to sort of the perspective on our balance sheet right now we re generally in that 15 to 17 ffo to debt ranges our framework generally around that 15 level going to next year we would also generally see ourselves moving farther into that into that band or that range you know that we ve just announced that we had a revision to the estimate and have not had to change our financing plan 42 44 we re still committed to the financing plan we disclosed on the q4 call as we move into next year and our balance sheet gets stronger yet we ll have more room and more opportunities or anything that might happen we absolutely are reiterating our financing plan for 2022 but given all of the fluctuations and volatility in the market we actually took a term loan out at eix to give ourselves more time and more flexibility to actually execute on that plan 43 12 so we re really focused primarily richard on flexibility and kind of executing in the best possible way richard sutherland 43 23 understood so just mechanically it s really that 13 to 17 range to keep in mind and i guess sort of movements within that range versus saying the midpoint is an outlook for now maria rigatti 43 34 that s right i mean that 15 to 17 range is the range and we re going to use the range richard sutherland 43 40 got it very clear and then hopefully just a clean up question saw that 2024 rate base ticked down a little bit but 2025 is unchanged just any moving parts to call out behind that revision maria rigatti 43 54 yes good question it actually does not have to do with our capital execution if you see our capital plan is pretty â very very close to where it was when we did our q4 call the change in 2024 is related to i ll say two very broad buckets mostly around timing both timing of applications and timing of when we adjust or get authorization to adjust some working capital items that impact rate base so you ll see that there is a change in 2024 but 2025 hasn t changed richard sutherland 44 25 great thank you for the color operator 44 29 our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america julien your line is open julien dumoulin smith 44 36 thank you operator good afternoon everyone thanks for the time so just coming back to where we started the q a here can we talk a little bit or at the new information during settlement negotiations that led to your desire to settle just can you elaborate to the best extent possible on just what led to that twist here at this point pedro pizarro 44 57 hey julien so i think i covered it pretty well with jonathanâ s question right because that question went a bit to what were some of the extraordinary cases and i think that s related to your question what would have let us to settle cases that we thought were significantly larger and then we might have expected based on our prior analysis so i m not sure i have a whole lot to add there just maybe to reiterate the points and then we set this in the past as well julien 45 32 we re nothing about consistent on these calls and the reality is that each of these cases is an individual case and as you know case by case by case by case across thousands of cases and i give a lot of credit to our team they ve done a great job both the internal team and with outside support and trying to get our arms around this from the very beginning and do mappings of the areas that were impacted and have a sense of what kind of household are in each neighborhood that was impacted and obviously thinking about the tragic toll on too many families and so developing a number of estimates that led to the best estimate 46 13 initially you might recall we didn t provide you a best estimate we were only able to provide you a low end of the range because weâ re still at such a large part of the uncertainty come that we couldn t develop the best estimate as we got more experience under our belt we progressed and we re able to shift through the best estimate but to be candid about it thereâ s been learnings and surprises along the way and not â if there are no surprises there are surprises right with this kind of complex very large case 46 43 and so again going back to what i in response to jonathanâ s question we saw and i think the biggest driver this quarter was seeing a small number of very large cases that were well beyond the scope of what we had and anticipated making â taking a reserve for those cases that we ve now settled taking an additional reserve amount anticipating that we might find more surprises in the rest of the tail that s remaining and then of course the second big factor that i mentioned in my prepared remarks was also adjusting for the number of that we re seeing 47 22 that s about all the color we can give you at this point julien but it s been i think a very deliberate process on the part of our team very methodical and it s just to reality of the statistics and frankly the probability curve across thousands and thousands of cases julien dumoulin smith 47 43 pedro if i can clarify actually maybe to bifurcate or distinguish from jonathanâ s question i hear you in addressing sort of the different settling pattern in the quantum and maybe that s driving a different estimate but maybe the nuance here and what s intriguing is why settle right why is that triggering a decision to settle is it simply just understanding what the mark to market is and the gets resolved or is there some new information that s driving settlements if you can distinguish between the two pedro pizarro 48 14 yes i think the best way to answer your question is again we go case by case let me extreme here we have not come across this one yet but we saw that there was a particular who was making a demand that was so out of field that baffled the logic of settling i don t think we would settle at that point right and that might be a case that we would decide to take the trial at the end of the day 48 45 so i don t think there s any systemic big news or change at saying we have changed our approach to settlements these really have been bottom up case by case decisions around okay we understand the fact better in this case we understand what arguments we have in our favor arguments might our favor we have some sense of where our jury might we have a sense of what the continuing costs are in pursuing litigation which by the way has its own set of costs alright that s just the legal process 49 22 and further in the like and so we continue to make those judgments on a case by case basis there if your question is asking is there something else that that you are aware of or that we re aware of or is there something more systemic or something that is influencing how we think about settling differently from a quarter ago the answer would be no 49 45 does that help with your question julien julien dumoulin smith 49 47 yeah absolutely thank you for the time and patience pedro pizarro 49 52 thank you julien operator 49 56 that was our last question i will now turn the call back over to mr sam ramraj sam ramraj 50 02 well thank you for joining us this concludes the conference call have a good rest of the day and stay safe you may now disconnect

consolidated gold production was lower by 5 11 279 ounces due to the planned significant waste stripping campaign and lower mined ore tonnage at the fekola mine in the first quarter of 2022 as phase 6 of the fekola pit continues to be developed in the first half of 2022 for the first quarter of 2022 total consolidated cash operating costs including estimated attributable results for calibre were 699 per ounce produced 656 per ounce sold well below budget by 94 per ounce produced 12 and consolidated cash operating costs from the company s three operating mines were 676 per ounce produced 630 per ounce sold well below budget by 103 per ounce produced 13 these favourable budget variances were attributable to higher than budgeted gold production lower than budgeted stripping costs and lower than budgeted realized fuel prices at the fekola mine which were partially offset by higher than budgeted fuel prices at the masbate and otjikoto mines as expected total consolidated cash operating costs were higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 609 per ounce produced 582 per ounce sold in the first quarter of 2021 and consolidated cash operating costs were higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 581 per ounce produced 552 per ounce sold in the first quarter of 2021 mainly as a result of the planned lower gold production and higher costs for fuel and other consumables for the first quarter of 2022 total consolidated aisc including estimated attributable results for calibre were 1 036 per ounce sold q1 2021 932 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 318 per ounce sold 23 and consolidated aisc from the company s three operating mines were 1 028 per ounce sold q1 2021 919 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 339 per ounce 25 these favourable budget variances were attributable to lower than budgeted cash operating costs higher than budgeted gold ounces sold and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures 33 million which is expected to be incurred later in 2022 for full year 2022 the company s total gold production is forecast to be between 990 000 and 1 050 000 ounces including 40 000 and 50 000 attributable ounces projected from calibre with total consolidated cash operating costs forecast to be between 620 and 660 per ounce and total consolidated aisc forecast to be between 1 010 and 1 050 per ounce notwithstanding the ongoing sanctions on mali announced by the economic community of west african states ecowas on january 9 2022 including closure of a number of the borders with mali the fekola mine continues to operate at full capacity and the company expects to meet its 2022 production guidance for the fekola mine due to the timing of high grade ore mining consolidated gold production from the company s three operating mines is expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2022 for the first half of 2022 consolidated gold production is forecast to be between 390 000 and 410 000 ounces which is expected to increase significantly to between 560 000 and 590 000 ounces during the second half of 2022 based mainly on the weighting of production and timing of stripping consolidated guidance ranges for cash operating costs are expected to be between 760 and 800 per ounce in the first half of 2022 before significantly improving to between 490 and 530 per ounce during the second half of 2022 in addition consolidated guidance ranges for aisc are expected to be between 1 250 and 1 290 per ounce in the first half of 2022 before significantly improving to between 820 and 860 per ounce during the second half of 2022 as previously disclosed the company s operations continue to be impacted by global cost inflation however despite these ongoing cost pressures the draw downs of existing inventories proactive management and the revised sequencing of some capital costs means that consolidated cash operating costs and aisc in the first quarter of 2022 were lower than budget the company will continue to closely monitor the levels of cost inflation over the remainder of 2022 b2gold s projects and operations continue to target long term cash flow and value at industry leading costs per ounce of gold produced 2022 first quarter financial results for the first quarter of 2022 consolidated gold revenue was 366 million on sales of 195 100 ounces at an average realized gold price of 1 874 per ounce compared to 362 million on sales of 202 330 ounces at an average realized gold price of 1 791 per ounce in the first quarter of 2021 the slight increase in gold revenue of 1 4 million was 5 attributable to the increase in the average realized gold price offset by a 4 impact from the decrease in gold ounces sold mainly due to the lower gold production for the first quarter of 2022 cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in non cash working capital was 152 million 0 14 per share compared to 171 million 0 16 per share in the first quarter of 2021 cash

2022 totaled 59 million q1 2021 21 million including approximately 15 million related to 2021 outstanding tax liability obligations based on current assumptions the company expects to generate consolidated cashflows from operating activities of approximately 625 million for full year 2022 expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2022 the benefit of higher gold prices realized in the first quarter of 2022 is expected to be offset by the impacts of cost inflation and delays in the recovery of vat receivables in addition based on current assumptions the company is forecasting to make total cash income and withholding tax payments including priority dividend payments for full year 2022 of approximately 290 million net income for the first quarter of 2022 was 91

production of 101 648 ounces slightly above budget by 1 917 ounces as higher than budgeted processed grade 6 offset lower than budgeted processed tonnes 5 based on a reduction in saprolite processed as a precautionary measure to hedge against potential supply chain problems arising from ecowas sanctions the fekola mine proactively prioritized the processing of high grade fresh ore to reduce reagent consumption and ensure that sufficient reagents remained available to process higher grade ore to meet budgeted gold production which resulted in lower than budgeted throughput for the first quarter of 2022 although the sanctions continue the situation has normalized as regular imports of reagents were received by fekola in february and march 2022 as a result saprolite ore was reintroduced back into the fekola mill feed blend at the end of february 2022 and the processing of saprolite ore resumed as planned and is ongoing fekola s gold production is expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2022 when mining reaches the higher grade portion of phase 6 of the fekola pit and cardinal operations are at full capacity as expected compared to the first quarter of 2021 fekola s gold production was lower by 19 23 440 ounces due to planned significant waste stripping and lower mined ore tonnage as phase 6 of the fekola pit continues to be developed in the first half of 2022 for the first quarter of 2022 mill feed grade was 1 54 grams per tonne g t compared to budget of 1 45 g t and 1 99 g t in the first quarter of 2021 mill throughput was 2 20 million tonnes compared to budget of 2 31 million tonnes and 2 07 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2021 and gold recovery averaged 93 3 compared to budget of 93 5 and 94 4 in the first quarter of 2021 for the first quarter of 2022 as described above processed grade was above budget while processed tonnes were below budget mainly due to the brief temporary suspension of processing saprolite ore offset by the processing of higher grade ore in january and february 2022 processed grade was lower compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to the planned significant waste stripping campaign in the first quarter of 2022 for the first quarter of 2022 fekola s cash operating costs were 624 per ounce produced 583 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 157 per ounce produced 20 mainly as a result of lower than budgeted mining processing and site general costs these favourable cost variances were mainly attributable to lower than budgeted fuel prices realized in the first quarter of 2022 as fuel prices are set in advance by the state and therefore subject to timing delays between market fuel price increases and those experienced at the fekola mine and below budgeted volumes of fuel and other consumables utilized due to lower overall tonnes mined and processed compared to budget mined tonnes were lower than budget due to a temporary change in mine sequencing to accommodate the temporary change in saprolite processing as discussed above over 20 of the power generated in first quarter of 2022 was solar resulting in over 3 5 million litres of fuel savings and a reduction of over 11 000 tonnes of carbon emissions in the first quarter of 2022 as expected fekola s cash operating costs were higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 503 per ounce produced 479 per ounce sold in the first quarter of 2021 mainly as a result of the planned lower gold production higher fuel and other consumable costs and increased mining costs from operating deeper in the fekola pit fekola s aisc for the first quarter of 2022 were 987 per ounce sold q1 2021 770 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 342 per ounce sold 26 mainly attributable to the lower than budgeted cash operating costs higher than budgeted gold ounces sold and lower sustaining capital expenditures 14 million mainly due to the timing of pre stripping the lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were primarily a result of timing of pre stripping and are expected to be incurred later in 2022 capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2022 totaled 28 million primarily consisting of 14 million for pre stripping 6 million for mobile equipment for the cardinal zone 4 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds for fekola and 4 million for the tailings storage facility dam raise on february 2 2022 the company announced an updated mineral resource estimate for the cardinal zone adjacent to the fekola mine the updated resource included a significantly increased mineral resource estimate for cardinal zone as at december 31 2021 with an initial indicated mineral resource estimate of 8 000 000 tonnes at 1 67 g t gold for 430 000 ounces of gold and an updated inferred mineral resource estimate of 19 000 000 tonnes at 1 21 g t gold for 740 000 ounces of gold constrained within a conceptual pit run at us 1 800 per ounce gold approximately 50 000 ounces has been budgeted to be produced from the cardinal zone in 2022 and included in fekola s 2022 production guidance based on engineering studies completed to date the cardinal zone has the potential to add an average of approximately 60 000 ounces per year over the next 6 to 8 years to fekola s annual gold production the low cost fekola mine is expected to produce between 570 000 and 600 000 ounces of gold in 2022 at cash operating costs of between 510 and 550 per ounce and aisc of between 840 and 880 per ounce for the first half of 2022 fekola s gold production is expected to be between 220 000 and 230 000 ounces which is expected to increase significantly to between 350 000 and 370 000 ounces during the second half of 2022 based mainly on the weighting of production and timing of pre stripping fekola s cash operating costs are expected to be between 720 and 760 per ounce in the first half of 2022 before significantly improving to between 380 and 420 per ounce during the second half of 2022 in addition fekola s aisc are expected to be between 1 140 and 1 180 per ounce in the first half of 2022 before significantly improving to between 660 and 700 per ounce during the second half of 2022 masbate gold mine the philippines the masbate mine in the philippines had a strong start to the year with first quarter of 2022 gold production of 59 764 ounces above budget by 11 5 711 ounces and 4 2 251 ounces higher compared to the first quarter of 2021 mainly due to higher processed grade for the first quarter of 2022 mill feed grade was 1 19 g t compared to budget of 1 09 g t and 1 10 g t in the first quarter of 2021 mill throughput was 2 01 million tonnes compared to budget of 1 93 million tonnes and 1 95 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2021 and gold recovery averaged 78 0 compared to budget of 79 7 and 83 6 in the first quarter of 2021 processed grade was above budget in the first quarter of 2022 due to mining additional unbudgeted higher grade areas identified within the planned mining areas in addition mine haulage optimizations related to the expansion of the tailings facility resulted in shorter than planned hauls of waste and increased mining rates and contributed to the above budgeted mined high grade ore tonnage in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 gold recoveries were lower as a result of processing a higher proportion of fresh rock ore in the first quarter of 2022 for the first quarter of 2022 masbate s cash operating costs were 710 per ounce produced 785 per ounce sold well below budget by 51 per ounce produced 7 mainly the result of higher gold production partially offset by higher than budgeted diesel and hfo costs as expected masbate s cash operating costs were higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 608 per ounce produced 578 per ounce sold in the first quarter of 2021 mainly as a result of higher fuel and other consumable costs masbate s aisc for the first quarter of

partially offset by lower than budgeted gold sales the lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were primarily a result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2022 capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2022 totaled 6 million including 2 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds and 2 million for tailings storage facility projects and other processing related capital the masbate mine is expected to produce between 205 000 and 215 000 ounces of gold in 2022 with cash operating costs of between 740 and 780 per ounce and aisc of between 1

quarter of 2022 producing 35 061 ounces of gold 5 1 803 ounces above budget with processed tonnes grade and recoveries all slightly better than budget as a result of the timing of higher grade ore mining otjikoto s gold production is expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2022 when mining is scheduled to reach the higher grade portions of phase 3 of the otjikoto pit and ore production ramps up at the wolfshag underground mine as expected compared to the first quarter of 2021 gold production was significantly higher by 52 12 019 ounces as processed ore in the first quarter of 2021 was primarily sourced from existing stockpiles while significant waste stripping operations continued at both the wolfshag and otjikoto pits for the first quarter of 2022 mill feed grade was 1 31 g t compared to budget of 1 26 g t and 0 82 g t in the first quarter of 2021 mill throughput was 0 85 million tonnes compared to budget of 0 84 million tonnes and 0 89 million tonnes in

for the first quarter of 2022 were 878 per ounce sold q1 2021 1 475 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 457 per ounce sold 34 mainly due to lower than budgeted cash operating costs higher than budgeted gold ounces sold and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures 5 million the lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were primarily a result of timing and are expected to be incurred later in 2022 capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2022 totaled 16 million primarily consisting of 6 million for pre stripping in the otjikoto pit 6 million for wolfshag underground mine development 2 million for mobile equipment rebuilds and replacements and 2 million for the national power grid connection line development of the wolfshag underground mine continues to progress with first development ore production expected to commence in the first half of 2022 the initial underground mineral reserve estimate for the down plunge extension of the wolfshag deposit includes 210 000 ounces of gold in 1 2 million tonnes of ore at 5 57 g t gold the otjikoto mine is expected to produce between 175 000 and 185 000 ounces of gold in 2022 with cash operating costs of between 740 and 780 per ounce and aisc of between 1 120 and 1 160 per ounce for the first half of 2022 otjikoto s gold production is expected to be between 65 000 and 70 000 ounces

the anaconda area comprised of the menankoto permit and the bantako north permit located approximately 20 kilometres from the fekola mine the updated and significantly increased anaconda mineral resource estimate as at january 11 2022 constrained within a conceptual pit shell at a gold price of 1 800 per ounce included an initial indicated mineral resource estimate of 32 400 000 tonnes at 1 08 g t gold for a total 1 130 000 ounces of gold and inferred mineral resource estimate of 63 700 000 tonnes at 1 12 g t gold for 2 280 000 ounces of gold the mineral resource estimate included first time reporting of 1 130 000 ounces of indicated mineral resources and an increase of 1 510 000 ounces 196 increase of inferred mineral resources since the initial inferred mineral resource estimate in 2017 21 590 000 tonnes at 1 11 g t gold for 767 000 ounces in 2022 the company has budgeted 33 million for development of infrastructure for phase i saprolite mining at the anaconda area including road construction based on the updated mineral resource estimate and b2gold s preliminary planning the company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the anaconda area could provide selective higher grade saprolite material average grade of 2 2 g t to be trucked to and fed into the fekola mill commencing as early as late 2022 at a rate of 1 5 million tonnes per annum subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final development plan the trucking of selective higher grade saprolite material to the fekola mill would increase the ore processed and annual gold production from the fekola mill with the potential to add an average of approximately 80 000 to 100 000 ounces per year to the fekola mill s annual gold production the plan to truck the selective higher grade saprolite material is not included in the company s 2022 production guidance and the anaconda area mineral resources have not been included in the current fekola life of mine plan based on the updated mineral resource estimate and the 2022 exploration drilling results the company has commenced a phase ii scoping study to review the project economics of constructing a stand alone mill near the anaconda area subject to receipt of a positive phase ii scoping study the company expects that the saprolite material would continue to be trucked to and fed into the fekola mill during the construction period for the anaconda area stand alone mill in 2022 the company is drilling to infill and extend the saprolite resource area and to follow up on the sulphide mineralization at the anaconda area including the mamba and adder zones and several other targets below the saprolite mineralization the good grade and width combinations at the anaconda area continue to provide a strong indication of the potential for fekola style south plunging bodies of sulphide mineralization which remains open down plunge four drill rigs are currently drilling in the anaconda area in april 2022 the company acquired the bakolobi permit in mali from a local malian company the bakolobi permit is located between the menankoto permit to the north and the fekola mine s medinandi permit wrapping around the latter to its south west end covering an area of 100 km2 the acquisition of the bakolobi permit results in the ownership by the company of four contiguous exploration and or exploitation permits covering 237 km2 extending from the northwestern end of the bantako north permit and the north east of the menankoto permit southwest of the medinandi permit fekola mine and cardinal zone to the southeast end of the bakolobi permit gramalote project b2gold 50 anglogold ashanti limited anglogold 50 colombia following a review of gramalote s feasibility study work to date b2gold believes that there is strong potential to improve the economics of the project economic highlights were previously released on may 4 2021 based on the feasibility study work to date which could be developed by revisiting the original gramalote project design parameters included in the existing mining permit as applied in the gramalote preliminary economic assessment in january 2020 and historical anglogold studies and further optimizing project design review of the updated gramalote ridge mineral resource also shows that further value can be created through additional drilling of the inferred portions of the mineral resource area both within and adjacent to the designed pit an updated revised budget that has been prepared to carry the gramalote project to completion of the feasibility study is currently under review by b2gold and anglogold the revised budget will fund ongoing the gramalote feasibility study optimization exploration community support continued advancement of key social commitments and compliance with regulatory and environmental impact assessment requirements a separate construction budget is expected to be developed subsequently upon a positive optimized

projected from calibre with total consolidated cash operating costs of between 620 660 per ounce and total consolidated aisc of between 1 010 1 050 per ounce following the receipt of the menankoto permit in mali the company is expanding the scope of its exploration activities on the anaconda area comprised of the menankoto permit and the bantako north permit to build on the successful exploration programs already completed to date the company will continue to follow up on the sulphide mineralization at the mamba adder and several other targets below the saprolite mineralization in 2022 in april 2022 the company completed the acquisition of the bakolobi permit from a local malian company the bakolobi permit is located between the menankoto permit to the north and the fekola mine s medinandi permit wrapping around the latter to its south west end covering an area of 100 km2 the acquisition of the bakolobi permit results in the ownership by the company of four contiguous exploration and or exploitation permits covering 237 km2 extending from the northwestern end of the bantako north permit and the north east of the menankoto permit southwest of the medinandi permit fekola mine and cardinal zone to the southeast end of the bakolobi permit b2gold s preliminary planning has demonstrated that a pit situated on the anaconda area could provide saprolite material to be trucked to and fed into the fekola mill commencing in late 2022 increasing the ore processed and annual gold production from the fekola mill subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final mine plan based on the updated mineral resource estimate and the 2022 exploration drilling results the company has commenced a phase ii scoping study to review the project economics of constructing a stand alone mill near the anaconda area subject to receipt of a positive phase ii scoping study the company expects that the saprolite material would continue to be trucked to and fed into the fekola mill during the construction period for the anaconda area stand alone mill the potential to truck material from the anaconda area in late 2022 is currently being developed and is not included in fekola s 2022 production guidance or the current fekola life of mine plan the company also continues to advance its other development project with work continuing on the gramalote project

provided by operating activities the company realized net cash provided by operating activities of 104 million up 148 from the first quarter of 2021 material growth in funds flow from operations 1 funds flow from operations 1 increased to 87 million up by 34 from the fourth quarter of 2021 the prior quarter and up by 201 from the first quarter of 2021 strong free cash flow 1 gran tierra generated free cash flow 1 of 46 million the highest quarterly amount in almost a decade rapid debt reduction gran tierra has been utilizing its free cash flow 1 to strengthen the company s balance sheet by paying down its credit facility and building its cash position during the quarter the company paid down its credit facility balance by 27 5 million to 40 million and had a cash balance of 59 million these figures compare to a credit facility balance of 67 5 million and a cash balance of 26 million at the end of the prior quarter as of may 3 2022 gran tierra has paid down its credit facility to a balance of 10 million and expects the facility to be fully repaid before the end of the second quarter 2022 annual production growth the quarter s production was in line with management expectations and averaged 29 362 bopd up 20 from the first quarter of 2021 and approximately flat compared to the prior quarter expects to meet 2022 production guidance gran tierra believes its ability to keep production flat compared to the prior quarter demonstrates the ongoing successful results from the company s waterflooding efforts in all major assets the ongoing infill development drilling campaigns in the acordionero and costayaco oil fields are expected to increase the company s full year 2022 average production into the guidance range of 30 500 32 500 bopd the ramp up in production from the quarter s level is expected to begin in the latter half of second quarter of 2022 as new acordionero and costayaco oil wells are brought online revised 2022 financial guidance as previously announced on april 19 2022 gran tierra has updated the company s 2022 financial guidance in light of the significant increase in world oil prices this year the company has increased its 2022 brent price forecast to 95 bbl at this higher oil price the company would maintain 2022 capital at 220 240 million with a forecast 2022 cash flow 1 of 410 430 million free cash flow 1 of 180 200 million ebitda 1 of 550 570 million and a 2022 year end cash balance of 210 230 million additional key financial metrics capital expenditures capital expenditures of approximately 41 million were relatively flat with the prior quarter s level of 40 million as gran tierra maintained capital discipline and its focus on driving down drilling and completion costs increased oil sales the brent oil price averaged 97 90 bbl up 23 from the prior quarter and up 60 year on year gran tierra generated oil sales of 175 million up 19 from the prior quarter and up 83 from the first quarter of 2021 the significant annual increase in oil sales was driven by the company s 20 increase in quarterly production year on year combined with the large rise in the brent oil price over the same period strong operating netback 2 the company s operating netback 2 of 52 45 bbl was up 39 from the prior quarter and up 80 year on year this strong annual increase was driven by gran tierra s 20 increase in quarterly production year on year and increased brent pricing decreased operating expenses compared to the prior quarter gran tierra s operating expenses decreased 9 to 13 14 bbl down from 14 46 bbl due to lower workover environmental and administration costs which were only partially offset by higher expenses for chemicals used in the company s waterflood projects compared to first quarter 2021 operating expenses decreased by 4 on a per bbl basis primarily as a result of gran tierra s higher production other expenses the quality and transportation discount dropped 2 to 12 57 per bbl compared to 12 78 per bbl in the prior quarter because of higher world demand for colombian oil general and administrative g a expenses before stock based compensation were 2 97 per bbl down from 3 08 per bbl in the prior quarter and 3 14 per bbl in the first quarter of 2021 due to a lower accrued performance bonus oil price hedges the company continues to have brent oil price hedges in place for 9 000 bopd in the first half of 2022 with an average ceiling price of 87 62 bbl on 8 000 bopd therefore approximately 73 of gran tierra s oil production which is unhedged has fully benefited from the current high oil price environment 2021 sustainability report highlights gran tierra plans to issue the company s 2021 sustainability report creating long term value and delivering on our environmental social and governance commitments tomorrow may 4 2022 at which time the report can be found on the company s website at www grantierra com esg highlights from this report are as of 2021

exploration drilling opportunities as we restart our exploration campaign during the second half of 2022 we plan to drill our first ever exploration wells in ecuador in addition to our first exploration wells in colombia in more than two years we believe gran tierra is in an excellent position for continued development and enhanced oil recovery activities in 2022 to optimize value from each of our assets our waterflood programs across all of our assets continue to perform well and we expect another strong year of free cash flow 1 from these high quality low decline assets as always our beyond compliance policy continues where gran tierra identifies significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities we voluntarily strive to go beyond what is legally

assumptions of gran tierra including without limitation that gran tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates and the general continuance of assumed operational regulatory and industry conditions in colombia and ecuador and the ability of gran tierra to execute its business and operational plans in the manner currently planned among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are gran tierra s operations are located in south america and unexpected problems can arise due to guerilla activity strikes local blockades or protests technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products other disruptions to local operations global health events including the ongoing covid 19 pandemic global and regional changes in the demand supply prices differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas including changes resulting from a global health crisis the russian invasion of ukraine or from the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by opec and other producing countries and the resulting company or third party actions in response to such changes changes in commodity prices including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile the effect of hedges the accuracy of productive capacity of any particular field geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of our products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan and realize expected benefits from current initiatives the

benefits of government programs including government tax refunds gran tierra s ability to comply with financial covenants in its credit agreement and indentures and make borrowings under its credit agreement and the risk factors detailed from time to time in gran tierra s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation under the caption risk factors in gran tierra s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2021 and its other filings with the securities and exchange commission these filings are available on the securities and exchange commission website at and on sedar at www sedar com the forward looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain assumptions made by gran tierra based on management s experience and other factors believed to be appropriate gran tierra believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time but the forward looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond gran tierra s control which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward looking statements in particular the unprecedented nature of the current economic downturn pandemic and industry decline may make it particularly difficult to identify risks or predict the degree to which identified risks will impact gran tierra s business and financial condition all forward looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a

operations cash flow free cash flow and net debt nor forward looking oil and gas sales the gaap measure most directly comparable to the non gaap measure operating netback due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap as a result of the inherent volatility in the value of certain financial instruments held by the company and the inability to quantify the effectiveness of commodity price derivatives used to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of its oil production and changes in commodity prices presentation of oil and gas information references to a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume gran tierra s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is not a precise breakdown since the company s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed references to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume this press release contains certain oil and gas metrics including operating netback and cash netback which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons these metrics are calculated as described in this press release and management believes that they are useful supplemental measures for the reasons described in this press release such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods

article the state of georgia and local governments will give rivian automotive 1 5 billion of incentives to build a 7 500 job 5 billion electric vehicle plant east of atlanta according to documents the company and state signed monday georgia economic development commissioner pat wilson said the size of the package reflects the size of the largest single industrial announcement in georgia history including a pledge that the company will reach the full investment and job targets by the end of 2028 with jobs paying an average of 56 000 a year plus benefits the state also hopes rivian will anchor an entire electric vehicle industry it s absolutely appropriate because they re creating more jobs wilson said it is by far the largest incentive package georgia has ever offered to a company it s also the largest incentive package any american state has ever given to an auto plant said greg leroy executive director good jobs first a group skeptical of subsidies to private companies this is very significant leroy said it s the biggest auto assembly subsidy package in us history rivian based in irvine california is a startup manufacturer of electric trucks and commercial delivery vans challenging both established automakers like ford and general motors and electric vehicle leader tesla the company is already producing vehicles in normal illinois rivian hopes to break ground as early as this summer and begin production in 2024 sprinting toward producing 400 000 vehicles a year in georgia as electric vehicle makers try to gain market share the long term economic partnership promises to deliver value to rivian the people of georgia and their kids kids kids the company said in a statement the plant has been beset by fierce local opposition from residents who say development on the 2 000 acre 800 hectare site will spoil their rural quality of life the site between social circle and rutledge is about 45 miles 70 kilometers east of downtown atlanta the state took over planning and zoning for the project after opponents overwhelmed morgan county officials residents have voiced concerns about possible well water contamination light pollution and the disruption of wildlife and farmland wilson said a site plan and other documents released monday show rivian responding to those concerns shifting the plant away from wetlands and agreeing to limit light pollution opposition has become entangled in politics former u s sen david perdue who is challenging kemp in the may 24 republican primary lines up with opponents perdue has emphasized the role of liberal billionaire george soros although soros bought 2 billion worth of shares about the same time rivian chose georgia he owns only 2 of rivian there s no evidence soros influenced the plant location think about how many small businesses in georgia could be helped for this kind of money instead of padding george soros pockets perdue said monday kemp gave away the farm to a woke corporation for something the locals don t even want and hardworking georgians are left footing the bill kemp during a debate sunday reiterated his backing for rivian i support 7 500 great paying jobs going to rural georgia to an automobile manufacturing facility kemp said i m going to always be for that local governments have agreed to 700 million in property tax breaks although rivian plans to make more than 300 million in payments in lieu of taxes over 25 years beginning in 2023 the state would spend 200 million to buy the site grade it build road improvements including a new interstate 20 interchange and extend utilities georgia would spend 62 5 million to build a dedicated training center and a projected 27 million on providing job training other major benefits include a 200 million income tax credit at 5 250 per job over five years if rivian didn t owe that much state corporate income tax georgia would give personal income taxes collected from workers instead georgia also estimates sales tax exemptions will save rivian 175 million on machinery and 105 million on construction materials kia got more than 450 million in incentives for its plant in west point southwest of atlanta georgia has promised sk innovation 300 million in incentives for a 2 6 billion 2 600 worker battery plant northeast of atlanta wilson said the state has strong protections to claw its money back if rivian falls below 80 of promised investment or employment the state touts a 420 million annual payroll as well as an analysis showing there will be 8 000 more jobs created elsewhere in the state with a total impact of more than 7 billion but leroy said incentives will cost 200 000 per job and state and local governments will never collect enough increased taxes to cover that the state can never break even leroy said there s no way that the average worker in this place is going to pay 200 000 more in state and local taxes rivian currently plans two models for consumers the r1t pickup with a base price of 67 500 and the r1s suv with a base price of 70 000 amazon which owns 18 of rivian has ordered 100 000 delivery vans launching the company into commercial vehicles rivian is flush with cash following a 11 9 billion stock offering nov 10 allowing it to finance the new plant but shares have fallen 70 since then as investors worry about production delays
the illusion of windfalls a one off tax on energy giants will hit pensions jobs and our green future says alex brummer bp knows more about political risk than any other ftse 100 firm its clash with president obama and the us courts over the 2010 deepwater horizon explosion in the gulf of mexico almost proved an existential event and left shareholders 50billion poorer after vladimir putin invaded ukraine bp a big shareholder in rosneft lost no time in pulling out at a cost now confirmed to be 19 2billion chief executive bernard looney may be best known to the british public as the boss denigrated by broadcasters and politicians for his description of bp as a cash machine in an age of high energy prices but he has also been the leader of the pack among oil majors in redirecting his company towards a greener future with demanding zero carbon goals he is behind an extraordinary plan of 18billion investment in uk climate change projects ranging from hydrogen production to a network of electricity charging points for motor cars one might have thought that the bullying of bp by obama and russia might have dissuaded british politicians from engaging in the same yet after it reported underlying earnings of 5billion for the first quarter opposition leaders couldn t restrain themselves from demands for a windfall tax sir ed davey of the lib dems has attacked the tories for raising taxes even though they are intended to pay for the sacred nhs then demanded a fresh tax on excess profits he also criticised dividend payouts and share buybacks never mind that almost all of these gains will accrue to the 76 per cent of private sector workers automatically enrolled in pension funds davey doesn t have to worry about this as he will benefit from a gold plated unfunded mp s pension that other knight of the realm keir starmer also rattled on about the cost of living crisis and windfall taxes there was no recognition that such levies cannot fund anything permanently energy market volatility means excess profit taxes are usually a one off also glossed over is the fact that bp is among britain s biggest taxpayers and faces a surging corporation tax charge in 2023 not much integrity in the criticisms from virtue signalling party leaders unlock arm when it emerged in 2020 that softbank boss masayoshi son intended to sell cambridge chip designer arm to rival nvidia it was clear that the best course of action for uk plc would be a london float which would reverse the error of theresa may s government in the aftermath of the referendum in 2016 when downing street laid out the red carpet for softbank it would restore one of europe s few tech champions to london the chief executive of the london stock exchange david schwimmer has told this paper he would be working alongside government in seeking to bring the 50billion plus company to the uk arm might have difficulty in meeting nasdaq criteria for a new york initial public offer in that the intellectual property hq and employees are mainly in the uk it is gratifying to learn that the government is taking the argument directly to son who was treated by the uk as a kind of conquering hero six years ago what is perplexing is the disclosure that among those doing the lobbying is city veteran gerry grimstone the office for investment chief when interviewed by the bbc in august 2021 grimstone dismissed opposition to overseas takeovers of key strategic and tech enterprises it would be a sad day for britain if we pulled down the shutters so that we weren t a mercantile and entrepreneurial country he opined his comments came when several uk engineering and defence companies were under siege from private equity opportunists and foreign competitors recent research by fund manager schroders found the ftse has been badly diminished by this foolish approach perhaps grimstone should step aside from the arm negotiations never boring among the next frontiers for elon musk is the boring company valued at 4 6billion after a fundraising last month its aim is to ease congestion on us roads and speed up rail journeys by burrowing into what is trendily called the subspace backed by silicon valley venture capital group sequoia it is already worth six times its early valuation as was the case at tesla no one should count on a quick payback
while leaks do escape the court the extent of monday s breach has major consequences for how the court functions both internally and as an institution of society example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington the monday night leak of a preliminary draft opinion from the supreme court to overturn roe v wade sent shockwaves not just through the country but through the halls of the court a traditionally secretive and confidential institution for washington standards with chief justice john roberts confirming the authenticity of the draft the head of the supreme court also signaled that the leak was a singular and egregious breach of trust and ordered the court marshal to launch a formal investigation into the source of the breach the court has cautioned that no final decision on the case has been made the dramatic escalation of events has many wondering why exactly the court is reluctant to be more public about their inner workings and what the leak means for the future of the court why does the supreme court value confidentiality one of the big reasons for confidentiality is that the court values its candor of deliberations according to american university law professor stephen wermiel in other words public awareness and perception of opinions may push justices to not consider all legal arguments fairly if you are locked into an initial view because it s made public you won t be willing to consider other arguments or possibly changing your mind wermiel said i think they consider that quite integral that it really is necessary to have confidentiality to guarantee forthright consideration of issues in other cases leaks could give leeway for affected parties to act before a ruling said josh blackman a prominent court watcher and professor of law at the south texas college of law houston for example a draft leak involving a publicly traded company might cause investors to sell stocks preemptively what will happen to the whistleblower the probe into the leak signals the supreme court is determined to figure out who exactly released the draft people familiar with the internal workings of the court could identify around 70 people who might have access to a draft first of course are the nine justices themselves then there is the small group of staff that work for each justice finally there are the justices clerks young lawyers who work with the justices for a year in a highly prized position each justice has four clerks and secrecy is part of their job politico said it received the copy from a person familiar with the court s proceedings leading to speculation that a dissenter among the justices or their staff wanted to make it public however it s also possible that someone who liked the draft hoped that releasing the document would harden support for it wermiel said he could see the whistleblower being prosecuted for breaking federal law if their identify is discovered i think they will probably follow through on this whether that be theft of confidential material or dissemination of such material he said but it remains unclear whether such leak is considered a crime in a lengthy twitter feed law professor orin kerr at the university of california berkeley said that there is no law prohibiting the distribution of draft opinions but suggested prosecutors could charge the whistleblower against a broadly written statute that prohibits the misuse of government owned things of value if it were a justice that leaked the draft the consequences are even less limited according to jonathan peters professor of media law at the university of georgia he said that there are no code that would reign under these circumstances and beyond although articles of impeachment could be brought forward by congress what does this mean for the court going forward it is unclear what behind the scenes changes will occur in the court but many legal experts believe that this leak will negatively impact the both the public s trust in the supreme court and the professionalism among justices and clerks the collegiality in this the friendship of the court has to be at a low level right now said josh blackman i don t know how the justices will rebound from this it was such a simple decision that was done that will salt wound for decades stephen wermiel adds that while this is only a draft opinion and there could be changes down the road the leak negatively impacts the credibility of the court there s been a lot of criticism that the court is becoming more and more political and i think this does confirm the impression that the court is acting more politically every year jonathan peters added that the supreme court could and likely will also make internal changes to how justices and staff review and handle cases but it is unlikely these changes will ever be revealed to the public he also said that while that this leak certainly is equivalent to the sausage making process and the public may be dissuaded by the partisan nature of the court some may see this is a step in the right direction if they believe transparency is better for government institutions the answer to public trust is what roles leak play peters said do they act as a prophylactic in showing us what institutions are really like for people to read more about them and be critical of them or do you prefer to operate in a system where less is more and you don t know us a much but that allows you to have this false space within the institution

guidance as previously announced on april 19 2022 gran tierra has updated the company s 2022 financial guidance in light of the significant increase in world oil prices this year the company has increased its 2022 brent price forecast to 95 bbl at this higher oil price the company would maintain 2022 capital at 220 240 million with a forecast 2022 cash flow 1 of 410 430 million free cash flow

key financial metrics capital expenditures capital expenditures of approximately 41 million were relatively flat with the prior quarter s level of 40 million as gran tierra maintained capital discipline and its focus on driving down drilling and completion costs increased oil sales the brent oil price averaged 97 90 bbl up 23 from the prior quarter and up 60 year on year gran tierra generated oil sales of 175 million up 19 from the prior quarter and up 83 from the first quarter of 2021 the significant annual increase in oil sales was driven by the company s 20 increase in quarterly production year on year combined with the large rise in the brent oil price over the same period strong operating netback 2 the company s operating netback 2 of 52 45 bbl was up 39 from the prior quarter and up 80 year on year this strong annual increase was driven by gran tierra s 20 increase in quarterly production year on year and increased brent pricing decreased operating expenses compared to the prior quarter gran tierra s operating expenses decreased 9 to 13 14 bbl down from 14 46 bbl due to lower workover environmental and administration costs which were only partially offset by higher expenses for chemicals used in the company s waterflood projects compared to first quarter 2021 operating expenses decreased by 4 on a per bbl basis primarily as a result of gran tierra s higher production other expenses the quality and transportation discount dropped 2 to 12 57 per bbl compared to 12 78 per bbl in the prior quarter because of higher world demand for colombian oil general and administrative g a expenses before stock based compensation were 2 97 per bbl down from 3 08 per bbl in the prior quarter and 3 14 per bbl in the first quarter of 2021 due to a lower accrued performance bonus oil price hedges the company continues to have brent oil price hedges in place for 9 000 bopd in the first half of 2022 with an average ceiling price of 87 62 bbl on 8 000 bopd therefore approximately 73 of gran tierra s oil production which is unhedged has fully benefited from the current high oil price environment 2021 sustainability report highlights gran tierra

that gran tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates and the general continuance of assumed operational regulatory and industry conditions in colombia and ecuador and the ability of gran tierra to execute its business and operational plans in the manner currently planned among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are gran tierra s operations are located in south america and unexpected problems can arise due to guerilla activity strikes local blockades or protests technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products other disruptions to local operations global health events including the ongoing covid 19 pandemic global and regional changes in the demand supply prices differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas including changes resulting from a global health crisis the russian invasion of ukraine or from the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by opec and other producing countries and the resulting company or third party actions in response to such changes changes in commodity prices including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile the effect of hedges the accuracy of productive capacity of any particular field geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of our products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan and realize expected benefits from current initiatives the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur the ability to replace reserves and production and develop and manage reserves on an economically viable basis the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic

refunds gran tierra s ability to comply with financial covenants in its credit agreement and indentures and make borrowings under its credit agreement and the risk factors detailed from time to time in gran tierra s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation under the caption risk factors in gran tierra s annual report on form 10 k for the year

the forward looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain assumptions made by gran tierra based on management s experience and other factors believed to be appropriate gran tierra believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time but the forward looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond gran tierra s control which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward looking statements in particular the unprecedented nature of the current economic downturn pandemic and industry decline may make it particularly difficult to identify risks or predict the degree to which identified risks will impact gran tierra s business and financial condition all forward looking statements

directly comparable to the non gaap measures ebitda funds flow from operations cash flow free cash flow and net debt nor forward looking oil and gas sales the gaap measure most directly comparable to the non gaap measure operating netback due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap as a result of the inherent volatility in the value of certain financial instruments held by the company and the inability to quantify the effectiveness of commodity price derivatives used to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of its oil production and changes in commodity prices presentation of oil and gas information references to a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume gran tierra s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is not a precise breakdown since the company s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed references to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume this press release contains certain oil and gas metrics including operating netback and cash netback which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons these metrics are calculated as described in this press release and management believes that they are useful supplemental measures for the reasons described in this press release such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods
asx xetra dax level 1 adr cuv ur9 clvly executive summary afamelanotide evaluated as safe in mild to moderate arterial ischaemic stroke nihss 1 15 n 6 nihss1 scores improved in five patients brain scans mri flair2 in all patients show reduction of affected tissue strong functional recovery in all five surviving patients melbourne australia may 03 2022 globe newswire clinuvel today released positive final results of the open label pilot study cuv801 in arterial ischemic stroke ais evaluating multiple doses of clinuvel s drug afamelanotide in six adult patients afamelanotide was shown to be well tolerated with five of the six patients showing considerable clinical and functional recovery up to 42 days after treatment final analyses from the cuv801 study show that surviving patients who received treatment with afamelanotide all seemed to have recovered well in the six weeks following their brain injury clinuvel s head of clinical operations dr pilar bilbao said our clinical team often publicly emphasise the significance of afamelanotide as a safe drug in patients and in this study we obtained further data that patients with longstanding cardiovascular disease seem to tolerate afamelanotide well the significance of these findings is of benefit to all our current and future programs study results cuv801cuv801 is the first clinical study assessing afamelanotide as a treatment for a life threatening brain injury all six patients enrolled in the study carried an increased risk of stroke due to their history of cardiovascular disease elevated blood pressure or diabetes type ii and all suffered a stroke blood clot in the left half of the brain the study was conducted at the specialist stroke unit of the alfred hospital in melbourne australia safety was the primary endpoint of the pilot study with afamelanotide administered up to four times over ten days following the stroke this frequency of dosing seemed not to affect patient safety with no drug related adverse events reported during or after the study completion one patient with a complex cardiovascular history passed away following a second stroke on day 5 which was assessed as unrelated to afamelanotide treatment treatment efficacy was measured using computer imaging to assess the volume of the area affected by the stroke and validated clinical assessments of function neurological impairment and disability analyses of the brain scans mri flair2 performed at days 3 and 9 showed a reduction in size of the affected area in five of the six patients a graphic accompanying this announcement is available at analyses of the nihss scores1 up to day 42 indicated that all five surviving patients showed an improvement in neurological functions and reduction in overall impairment p 0 0625 four out of five surviving patients showed an improvement of 4 points or more on the scale regarded as significant and all five patients reported a clinically meaningful reduction of 3 points two patients were symptom free at day 42 a graphic accompanying this announcement is available at the modified rankin scale a non stroke specific tool used to determine global disability proved not sensitive enough as an instrument for the short study period addressing unmet medical need in strokeischaemic strokes account for around 85 of the estimated 15 million strokes suffered worldwide each year stroke is the leading cause of serious long term disability in the united states considering the staggering prevalence of stroke the burden of post stroke recovery and ongoing disability is of primary public health importance despite the considerable impact of strokes on individuals and society the treatment options available even at specialist stroke units are tragically limited dr bilbao said we are seeking to prove that afamelanotide can provide a safe effective treatment option which can improve the overall prognosis post stroke and reduce patient disability long term the first steps are to gain comfort that the intervention with afamelanotide poses no harm to patients while obtaining objective measures of impact of treatment on the course of the patients disease with cuv801 we have achieved both these outcomes and can now pursue further studies and regulatory interactions with a degree of confidence that the drug performs as expected the gain for stroke patients but also for society as a whole lies in the improvement in neurological functions since the ability to resume independent living saves high costs to our healthcare systems dr bilbao said 1 the national

cuv801 was to evaluate the safety of patients who were first time administered afamelanotide within 24 hours of suffering a stroke while a secondary assessment was made of the recovery of brain tissue calculated from the volume of area affected neurological function assessments and of the overall disability over 42 days validated evaluations were made using national institutes of health stroke

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video while leaks do escape the court the extent of monday s breach has major consequences for how the court functions both internally and as an institution of society washington the monday night leak of a preliminary draft opinion from the supreme court to overturn roe v wade sent shockwaves not just through the country but through the halls of the court a traditionally secretive and confidential institution for washington standards with chief justice john roberts confirming the authenticity of the draft the head of the supreme court also signaled that the leak was a singular and egregious breach of trust and ordered the court marshal to launch a formal investigation into the source of the breach the court has cautioned that no final decision on the case has been made the dramatic escalation of events has many wondering why exactly the court is reluctant to be more public about their inner workings and what the leak means for the future of the court why does the supreme court value confidentiality one of the big reasons for confidentiality is that the court values its candor of deliberations according to american university law professor stephen wermiel in other words public awareness and perception of opinions may push justices to not consider all legal arguments fairly if you are locked into an initial view because it s made public you won t be willing to consider other arguments or possibly changing your mind wermiel said i think they consider that quite integral that it really is necessary to have confidentiality to guarantee forthright consideration of issues in other cases leaks could give leeway for affected parties to act before a ruling said josh blackman a prominent court watcher and professor of law at the south texas college of law houston for example a draft leak involving a publicly traded company might cause investors to sell stocks preemptively what will happen to the whistleblower the probe into the leak signals the supreme court is determined to figure out who exactly released the draft people familiar with the internal workings of the court could identify around 70 people who might have access to a draft first of course are the nine justices themselves then there is the small group of staff that work for each justice finally there are the justices clerks young lawyers who work with the justices for a year in a highly prized position each justice has four clerks and secrecy is part of their job politico said it received the copy from a person familiar with the court s proceedings leading to speculation that a dissenter among the justices or their staff wanted to make it public however it s also possible that someone who liked the draft hoped that releasing the document would harden support for it wermiel said he could see the whistleblower being prosecuted for breaking federal law if their identify is discovered i think they will probably follow through on this whether that be theft of confidential material or dissemination of such material he said but it remains unclear whether such leak is considered a crime in a lengthy twitter feed law professor orin kerr at the university of california berkeley said that there is no law prohibiting the distribution of draft opinions but suggested prosecutors could charge the whistleblower against a broadly written statute that prohibits the misuse of government owned things of value if it were a justice that leaked the draft the consequences are even less limited according to jonathan peters professor of media law at the university of georgia he said that there are no code that would reign under these circumstances and beyond although articles of impeachment could be brought forward by congress related articles supreme court chief justice confirms draft abortion opinion is authentic what does this mean for the court going forward it is unclear what behind the scenes changes will occur in the court but many legal experts believe that this leak will negatively impact the both the public s trust in the supreme court and the professionalism among justices and clerks the collegiality in this the friendship of the court has to be at a low level right now said josh blackman i don t know how the justices will rebound from this it was such a simple decision that was done that will salt wound for decades stephen wermiel adds that while this is only a draft opinion and there could be changes down the road the leak negatively impacts the credibility of the court there s been a lot of criticism that the court is becoming more and more political and i think this does confirm the impression that the court is acting more politically every year jonathan peters added that the supreme court could and likely will also make internal changes to how justices and staff review and handle cases but it is unlikely these changes will ever be revealed to the public he also said that while that this leak certainly is equivalent to the sausage making process and the public may be dissuaded by the partisan nature of the court some may see this is a step in the right direction if they believe transparency is better for government institutions the answer to public trust is what roles leak play peters said do they act as a prophylactic in showing us what

a controversial florida law prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation but the law s text does not include the words don t say gay on march 28 florida gov ron desantis signed the parental rights in education bill into law the bill prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards it also gives parents an option to sue a school district if the policy is violated the bill is set to go into effect on july 1 verify viewers charles and jesco recently sent us messages asking whether the phrase don t say gay is actually included in the text of the legislation the question does florida s parental rights in education law say don t say gay in its text the sources the answer no florida s parental rights in education law does not say don t say gay in its text what we found the phrase don t say gay is not included in the official text of the parental rights in education bill in fact the law does not mention the words lesbian gay bisexual transgender or queer at all nor does it include the lgbtq acronym it does however contain the terms sexual orientation and gender identity instead the law states classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards the law does not directly define what constitutes discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity it also does not define what a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students means republican state rep joe harding the bill s sponsor has said the law would not bar spontaneous discussions about sexual orientation or gender identity in schools but it would prevent districts from integrating the subjects into official curriculum harding also sought to require schools to inform parents if a student came out as lgbtq to a teacher during the bill s early stages however he withdrew the amendment in february after facing backlash online nothing in the amendment was about outing a student rather than battle misinformation related to the amendment i decided to focus on the primary bill that empowers parents to be engaged in their children s lives harding said in a statement meanwhile critics of the bill including the national education association nea have said the law s language including the phrases classroom instruction and age appropriate could be interpreted so broadly that any discussion could trigger lawsuits and create a classroom atmosphere where teachers would avoid the subjects entirely the bill s intentionally vague language leaves teachers afraid to talk to their students and opens up school districts to costly and frivolous litigation from those seeking to exclude lgbtq people from any grade level florida state rep carlos g smith a democrat who is gay said in a statement even worse dontsaygay sends a hateful message to our most vulnerable youth who simply need our support the nea also says the law s vague language opens the door for restrictions that may prohibit educators from teaching books that recognize the mere existence of same sex couples or reference an individual s gender in any way another risk the law poses according to the nea is that lgbtq educators may be forced to disguise their identity to their students and lgbtq students or students with same sex parents may be prohibited from equal participation in classroom discussions about their views or their families if the law were applied to prohibit lgbtq educators and only lgbtq educators to disguise their identity in the presence of students this discriminatory difference in working conditions may violate title vii almost certainly causes harm on the basis of sex discrimination in violation of title ix and amounts to intentional discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause under the supreme court s recent decision in bostock v clayton county the nea wrote similarly if the law were applied to prohibit lgbtq students from equally participating in class discussions about their views or to prohibit students with same sex parents from equally participating in class discussions about their families the law would almost certainly cause harm in violation of title ix s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex the nea continued gov ron desantis and other republican lawmakers have repeatedly defended the law saying that parents not teachers should be broaching subjects of sexual orientation and gender identity with their children we will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education not an indoctrination desantis said before signing the bill into law at a ceremony at a preparatory school outside tampa on march 28 on march 31 a lawsuit was filed in federal court against desantis and the florida state board of education on behalf of lgbtq rights groups including equality florida family equality and the national center for lesbian rights it alleges that the law violates the constitutionally protected rights of free speech equal protection and due process of students and families this effort to control young minds through state censorship and to demean lgbtq lives by denying their reality is a grave abuse of power the lawsuit said desantis however has said numerous times that he s not backing down to the criticism it doesn t matter what critics say desantis said we re going to make sure that parents are able to send their kid to kindergarten without having some of this stuff injected into their school curriculum

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video while leaks do escape the court the extent of monday s breach has major consequences for how the court functions both internally and as an institution of society washington the monday night leak of a preliminary draft opinion from the supreme court to overturn roe v wade sent shockwaves not just through the country but through the halls of the court a traditionally secretive and confidential institution for washington standards with chief justice john roberts confirming the authenticity of the draft the head of the supreme court also signaled that the leak was a singular and egregious breach of trust and ordered the court marshal to launch a formal investigation into the source of the breach the court has cautioned that no final decision on the case has been made the dramatic escalation of events has many wondering why exactly the court is reluctant to be more public about their inner workings and what the leak means for the future of the court why does the supreme court value confidentiality one of the big reasons for confidentiality is that the court values its candor of deliberations according to american university law professor stephen wermiel in other words public awareness and perception of opinions may push justices to not consider all legal arguments fairly if you are locked into an initial view because it s made public you won t be willing to consider other arguments or possibly changing your mind wermiel said i think they consider that quite integral that it really is necessary to have confidentiality to guarantee forthright consideration of issues in other cases leaks could give leeway for affected parties to act before a ruling said josh blackman a prominent court watcher and professor of law at the south texas college of law houston for example a draft leak involving a publicly traded company might cause investors to sell stocks preemptively what will happen to the whistleblower the probe into the leak signals the supreme court is determined to figure out who exactly released the draft people familiar with the internal workings of the court could identify around 70 people who might have access to a draft first of course are the nine justices themselves then there is the small group of staff that work for each justice finally there are the justices clerks young lawyers who work with the justices for a year in a highly prized position each justice has four clerks and secrecy is part of their job politico said it received the copy from a person familiar with the court s proceedings leading to speculation that a dissenter among the justices or their staff wanted to make it public however it s also possible that someone who liked the draft hoped that releasing the document would harden support for it wermiel said he could see the whistleblower being prosecuted for breaking federal law if their identify is discovered i think they will probably follow through on this whether that be theft of confidential material or dissemination of such material he said but it remains unclear whether such leak is considered a crime in a lengthy twitter feed law professor orin kerr at the university of california berkeley said that there is no law prohibiting the distribution of draft opinions but suggested prosecutors could charge the whistleblower against a broadly written statute that prohibits the misuse of government owned things of value if it were a justice that leaked the draft the consequences are even less limited according to jonathan peters professor of media law at the university of georgia he said that there are no code that would reign under these circumstances and beyond although articles of impeachment could be brought forward by congress what does this mean for the court going forward it is unclear what behind the scenes changes will occur in the court but many legal experts believe that this leak will negatively impact the both the public s trust in the supreme court and the professionalism among justices and clerks the collegiality in this the friendship of the court has to be at a low level right now said josh blackman i don t know how the justices will rebound from this it was such a simple decision that was done that will salt wound for decades stephen wermiel adds that while this is only a draft opinion and there could be changes down the road the leak negatively impacts the credibility of the court there s been a lot of criticism that the court is becoming more and more political and i think this does confirm the impression that the court is acting more politically every year jonathan peters added that the supreme court could and likely will also make internal changes to how justices and staff review and handle cases but it is unlikely these changes will ever be revealed to the public he also said that while that this leak certainly is equivalent to the sausage making process and the public may be dissuaded by the partisan nature of the court some may see this is a step in the right direction if they believe transparency is better for government institutions the answer to public trust is what roles leak play peters said do they act as a prophylactic in showing us what institutions are really like for people to read more about them and be critical of them or do you prefer to operate in a system where less is more and you don t know us a much but that allows you to have this false space within the institution

patients melbourne australia may 03 2022 globe newswire clinuvel today released positive final results of the open label pilot study cuv801 in arterial ischemic stroke ais evaluating multiple doses of clinuvel s drug afamelanotide in six adult patients afamelanotide was shown to be well tolerated with five of the six patients showing considerable clinical and functional recovery up to 42 days after treatment final analyses from the cuv801 study show that surviving patients who received treatment with afamelanotide all seemed to have recovered well in the six weeks following their brain injury clinuvel s head of clinical operations dr pilar bilbao said our clinical team often publicly emphasise the significance of afamelanotide as a safe drug in patients and in this study we obtained further data that patients with longstanding cardiovascular disease seem to tolerate afamelanotide well the significance of these findings is of benefit to all our current and future programs study results cuv801 cuv801 is the first clinical study assessing afamelanotide as a treatment for a life threatening brain injury all six patients enrolled in the study carried an increased risk of stroke due to their history of cardiovascular disease elevated blood pressure or diabetes type ii and all suffered a stroke blood clot in the left half of the brain the study was conducted at the specialist stroke unit of the alfred hospital in melbourne australia safety was the primary endpoint of the pilot study with afamelanotide administered up to four times over ten days following the stroke this frequency of dosing seemed not to affect patient safety with no drug related adverse events reported during or after the study completion one patient with a complex cardiovascular history passed away following a second stroke on day 5 which was assessed as unrelated to afamelanotide treatment treatment efficacy was measured using computer imaging to assess the volume of the area affected by the stroke and validated clinical assessments of function neurological impairment and disability analyses of the brain scans mri flair2 performed at days 3 and 9 showed a reduction in size of the affected

specific tool used to determine global disability proved not sensitive enough as an instrument for the short study period addressing unmet medical need in stroke ischaemic strokes account for around 85 of the estimated 15 million strokes suffered worldwide each year stroke is the leading cause of serious long term disability in the united states considering the staggering prevalence of stroke the burden of post stroke recovery and ongoing disability is of primary public health importance despite the considerable impact of strokes on individuals and society the treatment options available even at specialist stroke units are tragically limited dr bilbao said we are seeking to prove that afamelanotide can provide a safe effective treatment option which can improve the overall prognosis post stroke and reduce patient disability long term the first steps are to gain comfort that the intervention with afamelanotide poses no harm to patients while obtaining objective measures of impact of treatment on the course of the patients disease with cuv801 we have achieved both these outcomes and can now pursue further studies and regulatory interactions with a degree of confidence that the drug performs as expected the gain for stroke patients but also for society as a whole lies in the improvement in neurological functions since the ability to resume independent living saves high costs

from a person familiar with the court s proceedings leading to speculation that a dissenter among the justices or their staff wanted to make it public however it s also possible that someone who liked the draft hoped that releasing the document would harden support for it wermiel said he could see the whistleblower being prosecuted for breaking federal law if their identify is discovered i think they will probably follow through on this whether that be theft of confidential material or dissemination of such material he said but it remains unclear whether such leak is considered a crime in a lengthy twitter feed law professor orin kerr at the university of california berkeley said that there is no law prohibiting the distribution of draft opinions but suggested prosecutors could charge the whistleblower against a broadly written statute that prohibits the misuse of government owned things of value if it were a justice that leaked the draft the consequences are even less limited according to jonathan peters professor of media law at the university of georgia he said that there are no code that would reign under these circumstances and beyond although articles of impeachment could be brought forward by congress related articles supreme court chief justice confirms draft abortion opinion is authentic what does this mean for the court going forward it is unclear what behind the scenes changes will occur in the court but many legal experts believe that this leak will negatively impact the both the public s trust in the supreme court and the professionalism among justices and clerks the collegiality in this the friendship of the court has to be at a low level right now said josh blackman i don t know how the justices will rebound from this it was such a simple decision that was done that will salt wound for decades stephen wermiel adds that while this is only a draft opinion and there could be changes down the road the leak negatively impacts the credibility of the court there s been a lot of criticism that the court is becoming more and more political and i think this does confirm the impression that the court is acting more politically every year jonathan peters added that the supreme court could and likely will also make internal changes to how justices and staff review and handle cases but it is unlikely these changes will ever be revealed to the public he also said that while that this leak certainly is equivalent to the sausage making process and the public may be dissuaded by the partisan nature of the court some may see this is a step in the right direction if they believe transparency is better for government institutions the answer to public trust is what roles leak play peters said do they act as a prophylactic in showing us what institutions are really like for people to read more about them and be critical of them or do you prefer to operate in a system where less is more and you don t know us a much but that allows you to have this false space within the institution

continents and oceans and was the basis for the global mercantile economic system underlying international trade for more than two centuries gold reserves backed currencies of the world before the bretton woods agreement in 1944 the currency exchange rates of 44 nations were tied to the u s dollar secured by gold reserves at 35 per ounce in 1971 president nixon ended the link between gold and u s currencies creating a foreign exchange system of fiat currencies severing the connection between gold and currency enabled governments worldwide to issue trillions of currency units backed by the government s promise that the currency would retain its value excessive money in the public invariably ignites periods of inflation i e lowering the purchasing power of money the insidious effect of inflation inflation is the covert theft of value over time it is the theft of purchasing power since a dollar tomorrow buys fewer goods than a dollar today governments generally favor inflation as long as it is low enough to escape the notice of those most affected federal reserve chairman jerome powell recently announced an average inflation targeting to keep inflation within the 2 3 the effect of the rate is that a 40 year old earning 100 000 today must make 128 000 in 1950 retirees living on 75 000 in 2021 will need to increase their income by several thousand dollars each year to maintain the same lifestyles protecting purchasing power money is purchasing power what it will buy now and in the future saving and investing are tools to transfer and grow one s purchasing power

reason a balanced investment portfolio includes different types of investment with varying performance characteristics as economic conditions change a typical diversified portfolio might contain individual securities mutual funds bonds real estate and gold prices of precious metals typically rise when stock and bond markets are edgy and uncertain countering a general decline in securities prices when interest rate yields rise equity fixed income and real estate prices stagnate or decline at the same time demand for gold increases its price thus offsetting securities losses on a portfolio level monica stankowski the editor of marketreview com explains the benefits of gold as a hedge against securities losses in a portfolio how this works is that if one has a position in gold as well as in securities the securities hedge the gold and even more significant the gold hedges the securities so if you are down money in the market this means that you ve probably made money on your gold investments and this helps cushion the blow when we use such a strategy in advance for protection so to speak this is called hedging risk when looking to diversify your portfolio with precious metals it s important to work with a company that has years of experience and can be trusted one such company is gold alliance which was established in 2002 and has an outstanding rating of 4 96 stars out of 5 on the better business bureau gold alliance is helping americans diversify their savings with physical precious metals in an effort to achieve financial security their philosophy and practice is to do right by their clients and make sure they completely understand and are happy with their choices and their success is evident in the long list of 5 star reviews as an industry leader gold alliance has helped shape in many ways how their industry works towards more transparency and better client education
a month after his return to starbucks as interim ceo howard schultz has announced new benefits including expanded training improved sick leave and credit card tipping for some 240 000 starbucks employees at more than 8 800 stores across the country but not for those that are unionizing we do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway schultz said on a conference call with shareholders on tuesday starbucks said all employees including those at stores that are unionizing would receive the wage hikes that were first announced last october on august 1 employees will get either a 3 raise or 15 dollars hour whichever is higher and tenured hourly employers will get even bigger raises the announcement comes as more than 230 starbucks stores have filed petitions for union elections and about 50 stores have voted to join the national union workers united since december making it one of the most significant union drives in america schultz hinted that starbucks might move to exclude unionized stores from new benefits in comments to store managers over a video call in mid april at the time he said he had just learned that starbucks is not permitted by law to offer new benefits to a store that voted for a union while they are in the collective bargaining process workers united called schultz s assertion dead wrong and filed unfair labor practice charges with the national labor relations board under section 8 a 5 employers simply cannot implement new benefits during contract negotiations unilaterally wrote gabe frumkin counsel for workers united instead they must bargain with the union if they wish to implement new benefits programs in the filing frumkin charges that schultz misrepresented the law by giving the misimpression that starbucks could not even offer such benefits to the workers or their union representative schultz s comments had an immediate and profound chilling effect on organizing campaigns nationwide frumkin wrote schultz says no union contract measures up to what starbucks already offers the union drive at starbucks has been remarkable not only because of the stunning speed at which it has spread but also because food and drink establishments are among the least unionized in the country with just over 1 of the sector unionized in 2021 according to the labor department but unlike many other food and beverage chains starbucks has long prided itself on being a standout employer offering health care retirement stock options and free college tuition to full time and part time employees referred to as partners at starbucks indeed the generous benefits and socially progressive culture are a big part of what has drawn many workers to starbucks which has some 9 000 stores nationwide compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what starbucks offers schultz said on tuesday s shareholder call as he s pledged transformation at starbucks schultz says outside forces are driving union campaign upon his return to the company schultz acknowledged that starbucks had to transform over the past month he s traveled to different regions to attend what he calls co creation sessions with store employees referred to as partners at starbucks hearing them out on problems they encounter on the job as well as scheduling and pay issues it was difficult and emotional at times to hear the challenges and the issues that partners are facing schultz told store managers in a video call last month but in the shareholder call on tuesday schultz made clear that he thinks the source of workers grievances may have less to do with starbucks and more to do with events that have shaped workers lives from the great recession to the global pandemic these young people have completely valid concerns given today s uncertainty and economic instability he said they look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling it was a toned down version of comments he made last month when he spoke of companies throughout the country being assaulted in many ways by the threat of unionization and referred to the starbucks union drive as a new outside force trying desperately to disrupt our company that characterization has riled starbucks workers who say they are the ones leading the unionizing efforts at their stores not some outside force schultz has spoken of organizers intentionally and aggressively sowing divisions within the company while attempting to sell a very different view of what starbucks should be he said he s heard of stories of employees who did not support the union being bullied into not voting in elections pointing to the low turnout in store elections he urged store managers to encourage all workers to vote in pushing the outside force narrative schultz could be referring to one particular worker in buffalo where the starbucks union campaign got its start before landing a barista job with starbucks in 2020 jaz brisack a rhodes scholar from the university of mississippi had worked as an organizer with the uaw in mississippi and with workers united in buffalo where she led an effort to organize baristas at a local coffee chain but workers at starbucks stores across the country describe being inspired by the baristas in buffalo not directed by them while workers united lawyers are helping store workers file petitions for union elections and unfair labor practice charges the workers say they are the ones reaching out to coworkers across shifts and deciding what it is they want as a store starbucks workers condemn starbucks union busting activities all but a handful of the more than 50 starbucks stores that have held union elections to date have voted to unionize an election in springfield virginia in april ended in a 10 to 8 loss a result that workers united is challenging gailyn berg a shift supervisor who led the union campaign at their store believes starbucks union busting activities in fact changed votes pointing specifically to managers warnings about what could happen if the store voted to unionize we weren t going to be able to get raises in the next coming months we re not going to be able to work at other stores definitely our partners believe that berg said berg says those warnings were delivered through mandatory sessions between managers and employees known as captive audience meetings although starbucks denies that the meetings were mandatory the national labor relations board has moved to ban captive audience meetings as an unfair labor practice starbucks denies engaging in illegal anti union activities including at other stores where worker organizers have been fired starbucks says the workers in question were fired for violating

a month after his return to starbucks as interim ceo howard schultz has announced new benefits including expanded training improved sick leave and credit card tipping for some 240 000 starbucks employees at more than 8 800 stores across the country but not for those that are unionizing we do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway schultz said on a conference call with shareholders on tuesday starbucks said all employees including those at stores that are unionizing would receive the wage hikes that were first announced last october on august 1 employees will get either a 3 raise or 15 dollars hour whichever is higher and tenured hourly employers will get even bigger raises the announcement comes as more than 230 starbucks stores have filed petitions for union elections and about 50 stores have voted to join the national union workers united since december making it one of the most significant union drives in america schultz hinted that starbucks might move to exclude unionized stores from new benefits in comments to store managers over a video call in mid april at the time he said he had just learned that starbucks is not permitted by law to offer new benefits to a store that voted for a union while they are in the collective bargaining process workers united called schultz s assertion dead wrong and filed unfair labor practice charges with the national labor relations board under section 8 a 5 employers simply cannot implement new benefits during contract negotiations unilaterally wrote gabe frumkin counsel for workers united instead they must bargain with the union if they wish to implement new benefits programs in the filing frumkin charges that schultz misrepresented the law by giving the misimpression that starbucks could not even offer such benefits to the workers or their union representative schultz s comments had an immediate and profound chilling effect on organizing campaigns nationwide frumkin wrote schultz says no union contract measures up to what starbucks already offers the union drive at starbucks has been remarkable not only because of the stunning speed at which it has spread but also because food and drink establishments are among the least unionized in the country with just over 1 of the sector unionized in 2021 according to the labor department but unlike many other food and beverage chains starbucks has long prided itself on being a standout employer offering health care retirement stock options and free college tuition to full time and part time employees referred to as partners at starbucks indeed the generous benefits and socially progressive culture are a big part of what has drawn many workers to starbucks which has some 9 000 stores nationwide compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what starbucks offers schultz said on tuesday s shareholder call as he s pledged transformation at starbucks schultz says outside forces are driving union campaign upon his return to the company schultz acknowledged that starbucks had to transform over the past month he s traveled to different regions to attend what he calls co creation sessions with store employees referred to as partners at starbucks hearing them out on problems they encounter on the job as well as scheduling and pay issues it was difficult and emotional at times to hear the challenges and the issues that partners are facing schultz told store managers in a video call last month but in the shareholder call on tuesday schultz made clear that he thinks the source of workers grievances may have less to do with starbucks and more to do with events that have shaped workers lives from the great recession to the global pandemic these young people have completely valid concerns given today s uncertainty and economic instability he said they look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling it was a toned down version of comments he made last month when he spoke of companies throughout the country being assaulted in many ways by the threat of unionization and referred to the starbucks union drive as a new outside force trying desperately to disrupt our company that characterization has riled starbucks workers who say they are the ones leading the unionizing efforts at their stores not some outside force schultz has spoken of organizers intentionally and aggressively sowing divisions within the company while attempting to sell a very different view of what starbucks should be he said he s heard of stories of employees who did not support the union being bullied into not voting in elections pointing to the low turnout in store elections he urged store managers to encourage all workers to vote in pushing the outside force narrative schultz could be referring to one particular worker in buffalo where the starbucks union campaign got its start before landing a barista job with starbucks in 2020 jaz brisack a rhodes scholar from the university of mississippi had worked as an organizer with the uaw in mississippi and with workers united in buffalo where she led an effort to organize baristas at a local coffee chain but workers at starbucks stores across the country describe being inspired by the baristas in buffalo not directed by them while workers united lawyers are helping store workers file petitions for union elections and unfair labor practice charges the workers say they are the ones reaching out to coworkers across shifts and deciding what it is they want as a store starbucks workers condemn starbucks union busting activities all but a handful of the more than 50 starbucks stores that have held union elections to date have voted to unionize an election in springfield virginia in april ended in a 10 to 8 loss a result that workers united is challenging gailyn berg a shift supervisor who led the union campaign at their store believes starbucks union busting activities in fact changed votes pointing specifically to managers warnings about what could happen if the store voted to unionize we weren t going to be able to get raises in the next coming months we re not going to be able to work at other stores definitely our partners believe that berg said berg says those warnings were delivered through mandatory sessions between managers and employees known as captive audience meetings although starbucks denies that the meetings were mandatory the national labor relations board has moved to ban captive audience meetings as an unfair labor practice starbucks denies engaging in illegal anti union activities including at other stores where worker organizers have been fired starbucks says the workers in question were fired for violating company policies the nlrb has issued formal complaints against starbucks in a couple such cases calling the actions were retaliatory in arizona the nlrb has sued starbucks to have three workers

russia appeared to dodge default on its foreign debt by dipping into its scarce dollar reserves but moscow s debt drama is far from over russia s finance ministry abandoned its proposal to use rubles instead of dollars to make overdue payments on two government bonds saying friday that it had transferred the money to an account at citigroup 564 4 million for a bond due in 2022 and 84 4 million for another due in 2042 a 30 day grace period on making the overdue payments was to expire wednesday the government had claimed that u s sanctions freezing its massive currency reserves held abroad meant it couldn t pay and that russia wasn t to blame for any default the first on foreign debt since the 1917 bolshevik revolution even if russia is found to have made the most recent payments others are coming due plus u s permission for american bondholders to accept payment on russian bonds is set to expire may 25 so even if russia tries to pay investors would not legally be able to take the money here are some of the issues surrounding russian debt why are people talking about a possible russian default ratings agencies have said that if bonds specify payment in dollars then paying in rubles amounts to a failure to pay as promised one reason russia would want to pay in rubles instead of its reserves of foreign currency is that a large part of them have been frozen abroad it made friday s payment by dipping into scarce internal reserves that sanctions could not touch russia has not definitively avoided default unless the money made its way from citigroup through the banking system to bondholders ahead of wednesday s deadline bondholders don t get paid until citigroup processes the payments and pass them on to clearinghouses that distribute payment to bondholders said jay s auslander a top sovereign debt lawyer at the firm of wilk auslander in new york banks are being extremely cautious about any transactions with russia and may want to check with u s and uk authorities first but i think it s likely is that the funds will make it to the bondholders in which case they will not be in default this time auslander said how much does russia owe about 40 billion in foreign bonds about half of that to foreigners before the start of the war russia had around 640 billion in foreign currency and gold reserves much of which was held overseas and is now frozen how do you know if a country is in default ratings agencies can lower the rating to default or a court can decide the issue bondholders who have credit default swaps contracts that act like insurance policies against default can ask a committee of financial firm representatives to decide whether a failure to pay debt should trigger a payout which still isn t a formal declaration of default the credit default determination committee an industry group of 14 banks and investors that determines whether or not to pay on these swaps said friday that they continue to monitor the situation after russia s payment after another meeting tuesday the committee said it would continue to monitor the situation and defer publication of an initial list of deliverable obligations what can investors do the formal way to declare default is if 25 or more of bondholders say they didn t get their money once that happens provisions say all russia s other foreign bonds are also in default and bondholders could then seek a court judgment to enforce payment in normal circumstances investors and the defaulting government typically negotiate a settlement in which bondholders are given new bonds that are worth less but that at least give them some partial compensation but sanctions bar dealings with russia s finance ministry and no one knows when the war will end or how much defaulted bonds could wind up being worth in this case declaring default and suing might not be the wisest choice auslander said you can t negotiate with russia right now you re wading into a world where sanctions are constantly changing where there are a lot of unknowns so you may see creditors decide at this point to keep their intentions close to their vest and hang tight for now popular sentiment is a consideration for investors especially any who may have bought bonds at knocked down prices in hopes of profiting from a settlement right now is maybe not a good time to rush in and show that you were profiting off distressed debt in russian bonds auslander said will that time come in the future i suspect it will once a country defaults it can be cut off from bond market borrowing until the default is sorted out and investors regain confidence in the government s ability and willingness to pay but russia has already been cut off from western capital markets so any return to borrowing is a long way off anyway the kremlin can still borrow rubles at home where it mostly relies on russian banks to buy its bonds what impact could a russian default have the country is already suffering substantial economic impact from western sanctions which have sent foreign companies fleeing and disrupted trade and financial ties with the rest of the world default would be one more symptom of that isolation and disruption investment analysts are cautiously reckoning that a russia default would not have the kind of impact on global financial markets and institutions that came from an earlier default in 1998 back then russia s default on domestic ruble bonds led the u s government to step in and get banks to bail out long term capital management a large u s hedge fund whose collapse it was feared could have shaken the wider financial and banking system holders of the bonds for instance funds that invest in emerging market bonds could take serious losses russia however played only a small role in emerging market bond indexes limiting the losses to fund investors while the war itself is having devastating consequences in terms of human suffering and higher food and energy prices worldwide default on government bonds would be definitely not systemically relevant kristalina georgieva head of the international monetary fund has said

q1 2022 total revenue was 8 7 million including product sales of 7 9 million core non covid 19 product sales were an estimated 7 6 million and on a constant currency basis were comparable to core product sales a year ago product gross margins were 80 monmouth junction n j may 3 2022 prnewswire cytosorbents corporation nasdaq ctso a leader in the treatment of life threatening conditions in the intensive care unit and cardiac surgery using blood purification via its proprietary polymer adsorption technology today reported unaudited financial and operating results for the quarter ended march 31 2022 first quarter 2022 financial results total revenue including product sales and grant income for q1 2022 was 8 7 million a decrease of 18 compared to 10 6 million in q1 2021 q1 2022 product sales were 7 9 million including an estimated 7 6 million core non covid 19 sales and 0 3 million covid 19 related sales versus 10 1 million 8 3 million core and 1 8 million covid related in q1 2021 a decrease of 22 this decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in german direct sales which were hampered by the impact of unprecedented rates of new covid 19 infection in the country that persisted throughout q1 2022 and to a lesser extent a weaker euro germany sales were 3 8 million in q1 2022 versus 5 9 million a year ago a decline of 36 q1 2022 product sales were also lower by 0 6 million due to the stronger dollar compared to the euro on a constant currency basis core product sales in q1 2022 would have been 8 2 million and were comparable to core product sales of 8 3 million a year ago as expected covid 19 related sales during the quarter were low reflecting the low severity of current covid 19 illness resulting from high rates of vaccination and natural immunity product gross margins improved to approximately 80 in q1 2022 versus 77 in q1 2021 the company continues to have a solid balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of 44 7 million which includes 1 7 million in restricted cash at march 31 2022 and no debt recent operating highlights dr phillip chan chief executive officer of cytosorbents stated a key takeaway from our first quarter results is that our core non covid 19 product sales were stable on par with q3 and q4 2021 and comparable with q1 2021 product sales on a constant currency basis we did this despite the many business challenges and uncertainties created by covid 19 the russian ukraine war inflation currency exchange volatility and other factors out of our direct control as anticipated covid 19 related sales were nominal for q1 2022 due to the low severity of recent covid 19 infections and primarily accounted for the difference in product sales from a year ago during q1 2022 cytosorb sales in germany the company s largest market lagged as the country experienced its highest rates of covid infections since the pandemic began when we provided our 2022 outlook in early march the omicron wave appeared to be peaking but was supplanted by a massive wave of ba 2 variant infections that drove a new peak of more than a half million new covid 19 infections a day by the end of q1 2022 seven times higher than in the prior quarter and 21 times the peak seen a year ago we have previously discussed how these high rates of covid 19 indirectly reduce cytosorb sales by impacting hospital budgets staffing elective procedure volumes icu capacity and sale representative access due to visitation restrictions and illness fortunately covid 19 infection rates have dropped rapidly in the past several weeks however the ba 2 surge which still accounts for nearly 100 000 new infections a day in the country will likely delay the expected recovery in germany we are seeing a carryover of germany q1 sales trends to the current quarter and although this may change it has prompted us to conservatively revise our 2022 guidance see revision of 2022 outlook guidance below that said we are focused on the more important big picture where current trends portend an end to the global pandemic this year as covid 19 is expected to morph into a much less virulent disease like seasonal influenza when this happens we want to be well positioned to capitalize on what we expect will be a steady improvement and return to growth in our core business dr chan continued we remain confident that the slowdown in our growth is mainly driven by reversible covid related issues and expect that these too shall pass in the meantime we have a solid balance sheet anchored by 44 7 million in cash and no debt at the end of q1 2022 to weather the current turbulence we are also managing our business proactively continuing to invest in key areas such as our u s pivotal star t and star d trials while instituting tighter cost controls to reduce our cash burn by an additional 2 million per quarter against budget our goal is to end this year with more than 30m in cash which exceeds our projected cash need in 2023 and importantly is expected to provide adequate funds through the anticipated enrollment completion of both the pivotal u s star t and star d trials we also have the additional financial flexibility from our 15 million bridge bank term loan commitment to add debt if desired meanwhile we are not just waiting for conditions to improve rather we are focused on building this company and solidifying our leadership as the treatment pioneer of life threatening conditions using blood purification we are laser focused on four essential objectives that we believe are the key to driving sustainable long term value for shareholders open the u s market by obtaining fda marketing approval for drugsorb atr to remove blood thinning drugs during cardiothoracic surgery see clinical update below restore growth of core cytosorb sales driven by numerous initiatives see below transition cytosorb production to our new manufacturing facility and headquarters in princeton new jersey this year see operational update above forge and expand new and existing strategic partnerships to maximize the synergy between our technology and those of our partners while creating new global opportunities for growth to provide more color on our growth strategy we highlight several examples of important initiatives that we have been executing upon during the pandemic that are expected to drive improved results as the pandemic abates as well as future longer term growth near term growth drivers resume in person sales from a strong customer base our active customer base accounts for the majority of our direct sales and grew by 20 25 at the start of the pandemic and has remained stable since we are in close contact with these accounts and have confirmed that covid 19 related issues including its effect on staffing and numbers of icu patients are the primary issue for volatility in ordering we believe a return to in person selling will reinvigorate growth new therapeutic area divisions we have established three distinct therapy divisions within our commercial operations including critical care cardiovascular and liver kidney other to develop these markets internationally under the leadership of dedicated medical and commercial subject matter experts who will work closely with our sales teams and best serve the needs and interests of our customers we have already seen our efforts bear fruit with now more than 150 cardiac surgery centers internationally who have begun to use cytosorb to remove antithrombotic drugs during cardiac surgery for example we believe this infrastructure will yield many more similar successes across a broad array of applications new exclusive private hospital chain partnerships we are now the preferred supplier of hemoadsorption technology to the three largest hospital chains in germany including as announced yesterday asklepios group rise of existing and new applications among the many applications we highlight shock many studies have highlighted the ability of cytosorb to remove inflammatory mediators and help to stabilize shock a potentially fatal drop in blood pressure in a wide range of patients a recent 2019 meta analysis found that approximately 10 of icu patients have septic shock at admission and an additional 8 of patients admitted to the icu develop septic shock at some point in their hospital stay with a high mortality of 38 cytosorb is being used around the world as a treatment of shock and we are conducting the procyss rct to formally evaluate cytosorb as a treatment of this common and major unmet medical need liver disease in the treatment of acute liver disease cytosorb outperforms the market leading mars platform baxter in the in vitro removal of many liver toxins but has the added benefit of removing cytokines and inflammatory mediators while being much easier to use in real world practice cytosorb has replaced mars at many accounts one in 11 people worldwide have chronic liver disease that may deteriorate and require hospitalization and blood purification through our liver kidney division we aim to drive cytosorb as a therapy of choice in these patients lung injury our u s ctc registry highlights the high survival of critically ill covid 19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards treated with cytosorb and ecmo under fda emergency use authorization we believe these data demonstrate a therapeutic strategy of enhanced lung rest using the combined therapies that can be extrapolated to the treatment of ards in non covid patients a very large market longer term growth drivers stand alone blood pump business model there are many applications where a simple to use low cost hemoperfusion pump is adequate to implement our cytosorb blood purification technology this approach enables our customers to deliver cytosorb without the complexity of a full scale dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy crrt machine without the need for a dialysis technician and in clinical situations where the patient has not developed kidney failure by improving access to care and simplifying treatment with cytosorb in the icu we are potentially enabling more frequent and earlier use on more patients while supporting new hospital wide applications in the emergency room surgery suites and elsewhere cytosorbents has partnered with a major international dialysis company to distribute a high quality hemoperfusion machine and accessories and to provide field support to customers in germany austria and luxembourg and are currently in the midst of a pilot launch while early the initial results and feedback from this pilot have been promising pending continued success we plan a broader rollout in these countries and may pursue expansion of the program to more countries in the future we believe this can be a potentially important supplementary business model going forward that can significantly expand our total addressable markets and contribute meaningfully to cytosorb sales growth expansion of direct sales territories although opening new countries with a direct sales force requires time cost and resources it also allows us to directly lead the effort drive results and benefit from more profitable sales with the announcement of expansion of direct sales into the u k and ireland we now sell direct in two of the e u s big 5 economies germany and the u k and a total of 15 countries direct overall while working with distributors or partners in the other three big 5 economies france italy and spain investment in important clinical studies in shock liver failure cardiac surgery atr etc we are committed to funding company sponsored studies such as the star t star d and procyss rcts in key areas that we believe will drive international adoption and usage of our technologies with the goal of becoming a standard of care for those applications see clinical studies and data publications update below dr chan concluded we firmly believe we are a solidly financed company with a robust strategic and tactical plan that positions us well for both near term and long term success once the effects of the pandemic abate although we know it has been challenging we thank you for your understanding and continued support clinical studies and data publications update cardiac surgery u s star t pivotal rct enrollment and

quarter of 2022 was 8 7 million down 18 from 10 6 million in the first quarter of 2021 product sales in the first quarter of 2022 were 7 9 million down 22 from 10 1 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to a decrease in direct sales primarily from lower sales in germany due to covid 19 pandemic market conditions as well as the impact of the decrease in the average exchange rate of the euro to the u s dollar which negatively impacted first quarter 2022 product sales by approximately 0 6 million due to a surge in covid 19 case in the first quarter of 2022 many hospitals throughout germany either maintained or reinstituted restrictions such as visitation rights to non essential visitors however unlike prior waves in germany the rates of severe covid 19 illness requiring icu care and death have been comparatively very low this is being partly attributed to high rates of vaccinations that are associated with reduced severity of illness reduced need for hospitalization and risk of death these factors led to a decrease in both covid 19 and core non covid 19 cytosorb sales in germany in aggregate covid 19 related sales in the first quarter of 2021 were estimated to be 0 3 million compared to 1 8 million in the first quarter of 2021 core non covid 19 sales declined 9 from 8 3 million in the first quarter of 2021 to 7 6 million in the first quarter of 2022 cost of revenues cost of revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was 2 3 million compared to 2 8 million for the first quarter of 2021 product gross margins were approximately 80 for the first quarter of 2022 compared to approximately 77 for the first quarter of 2021 due mainly to the impact of non recurring costs of approximately 0 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 related to prior year tariffs following an audit by the german customs authorities that did not recur in 2022 operating expenses operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to 14 2 million a 33 increase from 10 7 million for the first quarter of 2021 research and development expenses increased from 2 3 million in the first quarter of 2021 to 4 2 million in the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to an increase in clinical trial and related costs rent expense on our new facility and other r d costs selling general administrative sg a expenses increased 19 to 9 2 million in the first quarter of 2022 from 7 7 million in the prior year period due primarily to an increase in salaries commissions and related costs of 0 9 million an increase in occupancy costs related to rent on our new facility in princeton nj of 0 4 million and an increase in sales and marketing costs which include advertising and conference attendance of approximately 0 3 million among other items these sg a expense increases were partially offset by lower non cash restricted stock expense of 0 3 million among other decreased expenses included within sg a legal financial and other consulting expense increased from 0 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 to 0 8 million in the first quarter of 2022 liquidity and capital resources since inception our operations have been primarily financed through the private and public placement of our debt and equity securities at march 31 2022 we had current assets of approximately 55 9 million including unrestricted cash on hand of approximately 43 0 million and had current liabilities of approximately 14 7 million as of march 31 2022 25 million of our total shelf amount was allocated to our atm facility all of which is still available in addition we have 15 million of debt availability providing financial flexibility if needed in april of 2022 we received approximately 740 000 in cash from the approved sale of our net operating losses and research and development credits from the state of new jersey we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund the company s operations beyond twelve months from issuance of the financial statements for the quarter ending march 31 2022 revision of 2022 outlook guidance the macro environment in which we operate remains difficult to predict given the complex drivers of our business the global nature of our operations and external factors such as the covid 19 pandemic the russia ukraine war inflation currency exchange volatility and other factors that are not in our direct control as evidence of this since our prior guidance on march 8 2022 where we anticipated growth of 20 or more in 2022 core product sales germany has since suffered a major surge in new covid 19 cases driven by the omicron ba 2 variant although infection rates are now falling we believe this has delayed the recovery of german hospitals and our german business given the importance of germany to our financial results and given that we see some q1 sales trends carrying over to q2 2022 although this may change we are revising our guidance to the following we expect covid 19 cases and hospitalizations worldwide to continue to decline and expect to reach a more normalized operating environment as the year progresses because of this we expect continued and progressive improvement in our underlying core non covid 19 business and expect growth in 2022 of core product sales on a constant currency basis however due to our limited visibility we are removing specific growth targets with plans to revisit this later in the year this expectation assumes a gradual recovery of normalized hospital activity and sales access in germany and other key countries no major economic slowdowns or major surges in covid 19 infections caused by new covid 19 variants little to no contribution to sales from russia and neighboring countries that might be impacted by the war in 2021 sales from these geographies represented less than 4 of total product sales no escalation of the russia ukraine war to other countries limited covid 19 related product sales in 2022 due to high rates of vaccination and natural immunity that have reduced the severity of covid 19 illness and need for hospitalization and icu care and with it the use of cytosorb in these patients for additional information please see the company s form 10 q for the period

by david gaffen new york reuters oil prices jumped on wednesday as the european union the world s largest trading bloc spelled out plans to phase out imports of russian oil raising concerns about further market tightness as those nations hunt for adequate supply crude benchmarks have risen steadily over the past two months following moscow s invasion of ukraine until now the european union has been reluctant to fully cut off imports of russian oil and gas and its plans still do not suggest a full ban for all eu members europe imports some 3 5 million barrels of russian oil and oil products daily and also depends on moscow s gas supplies inventories are so tight so against this backdrop when you re talking about this ban there are a lot of questions on how europe is going to make up for this said phil flynn senior analyst at price futures group futures settled up 5 17 or 4 9 to 110 14 a barrel west texas intermediate crude futures settled at 107 81 a barrel up 5 40 or 5 3 european commission president ursula von der leyen on wednesday proposed a phased oil embargo on russia as well as sanctioning russia s top bank the commission s measures include phasing out supplies of russian crude within six months and refined products by the end of 2022 von der leyen said she also pledged to minimise the impact of the move on european economies hungary and slovakia however will be able to continue buying russian until the end of 2023 under existing contracts an eu source told reuters russia could offset the loss of one of its primary customers by selling oil to other importers including india and china neither country has stopped buying from moscow needs for much greater supplies are not likely to be met at a meeting on thursday of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and allied producers opec is expected to stick to its plan for a gradual ramp up of monthly production in the united states crude stocks rose modestly last week according to the u s energy information administration stocks were up 1 2 million barrels as the united states released more barrels from its strategic reserves fuel stocks fell in part due to stronger exports of products since russia s invasion as buyers have sought other sources the markets largely shook off the federal reserve s announcement that it would raise interest rates by a half percentage point to try to bring down rising inflation the market was up so strong before the announcement i think the fed was a foregone conclusion said gary cunningham director of market research at tradition energy
a month after his return to starbucks as interim ceo howard schultz has announced new benefits including expanded training improved sick leave and credit card tipping for some 240 000 starbucks employees at more than 8 800 stores across the country but not for those that are unionizing we do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway schultz said on a conference call with shareholders on tuesday starbucks said all employees including those at stores that are unionizing would receive the wage hikes that were first announced last october on august 1 employees will get either a 3 raise or 15 dollars hour whichever is higher and tenured hourly employers will get even bigger raises the announcement comes as more than 230 starbucks stores have filed petitions for union elections and about 50 stores have voted to join the national union workers united since december making it one of the most significant union drives in america schultz hinted that starbucks might move to exclude unionized stores from new benefits in comments to store managers over a video call in mid april at the time he said he had just learned that starbucks is not permitted by law to offer new benefits to a store that voted for a union while they are in the collective bargaining process workers united called schultz s assertion dead wrong and filed unfair labor practice charges with the national labor relations board under section 8 a 5 employers simply cannot implement new benefits during contract negotiations unilaterally wrote gabe frumkin counsel for workers united instead they must bargain with the union if they wish to implement new benefits programs in the filing frumkin charges that schultz misrepresented the law by giving the misimpression that starbucks could not even offer such benefits to the workers or their union representative schultz s comments had an immediate and profound chilling effect on organizing campaigns nationwide frumkin wrote schultz says no union contract measures up to what starbucks already offers the union drive at starbucks has been remarkable not only because of the stunning speed at which it has spread but also because food and drink establishments are among the least unionized in the country with just over 1 of the sector unionized in 2021 according to the labor department but unlike many other food and beverage chains starbucks has long prided itself on being a standout employer offering health care retirement stock options and free college tuition to full time and part time employees referred to as partners at starbucks indeed the generous benefits and socially progressive culture are a big part of what has drawn many workers to starbucks which has some 9 000 stores nationwide compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what starbucks offers schultz said on tuesday s shareholder call as he s pledged transformation at starbucks schultz says outside forces are driving union campaign upon his return to the company schultz acknowledged that starbucks had to transform over the past month he s traveled to different regions to attend what he calls co creation sessions with store employees referred to as partners at starbucks hearing them out on problems they encounter on the job as well as scheduling and pay issues it was difficult and emotional at times to hear the challenges and the issues that partners are facing schultz told store managers in a video call last month but in the shareholder call on tuesday schultz made clear that he thinks the source of workers grievances may have less to do with starbucks and more to do with events that have shaped workers lives from the great recession to the global pandemic these young people have completely valid concerns given today s uncertainty and economic instability he said they look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling it was a toned down version of comments he made last month when he spoke of companies throughout the country being assaulted in many ways by the threat of unionization and referred to the starbucks union drive as a new outside force trying desperately to disrupt our company that characterization has riled starbucks workers who say they are the ones leading the unionizing efforts at their stores not some outside force schultz has spoken of organizers intentionally and aggressively sowing divisions within the company while attempting to sell a very different view of what starbucks should be he said he s heard of stories of employees who did not support the union being bullied into not voting in elections pointing to the low turnout in store elections he urged store managers to encourage all workers to vote in pushing the outside force narrative schultz could be referring to one particular worker in buffalo where the starbucks union campaign got its start before landing a barista job with starbucks in 2020 jaz brisack a rhodes scholar from the university of mississippi had worked as an organizer with the uaw in mississippi and with workers united in buffalo where she led an effort to organize baristas at a local coffee chain but workers at starbucks stores across the country describe being inspired by the baristas in buffalo not directed by them while workers united lawyers are helping store workers file petitions for union elections and unfair labor practice charges the workers say they are the ones reaching out to coworkers across shifts and deciding what it is they want as a store starbucks workers condemn starbucks union busting activities all but a handful of the more than 50 starbucks stores that have held union elections to date have voted to unionize an election in springfield virginia in april ended in a 10 to 8 loss a result that workers united is challenging gailyn berg a shift supervisor who led the union campaign at their store believes starbucks union busting activities in fact changed votes pointing specifically to managers warnings about what could happen if the store voted to unionize we weren t going to be able to get raises in the next coming months we re not going to be able to work at other stores definitely our partners believe that berg said berg says those warnings were delivered through mandatory sessions between managers and employees known as captive audience meetings although starbucks denies that the meetings were mandatory the national labor relations board has moved to ban captive audience meetings as an unfair labor practice starbucks denies engaging in illegal anti union activities including at other stores where worker organizers have been fired starbucks says the workers in question were fired for violating company policies the nlrb has issued formal complaints against starbucks in a couple such cases calling the actions were retaliatory in arizona the nlrb has sued starbucks to have three workers

this is the report delivered by keith jones to the 2022 international may day online rally held on may 1 jones is the national secretary of the socialist equality party in canada to view all speeches visit wsws org mayday keith jones national secretary of the socialist equality party canada the socialist equality party canada joins with its sister parties in the international committee of the fourth international in summoning the working class to oppose the reckless ever escalating us nato war on russia absent the revolutionary intervention of the international working class the imperialist powers will plunge humanity into a global conflagration as they did twice before in the last century canadian imperialism is playing an especially provocative and belligerent role in the ukraine war as it did in the war s preparation and instigation over the past quarter century under liberal and conservative governments alike canada has enthusiastically supported the us led drive to encircle russia and to harness ukraine to nato and the european union from 2015 hundreds of canadian armed forces trainers were deployed to ukraine where they worked alongside american and british military personnel to reorganize ukraine s armed forces this included helping integrate and train the fascists of the azov battalion the trudeau liberal government has led the charge for all out economic warfare against russia working in tandem with britain s tory regime it pressed for russia s exclusion from the swift banking system and the seizure of the assets of russia s central bank since january canada has pledged to deliver 618 million worth of military aid to ukraine by no later than next march the first shipment of heavy weaponry arrived last week behind a smokescreen of poisonous war propaganda the canadian ruling class is pursuing the most predatory economic and geopolitical objectives under conditions of systemic capitalist crisis it is determined to strengthen its eight decades old military security alliance with washington which it deems pivotal to securing and expanding its extensive global imperialist interests canada also has its own strategic rivalry with russia this is particularly true in the arctic where climate change is making the exploitation of natural resources and sea lanes ever more viable but there is a third important factor propelling canada s outsized role in the us nato war on russia the canadian state s longstanding alliance with the ukrainian far right after the fall of hitler s third reich canada provided refuge to tens of thousands of ukrainian fascists who had collaborated with the nazis in some of the 20th century s most monstrous crimes and carried out their own mass slaughter of jews and poles in pursuit of an ethnically pure ukrainian state canadian imperialism used these forces as tools in its cold war foreign and domestic policy this included helping them cover up and whitewash their crimes in the late 1980s and 1990s the ukrainian canadian far right was deployed to press for capitalist restoration the dissolution of the soviet union and subsequently for independent ukraine s transformation into a vassal of the western imperialist powers the ukrainian canadian congress ucc has long served as the nexus of the collaboration between the canadian state and the far right ukrainian nationalists the ucc writes a noted ukrainian canadian historian has put the glorification of the nazis ukrainian fascist collaborators at the very center of the ukrainian national identity project the alliance between canadian imperialism and the ukrainian far right is most strikingly embodied in the person of chrystia freeland canada s deputy prime minister finance minister and chief architect of its feminist foreign policy freeland has often written and spoken of her schooling in ukrainian nationalism by her beloved grandfather to describe freeland s maternal grandfather michael chomiak as a nazi collaborator is to be charitable from january 1940 through the first months of 1945 he edited the sole ukrainian language newspaper in nazi occupied poland krakivs ki visti krackow news lionized adolph hitler celebrated the nazi war of extermination against the soviet union incited hatred for jews and promoted the formation of a ukrainian division of the waffen ss the leading anti russia war hawk in canada s government freeland has come to play an important role in ukrainian domestic politics every evening she speaks by phone to ukraine s prime minister and finance minister at gatherings of her ukrainian canadian allies freeland routinely invokes symbols and rituals associated with the world war ii ukrainian fascists when her political ancestry was exposed in 2017 the entire political establishment and corporate media joined freeland in curtly dismissing it as russian disinformation no investigation of the canadian state s patronage of the ukrainian far right was to be permitted above all of its contemporary iteration be it the use of ukrainian fascists as shock troops in the 2014 us orchestrated canadian assisted coup that overthrew ukraine s democratically elected pro russian president the canadian armed forces training of the fascists embedded in ukraine s armed forces or the state sponsored ukrainian canadian congress s role in ideologically and materially promoting the ukrainian far right and its exclusivist virulently anti communist nationalism the unanimous denunciations of russian disinformation in the freeland affair were a small anticipation of the anti russia war fever that now unites canada s entire political establishment from right to ostensibly left federalist and pro quebec independence the social democrats of the new democratic party with the full throated support of the trade unions responded to the war s outbreak by forming a governmental alliance with trudeau and freeland in the name of political stability the ndp has pledged to keep the minority liberal government in power until june 2025 as it wages war dramatically hikes military spending and pivots to imposing austerity and inflation driven real wage cuts this is a continuation and escalation of the role that the unions and ndp have played throughout the pandemic in march april 2020 they supported the trudeau government s funneling of hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial markets and banks and corporate coffers then policed the ruinous back to work back to school policy that has resulted in six successive waves of mass infection and death that have officially killed more than 39 000 canadians writing in the transitional program leon trotsky observed that in times of extreme crisis like war trade union leaders become bourgeois ministers the union ndp liberal alliance is aimed at suppressing the class struggle so as to give the canadian ruling class a free hand in waging imperialist war abroad and class war at home they will not succeed the pandemic the war their ruinous economic fallout and decades of austerity and ever widening social inequality are impelling workers in canada like their class brothers and sisters around the world into struggle moreover these struggles are increasingly erupting in opposition to and outside the corporatist trade unions and phony establishment left parties the great challenge is to impart these struggles with a clear socialist internationalist program and perspective that is the task of the icfi and its socialist equality parties i appeal to you to join us in this fight

a month after his return to starbucks as interim ceo howard schultz has announced new benefits including expanded training improved sick leave and credit card tipping for some 240 000 starbucks employees at more than 8 800 stores across the country but not for those that are unionizing we do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway schultz said on a conference call with shareholders on tuesday starbucks said all employees including those at stores that are unionizing would receive the wage hikes that were first announced last october on august 1 employees will get either a 3 raise or 15 dollars hour whichever is higher and tenured hourly employers will get even bigger raises the announcement comes as more than 230 starbucks stores have filed petitions for union elections and about 50 stores have voted to join the national union workers united since december making it one of the most significant union drives in america schultz hinted that starbucks might move to exclude unionized stores from new benefits in comments to store managers over a video call in mid april at the time he said he had just learned that starbucks is not permitted by law to offer new benefits to a store that voted for a union while they are in the collective bargaining process workers united called schultz s assertion dead wrong and filed unfair labor practice charges with the national labor relations board under section 8 a 5 employers simply cannot implement new benefits during contract negotiations unilaterally wrote gabe frumkin counsel for workers united instead they must bargain with the union if they wish to implement new benefits programs in the filing frumkin charges that schultz misrepresented the law by giving the misimpression that starbucks could not even offer such benefits to the workers or their union representative schultz s comments had an immediate and profound chilling effect on organizing campaigns nationwide frumkin wrote schultz says no union contract measures up to what starbucks already offers the union drive at starbucks has been remarkable not only because of the stunning speed at which it has spread but also because food and drink establishments are among the least unionized in the country with just over 1 of the sector unionized in 2021 according to the labor department but unlike many other food and beverage chains starbucks has long prided itself on being a standout employer offering health care retirement stock options and free college tuition to full time and part time employees referred to as partners at starbucks indeed the generous benefits and socially progressive culture are a big part of what has drawn many workers to starbucks which has some 9 000 stores nationwide compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what starbucks offers schultz said on tuesday s shareholder call as he s pledged transformation at starbucks schultz says outside forces are driving union campaign upon his return to the company schultz acknowledged that starbucks had to transform over the past month he s traveled to different regions to attend what he calls co creation sessions with store employees referred to as partners at starbucks hearing them out on problems they encounter on the job as well as scheduling and pay issues it was difficult and emotional at times to hear the challenges and the issues that partners are facing schultz told store managers in a video call last month but in the shareholder call on tuesday schultz made clear that he thinks the source of workers grievances may have less to do with starbucks and more to do with events that have shaped workers lives from the great recession to the global pandemic these young people have completely valid concerns given today s uncertainty and economic instability he said they look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling it was a toned down version of comments he made last month when he spoke of companies throughout the country being assaulted in many ways by the threat of unionization and referred to the starbucks union drive as a new outside force trying desperately to disrupt our company that characterization has riled starbucks workers who say they are the ones leading the unionizing efforts at their stores not some outside force schultz has spoken of organizers intentionally and aggressively sowing divisions within the company while attempting to sell a very different view of what starbucks should be he said he s heard of stories of employees who did not support the union being bullied into not voting in elections pointing to the low turnout in store elections he urged store managers to encourage all workers to vote in pushing the outside force narrative schultz could be referring to one particular worker in buffalo where the starbucks union campaign got its start before landing a barista job with starbucks in 2020 jaz brisack a rhodes scholar from the university of mississippi had worked as an organizer with the uaw in mississippi and with workers united in buffalo where she led an effort to organize baristas at a local coffee chain but workers at starbucks stores across the country describe being inspired by the baristas in buffalo not directed by them while workers united lawyers are helping store workers file petitions for union elections and unfair labor practice charges the workers say they are the ones reaching out to coworkers across shifts and deciding what it is they want as a store starbucks workers condemn starbucks union busting activities all but a handful of the more than 50 starbucks stores that have held union elections to date have voted to unionize an election in springfield virginia in april ended in a 10 to 8 loss a result that workers united is challenging gailyn berg a shift supervisor who led the union campaign at their store believes starbucks union busting activities in fact changed votes pointing specifically to managers warnings about what could happen if the store voted to unionize we weren t going to be able to get raises in the next coming months we re not going to be able to work at other stores definitely our partners believe that berg said berg says those warnings were delivered through mandatory sessions between managers and employees known as captive audience meetings although starbucks denies that the meetings were mandatory the national labor relations board has moved to ban captive audience meetings as an unfair labor practice starbucks denies engaging in illegal anti union activities including at other stores where worker organizers have been fired starbucks says the workers in question were fired for violating

is heading for its biggest contraction since the years following the 1991 break up of the soviet union the russia military reacted today with great anger to our successes ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy said in his evening address the sheer scale of today s shelling clearly does not indicate that russia has any special sort of specific military aim andriy sadoviy the mayor of lviv a western city near the polish border said late on tuesday that air strikes had damaged electricity and water networks cutting off power in some districts and causing considerable damage to property olesksandr

they re still fighting they re still bombarding and shooting zelenskiy said via video link at a wall street journal event we need a breather zelenskiy put the preliminary cost of war damage in ukraine so far at around 600 billion he urged foreign companies to pull out of the russian market because not doing so means you are directly supporting that war machine russian president vladimir putin

defense plant to press the u s congress to approve his proposed 33 billion assistance package for ukraine which includes more than 20 billion in military aid if you don t stand up to dictators history

adjusted net income loss from continuing operations per share as presented herein are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap they are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as substitutes for net income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap management believes that these measures provide investors additional meaningful methods to evaluate certain aspects of the company s results period over period and for the other reasons set forth below ebitda is defined as net income loss plus interest expense net of interest income income tax provision benefit depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings as described in our senior secured credit agreement covenant calculations management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors in addition management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to evaluate our performance depreciation expense for property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized internally developed software costs relate to ongoing capital expenditures however amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships software tradenames and noncompete agreements are not representative of ongoing capital expenditures but have a continuing effect on our reported results non gaap financial measures of operating adjusted net income loss from continuing operations and operating adjusted net income loss from continuing operations per share in the opinion of the company provide comparability of the company s performance to other companies that may not have incurred these types of non cash expenses or that report a similar measure in addition operating adjusted net income loss from continuing operations and operating adjusted net income loss from continuing operations per share may include adjustments for certain other charges ebitda adjusted ebitda operating adjusted net income loss from continuing operations and operating adjusted net income loss from continuing operations per share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under gaap these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the 2022 expectation for adjusted ebitda is a forward looking non gaap financial measure we have not reconciled this non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure of net income loss due to the inherent difficulty and impracticability of predicting certain amounts required by gaap with a reasonable degree of accuracy accordingly a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort the following table

jetblue tries to get into the spirit of things as frontier comes out in front earlier in february 2022 frontier and spirit airlines seemed to be leaving the merger party hand having announced a definitive merger agreement that would combine their companies to create a competitive ultra low fare airline they stated that the customer stands to benefit including those in underserved communities and equally important job creation on both sides of the aisle ted christie president and ceo of spirit essentially said we do take frontier to be our lawfully wedded business partner adding that we re a perfect fit william a franke frontier s chairman of the board of directors also emphasized working together on their complementary footprints in early april jetblue s ceo not wanting to be left out in the cold stated that we could be a perfect match a month later jetblue chooses to enhance its proposal to acquire all outstanding common stock of spirit airlines for 33 per share cash adding that it offers spirit shareholders superior financial value and better certainty than the frontier deal perhaps jetblue s unsolicited cash deal or no deal was meant to garner a similar outcome as a certain recent purchase of a social media company jetblue s mention of divestiture of assets remedy packages to address regulatory concerns of their northeast alliance nea with american airlines and a whole host of other concessions and risks not be taken by frontier is more than sufficient reason for spirit to leave them out in the cold at least with frontier they remain mostly intact while leveraging the expanded fleet and reach and spirit airlines said as much in a rebuttal earlier today 02 may 2022 that they re happy with the less lucrative deal with frontier
a month after his return to starbucks as interim ceo howard schultz has announced new benefits including expanded training improved sick leave and credit card tipping for some 240 000 starbucks employees at more than 8 800 stores across the country but not for those that are unionizing we do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway schultz said on a conference call with shareholders on tuesday starbucks said all employees including those at stores that are unionizing would receive the wage hikes that were first announced last october on august 1 employees will get either a 3 raise or 15 dollars hour whichever is higher and tenured hourly employers will get even bigger raises the announcement comes as more than 230 starbucks stores have filed petitions for union elections and about 50 stores have voted to join the national union workers united since december making it one of the most significant union drives in america schultz hinted that starbucks might move to exclude unionized stores from new benefits in comments to store managers over a video call in mid april at the time he said he had just learned that starbucks is not permitted by law to offer new benefits to a store that voted for a union while they are in the collective bargaining process workers united called schultz s assertion dead wrong and filed unfair labor practice charges with the national labor relations board under section 8 a 5 employers simply cannot implement new benefits during contract negotiations unilaterally wrote gabe frumkin counsel for workers united instead they must bargain with the union if they wish to implement new benefits programs in the filing frumkin charges that schultz misrepresented the law by giving the misimpression that starbucks could not even offer such benefits to the workers or their union representative schultz s comments had an immediate and profound chilling effect on organizing campaigns nationwide frumkin wrote schultz says no union contract measures up to what starbucks already offers the union drive at starbucks has been remarkable not only because of the stunning speed at which it has spread but also because food and drink establishments are among the least unionized in the country with just over 1 of the sector unionized in 2021 according to the labor department but unlike many other food and beverage chains starbucks has long prided itself on being a standout employer offering health care retirement stock options and free college tuition to full time and part time employees referred to as partners at starbucks indeed the generous benefits and socially progressive culture are a big part of what has drawn many workers to starbucks which has some 9 000 stores nationwide compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what starbucks offers schultz said on tuesday s shareholder call as he s pledged transformation at starbucks schultz says outside forces are driving union campaign upon his return to the company schultz acknowledged that starbucks had to transform over the past month he s traveled to different regions to attend what he calls co creation sessions with store employees referred to as partners at starbucks hearing them out on problems they encounter on the job as well as scheduling and pay issues it was difficult and emotional at times to hear the challenges and the issues that partners are facing schultz told store managers in a video call last month but in the shareholder call on tuesday schultz made clear that he thinks the source of workers grievances may have less to do with starbucks and more to do with events that have shaped workers lives from the great recession to the global pandemic these young people have completely valid concerns given today s uncertainty and economic instability he said they look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling it was a toned down version of comments he made last month when he spoke of companies throughout the country being assaulted in many ways by the threat of unionization and referred to the starbucks union drive as a new outside force trying desperately to disrupt our company that characterization has riled starbucks workers who say they are the ones leading the unionizing efforts at their stores not some outside force schultz has spoken of organizers intentionally and aggressively sowing divisions within the company while attempting to sell a very different view of what starbucks should be he said he s heard of stories of employees who did not support the union being bullied into not voting in elections pointing to the low turnout in store elections he urged store managers to encourage all workers to vote in pushing the outside force narrative schultz could be referring to one particular worker in buffalo where the starbucks union campaign got its start before landing a barista job with starbucks in 2020 jaz brisack a rhodes scholar from the university of mississippi had worked as an organizer with the uaw in mississippi and with workers united in buffalo where she led an effort to organize baristas at a local coffee chain but workers at starbucks stores across the country describe being inspired by the baristas in buffalo not directed by them while workers united lawyers are helping store workers file petitions for union elections and unfair labor practice charges the workers say they are the ones reaching out to coworkers across shifts and deciding what it is they want as a store starbucks workers condemn starbucks union busting activities all but a handful of the more than 50 starbucks stores that have held union elections to date have voted to unionize an election in springfield virginia in april ended in a 10 to 8 loss a result that workers united is challenging gailyn berg a shift supervisor who led the union campaign at their store believes starbucks union busting activities in fact changed votes pointing specifically to managers warnings about what could happen if the store voted to unionize we weren t going to be able to get raises in the next coming months we re not going to be able to work at other stores definitely our partners believe that berg said berg says those warnings were delivered through mandatory sessions between managers and employees known as captive audience meetings although starbucks denies that the meetings were mandatory the national labor relations board has moved to ban captive audience meetings as an unfair labor practice starbucks denies engaging in illegal anti union activities including at other stores where worker organizers have been fired starbucks says the workers in question were fired for violating company policies the nlrb has issued formal complaints against starbucks in a couple such cases calling the actions were retaliatory in arizona the nlrb has sued starbucks to have three workers
