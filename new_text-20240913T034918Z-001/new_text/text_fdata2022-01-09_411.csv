paper books have come to stay librarians insist janet ogundepo writes about the effects of e books internet on libraries and paper books seated on a chair in front of his dimly lit stall at the popular oshodi market lagos state a bookseller and publisher emeka okochie rested his clasped hands on his knees and bowed his head in prayers he intermittently shook his head while his eyes were closed as he muttered some prayers a lot of us booksellers have become prayer warriors he remarked after a short prayer session once we come to the shop we keep praying to god to help us make sales beyond the advent of electronic books which has disrupted his business in some way okochie said people who still love to stock their personal libraries with hard copies of their choice books had been restrained from doing so due to the current state of the economy he said the truth is that the internet has not drastically affected us in nigeria so much that booksellers cannot make sales some people are not buying books because of the emergence of the internet but others still wish to have their hard copy books but because there is not enough money in circulation we have been struggling one advanced university book is now between n8 000 and n11 000 and a lot of people don t have the money to buy such after casting hopeful glances at a fellow bookseller who came to enquire the availability of a university book okochie was disappointed as he did not have the text he lamented in the last three days i have not sold a book customer patronage is low when primary schools resumed parents compulsorily bought english and mathematics textbooks but they hardly bought sciences and social studies books they did this to make sure the children had some textbooks in school while those in the universities go online to download materials i believe a lot of people would love to have the hard copy because of the disadvantages of relying on the internet and e books but when there is no money to buy it becomes a viable option okochie said he could not publish the manuscripts he wrote last year because he could not get a loan from his bank he had been tagged a defaulter when he could not repay the loan he took in 2020 to publish some books that have remained unsold and continued gathering dust on the shelves he added the cost of paper for production is so high that one of my books that was sold for n300 as of last year is now sold for n1 000 and some parents couldn t afford it i write and produce books but there are low sales sadly okochie is not alone in this downturn other booksellers recount their experiences poor economy social media low sales the harsh economic situation is also taking its toll on a once bustling paper book industry based in abuja the manager of donatus books mr donatus nwaogu said devaluation of the naira and the consequent increase in the price of commodities had affected the purchasing power of paper book lovers sad and bothered about the situation donatus said the effects of e books and the internet on the book business are huge but it is not as huge as the bad economy which has made everything hopeless it would be difficult for someone who has been unable to feed and clothe properly to buy books this will further kill reading in nigeria because the books i was buying n3 000 and sold for n4 500 is now sold betweenat n6 000 and n7 000 how can you cope when the economy is too poor donatus who has been selling books for three decades recalled that when e books were first introduced to nigeria the production and sale of paper books were not affected he however said social media have become a distraction and contributed to the low reading culture of nigerians he said i have never had it this bad before now in a week when i was in lagos not less than 50 people were patronising me sometimes the number rose from 70 100 but when i got to abuja in 2011 in a week i got 30 customers and now it has reduced to 10 those customers were buying two to three books but now it s hard to see anyone buy more than one book these days the number of customers has reduced and they don t go for expensive books low adoption of technology according to britannica e books emerged in the mainstream business world in the late 1990s when a publishing company referred to as peanut press made book content available on personal digital assistants a handheld device that preceded the invention of smart phones and tablets the site added that the sale of e books grew in the early 2000s when sony corporation released an e reading device in 2006 and amazon com released the kindle in 2007 however a teacher and purchasing manager at bible wonderland a bookstore in nigeria isaiah adeogun stated that the invention of e books had not affected the production and sale of paper books stating that nigerians had a slow adoption of technological advancements compared to other countries of the world adeogun emphasised that his bookstore which sold both electronic and hard copy books got more patronage and sales from the paper book section adding that paper books would still be available in nigeria and be relatively high to reckon with in the next 15 years he added though sales of books are relatively low everybody is feeling the heat of the inflation the fewer people that still patronise go for paper books and that can still not be compared to the patronage of e books the younger generation despite their access to gadgets do not make use of it to access information that would add to their knowledge about life i still feel shocked that the youth of this generation don t have the knowledge of current affairs that will help them this shows that definitely they are just using the advent of gadgets and technology on the wrong side they are not maximising the benefits at the end of it all they still fall back on paper books seated behind the desk in his u shaped bookstore in oshodi emmanuel okorie gazed eagerly at the throng of shoppers going back and forth with the hope that a few would stop by in his shop to buy books or bibles he told sunday punch that nigerians still buy books especially for academic purposes despite the advent of the internet he however said increase in the prices of books and notebooks had affected customers patronage as well as his profit margin okorie said books are needed in institutions and nigerians don t embrace technology or new improvement fast people have no option but to buy academic books despite the increase in prices and introduction of gadgets especially in primary and secondary schools the prices of books even notebooks have greatly increased in another vein a bookseller ben chucks lamented that the pandemic had drastically affected sales he added it is someone who has been able to feed well that would remember to buy books except for those who must buy books for their children who are in primary and secondary schools the sales are low e books aiding under utilisation of libraries neat sets of books of varying genres adorned the rows and columns of the shelves of a public library at ilupeju lagos state our correspondent who had been to the facility four times recently observed that the books were largely lying idle as readers came to the library with their laptops to study interviews with some university students revealed that though a few of them still make use of the libraries in their schools many of them go to the libraries armed with their reading materials an undergraduate at the university of benin edo state identified as praise said she was an ardent reader of paper books because they were recommended by her lecturers she added that students in my school still use the library due to the distractions that come from reading on his gadgets an undergraduate at the federal university of agriculture abeokuta ogun state tolulope aribisala said he preferred paper books to e books because i concentrate more on it than e books however tolulope added that e books were his lecturers recommendations in class and that was an advantage to them since contents on the e books could be easily upgraded on the use of libraries tolulope said it is mainly those that find it difficult to read at home who use the library i don t use it i read at home and sometimes go for night classes meanwhile samuel ogundele an undergraduate at the federal university of agriculture abeokuta said the strain on his eyes whenever he reads from his gadgets made him detest e books adding that he was forced to print out recommended texts in e book version on whether students attending his institution still visit the library ogundele said he does not make use of his school s library because it is located far from his off campus hostel students in my school use the library but it is four out of 10 and most of them live in the school hostel he added conversely an undergraduate identified as ademola said that he preferred to use e books to paper ones he emphasised that the electronic method was what applied when he was in the lecture hall he said i use and prefer e books our lecturers give us slides pdf copies of their materials which show they also use e books notwithstanding students in my school still make use of the library and i do too lack of constant electricity which resulted in either low or dead phones or computer batteries including lack of data subscriptions to surf the internet were the reasons ayomide an undergraduate of olabisi onabanjo university ago iwoye ogun state preferred to read paper books she said at the moment i use e book the most and my lecturers recommend e books for us but i prefer hard copies the challenge i currently have with reading e books is that if i want to read and my phone is dead i won t be able to read i will just sit down doing nothing or i sleep also there are some e books one can t download one just has to read online so if i don t have data i won t be able to read but if i have a hard copy i can read anytime nothing will stop me from reading stating that the ambience of the library moved her to read ayomide added in the library one can get the full contents of a book whereas the e book might limit one to a few chapters librarians responses a library officer with the national library board ogun state chapter mr lukman adelaja said the emergence of e books had negatively affected students usage of public libraries adelaja said there has been a drastic reduction in people coming to the library after the emergence of the internet and e books in the late 90s in our library we would have to go round the communities to search for chairs now the chairs are there but there are no students to use them students have abandoned library rooms because they believe they can get anything they want on the internet which is partially correct however on the internet most of the time there is scarcity of books by some major authors in that wise if any student goes to the library to search for materials for his or her project they would have total control of the topic because they would have access to different authors and quote the original owner or the right person that wrote the book adelaja stated that students dependence on electronic materials and the internet for their research would make them inadvertently guilty of plagiarism adding that such practice would make them end up being an unserious researcher in the nearest future when students know that they have already prepared materials on the internet they go there to copy it he noted to revive the reading culture and encourage the use of the library the national library introduced the e libraries in 2017 but the e libraries as it is today does not add many numbers to library patronage the librarian said in our office in abeokuta we have about 60 computers with the e libraries one can read books from the library of congress in america and we believe that if we do that as well it would draw people into the library as of now most people have access to smart phones so i think they believe there is no use in going to the libraries now we are trying to revive the reading culture from the grass roots that is why the national library board introduced the readership campaign in 2017 to bring the younger generation into the library halls not only during examinations but constantly another library officer with the lagos state library board youread library yaba lagos state mrs adesuwa ohiwere said despite the presence of the internet and e books some people still visit public libraries adesuwa said many users of the library were students and professionals who come to read during the examination periods she said people still use the library very well because it is not everyone that has access to the internet though it is rampant especially in the elderly compared to the younger ones the younger generation especially professionals and students also make use of the library we have an influx of users during examination periods students from universities and colleges there has been a sporadic increase in the use of libraries because it was recently renovated so the availability of the internet and the ambience of the library has made it conducive for reading meanwhile the director of the lagos state library board mr asimiyu oyadipe had earlier in the month called on students to utilise libraries in their schools as well as public libraries around them adding that about 200 public libraries had been renovated and contained a digital library section experts urge students others to use available libraries a professor of library and information science at the ahmadu bello university zaria kaduna hanna daudu said the advent of the internet and electronic books would not override the importance of the libraries and paper books the professor further advised students to maximise the use of the libraries stating that the presence of library professionals would assist them in getting good and needed materials for their coursework research or personal development daudu said they are actually supposed to maximise the use of the library and use the information to increase their knowledge they think the library can t give them what they require because they can access materials on the internet but it is an error there are some things that one can never replace in the library you can t replace the services in the library with the internet the professionals there can t be replaced with the internet we go out of our way to get information for people you can t do that on the internet students need to be educated so that they can make use of the facilities that are provided in the library it is better to use the library than stay off the library because they have the library on their phones she maintained that e books were good especially in light of financial constraint whereby people who could not afford to buy hard copies would be able to access them online the librarian added now libraries have lifted a lot of burden cost library materials are well selected the professionals go through many books to get the best option of materials to meet individuals needs they select based on the individual s needs and they improvise accurately what the individuals need but on e books one will find it difficult to select correct information that one needs daudu added that electronic books should complement paper books and that the ease of access to available information should not be a reason to stay off the library there are some libraries that are also online they have different materials that they can also upload online speaking on the influence of e books on students usage of printed books and library a professor of library and information studies at the university of ibadan kenneth nwalo said the former should be seen as supplement to the latter adding that libraries were a good source of both book versions nwalo said on the one hand the emergence of e books could make purposeful students visit the library more depending on the level of the student for example the postgraduate student would want to visit the library more because important academic e books are right there and they are not available on the open access there are some general books and texts that are in open access domain these are the ones people can access on their devices in the comfort of their homes hotels or anywhere on the other hand secondary school students can find enough materials on open access where they can get information for their assignments but many a student out of ignorance believes that the information they have got on the internet is adequate not knowing that there is something better for some reasons some organisations decided to pay for those materials that are available on open access but not always the main thing is that more important materials are on licensed databases and since an individual cannot pay that should encourage them to visit the libraries nwalo further noted that students would rather surf the internet and explore social media sites instead of reading materials available to them in various versions he said this was affecting the reading culture of students he said that students have access to e books on their phones does not mean that they are reading all the time it depends on the mindset of the student also it depends on the type of information they get some of them get their information from wikipedia encyclopaedia while there are better explanations available on licensed databases according to the don the library is in the best position to guide students on the materials they need where to get them and how to use them he explained that libraries now had facilities for e books for students to utilise at no cost he called on the school administrators to create more awareness of the availability of e libraries and the quality of resources available on such platforms and urged the government at all levels to fund university libraries adequately to sustain subscriptions to e libraries nwalo added the reality is that print books have come to stay from ancient times till now printed books are the most permanent storage of books even electronic one can be corrupted or disappear formerly people depended exclusively on printed books but now they have alternatives so textbooks have come to stay and would not be replaced by e books though sales may not be as much as before because e books certainly have an influence on them

the female led spy film wastes its all star cast on a forgettable formulaic neo feminist fantasy the 355 which premiered in theaters on january 7 is another one of those pieces of girl power propaganda that is more interested in activism than entertainment the idea behind the movie was born when the film s star jessica chastain spoke with writer and director simon kinberg about making a female led james bond and mission impossible type of spy action movie kinberg then wrote an egregiously unimaginative script that featured a derivative plot and trite dialogue and slapped female leads onto it as a twist the end result is the almost instantaneously forgettable the 355 the movie the title of which is derived from agent 355 the codename for a female spy for america during the revolutionary war tells the story of a diverse group of female super spies from across the globe who come together to stop a deadly computer weapon which can infiltrate any system and crash everything from planes to stock markets from falling into the wrong hands of course in order to check all the right boxes in this feminist fantasy and woke wet dream the lady super spies must all be of different skin colors and ethnicities jessica chastain is the white cia agent lupita nyong o the black mi6 agent diane kruger the hard edged german bnd agent penelope cruz the fish out of water colombian dni psychologist and fan bingbing the mysterious chinese mss agent it s like the united colors of benetton ads except with bad ass lady super spies not surprisingly all of the heroes in the film are women and all of the men are villains these brave women fight to save the world from not only the murderous mansplaining misogyny of turncoats and terrorists but also from the structural sexism of the all powerful patriarchy in the form of the web of corrupt global intelligence agencies what s so disheartening about the 355 is that the film s leading ladies are incredibly talented dramatic actresses with six oscar nominations among them and two wins but they are woefully ill suited for an action movie producer and star chastain has made a great deal about how in order to keep costs for the film down she did many of her own stunts unfortunately it shows chastain is among the best dramatic actresses in the business but she and her co stars are embarrassingly unathletic and their fight and action scenes are uncomfortably awkward this is not to say that women can t be action heroes they can angelina jolie and charlize theron are very good at that sort of thing for instance it is to say that being an action hero requires an athleticism and physical presence that none of the women in the 355 even remotely possess just like i wouldn t want to see jason statham do shakespeare i don t need to see gifted thespians jessica chastain penelope cruz and lupita nyong o attempting to do mindless action sequences another issue with the film is that director simon kinberg who has been a successful screenwriter for a long time in hollywood scripting mr and mrs smith sherlock holmes and x men days of future past among others is simply not a proficient filmmaker kinberg s directorial shortcomings are on full display on the 355 as the poorly shot film is saddled with amateurish fight choreography and egregious editing errors kinberg s script is also painfully pedestrian as he repeatedly uses tired tropes like accidentally spilling drinks on a bad guy as a way to distract them and pick their pocket in order to keep the plot moving his dialogue too is clunky and cliched featuring such eye rolling gems as because we re spies asshole and james bond never had to deal with real life which was followed up by the lament james bond always ends up alone the 355 which was supposed to be released last january but was delayed due to covid has a production budget of 40 million but despite being so economical by hollywood s bloated standards it faces an uphill battle to break even at the box office spider man no way home is simply an unstoppable juggernaut right now and the second rate the 355 is going to be lost deep in its box office shadow the film will also suffer because it s just another in a long line of recent girl power propaganda movies that were obviously more focused on getting their neo feminist women should behave like men message out than on making a quality film ghostbusters 2016 ocean s 8 charlie s angels 2019 terminator dark fate birds of prey and black widow all put their neo feminist message first and entertaining their audience second and they either bombed or underperformed at the box office struggling to break even the only reason many of the above mentioned movies as well as the 355 were made was because they appeased the pussyhat wearing brigade by featuring women as action heroes the problem though is that the 355 and many of its predecessors are just dreadful movies and fairly or not their failures are seen by many to be a referendum on not only the future of female led films but also on the insipid cultural politics these films espouse a wise man and it was most assuredly a man as pop culture tells me my gender compulsively mansplains things once said get woke go broke in regards to the 355 that statement definitely holds true as this shoddy vacuously neo feminist movie has earned the right to be entirely ignored rt com
vail what does that mean it meant nothing before 1960 then thanks to people many of us still remember it became a ski area and then also a town i only got here in 1990 of course it was a financial machine from the beginning but it was more than that the people at the top and their spirit seemed to matter it wasn t just the money the people at the top now don t have any connection with the spirit when the offices moved to broomfield the connection with the spirit that was here from the beginning was damaged possibly fatally was it just so that the ceo could live there because the inconvenience of the vail location would not allow the growth of the corporation that was envisioned from wall street i am not sure of all the questions and possible answers but i am sure that it is not the same place after broomfield look at the steady fall of vail in ski area ratings a recent question about staffing and blue sky is at the front of issues but does it really matter anymore i remember when blue sky was proposed and one of its justifications was supposedly early season north facing skiing or was that just my imagination never paying workers a living wage did it then and does it still matter that many people will still work for the ski area for almost nothing i have questions and few answers but i still love living here but the spirit from the top of vail resorts does not seem to exist anymore am i just fantasizing that it ever existed i am not the person who could lead this community and or the company that owns what we call vail mountain where do we go from here now where does employee housing fit in carbon and the environmental issues it s all more complicated than in the early 1960s support local journalism donate i am not questioning the current staff and leader of vail mountain and her dedication and feelings about this place in broomfield it s only about the payments to the shareholders stock value and the directors and key employees realistically what can we even expect up here i have to go shovel snow off the deck now it s a beautiful day in colorado bob essin vail
by mica rosenberg jonathan landay and james mackenzie kabul afghanistan reuters an infant boy handed in desperation to a soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the american evacuation of afghanistan has been found and was reunited with his relatives in kabul on saturday the baby sohail ahmadi was just two months old when he went missing on aug 19 as thousands of people rushed to leave afghanistan as it fell to the taliban following an exclusive reuters story published in november with his pictures the baby was located in kabul where a 29 year old taxi driver named hamid safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own after more than seven weeks of negotiations and pleas and ultimately a brief detention by taliban police safi finally handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives still in kabul they said they would now seek to have him reunited with his parents and siblings who were evacuated months ago to the united states during the tumultuous afghan evacuation over the summer mirza ali ahmadi the boy s father who had worked as a security guard at the u s embassy and his wife suraya feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the united states ahmadi told reuters in early november in his desperation that day he handed sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier who he believed to be an american fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining 5 meters 15 feet to the entrance to reclaim him just at that moment taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before ahmadi his wife and their four other children were able to get inside but by then the baby was nowhere to be found ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later the rest of the family was evacuated eventually ending up at a military base in texas for months they had no idea where their son was the case highlights the plight of many parents separated from their children during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of u s forces from the country after a 20 year war with no u s embassy in afghanistan and international organizations overstretched afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing or possibility of complex reunifications like this one we are working to reunify the family a state department official said the timing is still unknown however said a second u s official with knowledge of the situation because regular evacuation flights are not currently leaving the country the u s government is in discussions with the qataris as well as parties in afghanistan about the case the second official said alone at the airport on the same day ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby safi had slipped through the kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brother s family who were also set to evacuate safi said he found sohail alone and crying on the ground after he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby s parents inside he took the infant home to his wife and children safi has three daughters of his own and said his mother s greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son in that moment he decided i am keeping this baby if his family is found i will give him to them if not i will raise him myself he told reuters in an interview in late november safi told reuters that he took him to the doctor for a check up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family they called the baby mohammad abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his facebook nasdaq page after the reuters story about the missing child came out some of safi s neighbors who had noticed his return from the airport months earlier with a baby recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article ahmadi asked his relatives still in afghanistan including his father in law mohammad qasem razawi 67 who lives in the northeastern province of badakhshan to seek out safi and ask him to return sohail to the family razawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gifts including a slaughtered sheep several pounds of walnuts and clothing for safi and his family but safi refused to release sohail insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from afghanistan with his family safi s brother who was evacuated to california said safi and his family have no pending applications for u s entry the baby s family sought help from the red cross which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises but said they received little information from the organization a spokesperson for the red cross said it does not comment on individual cases finally after feeling they had run out of options razawi contacted the local taliban police to report a kidnapping safi told reuters he denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby not kidnapping him the complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander told reuters he helped arrange a settlement which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides razawi said the baby s family in the end agreed to compensate safi around 100 000 afghani 950 for expenses incurred looking after him for five months the grandfather of the baby complained to us and we found hamid and based on the evidence we had we recognized the baby said hamid malang the chief area controller of the local police station with both sides in agreement the baby will be handed over to his grandfather he said on saturday in the presence of the police and amid lots of tears the baby was finally returned to his relatives razawi said safi and his family were devastated to lose sohail hamid and his wife were crying i cried too but assured them that you both are young allah will give you male child not one but several i thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport razawi said we need to get the baby back to his mother and father this is my only responsibility he said the baby s parents told reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat there are celebrations dance singing said razawi it is just like a wedding indeed now ahmadi and his wife and other children who in early december were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in michigan are still finding their footing and focused on their son s return i was so sad and always crying for my baby said his mother suraya now i hope he arrives here

if you want to know exactly how the markets performed in 2021 and about what the experts believe will happen this calendar year you re in luck brokerage and retirement account statements will soon be on their way and wall street s forecasts for 2022 are rolling in along with earnest advice about how to manage your finances over the next 12 months this is the time for new year s resolutions after all make some now about investing and you ll be in good shape for the rest of the year or so you might think the seasonal deluge of financial information fosters the illusion that the markets are governed by the annual calendar and that wall street experts have a good sense of where things are going as i ve pointed out recently none of that is true
on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

international by bola a akinterinwa professor bolaji akinwande akinyemi a commander of the federal republic attained eighty years of age on tuesday 4th january 2022 he was born to mr and mrs aje akinyemi on 4th january 1942 at the wesley gate hospital ilesha osun state he was exposed quite early to international life and affairs for two main reasons first he was born to an educationist father who was a principal of the ilesha grammar school the father was an awoist who had a great commitment to education as an instrument of national and international development a second factor which is derived from the first reason is the development of a newspaper reading habit which enabled him to come across an advertisement placed by the embassy of the united states in 1961 the advert asked for essay entries and then mr bolaji akinwande akinyemi of the notable christ school ado ekiti applied and was among the successful applicants who were each given a prize of 3 month visit to the united states with all the expenses borne by the us government professor akinyemi visited the us from january to april 1962 and had the opportunity of not only meeting with other international students but also the opportunity of speaking directly with the us president john f kennedy the international students met with president kennedy who gave his address and bade the students goodbye but professor akinyemi consciously or otherwise said mr president and president kennedy not only heard him but also waited to hear him as quoted by crispin yomi ogunseye former deputy director of administration at the nigerian institute of international affairs niia lagos professor akinyemi said i made a fool of myself and i said mr president coming from a culture where you don t even talk to your parents unless they talk to you so with the most powerful man in the world i did not expect him to acknowledge but surprisingly he stopped and turned to hear what i had to say but i simply said nothing sir so he just smiled waved and left this was one of the foundations of the international life to which professor akinyemi was introduced at the age of about 20 and which apparently prompted him to seek his university education at the temple university in 1963 1964 and at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy tufts university medford massachusetts in 1964 1966 he later moved to the united kingdom for further educational experience but what remains critical to his university education is the strong secondary school foundation he had at the igbobi college yaba from 1955 to 1959 and at the christ school ado ekiti in 1960 1962 this explains in part why he is a foreign policy critical thinker bolaji akinyemi and foreign policy general senator sanda ike nwachukwu former minister of foreign affairs gave an overview of what professor akinyemi stands for in his foreword to an edited book by bola a akinterinwa and entitled nigeria and the world a bolaji akinyemi revisited lagos niia 2012 388 pp he said that the book was a collection of very vibrant well informed and insightful academic articles that seek to vindicate the poetic and metaphorical perception of professor a bolaji akinyemi as a truth spoken before its time more important general nwachukwu said the book confirmed the enduring nature of some of akinyemi s policies some of which now seem very prophetic it is in this vindication of the fact that professor akinyemi acted wholly in the national interest even when considered iconoclastic by some critics that the book has effectively established the former foreign minister as the truth spoken before its time a very robust example in this regard is the technical aid corps tac that professor akinyemi established under a volley of visceral criticisms but which has now become one of the flagships of nigeria s foreign policy explained differently professor akinyemi thinks and foresees in the national interest he lives in the future and thinks extraordinarily about making perceived impossibilities possible general nwachukwu cannot be more correct and this can be illustrated by professor akinyemi s active engagements in the conduct and management of international affairs at three complementary levels in his capacity as director general of the niia from 1975 to 1983 as minister of external affairs from 1985 to 1987 and at the level of his thru myeyes with prof bolaji akinwande since about two years now at the level of the niia he differentiated between the quest for love and respect for nigeria in his eyes what is needed is not love for nigeria but respect for nigeria he made this distinction in his farewell to policy niia lecture series no 35 p 16 and noted although god knows that given our behaviour at home and abroad it will take a miracle for anyone to love nigerians africans are not going to love us what we should aim for is respect not love every government in this country has been trying except that interlude between 1975 and 1979 to earn love from africans rather than respect the love we won t get the respect we can earn to struggle for respect for nigeria is quite interesting from the perspective of his being the son of a christian father and he too being a staunch christian christianism preaches love first if this is so to what extent is love applicable in political governance and during warfare should respect come first or vice versa god to wives to respect their husbands while husbands are required to love their wives in this case respect and love are to go pari passu but without any whiff of doubt the quest for survival at any time cannot but subject love to respect in international relations meaning that professor akinyemi is right his many foreign policy initiatives lend credence to this observation he introduced the use of dialogue as basis of foreign policy enquiry and formulation in four complementary ways first as a technical dialogue which should not be ordinarily seen as an exchange of messages or interpersonal talks professor ogaba oche relying on the explications of the russian philosopher mikhail bakhtin s and martin buber s theories of dialogue has it that technical dialogue is genuine and has the goal of achieving an objective understanding it is not simply a dialogue in which there is an exchange of words or messages to communicate something or to learn something as professor oche put it dialogue in its technical sense is unique because it evolves through a process and particular quality of communication whereby parties achieve a connection this connection between participants allows for each party to potentially change the other or be changed by the other put differently as a technique for policy formulation dialogue relies on the connection forged between participants and the information exchanged the three others are ambassadors forum academic institutional dialogue series and publication of dialogue series all of which are manifestations of the technicality of the dialogue the ambassadors forum is basically a conversation between an invited extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador accredited to nigeria on the one hand and niia s research fellows and invited scholars from universities and invited retired nigerian ambassadors the conversations are generally not covered by the media to allow for frank talks the dialogue allows the invited ambassador to project his country well and the niia fellows and other scholars were free to ask questions about the foreign policy attitudinal disposition of his country especially in terms of how nigeria s foreign policy interest might be affected regarding academic institutional dialogues they involve discussions on commonly identified international questions and generally took place within the framework of signed cooperation agreements the niia had collaboration with the chatham house in the united kingdom council on foreign relations in the united states for examples bilateral and multilateral issues are addressed during such research seminars and exchange of ideas the outcomes of such conversations were published under the niia dialogue series at times some of the critical questions are alco considered for publication in the nigerian forum which was also introduced by professor akinyemi and patterned after that of the chatham house in his capacity as minister of foreign affairs that is before his attainment of 80 years of age he came up with the consultation doctrine at the foreign policy conference in 1986 the concert of media power and the technical aid corps in 1987 he dreamt of greatness for nigeria for which he is not liked at home and abroad and this is one major reason it has been very difficult for nigeria to develop this is also why politico economic governance of nigeria has been largely predicated on untruths and dishonesty of purpose political governance hates patriotism dint of hard work and critical thinking for which professor akinyemi is noted for consequently greatness has not been an issue in nigeria s development calculations but true enough professor akinyemi not only wants to greaten nigeria in various ramifications but also wants the greatness fast tracked through consultation doctrine to guide nigeria s foreign policy any nigerian support for any african country must be a resultant from prior consultations with the government of nigeria the same is true for his consideration in 1987 of the black bomb that is for nigeria to become a nuclear power the logic that also informed the suggestion of a concert of medium powers which name was later changed to the lagos forum because of the international controversies it generated is not different the big powers saw the concert of medium powers as a threat to them and therefore did what was possible to get professor akinyemi removed as foreign minister for details see bola a akinterinwa the lagos forum and the medium powers debate international problems society and politics the israeli institute for the study of international affairs iisia university of tel aviv israel xxviii 52 1 2 spring 1989 pp 57 68 because professor akinyemi also suggested that access to some strategic institutions and particularly to the diplomatic service and intelligence agencies should be limited to the first class brains as it is the case in the great power countries the foreign service officers unnecessarily became his enemy even before professor akinyemi advocated the policy the foreign ministry used to accommodate only the very bright people why there should be hostility to the factor of special merit is very thought provoking today the foreign ministry is a dumping ground for wounded graduates cross posted civil servants with experiences that only bastardized the art of diplomacy and undermined the national interest professor akinyemi s establishment of the technical aid corps in 1987 has remained a major source of foreign policy inspiration and instrument of making nigeria great as regards his thru myeyes with prof bolaji akinwande programme it is a cutting edge commentary on international events initially held virtually every thursday at 7 p m but later changed to 8 pm nigerian time for reasons of technical force majeure the audience is limited to invited top foreign policy experts the discussion focuses on major international developments in the previous one week and lasts for one hour what is noteworthy is that the programme is not a direct but indirect dialogue between professor akinyemi and the participants the programme underscores public enlightenment and the perspectives of professor akinyemi the participants can chat and when questions of public interest are raised the moderator akin akinyemi requests an explanation from professor akinyemi foreign policy without grandeur professor bolaji akinyemi is a priori a hard foreign policy thinker who believes in the attainment of greatness for nigeria regardless of whether there are the domestic material resources in his thinking the most important requirement for development and greatness is human resource he strongly believes that foreign policy can be a good instrument of acquiring such greatness he thinks of greatness in the mania of charles de gaulle s grandeur de la france most unfortunately however nigerian leaders and particularly the foreign policy makers hardly think of nigerian greatness in their strategic calculations emphasis is limited to self preservation in terms of protection of political and territorial sovereignty and safety looking at nigeria providing leadership for africa or the world is considered an exaggeration whereas professor akinyemi strongly believes in the contrary therefore he is always not in the good books of the powerful countries of the world now that he is 80 years old and the energy to do and undo cannot but begin to wane nigeria s foreign policy may continue to lack the pursuit of greatness for nigeria in a long time to come foreign policy agitation for greatness of the nigerian people may be no more in the foreseeable future this is the unfortunate concern raised with the attainment of professor akinyemi s 80 years of age true nigeria s foreign policy generally lacks the quest for grandeur greatness in international relations for various reasons first is the wrong belief in self contentment which is very myopic in strategic calculations in 1966 for example there were about 100 000 people in fernando po equatorial guinea more than 75 of the population were nigerians of whom the majority were of the igbo ethnic stock by that time virtually most of the nigerians were working in the plantations and were also mistreated then and thereafter it is on record that captain and ambassador festus porbeni recommended the annexation of fernando po at a point in time but the government of nigeria kicked against it professor akinjide osuntokun s works on the equatorial guinea speak volumes on this matter but one point recently and rightly made by ambassador porbeni that is quite interesting about diplomatic smartness is his observation that the military uses force to get what it wants while the diplomat uses tact to get what he wants ambassador porbeni explained his experience thus when i go to the ministry of defence i will say i am captain porbeni when i go to the ministry of external affairs i am ambassador porbeni i play the two roles and i am the first and only nigerian to be appointed an ambassador while in service normally you retire before you are appointed an ambassador vide his interview with henry akubuiro admiral festus porbeni how i convinced babangida to secure mandela s release the sun 19th june 2021 sunnewsonline com as at the time captain porbeni was appointed ambassador he was the first to be so appointed from the public service with the appointment of the first three service chiefs under president muhammadu buhari as ambassadors captain porbeni is no longer the only military officer to be so appointed however captain porbeni s good suggestion reflected and still reflects the myopia in nigeria s foreign policy making the policy shortsightedness was first revealed when the apartheid south africa government attempted to establish a military base in equatorial guinea but which nigeria successfully resisted the chinese are also said to be currently seeking a military base along the equatorial guinean coast fernando po is not nigerian and the rule of sovereignty necessarily prevents any nigerian interference or intervention if porbeni had been listened to the current threats to nigeria by the chinese military base in equatorial guinea would have been completely different second several foreign ministers laid foundations for the grandeur of nigeria but never made any concrete effort to build on them it was only professor akinyemi that courageously attempted to do so most unfortunately the government and people of nigeria could not see the beauty of professor akinyemi s quest for nigeria s greatness and true enough the manifestations of the policy foundation of greatness dates to 1963 when dr jaja wachukwu then minister of external affairs not only formulated the policy of no compromise with apartheid south africa but also formulated an exception to the principle of non intervention as espoused in article 2 7 of the united nations charter this was when the togolese president mr sylvanus olympio was assassinated in the same vein dr okoi arikpo commissioner for external affairs under general yakubu gowon told the world that under no circumstance would africa be accepted to be used only as a source of raw materials for the development of europe it should be recalled here that the making of the european economic community eec following the march 1957 rome treaty largely capitalized on resources from africa recall also that nigeria applied to be an associate member of the eec in the early 1960s and that dr pius okigbo was deeply involved in the negotiations when the agreement on the associate membership was to be signed in lagos all the eec members signed except for france since the operating rule of the eec was unanimity of purpose the signing of the agreement by others became null and void as france refused to sign it nigeria was irked by the act to the extent that when discussions resumed between the african caribbean and the pacific countries on the one hand and the eec on the other in the 1970s dr okoi arikpo agreed with the idea of economic cooperation but not in the sense of africa being allowed to be exploited by europe to the detriment of africa s own development as good as this reactive foreign policy may be it does not have any objective of greatness for nigeria beyond simply laying a pillar for it no concrete action was taken to translate the threat of not allowing eec s exploitation of african raw materials for the development of europe the truth as at today is that the alleged exploitation of african resources has not stopped and currently knows no bound in fact nigeria is no longer visibly seen as the defender of black and african interests nigerians are mistreated here and there the impact of the 1977 black arts and festival held in lagos does not mean much as at today galloping institutional corruption recidivist terrorism aimed at dismantling the territorial unity of nigeria if not islamisation and fulanisation of nigeria have become the preferential order of the day and without braggadocio nigeria s foreign policy has become excessively reactive without any agenda for foreign policy grandeur this concern should be the point for discussion for professor akinyemi at 80 these issues would not have arisen if there has been an agenda for national greatness and the various foreign policy adopted so far would have been more meaningful and true enough professor ibrahim gambari s foreign policy concentricism ambassador oluyemi adeniji s constructive and beneficial concentricism and chief ojo maduekwe s citizen diplomacy are undoubtedly good foundational manifestations for nigeria s greatness however the policies are only operational in design focus they are not consciously articulated to achieve foreign policy greatness or military leadership and respectable national identity for nigeria as wanted by professor akinyemi who wants nigeria to have a black bomb and become a nuclear power he wants nigeria to play an active part in the conduct and management of global affairs by particularly advocating the employment of the brightest brains into strategic national institutions he introduced the technical aid corps to reflect that nigeria is truly a giant and a great power in the making he insisted on prior consultation with nigeria when muammar gaddafi of libya aggressed the united states and expected nigeria s support this was an expression of quest for greatness why should gaddafi propose to be the president of the united states of africa and nigeria should provide the defence minister on a serious note nigeria should be great in international relations the idea of the concert of medium powers should be revisited and reconceptualized so should the consultation doctrine we agree with professor akinyemi that nigeria should first be respected before being loved internationally respect without love is better than loving without respect happy 80th birthday anniversary professor

hamish mcrae the tidal wave of free money that the central banks have created is coming to an end two things happened last week that will help shape financial markets this year both happened in america but taken together they will also set the tone for uk investors and indeed investors all over the world one was that last monday the first trading day of the year apple shares rose and briefly valued the company at more than 3trillion that is an astounding amount more than all the companies traded on the frankfurt stock exchange but then the price came back so that by friday s close it was back to 2 8trillion that was part of the wider reassessment of the value to be put on high tech companies on both sides of the atlantic the other came on thursday when the minutes of the december meeting of the federal open markets committee were published this committee sets the fed s monetary policy and what shocked the markets was the tone of the minutes which suggested that the fed might raise interest rates faster and sooner than they had expected suddenly the markets knew that the fed was serious about combating inflation the end of ultra easy money was in sight the yield on ten year us treasury bonds had risen on friday to 1 76 per cent the highest since the pandemic struck in february 2020 this has pulled up uk long rates too our ten year gilts were yielding 1 15 per cent at friday s close which on a long historical view is very low indeed but is nevertheless just about the highest since may 2019 calling a turn in any market is a scary business but let s say that it is at least a real possibility that we will not see ten year gilts yielding less than 1 per cent this decade conceivably much longer we could be in the early stages of a 30 year bear market in fixed interest securities worldwide should one also call the top of the high tech boom that is more complicated start with apple it s a hugely profitable company sitting on a pile of cash its price earnings ratio is currently just over 30 that is high by the standards of a few years ago for between the beginning of 2017 and the end of 2019 it traded mostly at a p e of between 12 and 25 but it is lower than it was at the end of 2020 when it was over 40 there are some us high tech companies where the current valuations seem more the result of hopes and hype i would put tesla in that bracket despite the technical and marketing genius of elon musk and despite the transformation it has brought to the global motor industry but microsoft or amazon they must have a lot of profitable growth ahead what may happen will be a sorting out of the high tech sector with investors working out which firms can justify their heady valuations and which are really mostly hype every bull market comes to an end eventually but we have to keep our fingers crossed that the end to this one happens in a benign way apple shares rose and briefly valued the company at more than 3trillion last monday the froth has to be blown away and that will apparently destroy wealth but actually that wealth was never really there should we worry about bitcoin investors who bought at the peak my answer would be no but it does no one any good to have investors in solid enterprises lose their shirts it may even be that the entire edifice of things that exist only in the form of lines of computer code non fungible tokens nfts as well as cryptocurrencies will collapse we cannot know but what we do know is that a cool wind has blown across the world s financial markets in the past few days and that wind has been driven by an awareness that the tidal wave of free money that the central banks have created will be coming to an end when that happens people have to figure out what is really valuable and what is not i take comfort from the probability that the world is still in the early stages of a cyclical expansion historically the increases in interest rates associated with these upswings have generally been good for equities that is partly because the economic growth will deliver solid profits but also because solid businesses do give some sort of protection from inflation the footsie despite the bumps of the week is up 1 4 per cent on its close on december 31 of 7 385 at least there is some value there if scepticism of the high tech valuations persists and interest rates do indeed rise faster than expected then solid value will be what investors will want
sound investor joyce sims has a stocks and shares portfolio the most expensive gift that american singer joyce sims has ever received was a priceless diamond ring sims who shot to fame in the late 1980s with hit come into my life a top ten single in the uk says she would work to eliminate homelessness hunger and poverty if she were chancellor of the exchequer her new album change will be released early this year she speaks to donna ferguson what did your parents teach you about money to respect and earn it i grew up in rochester new york state i was the eldest of five my mother was head chef at a family owned restaurant and my father was a machinist for kodak money was tight as a child i remember hearing my parents often discussing the bills that needed to be paid and in what order everything was budgeted and they worked hard for the money they earned but we had everything we needed and some of the things we wanted we were a close knit family have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes the worst time was in the mid 1980s when i first left home and went to new york to pursue my recording career and try to get a record deal i was 23 i moved in with a friend in manhattan and in order to pay the rent got a job in an office filing paperwork in the evening i worked in a recording studio singing vocals on tracks in return for free studio time to record my own music my rent was so expensive that all i could afford for lunch every day was a slice of pizza and soda at one point i had to ask my parents for money to help me make it to the next pay cheque the worst thing was that i took my car to new york parking is crazy in that city you have to move your car from one side of the street to the other depending on the day and the time i racked up so many parking tickets more than 700 in fines since the car was in my parents name all the fines were going home to my parents they called one day and asked me what on earth i was doing they then told me bring our car back home have you ever been paid silly money in the late 1980s nightclubs would sometimes pay me thousands of dollars to sing all in all my biggest hit in america it would take me six minutes and 31 seconds and i could earn up to 3 000 equivalent to 4 700 today what was the best financial year of your life it was 1987 when the album come into my life came out it was a great year financially and in every other area of my life i was excited to release my first album just to hold that album in my hand meant so much a lot of the dreams and aspirations i had came true when the album was released i d say i made more than 100 000 that year from touring and close to 100 000 from album sales what is your biggest money mistake not buying a property as soon as i could afford to in 1987 instead i rented in different places for three years before i eventually got on the property ladder in my 30s at the beginning of my career i was so busy touring and recording in the studio i didn t save a lot i helped family and friends and also wasted a lot of money just living the best money decision you have made spending 20 000 turning one of my bedrooms into a home studio in the early 1990s that decision has saved me many thousands of dollars over the years joyce sims regrets not buying a home as soon as she could afford to as she rented instead the most expensive gift you ve ever received it was a pear shaped diamond ring with several carats in yellow gold my husband gave it to me at christmas it is beautiful and holds a special place in my heart i don t know how much it cost but to me it s priceless and i love it i was speechless when i received it which doesn t happen often do you save into a pension or buy shares yes i started saving into a pension when i was in my mid 30s because my accountant advised me to i wasn t really thinking about my retirement back then but i m glad i listened to him i have many thousands of dollars invested in the stock market and have been investing for about 20 years i have a diverse portfolio but i lean more towards shares than bonds i take a medium risk long term approach and let someone else manage my portfolio to date i m happy with the performance of my investments do you own any property yes my husband and i own our home it s a three bedroom townhouse in new jersey we bought it ten years ago i d rather not say how much i paid for it but i definitely think it has increased in value since we got it the one little luxury you treat yourself to going to a hotel by the new jersey shoreline and spending a couple of days at the beach i love just sitting relaxing and listening to the waves i find it inspiring it s good for my soul i ve actually recorded the sound of the ocean to use in my songs a trip like that typically costs me around 500 if you were chancellor what would you do i would eliminate hunger and homelessness i would increase funding for organisations that support the poorest families in the uk i would try to put an end to poverty and make sure that everyone had enough to live on in my opinion no one in the uk or the united states should be hungry or homeless if everyone were able to have a home and not worry about food i believe they would live a more productive life and the world would be a better place do you donate money to charity yes i give to charities that feed children and look after the poor i also give to my church what is your number one financial priority to leave a legacy for my two children with the hope they will do the same for their children i want to die knowing my children are taken care of financially

the bankers investment trust a steady eddie with 55 years of rising dividends that investors can bank on a week tomorrow the board of global investment trust bankers will confirm the final quarterly dividend that shareholders will receive for financial year 2021 although the payment in monetary terms will be small probably 0 55 pence per share it will mark another year of dividend growth of around one per cent for the 1 6 billion trust with 55 years of annual dividend increases then behind it bankers will be on a par with city of london as the investment trust with the longest record of dividend growth it s a modest dividend increase says alex crooke who has been overseeing the trust for the past 19 years but in being cautious now it means we can be more generous with our dividends next year we ve been living through lots of uncertainty both city of london and bankers are trusts that are run by investment managers at janus henderson what separates them apart from having different managers at their helm job curtis runs city of london is that city of london is focused on the uk stock market while bankers spreads its wings further afield over the past decade bankers has been steadily reducing its holdings in the uk from 50 per cent to below 20 per cent of the portfolio with the biggest remaining uk stocks being relx diageo lloyds and astrazeneca the result is that its largest asset allocation is now in north america 35 per cent while the trust s top 10 holdings are all listed in the united states it also has key geographic positions in europe japan and the rest of the pacific region although crooke is the trust s manager he doesn t pick the individual stocks of which there are 165 his role is to determine the allocation of assets under the trust s bonnet he then gets janus henderson s regional equity teams to run the money allotted to them he also decides how much money the trust should borrow if he wants to increase its exposure to stock markets new borrowings were taken out last year at an attractive interest of two per cent the overall results are satisfactory if not spectacular over the past year total returns are around 10 per cent any year when you are generating a return of 10 per cent or more is a good one says crooke over the past three and five years returns are 64 per cent and 93 per cent respectively crooke is optimistic about the year ahead although he says he would be surprised if investor returns exceed 10 per cent between five and 10 per cent is what i am expecting better than investing in fixed interest the best market value he says is to be found in asia and japan underperforming markets in 2021 the trust s shares currently priced at just above 1 20 stand at a small discount to the value of the underlying assets total annual charges are low at 0 5 per cent and the trust s stock market ticker and identification code are respectively bnkr and bn4ndr3 the annual income it generates for shareholders is equivalent to around 1 7 per cent modest but growing bankers is diverse has holdings across the world and is more cautious than some of its peers says crooke this is demonstrated by the fact that over the past five years some rival global trusts such as scottish mortgage and monks both managed by baillie gifford have delivered far superior returns compared to these bankers is a steady eddie a suitable investment for first time investors and for those happy to hold long term and enjoy the rising stream of dividend payments
invest in a retail bargain high streets are struggling but stores like next and waterstones can reap returns or try property trusts that own sites with the country s high streets facing another crisis as people work from home rather than travelling into town and city centres it is hard to predict which stores and specific retail sectors if any will do well this year yet we are not about to stop shopping altogether and so selected retailers may represent more of a bargain from an investment perspective than anything you might find in the january sales jason hollands managing director of investment platform bestinvest says there are some strong reasons to put retail stocks in your investment shopping basket despite the latest high street crisis he says the road ahead may well be bumpy but some retailers which are coming under pressure from staff shortages inflation and lower footfall will emerge from this difficult period in better shape as they trim costs such as underperforming stores barclaycard s data on how we shopped last year confirms the popularity of online retailing but it also shows some green shoots on the high street overall consumer spending rose almost six per cent last year compared with 2019 with growth in spending on the home pets and in local stores notable calum bruce investment manager of trust ediston property believes that despite widespread talk about the death of the high street physical shops will always be needed he says while the pandemic has undoubtedly increased the penetration of e commerce busy car parks and queues around out of town shopping centres show the resilience of bricks and mortar stores not everyone is as bullish darius mcdermott managing director of fund supermarket chelsea financial services believes the high street is in structural decline he says high street retailers can t compete matters will only get worse as the cost of online retail deliveries continues to fall and people are put off shopping as their local high streets are scarred by empty shops companies that can deliver an omnichannel experience allowing people to shop online or in store and to click and collect purchases will fare well in the new shopping normal they include stores such as next and waterstones william meadon manager of investment trust jpmorgan claverhouse is a big fan of next he says the fashion house maintains its reputation as one of the country s best run firms it has outperformed expectations throughout the pandemic and its management team is without peer last week it issued a bullish trading statement with profits for the year to the end of this month forecast to come in at 822million some 10 per cent up on profits before the pandemic it also announced a special dividend of 1 60 and forecast sales growth for the year ahead of seven per cent as inflation continues to rise companies running stores that offer customers good value should do well although high profile price discounters such as aldi

menafn gulf times when democratic senator joe manchin announced that he would not support us president joe biden s build back better act effectively dooming the president s signature legislative initiative he cited america s staggering debt his concerns echoed those of biden s republican opponents who insist that all that spending would expand the deficit and leave future generations groaning under the weight of a heavy tax burden but would it proponents of modern monetary theory would beg to differ the build back better act s detractors subscribe to the conventional ricardian assumption that over time a government must balance its budget just like a private firm but mmt holds that as long as debt is denominated in a country s own currency its government cannot default excessive government spending can fuel inflation but as long as prices are stable governments can spend away using fiscal deficits rather than tax revenues to support employment and finance public goods while mmt is not new it has been gaining traction in recent years and a significant share of its following nowadays comes across almost as zealots unwilling to brook any dissent meanwhile mainstream economists largely regard mmt as tantamount to professional heresy with some avoiding so much as uttering its name needless to say the rigid stances of mmt s devotees and detractors have not lent themselves to productive discussion this is a serious loss for policymakers because mmt includes both problematic propositions and perfectly reasonable even highly useful positions in the latter category the idea that stands out is essentially functional finance theory proposed by abba lerner in 1943 fft holds that because governments borrowing in their own currency can always print money to service their debts but still face inflation risks they should aim to balance supply and demand at full employment rather than fret about balancing the budget in lerner s view well targeted deficit spending is an effective way for governments to maintain prosperity fft supports the case for build back better which includes spending on goods like education infrastructure and the green transition the biden administration claims that the act would be financed entirely with tax revenues but even if that turned out not to be the case as his detractors predict wouldn t inadequate infrastructure depleted human capital and a planet ravaged by climate change hurt future generations more to be sure us policymakers broadly recognise the importance of such investments especially in infrastructure the us congress recently passed with bipartisan support a 1tn spending plan that aims to advance objectives like overhauling the electricity grid upgrading railways and expanding access to high speed internet but even some democrats demanded that the new funds contained in the package be entirely offset by new tax revenue a development that highlights enduring resistance to the logic of mmt or fft and yet as the wall street journal s james mackintosh recently argued this may be largely a rhetorical issue after all he notes the infrastructure act is in fact debt financed anyway and it may well be that many of build back better s supporters are not convinced by biden s claims that tax revenues will offset the new spending but are not that concerned about it but mmt and fft are not synonymous mmt includes two additional propositions that in my view are unsound the first is that monetary policy should be conducted in such a way that it facilitates fiscal policy decisions such as by maintaining a constant very low interest rate this expresses a crucial feature of post keynesian economics interest rates rather than money supply are the key variables this defies conventional economic thinking which focuses on the interaction of stock and flow variables and the role of expectations more important if interest rates are held constant and prices start to rise inflation could snowball mmt proponents would advocate tax hikes as a way to manage aggregate demand and control inflation but given what we know about asset dynamics this would be a hard sell mmt s second problematic proposition that governments should provide a job guarantee in order to maintain full employment while mitigating inflationary pressures is even harder to defend it simply moves too far in the direction of socialist labour allocation and enables governments to wield excessive control over workers wages when i explained mmt to former japanese prime minister shinzo abe he compared it to preparing fugu if done correctly the puffer fish is a sublime delicacy but if the chef makes even a minor mistake the diner could suffer a rapid and painful death it is an apt metaphor if policymakers adopt the positive elements of mmt essentially fft they will gain new options for bolstering prosperity for current and future generations but one wrong cut and the results could be fatal project syndicate koichi hamada professor emeritus at yale university was a special adviser to former japanese prime minister shinzo abe
on friday the centers for disease control and prevention held a telebriefing director rochelle walensky presided along with two career scientists the substance was notable updated covid 19 guidance for k 12 schools but even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all it was the first such briefing in months despite the ongoing pandemic crisis that lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency in recent days public health experts have called out cdc for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance and asked the agency to communicate more often and more clearly an unmet promise in fact the biden administration has repeatedly promised to put career scientists front and center in its covid communications but such experts have generally not appeared outside of white house covid 19 response team briefings usually held several times each week but typically only featuring political appointees walensky among them that s not the same as a briefing by subject matter experts sharing what they know with the press and the public the fact is there are dedicated scientists at cdc who are the world s experts in a lot of these issues and they need to be speaking directly to the public along with dr walensky says dr tom frieden cdc director during the obama administration who now runs resolve to save lives an initiative to help governments and outside groups prevent epidemics cdc is responding to these charges of inadequate communication the agency decided to hold friday s briefing walensky told reporters on the call because we had heard clearly over the last week that there was interest in hearing from us independently this is hard and i am committed to continue to improve she said i anticipate that this will be the first of many briefings and i very much look forward to them frieden is on board i hope this will be an inflection point in rebuilding confidence in cdc he says the more cdc can speak directly to the public following its own principles of communication in a health emergency the better off we ll all be for cdc covid 19 briefings have been unusually sparse the idea of speaking out during a public health crisis is hardly new cdc literally wrote the book on how to communicate in a health emergency says frieden it has clear principles to uphold he says be first be right be credible be empathetic and give people practical proven things to do to protect themselves their families and their communities glen nowak who used to run media relations for the agency says press briefings are an important part of its mission typically if there is some health development where it makes sense to notify the american public and give them recommendations and guidance as to what they should do about it then press briefings are really helpful he says when the h1n1 outbreak began in 2009 we did a press conference every single day for eight weeks including weekends nowak says we did press conferences as long as we had something that was new something that was different there was a need to do it the idea wasn t just to inform the public at media briefings says frieden oftentimes smart journalists ask tough questions and we d realize oh we didn t say that as clearly as we intended or we didn t think of that we d better address that issue when sars cov 2 was identified in china cdc seemed to follow that playbook in mid january 2020 dr nancy messonnier then director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases led the first cdc telebriefing on the subject she was joined by another career scientist dr marty cetron director of cdc s division of global migration and quarantine since the outbreaks of mers and sars we have made improvements in our capacity in the united states and around the world messonnier told reporters we re now better poised to respond to this new threat quickly and collaboratively these briefings continued every few days until one of them jolted america to attention on feb 25 2020 messonnier warned this could be bad i had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and i told my children that while i didn t think that they were at risk right now we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives she said after her comments financial markets crashed president donald trump whose message was that the pandemic was of little concern and under control was so angry at messonnier that he reportedly wanted her fired the next day he put vice president mike pence in charge of the white house coronavirus task force televised covid 19 briefings became a white house affair the cdc director was not usually present the cdc telebriefings did continue for a while although only occasionally under biden cdc still seems sidelined president biden came into office promising to beat the pandemic by restoring public trust scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you that s why you re going to be hearing a lot more from dr fauci again not from the president but from the real genuine experts and scientists biden pledged the day after his inauguration certainly americans have heard a lot from dr anthony fauci of nih the president s chief medical adviser and cdc s walensky both are frequent guests on tv news shows and in white house covid 19 response briefings which are usually held several times a week but under biden cdc and its career scientists seem to still be sidelined cdc has actually done fewer telebriefings on the pandemic under biden in 2020 under trump there were around two dozen cdc telebriefings in 2021 under biden there were two dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at nyu who considers dr walensky a mentor says she has been hoping to hear more from cdc s career scientists in the new administration i would love to hear more from them just about what is the science that they re doing how do they go about it what is their process she says i think there is something to be said for also just putting a human face on some of this she adds which the public does not get when guidance changes happen via the cdc website she calls walensky s promise to bring back regular briefings good news politics and a pandemic aren t necessarily good bedfellows the administration seems to be treating the pandemic as a political problem that has to be managed in a political way says gregg gonsalves an epidemiologist at yale there needs to be a lot more openness and transparency from the white house and they need to let their scientists off the leash he says one overriding issue may be a clash between politics and public health political messages need to be simple but that doesn t work for infectious disease messaging says nowak the situation is much more dynamic viruses change a lot and can change in ways that render your recommendations not so effective he says with infectious disease communications you really have to acknowledge uncertainty yet over the 14 years he worked at cdc across democratic and republican administrations he says the trend seemed to be for the white house to exert more and more strict control over messaging you have to be willing to trust that the scientists and the experts who are doing those briefings are going to do what needs to be done he says and this administration is not unique not by any stretch of imagination in terms of their willingness to trust career scientists which is to say they don t seem to trust them very much he adds walensky s pledge to hold more briefings is a helpful development he says the question is going to be the frequency that they commit to holding regular press briefings what the topics are what the messages are cdc didn t respond to npr s question about how often the agency plans to hold agency led briefings frieden hopes that cdc will live up to its promise and speak directly to the public more often it s better for everyone he says it s better for cdc because they can explain themselves it s better for the administration because you re better off if you have a cdc that people trust and it s better for the public because you can understand the guidance copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
the tobacco giant was on fire for the entire month and is continuing into 2022 what happened after losing nearly one fifth of its value between march and the end of november last year altria mo 0 92 began marching higher beginning dec 1 and hasn t looked back since according to data from s p global market intelligence the tobacco giant enjoyed a one month gain of 11 1 in december and is up another 5 so far in 2022 there was no specific company news to account for the run up in altria s shares but the tobacco company was trading at a relative discount and it had reported a better than expected third quarter earnings result the end of the year could be an opportune time to buy ahead of what may be a rocky year for the stock market and as a hedge against inflation dividend paying stocks like altria are seen as a safe haven during difficult times because they provide income when capital appreciation may be in doubt and a dividend aristocrat like altria provides a degree of consistency that also offers tax advantages so what traditional cigarettes remain in a secular decline as they have for decades smokers are either quitting or increasingly switching over to electronic cigarettes altria had been looking to go nationwide with philip morris international s pm 0 65 iqos heated tobacco electronic cigarette but british american tobacco bti 1 65 won a ruling from the international trade commission that bans the importation of the iqos into the united states as e cigs are seen as the future of the tobacco industry and altria had given up its own ambitions of launching a branded e cig in favor of marketing the iqos under its leading marlboro brand the import ban leaves the tobacco company without an e cig device on the market investors though can derive some comfort from the fact that e cig usage while growing is nowhere near ready to displace traditional combustible cigarettes in the marketplace while philip morris had shipped 23 4 billion heated tobacco units worldwide in the third quarter only 221 million went to the americas altria on the other hand had shipped more than 23 1 billion cigarettes all across the united states now what even though smoking is in decline tobacco stocks are not what you d call a cigar stub investment one where you hope to get a few more puffs out of the company before you discard it there are still tens of millions of people who smoke and the decline is incremental albeit steady moreover altria s marlboro brand still owns over 43 of the cigarette industry s market share and as noted altria is a dividend aristocrat a company that has raised it shareholder payout for 25 years or more its dividend is not at risk of being cut let alone eliminated and with a yield of 7 2 annually it s an attract haven for income investors

interest rates surge higher consequences follow the 10 year us treasury bond yield hit a 2 year high of 1 8 on news that the national unemployment rate fell to only 3 9 in december and that year over year average hourly earnings had surged by 4 7 american futures markets are now pricing four quarter point interest rate increases within the next year on expectations that the fed is determined to fight inflation and will accelerate the taper raise interest rates and reduce the size of their balance sheet another reason for falling bond prices the fed will be buying fewer bonds while the treasury will be issuing more the s p and djia hit new highs early this the week then tumbled wednesday on hawkish fed minutes the santa rally from december 20 to january 5 boosted the djia 2 000 points to fresh all time highs front running expectations of a tidal wave of new cash coming into the market in january still the market reversed hard wednesday when the fed s december meeting minutes showed a more hawkish than expected fed the s p chart had a weekly key reversal down interest rates have been rising for the past month with the consequences initially hitting more speculative investments while the generals soldiered on aapl officially became a 3 trillion company early this week rotation was a big deal this week as capital sought safety growth things that have been trendy and hot was sold while value was bid bitcoin is down 40 from november highs but is still a 4x gain from march 2020 lows seasonally the s p falls in the 2nd half of january not a good week for gold sharply rising nominal interest rates have led to sharply rising real interest rates well actually real interest rates have just become less negative and that s not a good thing for gold for the past few years gold benefited as real rates became increasingly negative if real interest rates ever turn positive that will not be good news for gold wti crude oil has rallied 18 from post thanksgiving lows to hit 80 rising american interest rates have helped drive the us dollar to a five year high vs the yen on january 6 2020 the yen hit a 4 year high against the us dollar ex two days during the march 2020 covid panic when the mob invaded the capitol building in washington dc i have repeatedly referred to that date as an inflection point the us dollar index hit a 3 year low when there was blood in the streets and has been higher ever since last year s fall in the yen s value picked up speed after september when it appeared that us interest rates would be rising relative to japanese rates from a technical perspective the yen fell through previous support levels around 90 and from a positioning perspective speculators were adding to their substantial short positions last year the euro fell against the usd but steadied in december as european bond yields rose german 10 year bund yields rallied from negative 0 4 to nearly zero china the real estate debt crisis continues 70 of household wealth in china is in real estate investments and chinese real estate looks to be in the dog house the ccp s common prosperity policies are a significant reversal of previous policies and are slowing the economy formerly high flying tech company shares continue to trend lower china has looked like an over leveraged accident waiting to happen with luck the ccp may succeed in containing the damage on my radar currencies i m intrigued by the euro s price action over the past few weeks it has gone sideways in a very narrow range i ve actively traded currencies for over 40 years and i ve noticed that 1 trends often go further than seems to make sense 2 the trends often make an abrupt change in direction and 3 the trends often change direction around the turn of the year the current macro environment reminds me of the late 1990s when the red hot stock market in the usa the dotcom bubble was a magnet for global capital that caused the us dollar index to rally to a 15 year high when the stock market especially the nasdaq fell foreign money what remained of it went home and the dollar began a multi year decline one of the reasons the usd has been rising especially since september has been the idea that american interest rate premiums over other currencies would be increasing that european and japanese rates would not rise or if they did they would lag far behind us rates inflation has been surging higher in europe but not in japan eurozone bond yields have been rising perhaps the ecb will surprise markets and start raising interest rates i can imagine some european capital taking profits in the us equity markets and returning home putting a bid in the euro if the euro starts to rise against the usd other currencies might follow suit even the yen and gold would likely catch a bid if the usd weakens at this point this is just an idea and i will be watching price action for confirmation i m currently long the euro but only small size if it starts to rally i ll try to buy more the caveat here is that if the equity markets start to fall hard then the usd will likely get a safety bid as it did during the early days of the covid crisis stocks last week i wrote that i expected a severe break in the stock markets sometime soon perhaps starting as early as this week the djia the s p and the vti vanguard total stock market etf all made new highs early this week but tumbled wednesday to friday as interest rates soared positioning risk also contributed to this week s fall being long the american stock market is the most crowded trade in the world i don t anticipate a nasty break like the march 2020 covid panic unless we get a geopolitical shock still i could see a rotation between sectors with a trend away from speculative and towards value that alone would let some air out of the major indices my long time friend bob hoye likes to remind me that the real reason that markets could take a tumble is because speculators who ve had a great run get exhausted i agree some analysts believe that the fed s willingness to fight inflation will cave quickly if the stock market tumbles if past is prologue they might be right but i ve written many times over the years that the fed knows that their policies have amplified inequality in america and the strike on the fed put might be a lot lower than some shareholders expect so how political is the fed biden s popularity is low and political pundits tell us that the dems may lose both the house and the senate in the mid terms consider this only 50 of all americans own shares directly not counting shares that pension funds may hold on their behalf but the wealthiest 10 of the population own more than 80 of all publicly traded shares inflation especially in things like food and shelter is a hot political issue and it hits non shareholders far harder than it hits shareholders given that there are a lot of voters who don t own any shares the dems current political calculus might be kill inflation even if it means the stock market takes a hit my short term trading i began this week short wti and long euro but i was stopped for small losses on both early in the week i began shorting the stock market on monday creating small gains and losses on tuesday i shorted both the nasdaq and the s p i covered the nasdaq late tuesday for a small profit but stayed with the s p until thursday earning 100 points on friday i bought the s p looking for a bounce but was stopped for a slight loss i rebought the market later in the day still only looking for a bounce and i have stayed with that trade into the weekend i bought the euro after the employment report friday looking for it to rally out of the sideways range it has been in for the past six weeks i m long the euro and the s p at the end of the week with tight stops my realized p l for the week was a gain of 0 6 thoughts on trading there must be a million ways to participate in the markets but i believe every successful trader has found a way to participate that suits them i put successful in scare quotes because there must be a million ways to define successful but let s agree that for most people successful trading would include making more money than they lose when i was the currency analyst for conti a large chicago based commodity brokerage firm back in the 1980s i thought it was important to know why currencies traded the way they did i paid attention to price action but the why seemed more sophisticated and informed these days i still pay attention to fundamentals but i think important things happen in the markets that i don t know anything about or don t understand to quote donald rumsfield the unknown unknowns therefore while i can t seem to shake the habit of trying to know understand why a market is moving the way it is i only put my capital at risk when i can find a setup in the price action that works for me a subscriber asked me a question last week about how i trade here s my edited reply yes i m going to try to stay with winning trades longer i will stay with a trade longer if it keeps working price action supports my opinion of where the market may be going i will not stay with a trade that is not working because i think hope it will eventually start working i will continue to move stops higher in a rising market to levels that make sense for instance if the market has risen to level x i will now want to be out if it drops below level y i will not move stops based on a dollar amount of risk and i always reserve the right to sell at the market if i think the rally is over or if the market has surged higher i want to capture that windfall and or i believe i can reload at a lower price i think of stops and trailing stops as insurance protecting against capital loss rather than the optimal way to exit a trade in an attempt to try to stay with trades longer i may experiment with taking multiple positions treating some as short term trades and the others as long term the reason i want to try to stay with winning trades longer i didn t have any big wins last year which is unusual and i think an occasional big win is necessary to balance off a lot of small losses small wins i may be wrong about that perhaps i can continue to grind out a living by having a win loss ratio of 50 but with my winning trades averaging 3x the size of my losing trades that may fit my personality better but who doesn t want to have the occasional big win quotes from the notebook give trade expressions ideas themes the room to prosper by widening your risk tolerance hugh hendry rtv interview 2018 my comment i wish i could be more like that but i ve seen a lot of people go down with the ship when they had a great idea that either turned out to be dead wrong or they had their timing wrong on the trade for my short term trading i will only stay with a trade that is showing positive results i ve made a few longer term bets that have worked out very well for instance i switched about a third of my net worth from cad to usd when the cad was above par i stayed with that trade for several years and gradually unwound it as cad fell i hope to make more trades like that in the future the whole case for the stock market today is that it is cheap relative to interest rates and rates are priced in a distorted fashion alan fournier in an rtv interview with the one and only jim grant december 2017 my comment well ain t that the truth and if it was true then it s even more true now a great trader is someone whose idea time frame matches his

dimon and herman gref we consider jp morgan to be the strongest largest and most profitable bank in the world it has not always been so and the fact that it is what it is today can be attributed especially to its ceo jamie dimon dimon has spent his entire career in banking he came to jp morgan in a roundabout way in 2004 after the bank bought bank one of which he was ceo at the time since early 2006 dimon has been ceo of the entire jp morgan the quality and strength of jp morgan under his leadership became fully apparent for the first time in 2008 not only did jp morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing bear stearns in the spring of that year but it was the only major us bank that did not require government assistance throughout the great financial crisis and that was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008 today jp morgan is even bigger even more profitable and even stronger than ever before many investors view banks with disdain but a good bank with good management can be a very good long term investment from the time of its merger with bank one in 2004 through the end of 2020 jp morgan s stock has outperformed even the s p

owners of a southern illinois coal mine violated multiple state laws by dumping toxic foam deep underground in an unsuccessful attempt to extinguish a fire according to a new lawsuit that documents high levels of pollution in nearby creeks and ditches the complaint from illinois attorney general kwame raoul seeks to force st louis based foresight energy to eliminate threats to public health and the environment at its sugar camp mine in franklin county about 270 miles southwest of chicago raoul also is asking a judge to prohibit foresight from using firefighting foam made with chemicals known as pfas per and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a growing concern worldwide because they remain in the environment forever linger in the blood of exposed people for years and trigger several health problems including cancer liver damage and decreased fertility foam made with the chemicals is being phased out in illinois and 11 other states but stocks of it are still on hand at airports and industrial operations such as sugar camp sugar camp jeopardized public safety and irresponsibly violated both state environmental statutes and the constraints of its permit by misusing dangerous forever chemicals raoul said friday in a statement exposure to such chemicals can cause long lasting damage to the environment and poses a serious risk to public health raoul s lawsuit filed in franklin county circuit court comes after environmental activists announced plans to file their own complaint under provisions of the federal clean water act the use of firefighting foam containing toxic pfas chemicals at sugar camp mine is the latest reminder that illinois must move beyond coal and transition to a safer renewable energy future said jack darin director of the illinois sierra club that future starts by holding coal companies like foresight accountable for their actions and protecting communities from further harm the chicago tribune first reported in october that one of foresight s lawyers told state officials the foam used at sugar camp was biodegradable and would not harm fish or wildlife inspectors later determined the company had pumped more than 46 000 gallons of pfas laden foam into the mine raising the possibility that nearby private wells and other sources of drinking water could be contaminated company officials hired contractors to drill boreholes into the mine without a permit records show one of the boreholes is close to a creek where testing by the illinois environmental protection agency detected high levels of pfas both the fire and foresight s responses to it remained secret until a local environmental activist took pictures of foam that had drifted to aboveground ditches and farm fields near the mine entrance the activist forwarded the photos to state officials and to the tribune which sought more details under the freedom of information act portions of the mine are still smoldering federal mining regulators have blocked foresight from resuming production foresight executives did not return requests for comment because pfas remain largely unregulated federal and state officials have struggled to protect americans from the chemicals even though it became clear more than two decades ago that they pose widespread hazards to public health nearly all americans have pfas in their blood studies have found the compounds are known largely for their use in products featuring the teflon and scotchgard brands manufactured by dupont and 3m respectively dozens of related compounds are widely used in food packaging stain and water resistant clothing carpets and household products among other things foresight one of the last coal companies operating in illinois declared bankruptcy in 2020 yet the company produced more than half the 32 million tons of coal mined in the state during the same year nearly all of foresight s coal is shipped to other states and countries the company cuts costs by relying on longwall mining a process that uses robotic equipment rather than people to do most of the work since opening in 2008 sugar camp has repeatedly shown up on the u s epa s list of chronic violators of the federal clean water act five of the 16 illinois miners killed on the job since 2008 worked at the mine where the injury rate exceeded the national average at times during the past decade the mine also is a major source of heat trapping pollution scrambling the planet s climate during 2020 companies that burned foresight coal released more carbon dioxide than emissions from all 4 6 million automobiles registered in illinois according to a chicago tribune analysis

every criminal trial is unique and in general it is a mistake to read too much into a verdict still the law professor in me can t help but notice the oddly mixed message delivered by the jury in the elizabeth holmes trial the disgraced founder of theranos was acquitted on four counts of the indictment including those related to the supposed misleading of patients the jury reached no verdict on three counts and she was found guilty on four counts three involving her communications with investors and one of conspiracy the odd part is that holmes seems to have been convicted of fraud only against investors who asked few questions the jury appears to have accepted the defense s argument that investors who sought and were denied more data should have known better this result might mirror existing law but it creates incentives that are to say the least peculiar one might read the verdict as suggesting that the less curiosity an investor displays before buying the greater the protection extended by law from the start of the trial observers noted that her best chance for acquittal would be a jury that understood the language entrepreneurs must speak if they want to attract investors in this sense the very culture of silicon valley was on trial that is the culture of puffing your invention to the moon and back to be clear entrepreneurs hyping their prospects beyond what they know for sure is a practice as old as entrepreneurship certainly it s part of the culture of silicon valley years ago an investor told me that every tech pitch concludes with something like this i need your answer now because a mutual friend is setting up a meeting with peter thiel tomorrow the investor was speaking half in jest but the tendency isn t any secret a couple of decades ago the humorist p j o rourke was inspired by california s search for alternative energy sources to pen this bit of acerbity with all the puffery from silicon valley dot com start ups wind farms wouldn t be a problem courts have long understood these nuances of silicon valley culture in 2015 a federal court in california dismissed most of a civil lawsuit alleging that defendant had falsely asserted that its technology was a proven concept that the technology had been vetted by an unnamed biotech company and that publicly traded pharmaceutical companies wanted to license it the court ruled that the assertions were sufficiently vague that they were merely predictions or hopes and did not become actionable simply because they never panned out drawing the distinction can be a challenge courts in criminal fraud prosecutions like to quote the old and delightfully convoluted rule that a hope or prediction about the company s future becomes fraud when it involves expression of an opinion not honestly entertained such an inquiry is complex because it requires the jury to determine what was in the defendant s head when she made a statement to an investor that s why trial judges have traditionally been generous in permitting prosecutors to introduce circumstantial evidence of what the defendant actually believed the holmes jury after two weeks of working its way through this thicket apparently decided not to punish her for supposedly false claims she made to those who pressed for more information one wonders then exactly how cautious the jury believes investors should be is it better to ask questions or not no doubt holmes will raise this paradox on appeal she will remind the appellate courts of the adage that the law of fraud does not attribute to investors a childlike simplicity she will also surely raise once more the claim that every investor knows that silicon valley is a veritable hotbed of hype don t get me wrong i m not arguing that holmes is innocent we should always as a first approximation trust that juries have done their work correctly i won t be surprised if the verdict is upheld on appeal but even if holmes has to spend some time behind bars one suspects that things will work out for her fairly or not she s captured a corner of the zeitgeist and is likely to retain a degree of celebrity or perhaps notoriety for years to come fans attended the trial in replicas of her iconic plain black suit jennifer lawrence has agreed to portray her in the movie and because this is silicon valley it s appropriate to close with what might be the strangest coda to the holmes story venture capitalist marc ostrofsky an early theranos investor whose stake was at one point valued at 22 million is auctioning a non fungible token of his stock certificate good for 500 000 preferred shares in theranos as of this writing there are no offers
bloomberg in the summer of 2018 a senior anti money laundering official at swedbank ab appeared anxious as he read reports that its competitor danske bank a s could be fined by u s authorities for alleged crimes in the baltics i m afraid that if they are sentenced we will be in focus he wrote in an email to then chief compliance officer cecilia hernqvist she replied fingers crossed danske which has since admitted handling suspicious funds in one of europe s largest ever money laundering scandals is still awaiting judgement by regulators in the u s but swedbank executives were right to be concerned in the months that followed swedbank was also sucked into the maelstrom of the nordic wide revelations of dirty money flows from the former soviet union the lender has been fined in sweden and remains under investigation by u s authorities email exchanges reports and witness testimonies released this week by sweden s economic crime authority that run to almost 4 000 pages add to evidence that some swedbank managers were aware of significant links to the potential laundering including through danske yet when pressed by outsiders former chief executive birgitte bonnesen appeared to be less than forthcoming about those connections the documents written mostly in swedish were made public as part of the indictment against bonnesen for serious fraud the ex ceo is also accused of disclosing insider information when on feb 18 2019 she gave the bank s biggest investors advance notice of an investigative program aired by the public broadcaster two days later those revelations sent the lender s stock tanking losses the shares have yet to recover bonnesen who was ousted in march 2019 after steering the bank for three years denies the charges there is no doubt that birgitte bonnesen was made a scapegoat her lawyers per samuelson and christina bergenstein with legal firm ssw said in the filing they described her statements as completely normal elements of her work as ceo adding it was simply her duty to comment bonnesen had received reports drafted by the bank s compliance officers on exposure to danske described by its author in an email as not looking good in july of 2018 and a final report in september of that year according to the investigation report released this week but in the months that followed she told swedish media the bank found nothing when investigating transactions with danske she also stressed in other interviews statements and at quarterly earnings calls with analysts that swedbank s business model was entirely different from danske s and not focused on non resident clients of the baltics which included those often implicated in laundering swedish authorities in 2020 fined swedbank a record 4 billion kronor 440 million for breaching money laundering rules swedish newspaper dagens industri reported in december 2020 that federal authorities in the u s including the justice department the fbi and a federal prosecutor s office in new york are probing nordic banks including swedbank unni jerndal a spokeswoman for the stockholm based lender declined to comment on the released documents saying those concern historical information in a legal process that does not involve the bank and wouldn t specify the status of any ongoing probes often regarded a model of successful transition from communism the baltic countries of estonia latvia and lithuania were swift to reduce economic dependence on their former soviet overlord after regaining independence in 1991 yet the region remained a window for capital flight from russia to the west long after the nordic lenders came to dominate its financial sector banks transfered money from east to west often in dollars and often with murky origins in what was a widely touted business model that began to change in 2014 when russia annexed crimea triggering u s sanctions and closer scrutiny of financial flows more scandals such as the russian laundromat emerged and lenders were shut the u s treasury proposed banning ablv from the american financial system designating it as a primary money laundering concern in february 2018 sparking its demise ablv denied the accusations when danske revealed in september 2018 that a large part of the 200 billion euros 227 billion in flows handled by the bank between 2007 and 2015 were suspect the news triggered a surge in international scrutiny that also engulfed deutsche bank ag the main correspondent bank for danske s estonian unit the newly revealed swedbank documents seemingly point to repeated instances in which swedbank s management tried to play down its potential role in money laundering swedbank had been aware of shortcomings at its baltic operations already in 2016 when an internal compliance report by hernqvist s predecessor pointed to problems in risk assessment know your client processes as well as screening and transaction monitoring the department s attention turned to the region in 2015 and its investigation found rather serious shortcomings including transaction monitoring that was done by simply going through excel spreadsheets hernqvist s predecessor told the police in september 2019 in 2017 an investigation for the bank by law firm erling grimstad showed a high risk of widespread money laundering and significant risk of swedbank involvement in other criminal activity as the bank has no control of money flow in and out of accounts triggering a purge of high risk clients that year another report commissioned from grimstad at the end of 2018 said it found several similar risks in swedbank estonia as those identified at danske s local unit adding there were major breaches of core anti money laundering obligations at swedbank estonia oh f ck this is not sparing on estonia a senior swedbank compliance officer said in an email to a colleague on dec 13 2018 point of no return nasty times ahead over the years swedbank had also attracted the suspicion of u s authorities in 2016 the new york department of financial services had asked swedbank s u s operation for details about its exposure to clients of mossack fonseca co the law firm whose leaked files put a spotlight on offshore finance in what became known as the panama papers another letter from dfs in 2018 requested details on exposure for the global operations of swedbank to the law firm the indictment documents released this week show hernqvist the chief compliance officer at the time excluded the lender s baltic subsidiaries from the bank s response according to an email dated feb 23 2018 a month later a senior officer wrote just so you know we do have a lot of hits on mf in the baltics hernqvist replied that s why i wanted to get them out of the scope hernqvist who has not been accused of any wrongdoing declined to comment when reached by bloomberg news via linkedin hernqvist also said in an email to bonnesen dated sept 23 2018 that the bank hadn t done much to prevent money laundering in the past and i m afraid there may be a lot of old historic stuff so i think we should be a bit careful the bank s senior management failed to establish clear lines of responsibility for preventing dubious flows was the conclusion of an audit by law firm clifford chance published in march 2020 commissioned by swedbank it found that between 2007 and 2019 client transactions totaling 40 billion mainly at swedbank s estonian unit represented a high risk of money laundering 2022 bloomberg l p

declining for so long that ignoring new potential discoveries probably won t affect calculations doly wrote i dump 1000 btus of natural gas costing 1 1000btus into extracting 100 btus of tar sand oil

thinking in terms of money it sounds plausible that s exactly the problem with thinking in terms of money it sounds plausible doly wrote in the real world however money is a reflection roughly of the amount of work capital and inputs that it takes to do something so let s suppose that things were running as you say clearly that natural gas is rather cheap so it must be plentiful and need little capital for its extraction on the other hand that tar sand operation using vast amounts of gas is clearly using a lot of inputs for very little output some engineer is going to think hey i could convert that cheap gas into liquids with just a little more capital and then sell the liquids to the people buying from the tar sands at a cheaper price doly wrote that s how eroei can predict how people switch from one energy source to another in spite of not even touching the subject of money doly wrote money doesn t have a straightforward equivalent to energy but it does relate to it indirectly sufficiently to put a boundary on what sorts of energy source exploitation are economically viable fortunately because if it turned out that you are right and i am wrong it would mean that finance wizards could make industry grind to a halt and nobody would move a finger till it all literally stopped the second law of thermodynamics isn t something you can argue with in a court of law doly wrote and how well did it predict production from saudi arabia using this energy metric venezuela russia it didn t go into specific countries the aim of my model was never to go into such specifics but to answer some general questions related to the peak oil issue if you are interested in such specifics there are plenty of people that have modelled production of specific countries it

available with what appears to be limited estimates of world reserves and resources no since my model does not have anything in it about price as price is a confounding issue for the questions that i was trying to answer prices fluctuate for all sorts of reasons and simply add noise to the signal no since my model does not have anything in it about price as price is a confounding issue for the questions that i was trying to answer prices fluctuate for all sorts of reasons and simply add noise to the signal i clearly did not ignore that line oil and gas development in the us didn t grind to a halt in 2011 any more than it did in 2005 new discoveries and the discovery processs modeling needed to not miss them was formally documented and published by aarps and roberts back in 1956 1957 if memory serves are you saying that charles couldn t be bothered to do basic research on this effect and the consequences of his work nearly a quarter century after it was published in your world of independent research is such a miss considered good work as far as reserve growth itself a form of new discovery hubbert himself had built a modified arrington function for the usgs that was applied in usgs circular 725 betty miller primary author so that folks wouldn t make the mistake of not counting those volumes either are we to say that charles does good work because as a fisheries ecologist he isn t required to know the most basic geoscience research on this topic and therefore when his system gets it wrong we just give him a pass i didn t describe a process that sounds plausible i described a process that forms the backbone of human activity across the range of all extractive industries and incorporates the value difference in energy as well as scarcity of any particular type all at the same time which eroei does not do you have a perspective you can enunciate that negates the value of the current system or bests it in terms of real world modeling compared to eroei that doesn t recognize the value differences between energy forms you are exactly correct in how an engineer would think this we excuse me they can be quite clever that same engineer would also know that the market price point for that conversion might be about 125 bbl for the gtl process and let the substitution process at a given price point begin except charles couldn t predict anything like this at all and because the switch occurs at a market price point not an energy equivalency point how does the eroei process know when the conversion occurs without incorporating market price or cost eroei wants nothing to do with the 2nd law because if it did and properly incorporated the energy inputs as well as the outputs eroei would by definition be 1 i am more than interested in the specifics but not those systems handicapped by the limitations of their designers or data or budgets charles handicapped his system by ignoring even the most basic geoscience principles and the expected happened the eroei system might have some value somehow and i am attempting to have someone familiar enough with it to say something that might juxtapose in a logical way with the system under which oil and natural gas production actually functions prices do fluctuate for all sorts of reasons and that noise you mention exists primarily above the cost of production and the cost of production is something that economic models can be based upon one final question are you familiar with any equivalency between your eroei work and resource cost curves in any way thank you for your detailed answers
gov jay inslee rescinded directive 98 01 which prevented agencies from considering race or sex when making hiring decisions olympia wash gov jay inslee announced friday he will rescind a directive preventing state agencies from considering race or sex when making hiring decisions which throttled the implementation of affirmative action within washington directive 98 01 issued by former washington governor gary locke in 1998 laid out how state agencies should comply with initiative 200 which prevented the state from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to individuals or groups based on race sex color ethnicity or national origin in public employment public education or public contracting the directive still allowed veteran status or disability status to be taken into account when making hiring decisions in a press release inslee called the directive overly restrictive and announced he would issue another executive order instructing state agencies on how to move forward achieving equity while still complying with i 200 previously a referendum to repeal i 200 passed the state legislature but failed after opponents gathered enough signatures to put the initiative to a vote in the 2019 general election inslee also made an executive order on friday concerning equity in public contracting the order directs state agencies to review whether certain bonding insurance and experience requirements in state contracting pose unnecessary obstacles to minority women and veteran owned businesses and if anything can be done to mitigate or eliminate barriers to those businesses winning state contracts in 2019 a study by the governor s subcabinet on business diversity confirmed unequal access to contracting opportunities for minority women and veteran owned businesses

these talented teachers left an outdoors legacy retired teacher hugh birdsall in an article that appears in today s perspective section suggests public k 12 education stop focusing on remote learning and other work arounds to compensate for pandemic related loss of time in school instead he says recruit the help of naturalists and knowledgeable nature lovers to help educators move learning to the great classroom of the outdoors planning a broad based move to nature s classroom seems like it would take years yet i am struck by how much of that already goes on in local schools nature centers and environmental programs and is staffed in part by volunteers southeastern connecticut is an especially rich place to introduce students to the biosphere hundreds of acres of land remain unspoiled transected by rivers and streams most towns touch estuary waters including long island sound and the connecticut niantic thames and pawcatuck rivers in a lifetime you could not fathom all the biology geology hydrology chemistry and physics on display to learn but what an enthusiastic teacher can bequeath is a lifetime of devotion to nature and earth needs human advocates more than anything in the past month we have lost two of the region s most passionate outdoors and nature teachers both of them experts and volunteers curtis nelson and eleanor robinson each made sure however that the natural world hereabouts would have champions long after they departed curt nelson was a retired eb engineering manager from ledyard he embodied the fly fisher s creed that the places where trout live are unfailingly beautiful and that humans who visit those places will find peace and excitement at the same time curt helped found the thames valley chapter of trout unlimited an organization whose name is its mission to sustain the trout population and the local streams where these gorgeously speckled fish can thrive he and other tu guys annually helped state fish and wildlife workers stock trout in streams up and down eastern connecticut overjoyed to be wading frigid april and november streams once they even set out to raise brown trout from the egg stage and eventually set them free in merrick brook in scotland north of norwich curt and his fly fishing friends would land trout on barbless hooks and release them unharmed they hosted fishing lessons for children teaching woods and water safety and sportsmanship and the science of entomology because you can t tie an artificial fly if you don t understand the life cycle of the real bug as it emerges spreads its wings and hovers over moving water when curt died dec 14 at 86 he bequeathed to people he would never meet a web of clean and beautiful waterways where a trout would be glad to live and a passion for preserving them eleanor robinson who died jan 2 was responsible for educating even more lovers of nature in 2015 the first year she led a small group of volunteers for the nascent roger tory peterson estuary center in running a nature program for third graders in essex they enrolled 35 kids in 2021 the center s camps and programs including science education for all elementary school students in the new london schools reached 3 500 children and more than 1 500 adults eleanor was the prime mover and first director of the estuary center in old lyme a teacher biologist and environmentalist she had banded birds in the amazon rain forest and climbed in the adirondack mountains but she believed that the environment in each child s neighborhood was the most compelling one the science based curriculum she developed with others takes children out of the building to study the ecology within walking distance whether urban suburban or rural it now serves children in 15 towns eleanor robinson and curt nelson were many things besides environmentalists she a musician and he a submarine builder among others they did not stand still when they had time they shared it they had fun they were look at this people i hope their successors are out there ready to share with young people what they have learned outdoors lisa mcginley is a member of the day editorial board
the most amazing crypto statistics of 2021 cryptocurrencies are relatively new inventions in recent years they have gained tremendous strength thanks to their great reputation it has also revolutionized many industries especially the banking sector many fintech companies rely on blockchain and cryptocurrencies for example crypto is now used for payment and cross border remittances filling the gap left by traditional banking systems as a result investors have found cryptography to offer great investment opportunities it is therefore essential to understand the scope of cryptocurrencies we ve narrowed down some of the most amazing cryptographic statistics you should know 1 it first surpassed its 1 trillion market value in february when bitcoin reached a new milestone after reaching a 1 trillion market capitalization the price of bitcoin was selling for just over 53500 this was the first time that a cryptocurrency had reached a market capital of more than 1 trillion however bitcoin is currently selling at 47 170 with a market cap of 892 billion it is the second largest crypt and can achieve the same feat at least if it doubles its price 2 the value of the global cryptocurrency market increased by almost 3000 from 2020 to 2021 the whole cryptocurrency market went from 100 000 billion to 3 trillion in early 2020 in 2021 this represents an increase of 3000 however the market value fell by 2 22 trillion future growth will be affected by the growth of large cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin and ethereum valuates reports estimates that from 2021 onwards the size of the cryptocurrency market will grow at a cagr of 12 8 by 2030 billion by 2030 3 shiba grew by 26 million percent in one year according to crypto academy org shiba was selling for 0 0000000003 in the third quarter of 2020 the price increased in 2021 reaching a historic high of 0 00008 in october more than 26 million percent in just 13 months this is the biggest growth in cryptocurrency in 2021 to put it bluntly the 10 investment provided 266 million in 2021 the price rose from 0 00000001 in january to 0 00003 at the end of the year more than 330 000 in one year 4 there are 34 000 bitcoin atms bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency accounting for almost half of the cryptocurrency market growth and growth have had to improve bitcoin support infrastructure the number of bitcoins rose to 34 000 from 14 000 at the beginning of the year most of these machines are in the us with just over 30 000 canada ranks second with 2200 bitcoin atms el salvador which made bitcoin the legal price in september ranks third with 200 bitcoin atms the operation of bitcoin is quite different from that of atms it allows people to exchange bitcoin fiat currency and allows bitcoin to sell fiat currency 5 there will be more than 300 million cryptocurrency users worldwide by 2020 with the number of verified identity users exceeding the 100 million mark binance reports that the number will grow to 300 million by 2021 about 3 8 of the world s population this figure represents 5 8 of the population aged 15 to 65 and is set to increase as the adoption of cryptocurrencies increases 6 the value of the global cryptocurrency theft in 2020 was 513 million 7 7 million was stolen worldwide from cryptographic scams up 80 from 2020 according to chainalysis rug pull accounts for the bulk of the 2 8 billion theft this represents 28 of the total crypto registered in 2020 carpet pulls leave developers with a project and disappear into the open air with investor funds 7 india has the 100 million largest cryptocurrency holders india is among the countries with the largest number of crypto users according to triple a india has 100 740 320 crypto users followed by the us with 27 491 810 russia and nigeria have 17 million and 13 million respectively 12 73 of the ukrainian population has a crypto the highest percentage in the world 8 ethereum there were more than one million transactions every day in 2021 ethereum processes more than a million transactions every day according to y charts ethereum processed between 1 057 million and 1 717 million transactions per day this is more than six times the average of 250 000 bitcoin transactions in june 9 more than 16 000 cryptocurrencies developers are creating new cryptocurrencies every day according to coin market cap data there are more than 16 000 cryptocurrencies listed in 451 cryptocurrencies 10 did you know that 18 000 companies are already accepting cryptocurrency payments so you can pay for goods and services using bitcoin probably yes what you may not know is that 18 000 companies around the world accept bitcoin payments deloitt reported that 2 300 u s businesses were accepting bitcoin payments by the end of 2020 excluding bitcoin atms major companies that support crypto payments include at t microsoft nasdaq overstock nasdaq twitch pizzahut and newegg amazon nasdaq mastercard nyse visa nyse and tesla nasdaq also plan to join the group 11 us controls hash rate of 35 4 usa is the top destination of bitcoin miners it now controls 35 of the bitcoin hash rate according to the cambridge center for alternative finance the hash rate corresponds to the computing power of the miners the us banned china after the chinese government banned cryptographic mining at its peak china controlled 67 of the hash rate in september 2020 12 the top 10 cryptocurrencies make up 88 of the total market value crypto currencies have different market prices and capitalizations bitcoin which had the advantage of the first movement was once more valuable than all other cryptocurrencies combined however it is losing market share due to ethereum and other altcoins the top ten cryptocurrencies have taken a significant toll on bitcoin s market share low ranking cryptocurrencies are of low value mainly due to low demand and reputation in fact it is surprising that bitcoin ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in the top ten are controlled by about 88 of the total value of the crypto market 13 merchants who accept crypto payments have had an average return on investment of 327 one of the areas that is revolutionizing crypto is online payments it is convenient and inexpensive for people with cryptocurrencies to use digital currency businesses that support cryptocurrencies therefore attract users of cryptocurrencies this represents a staggering roi of 327 of cryptocurrencies conversely the crypto market has not been pink while the statistics paint a compelling growth story some crypts are experiencing a bear run for example bitcoin has fallen from a high of 65000 and is now trading at 47000 it has dropped more than 70 why you should care according to these statistics the crypto market has grown on all fronts and is ready to expand further however you need to be careful about which digital assets to invest in to make a profit otherwise you risk losing money if you invest in a falling digital currency the conclusion is that 2021 is the year that the crypto market exploded and so are amazing statistics we expect more growth in the crypto market in 2022 and perhaps more amazing statistics and more fun events magazine woman register to get the reverse of the crypto upgrade your inbox and receive our dailycoin editor options 1

welcome to the supermarkets of the future they may look and feel like the supermarkets we are all used to and stock the same bread butter and bananas but these shops are now fitted out with more than 1m of the latest technology that their bosses promise will put an end to our biggest frustration queueing and our most persistent crime shoplifting jill french a legal secretary in her 30s wearing a sharp navy suit and matching beret has just left a tesco express on london s holborn viaduct empty handed it s coming up to 6 30pm on a thursday and like dozens of others french has popped in for a few essentials on her way home i just went in to grab pasta milk and some broccoli she says but there was such a queue i got frustrated and walked out an eight minute walk away is another near identical tesco express where there are no queues this shop is the cleverest of all the 2 700 tescos in the uk there are no checkouts self scanning or traditional no checkout assistants and in theory no chance of shoplifting this tesco called getgo is filled with thousands of cameras weighted shelves and artificial intelligence technology that watches your every move figures out what you ve bought and bills you directly as you walk out it s not just tesco that is trialling these new smart supermarkets retailers across the uk and the rest of the world are racing to deploy rival technology the model for all of them is similar first you must download an app register a credit card and scan a qr code on your phone to enter through train station style gates barriers prevent those without the app from entering the shop once inside the technology follows you around the store recording every item you pick up and put back when you re done you just walk out and after a few minutes your phone alerts you as to how much you ve spent the supermarkets say time pressed easily frustrated people are crying out for a better hassle free shopping experience and if these trial stores are successful they will roll out the technology across the country it s almost 74 years since the first british supermarket opened in manor park east london at this branch of the london cooperative society customers could walk round the store and take items off the shelves by themselves it was revolutionary in the years before shoppers had to present the shopkeeper at a counter with a list of items that their assistants would fetch choosing your own tomatoes was banned and touching the products could lead to prosecution as with many innovations the self service supermarket concept was exported from the us where retail pioneer clarence saunders opened piggly wiggly in memphis tennessee in 1916 if you re wondering about the name saunders said it was named so people will ask that very question today all shops big or small follow a similar concept but our retail needs are evolving the days of the big weekly shop are over with britons going to a supermarket at least twice a week according to yougov while a growing minority admit to popping in more than twice a day the new generation of ai stores is meant to respond to these changes but are there dangers in tinkering with one of the last remaining social levellers supermarkets are more than just places to buy food they provide a space for a daily mixing of people of different classes and backgrounds in our increasingly siloed world

the wage bill and save some of the 5 5bn lost every year to shoplifting and employee theft illustration pete reynolds if ai takes over will those without access to the latest smartphone be barred from the great supermarket melting pot will lonely older people lose their friendly chat with the cashier which could be their only conversation of the day research backs up the retailers hunch about our frustrations with shopping a recent survey by packaging company ds smith found that more than a third of 2 000 people polled would walk out of the store rather than wait five minutes in a checkout queue and 46 said they were so irritated by queuing that they would consider not coming back to the shop again laura saunter a senior retail analyst at the consumer trends analytic firm wgsn says supermarkets have spent years trying to bust queues because they are the customers number one pain point many of us are now so impatient that waiting a few minutes for a checkout assistant to become free can feel like an unacceptable hassle in a world where technology dominates and instant gratification is expected will ai stores send checkout workers the same way as the elevator operator these stores are positioned at millennial parents who are busy they want to be in and out they don t want to waste their time saunter says and younger people generation z just don t want to interact with store staff tesco has already tested the technology at its employee only supermarket in welwyn garden city for more than a year amazon has 15 stores that use similar technology including one almost directly across the street from the tesco on holborn the supermarkets analytics teams seem to have a thing for the central london neighbourhood with sainsbury s also opening a trial smart supermarket

recent leak of internal documents reveals that these are just baby steps on to the uk high street for amazon which was founded by the world s second richest person jeff bezos in 1995 and is now the second largest retailer on the planet collecting sales of more than 1 2bn 900m every day the internet giant is planning to open about 60 more uk stores next year followed by 100 in 2023 and another 100 in 2024 according to a report by the blog business insider amazon has long been accused of attempting to kill off the high street by encouraging us all to buy almost everything online but could its desire to now open bricks and mortar stores revitalise our urban centres all of the supermarkets say the technology is designed to make shoppers lives easier but experts say the real desire is to improve their bottom line as they can cut back on the wage bill and save some of the 5 5bn lost every year to shoplifting and employee theft the most frequently stolen items from uk stores include spirits sirloin steaks razor blades cosmetics infant formula and batteries according to the centre for retail research crr cheese also makes the top 10 with posh bries and aged camembert often stolen

to open the doors of shipping container like stores shop completely alone and walk out to the beep of the bill notification on their phone in less than three years stockholm based start up lifvs has opened 29 of the tiny stores in remote villages across sweden which in some instances had lost their last corner shops decades ago giulia ray a beekeeper in the village of veckholm 60 miles east of stockholm said the opening of the lifvs shopping box added to rather than took away from community spirit you go inside and get something and maybe someone else is here and you can have a chat she says as she picks up essentials and restocks the shelves with her own honey at the same time while fitting out supermarkets with the new technology costs about 1m per store the firms installing it claim it will pay for itself within 18 months because it will hopefully eliminate theft with this technology you can t really steal we know who is in the store and we know where all the products are says yair holtzer who helped develop the technology for trigo an israeli firm that fitted out the tesco store and is working with other major retailers across the world with these systems it cuts out not just shoplifting but also mistakes errors and employee fraud he says these are problems that all retailers have and could be solved view image in fullscreen in the basket shoppers scan a barcode to enter smart supermarkets photograph ben stevens parsons media supermarkets lose about 1 4 of their combined 200bn annual revenue to shrinkage industry code for customer or employee theft and admin errors professor joshua bamfield director of the crr says supermarkets thought they had found a solution to queue frustration and high wage bills with the introduction of self scanning machines that were rolled out in the early 2000s and are now ubiquitous but it is very easy for customers to skip a few items through without scanning the barcode he says it s quite easy to get away with things that you wouldn t be able to at a staffed till probe a little and even the most upstanding friends and acquaintances have a shoplifting tale from the south london primary school teacher who makes a point of stealing one item in every shop to the writer who was tapped on the shoulder by a security guard who d seen her tap the screen for one banana when she bagged two a study by the university of leicester s criminology department found that theft from stores with self checkout machines was between 33 and 147 higher than those with only traditional checkouts the researchers also found that the number of self checkout machines available to use was correlated to the level of theft in response shops have cut down on the number of self checkout machines available per staff member which bamfield says explains why supermarkets often annoyingly place out of order stickers on working terminals supermarkets including tesco have also begun installing screens on self checkouts showing a livestream of customers scanning their items they re reminding you that every action you take is being filmed says bamfield it s like the shop saying are you sure you want to steal it s not just customers who steal bamfield s research shows that about 1 4bn a year is lost to shoplifting followed closely by 1 3bn in employee theft the new technology is designed to tackle that too it might not seem so obvious but a big proportion of theft is due to staff on the take and by removing staff from tills this technology will eliminate that loss he says bamfield believes the most common technique staff use to steal is referred to in the industry as the switcheroo an uncle will say to his cashier nephew i m coming into the store tomorrow afternoon and i d like a discount he explains when the uncle comes to the checkout the nephew will have a barcode sticker for a watermelon or orange or something on his palm and while pretending to scan the uncle s bottles of scotch whisky the nephew will scan the watermelon sticker bamfield who has spent a career working with retailers and has written a book on shoplifting waterstones describes his 2012 title shopping and crime as an interdisciplinary study of retail crime as a cultural phenomenon isn t sure the new checkout free supermarkets will succeed in eliminating shoplifting altogether view image in fullscreen screen grab shoppers receive a text with a receipt a few minutes after leaving a smart store photograph ben stevens parsons media i was at a retail conference in norwich and one of the speakers flashed up a picture of one of these new stores and said well that is the end of shoplifting but we just don t know yet how good this technology will be at reducing theft shoplifting which was first documented in the 16th century began soaring in 2014 after the law was changed to define low value shoplifting as a summary offence this means that police forces can decide not to investigate thefts from shops of goods worth less than 200 anyone caught stealing less than 200 worth of goods can still be arrested and face prosecution but the 2014 antisocial behaviour crime and policing act allows them to plead guilty by post police in england and wales recorded 374 000 incidents of shoplifting in 2019 the latest figures available up from 317 000 in 2013 before the law changed retailers have responded with more technology sainsbury s is experimenting with machine learning concealment detector technology to monitor and record when shoppers place an item in their pocket and alert in store security guards in real time sainsbury s says its 30 store trial partnership with uk artificial intelligence startup thirdeye has helped cut theft from its spirits aisles by 47 razwan ghafoor co founder and chief executive of thirdeye says the technology helps make cctv smarter you can have hundreds of cameras in a store but which feed should you be watching ghafoor says on the phone from heathrow as he boards a plane to new york the day after selling thirdeye to larger rival standard ai for millions of pounds we ve taught the system to learn when someone picks up an item and pockets it the system will flag it and send a four second clip to a human to investigate it means the security team can watch a lot less footage and concentrate on the footage they need to watch no queues less shoplifting lower wage bills the benefits of this new generation of hi tech supermarkets are clear but campaigners are concerned they represent another step in the uk s march towards an everyday surveillance society going to the supermarket is one of the most mundane everyday things we do the fact that surveillance and data gathering in such a space is being normalised is deeply troubling says emmanuelle andrews policy and campaigns officer at human rights group liberty shopping should be one of the great levellers where the businessman in the sharp suit is shoulder to shoulder with the pensioner on benefits everyone has to buy food but with this technology only those with a smartphone and credit cards will be able to shop there in the near term the biggest losers from this technological revolution are likely to be britain s army of 270 000 checkout workers most of whom are women the pandemic has already hit retail workers hard with some 190 000 jobs lost since the start of the first lockdown in march 2020 the office for national statistics ons has identified supermarket cashier jobs as among the most at risk of being replaced by automation with 65 of checkout operator jobs said to be in peril the checkout free technology is specifically designed to eliminate jobs and save money says dr carl benedikt frey an oxford university economist and expert on automation whose research the ons statistics are based on up to 47 of all jobs could be done by machines over the next decade or two he believes frey predicts that checkout workers are likely to be among the first to lose their jobs to the robots alongside bar staff farm workers and sewing machinists supermarkets have offered stable employment to generations of britons excluded from higher skilled roles providing modest but reliable incomes and the prospect of advancement in communities blighted by manufacturing decline frey fears that a national rollout of ai stores would send the checkout worker the same way as the elevator operator which as of today is the only one of 270 job descriptions listed in the 1950 us census to be completely eliminated by automation we think this coming change is unprecedented but actually what is happening mirrors what we saw in the industrial revolution and hollowing out of middle income jobs he says the technology is very different but the effects on the economy are quite similar back in that holborn tesco among the familiar daily groceries a change is coming that could herald the biggest revolution in how we shop for groceries since the opening of the first supermarket on 12 january 1948 like their predecessors the smart supermarkets are said to be designed to make our lives easier but is it time to allow the shop assistant to follow the elevator operator into obsolescence or could we all learn to wait a little longer and enjoy a friendly chat at the checkout
this started as a story about what happens after a pandemic ends i pitched my editor on the idea in early may every adult in america could get a vaccine covid 19 numbers started to fall if the roaring 20s came after the spanish flu a century ago did that mean we were on track for another roaring 20s now would hot vax summer give way to decadent gatsby party autumn i started to dig in a number of compelling parallels emerged america 100 years ago had staggering income inequality a booming stock market racial uprisings anti immigrant sentiment a one term president plagued by scandals after he left office plenty of material for a story then the pandemic didn t end vaccinations stalled the delta variant fueled new waves of infections hospitalizations and deaths by september some states had more hospitalized covid 19 patients than they did during the winter surge the economic outlook for this decade has gone from champagne soaked to room temperature in late november the world health organization announced a new variant of concern omicron i called a meeting with my editor i said i didn t think it was a good time to write a story in which the premise was this pandemic is over now what the pandemic wasn t ending would it ever this is not humanity s first time staring down a seemingly unstoppable disease pandemics a disease affecting a large number of people in multiple countries or regions around the world per the world health organization epidemics a disease affecting people in a country or region and outbreaks a sudden occurrence of an infectious disease have plagued us throughout history just in the past century we ve survived a few how did those end and how might we get ourselves out of this one spanish flu how it started unclear but probably not in spain it was a particularly deadly strain of h1n1 influenza and first took root in the u s in kansas the disease was so virulent and killed so many young people that if you heard this is just ordinary influenza by another name you knew that was a lie said john barry the author of the great influenza there was zero partisanship over the virus barry said if the flu did hit your town it hit hard a young person could wake up in the morning feeling well and be dead 24 hours later half the people who died of the flu in 1918 were in their 20s and 30s it was a spooky time said georges benjamin executive director of the american public health association so how did we as a species beat the spanish flu we didn t we survived it it torched through individual communities until it ran out of people to infect a third of the world s population was believed to have contracted the spanish flu during that pandemic and it had a case fatality rate of as high as 10 20 globally and 2 5 in the united states johns hopkins university reports the covid 19 case fatality rate in the u s is 1 6 as of december 2021 roughly 675 000 people in america died out of a population of 103 2 million a number recently surpassed by covid 19 victims of a 2020 u s population of 329 5 million flu vaccines wouldn t be developed until the 1930s and wouldn t become widely available for another decade ultimately the virus went through a process called attenuation basically it got less bad we still have descendent strains of the spanish flu floating around today it s endemic not a pandemic as a society we accept a certain amount of death from known diseases the normal seasonal flu usually kills less than 0 1 of people who contract it deaths have been between 12 000 and 52 000 people in the u s annually for the past decade the regular seasonal flu is both less contagious and less deadly than covid 19 that people were washing hands working from home and socially distancing in the winter 2020 flu season likely contributed to the fact that it was a comparably light flu season though business and school closures weren t enough to stave off the devastating winter surge of covid 19 the measures were sufficient to keep the flu at bay one strain may have been completely extinguished as places reopen and people feel more confident about socializing and traveling again the flu could make a calamitous comeback by the way have you gotten your flu shot yet how it ended endemic polio how it started the first documented polio epidemic in the united states was in 1894 outbreaks occurred throughout the first half of the 20th century primarily killing children and leaving many more paralyzed polio reached pandemic levels by the 1940s there were more than 600 000 cases of polio in the united states in the 20th century and nearly 60 000 deaths a case fatality rate of 9 8 in 1952 alone there were 57 628 reported cases of polio resulting in 3 145 deaths polio was every mother s scourge benjamin said people were afraid to death of polio polio was highly contagious in a household with an infected adult or child 90 to 100 of susceptible people would develop evidence in their blood of also having been infected polio is not spread through the air transmission occurs from oral oral infection say sharing a drinking glass or by what s nicely called hand fecal paula cannon a virology professor at the university of southern california keck school of medicine told me people poop it out and people get it on their hands and they make you a sandwich polio like covid 19 could have devastating long term effects even if you survived the initial infection president franklin roosevelt was among the thousands of people who lived with permanent paralysis from polio others spent weeks years or the rest of their lives in iron lungs precautions were taken during the polio pandemic schools and public pools closed then in 1955 a miracle a vaccine a two dose course of the polio vaccine proved to be about 90 effective similar to the effectiveness of our current covid 19 vaccines vaccine technology was still relatively new and the polio vaccine was not without side effects a small number of people who got that vaccine got polio from it another subset of recipients developed guillain barre syndrome a noncontagious autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis or nerve damage a botched batch killed some of the people who received it but there were no masses of polio anti vaxxers it was a whole sense of the greater good that this was the only way out of this terrible scourge cannon said you would have had to have been a psychopathic monster to not want to be part of the solution benjamin said the polio vaccine campaign became a moment of national unity jonas salk and the folks that solved the polio problem were national heroes by 1979 polio was eradicated in the united states how it ended vaccination smallpox how it started the disease had been observed in the eastern hemisphere dating to as early as 1157 b c and european colonizers first brought smallpox to north america s previously unexposed native population in the early 1500s a 2019 study suggested smallpox and other viruses introduced by colonizers killed as much as 90 of the indigenous population in some areas globally smallpox is estimated to have killed more than 300 million people just in the 20th century the case fatality rate of variola major which caused the majority of smallpox infections is around 30 outbreaks continued in north america through the centuries after it arrived here at one point infecting half the population of the city of boston we fought back by trying to infect people with a weakened version of it long before vaccines existed an enslaved man named onesimus is believed to have introduced the concept of smallpox inoculation to north america in 1721 when he told slave owner cotton mather that he had undergone it in west africa mather tried to convince boston doctors to consider inoculating residents during that outbreak to limited success one doctor who inoculated 287 patients reported only 2 of them died of smallpox compared with a 14 8 death rate among the general population in 1777 george washington ordered troops who had not already had the disease to undergo a version of inoculation in which pus from a smallpox sore was introduced into an open cut most people who were inoculated developed a mild case of smallpox then developed natural immunity some died though at a far lower rate compared with other ways of contracting the disease the practice of inoculation was controversial enough some skeptics said it was not sufficiently tested some argued it was doctors playing god others theorized that it was a conspiracy from slaves to trick white slave owners into killing themselves that it was banned in several colonies edward jenner first demonstrated the effectiveness of his newly created smallpox vaccine in england in 1796 vaccination spread throughout the world and deaths from smallpox became rarer over time in a century smallpox went from being responsible for 1 in 13 deaths in london to about 1 in 100 but while early vaccines reduced smallpox s power it still existed an outbreak hit new york city in 1947 it demonstrated that the vaccines were not 100 effective in everyone forever 47 year old eugene le bar the first fatality had a smallpox vaccine scar israel weinstein the city s health commissioner held a news conference urging all new yorkers to get vaccinated against smallpox whether for the first time or what we would now call a booster shot the mayor and president harry truman got vaccinated on camera in less than one month 6 35 million new yorkers were vaccinated in a city of 7 8 million the final toll of the new york outbreak 12 cases of smallpox resulting in 2 deaths our country s final outbreak affected eight people in the rio grande valley in 1949 in 1959 the world health organization announced a plan to eradicate smallpox globally with vaccinations the disease was declared eradicated in 1980 of all the diseases our species has tackled the only one we ve ever been really successful to totally eradicating is smallpox benjamin said the only remaining smallpox pathogens exist in laboratories how it ended vaccination hiv aids how it started in 1981 the cdc announced the first cases of what we would later call aids roughly half of americans who contracted hiv in the early 1980s died of an hiv aids related condition within two years deaths from hiv peaked in the 1990s with roughly 50 000 in 1995 and have decreased steadily since then as of 2019 roughly 1 2 million americans are hiv positive there were 5 044 deaths attributed to hiv that year the reagan administration did not take hiv seriously for years unlike covid 19 which was quickly identified as a respiratory disease hiv spread for years before scientists knew for sure how it was transmitted gay activists who encouraged their community to use condoms in the early 1980s were criticized as sex negative today we know how to prevent the spread of hiv and treatments for it have progressed to the point where early intervention can make the virus completely undetectable if you re hiv positive the hiv pandemic never went away for you said cannon who s spent much of her career studying the virus she described it as a great irony that we identified the cause of covid 19 and developed a vaccine within a year only to have people refuse it anybody with hiv would tell you that the opposite is true for hiv where despite decades now of research we have not been able to come up with vaccines that work against this shapeshifter of a virus that is hiv and people would be desperately pleased if there were vaccines around 700 000 people in the u s have died of hiv related illnesses in the 40 years since the disease appeared in less than two years of the covid 19 pandemic we ve surpassed 820 000 covid 19 deaths how it ended endemic sars how it started sars first appeared in china in 2002 before making its way to the united states and 28 other countries severe acute respiratory syndrome quickly shortened to sars in headlines and news coverage is caused by a coronavirus named sars cov or sars associated coronavirus covid 19 is caused by a virus so similar that it s called sars cov 2 globally more than 8 000 people contracted sars during the outbreak and 916 died by comparison there were 10 times more cases of covid 19 than that registered globally by the end of february 2020 one hundred fifteen cases of sars were suspected in the united states only eight people had laboratory confirmed cases of the disease and none of them died like covid 19 fatality rates from sars were very low for young people less than 1 for people under 25 up to a more than 50 rate for people over 65 overall the case fatality rate was 11 public anxiety was widespread including in areas unaffected by sars sars and covid 19 have a lot in common but the diseases and the way the government responded to them weren t exactly the same said benjamin who worked for the cdc during the sars epidemic there wasn t asymptomatic spread early on we had a functional test we had a public health system that was in much better shape than it is today all those things went wrong this time he said and turned out to be much more infectious it turned out to have asymptomatic spread you had a public health system which wasn t ready for prime time because it hadn t been invested in conversely he said the response to sars was robust and immediate the who issued a global alert about an unknown and severe form of pneumonia in asia on march 12 2003 the cdc activated its emergency operations center by march 14 and issued an alert for travelers entering the u s from hong kong and parts of china the next day pandemic planning and guidance went into effect by the end of that month when had the actual genetic sequence mapped out and then they made a test for it they rapidly got that test out to state and local health departments they began screening doing surveillance we contained it very quickly we communicated effectively to the public and it worked he said in the case of sars the disease stopped spreading before a vaccine or cure could be created scientists knew another coronavirus could emerge that was more contagious they laid the groundwork for developing the covid 19 vaccines we have now how it ended died out after being controlled by public health measures swine flu how it started both the spanish flu and swine flu were caused by the same type of virus influenza a h1n1 ultimately according to the cdc there were about 60 8 million cases of swine flu in the u s from april 2009 to april 2010 with 274 304 hospitalizations and 12 469 deaths a case fatality rate of about 0 02 so there were millions more cases of swine flu than there were of covid 19 in the same time period but a fraction of the fatalities eighty percent of swine flu deaths were in people younger than 65 it was first detected in california on april 15 2009 and the cdc and the obama administration declared public health emergencies before the end of that month as with covid 19 hospital visits spiked hundreds of schools closed down temporarily in texas a children s hospital set up tents in the parking lot to handle emergency room overflow several hospitals in north carolina banned children from visiting hospitals near colorado springs colorado reported a 30 increase in flu visits some 300 000 doses of liquid tamiflu for children were released from the national pandemic stockpile in the same month cases were first detected the cdc started identifying the virus strain for a potential vaccine the first flu shots with h1n1 protections went into arms in october 2009 who declared the swine flu pandemic over in august 2010 but like spanish flu swine flu never completely went away how it ended endemic ebola how it started from 2014 to 2016 28 616 people in west africa had ebola and 11 310 died a 39 5 case fatality rate despite widespread fears about it spreading here including close to 100 tweets from the man who would be president when the covid 19 pandemic began only two people contracted ebola on u s soil and neither died so how did we escape ebola unlike covid 19 ebola isn t transmitted in the air and there s no asymptomatic spread it spreads through the bodily fluids of people actively experiencing symptoms either directly or through bedding and other objects they ve touched if you haven t been within 3 feet of a person with ebola you have almost no risk of getting it part of the problem in africa benjamin said was that families traditionally washed the bodies of the deceased exposing themselves to infected fluids and health care workers who treated patients without proper protective equipment or awareness of heightened safety procedures were at risk once adequate equipment was delivered to affected areas and precautions were taken by health care workers and families of the victims the disease could be controlled people needed to temporarily change their behavior to respond to the public health crisis and they did while this particular outbreak ended in 2016 it s very possible we will see another ebola event in the future an ebola vaccine was approved by the fda in 2019 how it ended subsided after being controlled by public health measures how will covid end big picture pandemics end because the disease is unable to transmit itself through people or other vectors that allow the transmission of the disease benjamin said the most likely outcome at this point is that covid 19 is here to stay he said i think most people now think that it will be endemic for a while on twitter hiscolleagues in epidemiology and public health seem to agree covid 19 has a lot going for it as far as viruses go unlike ebola and sars it can be spread by people who don t realize they have it unlike smallpox it can jump species infecting animals and then potentially reinfecting us unlike polio one person can unwittingly spread it to a room full of people and not enough people are willing to get vaccinated at once to stop it in its tracks it s less contagious than swine flu and less deadly than ebola landing it in a sort of perverse sweet spot where it infects a lot of people but doesn t kill enough of them to run out of victims for many people it s mild enough that it convinces others they don t have to take the disease or precautions against it seriously no one thought that about smallpox or ebola in a conversation i had with cannon for a different story in may 2020 she told me if someone were designing a virus with the maximum capacity to succeed it would look a lot like this coronavirus one of the really superpower things about this virus is its stealthiness she told me then so you can feel fine you can go hang out with friends and not obey the 6 foot rule and the next morning you feel like death and you re like oh crap back then she contrasted it with the way we shut down sars the reason we could stop it is everybody who had sars you were only infectious while you were sick you woke up one day feeling like death and that was the day you were infectious infected people couldn t walk among us with this coronavirus they walk amongst us so what happens next in some populations enough people will get vaccinated to achieve something like herd immunity in others it will burn through the population until everyone s had it and either achieves naturally gained immunity which confers less long term protection than vaccination or dies people still die from influenza and hiv in the united states a disease becoming endemic isn t exactly a happy ending we tolerate the tragedy a lot better when it s a disease that we ve seen before benjamin said it is less scary to us based on where we are now i don t think covid 19 will ever go away cannon said we re still learning about the omicron variant early reports out of south africa suggest it may be a more contagious but milder version of the disease though it s too early to say for sure in a perfect world covid 19 would go away entirely with that possibility almost certainly off the table an attenuated strain that displaces the delta variant and turns covid 19 into an illness that rarely requires hospitalization is perhaps the best we can hope for at this point how it ends a combination of vaccine and naturally gained immunity attenuation availability of rapid testing and improvements in treatment for active cases could turn it into what skeptics wrongly called it to begin with a bad cold or flu 2021 los angeles times distributed by

at the start of 2022 most measures show the u s economy is booming with an unemployment rate that is approaching record lows and a demand for goods that has imports from the rest of the world surging on friday the labor department announced that the unemployment rate had fallen to 3 9 in december even as the economy produced a smaller than expected increase of 199 000 new jobs the report came a day after the commerce department announced that u s imports in november had increased by 4 6 over the previous month to 304 4 billion the rising level of imports contributed to a trade deficit of 80 2 billion for the month which is close to the record high of 81 4 billion set in september while a large trade deficit is seen as a negative by many particularly former president donald trump who went to great lengths to close the gap between imports and exports economists say it points to a u s economy that is leading the global recovery from the pandemic induced recession when we do better than everybody else we get a bigger trade deficit said economist gary hufbauer a senior fellow with the peterson institute for international economics us as economic engine it s a popular misconception that a trade deficit is a sign of bad economic times in the united states hufbauer told voa not at all it s an indicator of great times in the u s relative to other countries and that s exactly where we are we re doing very well relative to other countries so the dollar tends to be stronger that tends to increase the trade deficit because demand is greater the benefits of a strong u s economy are felt around the world as other countries find u s consumers eager to purchase their goods china as usual was the largest net beneficiary of the u s trade deficit selling u s consumers 28 4 billion more than it purchased the u s ran a significant trade deficit with other trade partners as well including the european union at 19 4 billion mexico at 11 billion germany at 6 1 billion and canada at 5 4 billion the u s runs a trade surplus with only a few partners the largest is a 4 5 billion surplus with all of central and south america the only other surpluses of 1 billion or more are with hong kong at 1 6 billion and brazil at 1 0 billion job growth continues the monthly jobs report from the department of labor released friday told a similar story of an economy that continues to demonstrate a strong recovery from the pandemic recession the 199 000 figure for the month of december was lower than expected but contributed to an average of about 537 000 jobs per month over all of 2021 all told the unemployment rate fell from 6 4 at the beginning of the year to 3 9 in december not all of the decline in unemployment can be attributed to job growth millions of american workers dropped out of the labor force largely as a result of the pandemic that means that even though the unemployment rate is low there are still about 3 6 million fewer workers in the u s than there were in the months prior to the beginning of the pandemic we still have aways to go in terms of absorbing the labor force and people who ve left the labor force as well as population growth but it s certainly a positive sign said elise gould senior economist with the economic policy institute a washington think tank on a more sobering note the report revealed that when it comes to employment the economic recovery has not been evenly distributed from november to december the unemployment rate among black americans rose from 6 1 to 6 5 the problem is particularly acute among black women who face an unemployment rate of 5 6 double the rate of white women omicron is wild card what the most recent economic data cannot yet tell us is the degree to which the surging omicron variant of the coronavirus has had on u s employment the labor department uses a reference week each month when calculating job numbers and the reference week in december was unusually early encompassing dec 5 11 before the omicron surge began in earnest most of it happened in the second half of the month gould told voa so it s really not being reflected here at all on february 4 when the january data comes out i m sure we will see a pretty big impact hopefully a short lived one but probably a significant impact on the labor market
who joined the protests in solidarity across the country the groups behind the protest had different motivations and the protest changed course over time some of them rallied in support and solidarity of the original protests from zhanaozen others took to the streets to voice the demands of unofficial opposition parties such as mukhtar ablyazov s democratic choice of kazakhstan and zhanbolat mamai s democratic party alongside youth movements such as oyan qazaqstan and other less organised groups and individuals these protesters demanded political reform and the release of political prisoners yevgeny zhovtis facebook in our work at the international bureau for human rights we monitor these protests and we can assess that the massive gatherings of 3 to 4 january were not organised by one particular group the trigger was rather the difficult socio economic situation the pandemic and the ongoing restrictions to freedoms until midday on 4 january the protest was largely peaceful and pressure was mostly registered on the part of the police and security forces this made the situation tense also given that the police the ruling party and the authorities in general have no legitimacy and don t enjoy any trust from the population besides some government officials in the west of the country local governors refrained from meeting with the people at the rallies we saw different styles and different kinds of people protesting from angry residents to workers to looters what can you tell us about the make up of the protest by 5 january there were probably four main groups of people on the streets of almaty where the protest took on a mass scale the first group was the peaceful citizens that had gathered the previous days across most urban centres in the country a second group comprised the political groups that tend to take part in these protests which are generally promptly suppressed a third group was composed of a large crowd of young people mostly marginalised segments of the population that came into the city from the outskirts of the metropolis and from nearby villages this generated a tension along rural urban lines and became evident in this group s drive to loot the city this group numbered in the thousands and tokayev later called them terrorists and bandits but that s far from the truth it was just a crowd like those we have seen recently on the streets of the united states or france the last group which by no means should be considered as unitary or organised is the violent section composed by islamists and criminal elements infiltrated by loyalists to local elites it is likely that islamist groups were behind the burning of government buildings in the northern city of aktobe where islamist cells historically exist the involvement of these people whose objective was to attack the police and steal weapons was visible in the south as well in the cities of taraz shymkent and almaty where several criminal and violent groups possibly linked to the elites operated the third and fourth group joined forces in certain instances especially in almaty escalating the violence against the police which responded with an iron fist
she entered the headlines as the super confident entrepreneur who founded a wildly successful tech company at 19 she recruited generals and secretaries of state to her board her fresh face and long blonde hair made the covers of forbes fortune and inc as the business world marveled at her invention that could allegedly do blood tests with just a pinprick on the finger no more needles in veins elizabeth holmes was just found guilty on four counts of fraud for lying to investors in her quest to raise money for her company theranos it turned out that her blood testing technology never worked here was another unlovely story about the dishonest fake it till you make it culture of silicon valley but the trial took a still more sour turn when holmes tried a metoo defense she claimed she had been victim of an abusive relationship with ex boyfriend and former theranos executive ramesh sunny balwani he took over her brain she implied and forced her to have sex that balwani was 20 years older added to the innocent young thing account holmes also claimed to have been raped as a student at stanford university that was the reason she dropped out i needed to kill the person i was to become an entrepreneur she testified that kind of advice would have made for one strange ted talk suddenly the woman who used her marketing and lying skills to turn a smoke and mirrors invention into at one point about 4 5 billion of stock tried to argue that sexually violent men had ruined her ability to run a company advertisement david ring a lawyer who represents victims of alleged sexual abuse called holmes testimony an incredibly risky move the defense wisely did not call an expert to speak on how such abuse might have affected her behavior as ceo the prosecutor meanwhile told the jury members that they didn t have to consider such factors in reaching a verdict the case is about false statements made to investors and false statements made to patients he said how did holmes do it she had the silicon valley patter down pat she was always pictured in black turtlenecks like steve jobs wearing the same outfit every day fashion critic vanessa friedman wrote was the techie s equivalent of the heroic uniform she built on the tech genius storyline of having dropped out of college like jobs and bill gates holmes had mastered all those concept explaining hand gestures and deployed the big talk catch phrases when cnbc s jim cramer asked her about the doubters holmes responded first they think you re crazy then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world to round out the resume she became a vegan and that s how holmes lured the likes of former secretaries of state henry kissinger and george shultz and former defense secretary william j perry to her board it s how she extracted 100 million from the very rich family of former u s education secretary betsy devos advertisement slapping the logos of pfizer and other leading drug companies onto her documents without their permission helped bamboozle walgreens into entering a partnership a deal that gave further weight to the claims the defense did make a good point in arguing that the investors were partly to blame they had failed to perform due diligence to assess the company s assertions one wishes that holmes had taken her lumps after all with little business experience she managed to pull one over on some of the most sophisticated minds in america and most of those she cheated were rich holmes should have held her head higher playing the damsel who went bad as the puppet of a powerful man ought to have been beneath her dignity froma harrop is a syndicated columnist follow her on twitter fromaharrop she can be reached by email at fharrop gmail com send questions comments to the editors previous next
hultman analysis we ve had very good demand for corn we had a tremendous start early this year with ethanol demand but ethanol profit margins will tighten up with corn jumping higher there s a possibility we could see more demand from china but the ukraine also had a good crop so china is buying from them lately for old crop corn anything above 6 per bushel is a tremendous opportunity for producers to make sales i would not try to play guess the weather in south america take advantage of good prices when they are in front of you on new crop for those who have bought fertilizer early there are good opportunities for pricing up to 25 of expected production if you don t have fertilizer on yet or you are in the western corn belt on the edge of drought i would be in no hurry to price new crop anything in the major corn growing states cost of production should be in the 4 50 per bushel range for high yield corn producers of 200 bushels per acre bpa or more soybeans latest usda 2021 22 projections acres planted 87 2 million bushels harvested 4 4 billion beginning stocks 256 mb total use domestic 2 19 bb exports 2 05 bb ending stocks 3 430 mb average farm price 12 10 per bushel

maples analysis soybeans are on pace for exports meeting usda projections the soybean market is looking good but pricewise even with the high input costs the market is still favoring planting corn at the moment where the split between corn and soybean planted acres lands for 2022 will be a key factor in the price direction hultman analysis very soon we will probably see quite a drop in soybean export activity that probably won t revive until fall because of brazil s harvest becoming available it looks like a 5 billion bushel bb harvest at this time even with the dry weather in southern brazil i m concerned that the usda will have to dial down its export number the upper end of my price projection is usually seen in the first half of the year and right now with weather scares anything above 13 is a very good price for old crop beans the low end at 10 would be more the expectation at harvest if we have good weather farmers are roughly looking at a production cost of 10 per bushel for the new season cotton latest usda 2021 22 projections acres planted 11 19 million acres production in bales 18 28 million 480 pound bales beginning stocks 3 15 million bales total use

acres usda 12 million acres 2022 average farm price projections maples 80 cents to 95 cents per pound hultman 80 cents to 1 25 per pound maples analysis it was a lot better harvest for cotton in 2021 and a lot less abandonment of the 11 2 million acres planted we got 9 9 million harvested that s really good for cotton upland cotton exports remain slightly off pace so we could see usda adjust export projections for 2021 prices are good there s more excitement around it with weather patterns in west texas drying up which could add in more cotton acres there with neutral to tightening stock with ending stocks at 3 4 million bales the average market farm prices should hang around 75 to 90 cents in 2022 23 that stock level should easily maintain the current cotton market hultman analysis i have a wide price range but there s potential for drought across the south this year that will be a concern in 2022 we had a tremendous year least year and we are still riding the coattails of that there will be a lot of incentive to plant but how that goes is another story wheat latest usda 2021 22 projections acres planted 46 7 million acres bushels harvested 1 65 bb beginning stocks 845 mb

dtn s recent national index of cash hard red winter hrw wheat at 7 78 per bushel as of the afternoon of jan 6 is near its highest price in nine years and usda estimates ending supplies of all u s wheat at their lowest level in eight years for 2022 i expect prices to find support at 6 50 per bushel on the low end should weather prove to be more favorable this year on the high end current prices are already attractive for producer selling but threat of drought in the southwestern plains is giving hrw wheat bullish potential early and we can t rule out the possibility of 9 per bushel dtn s national index of cash hard red spring hrs wheat prices is at 9 24 a bushel as of the afternoon of jan 6 down from a 10 year high of 10 37 per bushel in november even though spring wheat supplies are estimated at their tightest level in 14 years it looks like end users are comfortable with the wheat they have secured i expect 9 46 per bushel to be near the high of the year with a downside projection of 7 per bushel should weather cooperate weather of course will be the key factor of 2022 and many areas of the northwestern u s and western canadian prairies are still in need of moisture

a few weeks ago i wrote about arkansas participation in the 1876 u s centennial celebration in philadelphia the first national exhibition in which arkansas participated replete with an appealing and unusual exhibit building the success of the centennial fair spawned a number of regional fairs in which arkansas exhibited but did not have a building arkansas had a building at the world s columbian exhibition in chicago in 1893 that was designed by a woman it is not an exaggeration to say that the women of arkansas stepped in and saved the floundering effort when the legislature refused funding until the fair was practically underway the business and political leaders of chicago were intent on using the columbian exhibition as a showcase to demonstrate that their city was no longer a backwater metropolis but was ready to claim its place as a great american city as was the case with the centennial in philadelphia planning for such a huge event did not get started as early as needed while the chicago fair was originally planned to open in 1892 the 500th anniversary of columbus first voyage it did not admit visitors until june 1893 even with this extra time the arkansas building was barely finished by the opening but not the exhibits in may 1890 gov james p eagle named two arkansans to represent the state as fair commissioners john d adams of little rock and lafayette gregg of fayetteville adams was a prominent businessman democrat and veteran of the confederate army gregg was a well known republican a lawyer of note and a veteran of an arkansas union cavalry regiment two arkansas women appointed to the fair s board of lady managers were also different politically the democrat being mary kavanaugh oldham eagle governor eagle s energetic and shrewd wife the republican was emma amelia edgerton a suffragette and the wife of prominent little rock businessman and union army veteran rollin a edgerton a native of vermont mrs edgerton does not seem to have been active beyond her appointment mrs eagle was active enough for both lady managers in addition to her untiring efforts in arkansas she played a crucial role in organizing the first world congress of representative women which was held in the women s building during the fair as noted by historian bernadette cahill given the limited time frame in early january 1891 fair supporters held a statewide meeting in fort smith sponsored by the local chamber of commerce to hear speeches and make plans one speaker proclaimed that we could not expect non arkansans to know anything about the state when some people residing in arkansas know little or nothing of the state or if they do they successfully hide their knowledge the group asked for a just and liberal appropriation for the fair as soon as the 1891 legislature convened governor eagle asked for funding for the arkansas exhibit the legislature refused the request possibly due to the presence of a number of populist agrarian insurgent legislators using contorted reasoning and no small amount of racist grandstanding several legislators tied their opposition to funding the fair to proposed legislation in congress to designate lynching as a federal crime out of necessity arkansas leaders began raising private funds governor eagle possibly at the insistence of his wife urged women to attend a convention in little rock in august to plan proper representation of the state s resources at the world s fair an arkansas world s fair association was created in december 1891 and a capital stock corporation was established each share costing 2 still fundraising proceeded slowly women across the nation supported the event especially since this was the first national fair in which they were allowed to participate in a meaningful way including having their own exhibit hall and hosting a national congress of women under the leadership of mrs eagle upper class women in several arkansas cities established woman s columbian clubs with the little rock and helena branches being especially active in collecting funds jean loughborough douglass of little rock designed the arkansas building one of two major fair structures designed by women the building s french rococo style was an acknowledgement of arkansas long history as a part of french colonial louisiana it measured 60 by 80 feet with two stories by march 1892 some 15 000 in private donations and pledges had been raised the goal was 50 000 commissioner john d adams used a meeting of pine bluff fair supporters to update the public and begin a renewed effort to lobby the next legislature for an appropriation the 1893 legislature debated an appropriation of 30 000 for the fair but opposition was strong and ultimately only 15 000 was appropriated it came at a crucial point with the opening of the fair looming the contractor who built the arkansas building was still owed 3 700 and he would not release it this helps explain why the exhibits were not completed by opening day finally on june 15 1893 the arkansas fair managers transferred the arkansas building to the state a total of 8 000 was spent in acquiring seven rail cars of exhibit items and another 3 000 for shipping them to chicago with the help of the arkansas horticultural society large exhibits of fruit were mounted including many specimens of apples pears peaches plums and small fruits all of excellent quality receiving extra praise were the apples whose flavor and staying qualities are strongly commended other exhibits included a large relief map of the state a display of minerals including sizable quartz crystals and an extensive array of forest products produced in arkansas the forestry display spilled over onto the grounds of the arkansas building with sections of huge logs stacked near the entrance works by arkansas artists and craftsmen were recognized throughout the building including paintings sculptures and fine woodwork black little rock dentist j h smith father of composer florence price exhibited his paintings a variety of promotional publications on arkansas were distributed to visitors among the numerous state songs written for the occasion was my happy little home in arkansas which remained popular for several years some 27 million people visited the world s columbian exposition during its six month run technological wonders were everywhere ranging from a movable sidewalk to a contraption known as the ferris wheel visitors found many new products at the fair a few being juicy fruit chewing gum quaker oats and pabst blue ribbon beer tom dillard is a historian and retired archivist living near glen rose in rural hot spring county email him at arktopia td gmail com

sunday review vested stock options turning point for vr glasses evil airtags more on stacked frames by graham k rogers tim cook s remuneration is in the cross hairs 100 million looks a lot until analyzed or compared with the income of other executives airtags are also under fire despite the warnings given to those unlawfully tracked not afforded by other manufacturers devices is this the moment that vr glasses take off with meta playstation and apple all interested with apple s q1 2022 figures about to be announced 27 january it is noted that the shareholders meeting a few days later on 4 february will be held wisely online this time a note released by apple this week as part of its filing to the set reveals that the income last year for tim cook was 100 million oliver haslam imore the actual figure was 98 7m but 100m looks better in headlines 3m of that was his salary but the rest was made up of vested shares an individual is given options on a number of shares as long as they stay at the company for a certain number of years in cook s case some of these were for a 10 year period this is to discourage hopping about from company to company it also creates continuity and there is less risk of company secrets being released as might be the case when those worth knowledge of apple s plans is hired elsewhere see below needless to say there were negative comments about this oliver haslam imore for example used raked in his headline apple ceo tim cook raked in almost 100 million in 2021 the sub headline although confirming the main sum was made up of the divested shares added to this with a stock award of more than 82 million made up the main chunk of the money it must be remembered too that in january 2021 when cook was granted the stock options the share price was under 15 it is now 183 and cook s leadership had no small part in that those with stock options at dell were less lucky as the value tanked sean gallagher arstechnica i regard raked in which was used in a summary as well and chunk as negative words meant perhaps mistakenly to put a spin on this the article also mentions that other members of the management team were similarly awarded divested shares as have been a number of engineers at apple recently in an attempt to dissuade them leaving for other companies it is not hard to show that other companies award top management shares as part of remuneration beqom a company concerned with compensation management in several industries says that not everyone will have such packages but those who do are usually considered crucial to the success of the company companies like hp also offer stock options as does tesla google s sundar pichai has a 242m package nick statt the verge with additional benefits that far outstrip what cook had these really are not hard to find if reporters bothered to look somehow it is different when apple is in the frame on that theme in the last few weeks i have been looking at the ways in which apple s airtags could be better used and also the problems with secret tracking i mentioned in particular at the end of the year in this context that airtags are not evil people are following news that a fashion model had been tracked which made headlines on fox and in the nytimes always ready to tilt at apple chance miller wrung his hands in a tweet writing i don t know what the solution to this problem is but it s becoming clear that something needs to change it s only a matter of time before one of these stories ends very badly at least apple provides information to someone being tracked by devices not registered to them which others apparently do not as another tweet in the same thread made clear imagine how many people are being tracked by non apple devices and have no idea it s happening while miller added yeah apple s anti stalking features are generally working as expected it seems like commenting that this event took 5 hours to come to light there may be some need for more information to be made available to android users there are several other trackers on the market as well as devices that may be used by the authorities such as the fbi who need a warrant but although apple is in the doghouse again apparently samsung tile et al do not make those being tracked aware of the problem the best response to miller s tweet was from samir estefan so let me get this straight out of all of the manufactures of bluetooth trackers only one apple alerts people if someone else s device is tracking them and so they need to change them we should be pushing for samsung tile et al to include this privacy measures as a related aside recent comments on the pegasus insecurities on smartphones initially focused on apple because of better logging more analysis showed that android phones were also being attacked but this was not quite so obvious yeah its apple s fault again although let s be clear those being tracked are most assuredly victims it is reported christian zibreg idownloadblog that meta have given up on developing an operating system for ar vr but it is not clear if android will be used another report among several from adi robertson the verge suggests that meta is looking for another os i do not think that ios is likely an acquaintance currently living in the usa has been gung ho for vr glasses over the past couple of years and believes this is the future of computing i have been les convinced partly because of the tasks i use my devices for but have kept a weather eye on developments this is as much because i distrust facebook meta and its use of data as wondering what apple is up to goggles image courtesy of apple with technologies there is often a point at which ideas come together for example while i had been using the internet for a while as a text based means of communication including the early world wide web with the unix app lynx still installable on the mac it was not until mozilla came up with its graphic browser that the whole show took off i hate to say it but although apple had its gui in 1984 i first used a mac in 1985 i was unconvinced about these expensive devices and like many stuck to text based msdos pcs when windows 3 arrived computers became usable for a wider user base it was about then that i switched from dos 6 1 to a mac quadra running system 7 when my last pc died this week a couple of apparently unconnected news items joined some dots concerning vr glasses and this seems to be a moment which will lead to wonder adoption of such glasses when they are released as well as the changes in the meta approach to its xros on the playstation blog senior vp for platform experience hideaki nishino writes it is my great pleasure to start off 2022 with news on our next generation virtual reality system for the ps5 console starting with the official name playstation vr2 and our new vr controller playstation vr2 sense controller we can expect more news in the next months concerning vr ar solutions from playstation meta oculus microsoft and perhaps even apple i tried microsoft s glases at a health oriented exhibition in bangkok a few years back and could see glimmerings of how a hands free approach could help in some situations but neither the displays nor the interface were good enough at that time and i felt disoriented cupertino has been rumoured to be working on a glasses solution for a while one would expect that there will be limits on innovation but that the device would be effective out of the box after the announcement of intel s new processor which is claimed to be faster than the m series chips currently there were a number of comments several made the same points that i had also covered fast yes but the power use far outstrips that of the m1 and power high wattage means heat i have not heard the fans on my macbook pro since i have had it even when working on photo editing that would have had both fans screaming at 6 000 rpm on my previous macbook pro with intel inside a point that i made that i have not seen mentioned yet is that all companies leapfrog each other with technology developments when apple announced its soc system on a chip m series others including qualcomm amd microsoft decided that they would develop similar chips despite ridiculing apple in several advertisements intel mentioned a move in this direction too as what may be part of the development plans a senior apple engineer jeff wilcox has now taken up a position at intel where he had worked before as leader of the client soc architecture team evan selleck idownloadblog reports apple m1 max image courtesy of apple alex coleman on fstoppers a photo site compared benchmarks for alder lake and other related processors using adobe photoshop and lightroom these were reported by puget systems who are highly regarded 11 processors were tested 7 from intel and 4 from amd i presume these benchmarking tests were all run on pcs apple or the m1 processors were not mentioned at all of course the new chips perform exceptionally well but i could not help noticing that there was also no mention of watts although power was mentioned in the article and the comments section also missing was heat i find apple tv somewhat hit and miss with several series or movies i really enjoy followed by a fallow period when little appeals to me there are a few potential winners in the pipeline and coming next week is the frances mcdormand denzel washington version of macbeth apple has finally released a full trailer after a number of teasers but the same black and white theme remains with the tick tock of a slow walk over flagstones enhancing the inevitability joel coen has some good input and i particularly liked the foreshadowing as the door is opened to the king s chamber prior to his murder so the handles are lit so that they appear to be shaped like knives blood will have blood this week i finally finished suits the new york lawyers series that had some mighty egos working with thin scripts there were some bright spots as well as some excruciatingly embarrassing moments particularly with the character louis litt how any partnership could succeed as they seemed to over the years with that many upsets is a little beyond me the consistent high spot for me was at the beginning of every episode with the short extract of greenback boogie by ima robot which reminds me of the woodstock hit by canned heat on the road again released 1968 itself a remake of a 1953 song by floyd jones which was also covered by willie nelson while on the subject of older recordings rusty blazenhoff boingboing reports on newly discovered tapes of johnny cash recorded by lsd chemist owsley stanley the same year cash made the famous appearance at folsom prison stanley was an exceptional sound engineer as detailed on the owen stanley foundation site who had a second string as an exceptional chemical engineer producing high quality lsd when it was legal he may have also produced some when it was made illegal on netflix i also watched and enjoyed don t look up despite its general rejection by critics who clearly did not see the same movie i watched many people have tried to bring ideas to the public sphere only to be rejected by those in positions of authority who are just not interested where i work i joke that my ideas are often rejected only to be taken up 5 years later although apple picked up a couple within 6 months coincidentally see below john naughton the guardian begins a comment on nfts non fungible tokens with references to don t look up and compares it to johnathon swift s satire in which it is proposed that irish babies could be sold as food to rich gentlemen and ladies swift was seriously critical of absentee landlords in a country with a starving populace and the critics miss this seriously understated approach in this movie that has a stark hidden message about the climate disguised as the inevitability of the comet apple macbook air may 2020 first introduced in 2008 a footnote to that comment about apple and ideas in january 2008 i was in san francisco for the second time that was the year when steve jobs introduced the macbook air magically bringing it out of the manila envelope he had carried on stage he also introduced the second version of the ipod touch this was identical to the first apart from the enhanced software which users could download from the music store the problem for me was that there was no music store for users in thailand at that time i was critical of this voicing my concerns to my apple handlers tony li whom i had met several times at product introductions here was almost apologetic saying that marketing were adamant this was the way it was to be done later that evening at a meal for journalists from this region provided by apple i brought this up again and suggested that there was a case for a second tier store that would allow users in some countries like thailand to download apps apple controlled them and i was aware that music was subject to copyright and therefore availability was really beyond apple s control with this second tier apple would be able to collect data from its users names devices credit card information without copyright problems tony seemed interest and said he would pass the comments on six months later the app store came into existence i do not claim this as my idea great minds think alike last time i outlined the process by which andrei duman photographed 2 dozen beetles in exquisite detail using phase one cameras and stitching software to merge around 8 000 photographs for each final image the next day i saw another article from jaron schneider petapixel on the use of a hasselblad h6d 400ms to take 8439 photographs of rembrandt s the night watch at the reijksmuseum in amsterdam producing a 717 gigapixel image when all were combined of 6 6 tb like the comments on the superb images of the beetles my summary hardly does justice to the process outlined in the article by jaron schneider nor of course to the finished task which is to be used in the painting s preservation process graham k rogers teaches at the faculty of engineering mahidol university in thailand he wrote in the bangkok post database supplement on it subjects for the last seven years of database he wrote a column on apple and macs after 3 years writing a column in the life supplement he is now no longer associated with the bangkok post he can be followed on twitter extensions_th

the company s disappointing financial performance is a key reason for its dwindling share price covid has caused significant disruption for the business the pandemic contributed to a 24pc decline in revenue in the 2020 financial year as major projects were delayed in response to an uncertain economic environment this trend persisted in 2021 and caused wood group s first half revenue to fall by 23pc compared with the same period of the previous year more recently its latest trading update included a downward revision to revenue and profit expectations compared with those provided at the halfway stage of its 2021 financial year previously at the time of its half year results it had forecast full year sales of between 4 9bn and 5bn as well as an ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation margin of 8 8pc however thanks to the ongoing deferral of activity and contract awards in its end markets the company now expects revenues of 4 7bn and an ebitda margin of 8 6pc for the full year in addition it now expects net debt to be higher than previously forecast the company forecasts that it will end the year at the same level that was reported in its half year results a further update on its performance is due on thursday in questor s view further uncertainty could be ahead for the energy industry rises in inflation which recently reached a 30 year high in america and a 10 year high in britain are likely to nudge central banks towards a less accommodative monetary policy this could act as a drag on the global economy s growth rate which could lead to further delays across the major projects on which wood group consults higher official interest rates may also inhibit the pace of transition towards low carbon assets across the energy sector as businesses borrowing costs rise in harmony even if the company delivers on consensus profit forecasts in the 2022 financial year its price to earnings ratio of 20 for that year suggests that its shares lack a margin of safety

a few weeks ago i wrote about arkansas participation in the 1876 u s centennial celebration in philadelphia the first national exhibition in which arkansas participated replete with an appealing and unusual exhibit building the success of the centennial fair spawned a number of regional fairs in which arkansas exhibited but did not have a building arkansas had a building at the world s columbian exhibition in chicago in 1893 that was designed by a woman it is not an exaggeration to say that the women of arkansas stepped in and saved the floundering effort when the legislature refused funding until the fair was practically underway the business and political leaders of chicago were intent on using the columbian exhibition as a showcase to demonstrate that their city was no longer a backwater metropolis but was ready to claim its place as a great american city as was the case with the centennial in philadelphia planning for such a huge event did not get started as early as needed while the chicago fair was originally planned to open in 1892 the 500th anniversary of columbus first voyage it did not admit visitors until june 1893 even with this extra time the arkansas building was barely finished by the opening but not the exhibits in may 1890 gov james p eagle named two arkansans to represent the state as fair commissioners john d adams of little rock and lafayette gregg of fayetteville adams was a prominent businessman democrat and veteran of the confederate army gregg was a well known republican a lawyer of note and a veteran of an arkansas union cavalry regiment two arkansas women appointed to the fair s board of lady managers were also different politically the democrat being mary kavanaugh oldham eagle governor eagle s energetic and shrewd wife the republican was emma amelia edgerton a suffragette and the wife of prominent little rock businessman and union army veteran rollin a edgerton a native of vermont mrs edgerton does not seem to have been active beyond her appointment mrs eagle was active enough for both lady managers in addition to her untiring efforts in arkansas she played a crucial role in organizing the first world congress of representative women which was held in the women s building during the fair as noted by historian bernadette cahill given the limited time frame in early january 1891 fair supporters held a statewide meeting in fort smith sponsored by the local chamber of commerce to hear speeches and make plans one speaker proclaimed that we could not expect non arkansans to know anything about the state when some people residing in arkansas know little or nothing of the state or if they do they successfully hide their knowledge the group asked for a just and liberal appropriation for the fair as soon as the 1891 legislature convened governor eagle asked for funding for the arkansas exhibit the legislature refused the request possibly due to the presence of a number of populist agrarian insurgent legislators using contorted reasoning and no small amount of racist grandstanding several legislators tied their opposition to funding the fair to proposed legislation in congress to designate lynching as a federal crime out of necessity arkansas leaders began raising private funds governor eagle possibly at the insistence of his wife urged women to attend a convention in little rock in august to plan proper representation of the state s resources at the world s fair an arkansas world s fair association was created in december 1891 and a capital stock corporation was established each share costing 2 still fundraising proceeded slowly women across the nation supported the event especially since this was the first national fair in which they were allowed to participate in a meaningful way including having their own exhibit hall and hosting a national congress of women under the leadership of mrs eagle upper class women in several arkansas cities established woman s columbian clubs with the little rock and helena branches being especially active in collecting funds jean loughborough douglass of little rock designed the arkansas building one of two major fair structures designed by women the building s french rococo style was an acknowledgement of arkansas long history as a part of french colonial louisiana it measured 60 by 80 feet with two stories by march 1892 some 15 000 in private donations and pledges had been raised the goal was 50 000 commissioner john d adams used a meeting of pine bluff fair supporters to update the public and begin a renewed effort to lobby the next legislature for an appropriation the 1893 legislature debated an appropriation of 30 000 for the fair but opposition was strong and ultimately only 15 000 was appropriated it came at a crucial point with the opening of the fair looming the contractor who built the arkansas building was still owed 3 700 and he would not release it this helps explain why the exhibits were not completed by opening day finally on june 15 1893 the arkansas fair managers transferred the arkansas building to the state a total of 8 000 was spent in acquiring seven rail cars of exhibit items and another 3 000 for shipping them to chicago with the help of the arkansas horticultural society large exhibits of fruit were mounted including many specimens of apples pears peaches plums and small fruits all of excellent quality receiving extra praise were the apples whose flavor and staying qualities are strongly commended other exhibits included a large relief map of the state a display of minerals including sizable quartz crystals and an extensive array of forest products produced in arkansas the forestry display spilled over onto the grounds of the arkansas building with sections of huge logs stacked near the entrance works by arkansas artists and craftsmen were recognized throughout the building including paintings sculptures and fine woodwork black little rock dentist j h smith father of composer florence price exhibited his paintings a variety of promotional publications on arkansas were distributed to visitors among the numerous state songs written for the occasion was my happy little home in arkansas which remained popular for several years some 27 million people visited the world s columbian exposition during its six month run technological wonders were everywhere ranging from a movable sidewalk to a contraption known as the ferris wheel visitors found many new products at the fair a few being juicy fruit chewing gum quaker oats and

it s no secret black looks great on pretty much everything but one has to admit there are times when the non color seems to be used to such an extent it kind of loses its appeal until something like the motorcycle we have here comes along and twists that around all over again for a motorcycle whose production name screams darkness black of course seems like the obvious choice and that s the path japanese custom shop bad land took once more when it decided to come up with a beautifully crafted night train shown for the first time back in 2016 the black joe as the motorcycle we have here is called seems like the perfect monster machine to be lurking in the dark on but at the same time it is a perfect billboard to advertise the shop s custom building skills propped on rick s motorcycles rodder wheels sized 21 inches at the front and 18 inches at the rear and shod in metzeler rubber the black joe is draped front to rear in bad land items the garage is advertising as being one offs up front we get a japanese made triple tree handlebar and headlight further back we re treated to a custom fuel tank and air cleaner while the rear ends in a unique exhaust system and swingarm the fenders that cover both wheels are also made by the japanese garage a few others contributed elements to the build as well including ken s factory who supplied the footpeg or performance machine from where the grip comes from the engine on the night train seems to have remained the stock one and apart from the changes to its breathing pathways it should retain the distinctive american growl as usual bad land does not say how much the black joe cost to put together

by martin cullip insidesources com the u s food and drug administration fda led at the time by then commissioner scott gottlieb published a regulatory plan in july 2017 to reduce tobacco related disease and death gottlieb proudly announced that envisioning a world where cigarettes would no longer create or sustain addiction and where adults who still need or want nicotine could get it from alternative and less harmful sources needs to be the cornerstone of our efforts his plan was to encourage smokers to quit using combustible tobacco either through abstinence or by switching to reduced risk nicotine products such as e cigarettes or heated tobacco on one side of the equation was the intention to strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less dangerous than cigarettes while at the same time starting a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to non addictive levels through achievable product standards this seems on the face of it a fairly sensible proposal to encourage the manufacture of less satisfying combustible cigarettes while making far less harmful products widely available and a more attractive method of consuming nicotine however nearly five years later the fda s proposed policy is in disarray just before christmas the fda granted a modified risk tobacco product mrtp order for 22nd century group inc s vln cigarettes the mrtp order is an enhancement to the already authorized premarket tobacco product application pmta which the fda ordered in december of 2019 this product delivers next to no nicotine but still carries the risks associated with all the other harmful ingredients in lit tobacco meanwhile more than 5 million vaping products have since been banned including all flavors which are vital in helping millions of smokers globally quit gottlieb s envision from 2017 is in tatters instead there is now a situation where a new combustible cigarette has not only been authorized under a new tobacco product regulatory scheme but also deemed to present a reduced level of harm to the user meanwhile and simultaneously far safer options designed to lure smokers away from the tar and carcinogens in cigarettes have all but been obliterated in 1976 tobacco researcher michael russell noted that people smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar and that the risks associated with smoking might be more quickly and effectively reduced if attention were focused on how to reduce their tar intake irrespective of nicotine intake this is the essence of tobacco harm reduction to make nicotine available in a safer form while discouraging far more harmful cigarettes what the fda has now implemented is the opposite it is arguably a regulatory policy of aggressive harm maximization this has come about because the fda appears to believe that nicotine itself is the harmful substance to be eradicated rather than tar and smoke indeed the fda s authorization describes the new vln cigarettes as tobacco products that help reduce exposure to and consumption of nicotine for smokers who use them this is dangerous as the authorized cigarettes are not being marketed as a smoking cessation strategy the fda is instead claiming that continued use of the products will lead to a health benefit which could not be further from the truth the authorization also goes against the 2017 regulatory plan in that the only way that vln cigarettes could be good for public health is if smokers don t use them because they are so unsatisfying and switch to safer products instead but the safer products have mostly been banned while the makers of this newly authorized cigarette including what will be the only menthol cigarette permitted to be sold in the country soon are free to encourage smokers to buy them not to use them for a short period and then quit or switch to something else it is little wonder then that 22nd century group stock skyrocketed at the announcement it seems that the fda has completely lost its way in the years since the 2017 regulatory plan was announced in 2021 rather than encouraging smokers to reduce their exposure to the thousands of toxins in smoke and promoting less harmful use of nicotine the fda is effectively telling the american public that nicotine is the harmful substance in cigarettes not the smoke it is a potentially catastrophic approach and one which should be scrapped and urgently reconsidered martin cullip is the international fellow at the taxpayers protection alliance s consumer center and is based in south london uk he wrote this for insidesources com like this like loading related
across the combined capitals upper quartile dwelling values were up 2 6 per cent in the december quarter compared with a 3 7 per cent rise across the lower quartile and broad middle of the market he said but melbourne buyer s agent david morrell who specialises in securing homes for ultra wealthy clients in toorak and south yarra said there was no sign of any let up at the very top end of the market that s not what i am experiencing we had our busiest two to three weeks of the year in the lead up to christmas mr morrell told the australian financial review in fact it s the opposite is saying there is more interest at the top end it s in my interests to talk down the market but at the coal face that is not what i am hearing mr morrell said vendors are saying this is my price there is no room to negotiate advertisement an ongoing issue he said was a lack of listings a problem being exacerbated by the omicron wave of covid 19 infections there s not a lot happening owners don t want people coming into their houses some are talking about holding off selling until april or may mr morrell said it may well be the case that a slowdown was occurring one notch down the property ladder in the 3 million to 4 million bracket where more onerous lending conditions were having an impact but at the very top end finance was not an issue but rather choice quality offerings and the motivation to sell a lot of vendors are just dipping their toes in the water they re using a listing to get a free valuation on sydney s wealthy upper north shore similar dynamics were playing out said lynette malcolm an agent at chadwick real estate advertisement it s going to be a tightly held year again at the top end she said there are a lot more mid range properties 6 million to 7 million for sale but not many are being tipped onto the market at the high end it s the lack of stock which is preventing areas like the upper north shore from cooling off this grand georgian estate on burns road in wahroonga has a price guide of 13 8m just how strong this market is will get an early test after ms malcolm listed one of the area s historic mansions for sale alongside chadwick colleague william zhang and tim fraser of di jones the grand five bedroom georgian estate set on 5400 square metres on burns road in wahroonga has been put on the market by the directors of china s yunnan tin group the world s largest producer and exporter of tin price expectations start from 13 8 million for the property which was built for dr hr arnott of the famous biscuit family back in 1941 it last sold for 7 million in 2008 advertisement should it attract strong interest it could come close to matching the 15 million record for an upper north shore home a price paid two years ago for 27 29 chilton parade warrawee a nine bedroom mansion on 6400 square metres of land anna porter a property valuer and chief executive of sydney based advisory firm suburbanite said affordability challenges had emerged for those looking to buy middle tier family homes previously able to purchase something in the 1 million to 2 million bracket 20 per cent price growth over the past 12 months had lifted average prices above 2 million some families have had to reconsider their options it s a lot tougher to purchase sub 2 million and get a nice long term family home you have to come up with a bigger budget any interest rate increase could be a trigger for a slowdown in this sector but ms porter said at higher price points it was a different market at the super prestige level it s about supply and demand and there is a lack of supply you need more listings to put downward pressure on prices
so while you rack your brain trying to figure out whether the santa claus rally or the january effect will win out this year consider this us10 2 trillion 14 2 trillion that s the amount of bonds globally that have negative yields what this means for the non bond geeks is that instead of lending your money and having the borrower pay you interest you re effectively paying borrowers to use your money yes that s not normal no one should willingly go into an investment that is guaranteed to lose money the reason this number is important is because it speaks to perhaps the single biggest reason stocks seemingly never go down anymore or not for long if they do and that is because there is no alternative big headwind this alone should support the stock market for some time even as the federal reserve and other important central banks begin to abandon their dovish ways granted tighter monetary policy will be a big headwind but consider that real or inflation adjusted yields are deeply negative and will likely stay that way throughout the year even as the fed raises its target for the federal funds rate at around 1 75 per cent the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note is about 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index advertisement and even though economists and strategists surveyed by bloomberg news see the rate of inflation moderating this year to 4 4 per cent that s still higher than their forecast of 2 04 per cent for the 10 year yield that s a big incentive to stay away from bonds what s often lost in the debate over whether stocks will be able to withstand tighter monetary policy is the reason the fed is tightening policy in the first place sure inflation is elevated and policymakers want to get back to their target of around 2 per cent before it does lasting damage to the economy labour market but the real reason according to fhn financial s chris low one of wall street s most accurate economists is that the economy and more specifically the labour market are so strong the fed is worried that a tight labour market will sustain inflation even though the fed is forecast to raise its target for the fed funds rate two to three times this year and start shrinking its balance sheet the median estimate of economists surveyed by bloomberg is for real gross domestic product to expand 3 9 per cent in 2022 besides last year when real gdp likely expanded 5 6 per cent you d have to go all the way back to 2010 to find the last time the economy grew as much as a reminder 2010 was a good year for stocks with the s p 500 gaining 12 8 per cent after surging 23 5 per cent the year before advertisement while there s no doubt that stocks are rich with the s p 500 trading at around 26 times earnings stocks are always expensive or cheap for a reason and one big reason is the outlook for earnings the s p 500 is expected to generate record profits per share of around 220 this year up from an estimated 209 for 2021 if there truly was genuine concern about equities and earnings power and an overly aggressive fed inadvertently pushing the economy into recession it would show up in the market for high yield bonds and yet the extra yield investors demand to own junk bonds rather than risk free treasuries is lower now than before the fed s hawkish pivot last month and lower than this time a year ago that s a sure sign that bond traders are confident that the outlook for corporate america is bright the amount of bonds being evaluated for a ratings upgrade has swelled to 203 billion the most since 2010 according to bloomberg news this is not to say that stocks will come close to repeating their performance of last year when the s p 500 soared 26 9 per cent to cap its best three year run since the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 there s just too much working against equities for one the bears like to recall that the s p 500 fell 6 24 per cent in 2018 when the fed raised rates while simultaneously shrinking its balance sheet the sell off though came in the fourth quarter and was due more to developments in china than anything having to do with the fed we ve just finished week one of 52 this year sure it was rough but extrapolating a few days of bad performance for the whole year is something that even santa claus would overlook when checking his naughty and nice list bloomberg opinion
you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel what began just a few years ago as an organic gradual and sometimes cautious migration of communications operations and data of various corporations to the virtual world of cloud storage and remote operations has now accelerated exponentially due to the pandemic even those corporations which adopted decidedly measured or even reluctant approaches to the early migratory patterns were forced to forgo any misgivings or operational realities in their blind leap to accommodate the new realities imposed by the covid 19 scenario this seemingly overnight transformation from office based activity to remote work across the globe now screams for the adoption of robust cyber security protocols and therefore is more critical and time sensitive than ever before undoubtedly this unprecedented paradigm shift was crucial in mitigating the spread of the physical virus in doing so it has left many organisations or say corporations vulnerable to viruses of an electronic nature such as malware and ransomware the world economic forum s global risk report for 2021 placed cyber security failure among the greatest threats facing humanity within the next decade the wef report states attackers could trigger a breakdown in the systems that keep societies functioning industry and critical infrastructure which need to be running continuously such as nuclear power plants banking operations intensivecare units in hospitals and cold storages which protect covid vaccinations among others could be potential targets for hackers whether they are small groups or state actors concerns exist that nation state actors will test the pressure points of critical infrastructure through hacks with the aim of sowing seeds of more chaos by disrupting the supply chains during future periods of geo political conflict at such times targeting food and energy supplies of an adversary will be a classic strategy to begin with the hacking of the colonial pipeline in may 2021 which controls 45 percent of fuel in the eastern us led to panic buying of petrol by consumers which in turn escalated fuel prices on the entire eastern coast a month later a ransomware attack on the world s biggest meat processing company jbs shut down 20 percent of the meat supply of the united states and canada escalating concerns about the potential for a spike in meat prices and highlighted food supply as a national security threat calling the past month a tumultuous one for world s digital policy might be an understatement said lt col bryan miranda a security specialist and former indian army officer who served with cyber intelligence acquisitions for the military intelligence and is now the co founder at cipher one of the premier cyber security firms of the country cyber security is a topic that often fails to get the attention of the public until a headline hits about a company that has their personal information becoming the victim of a hack but over the past year a different threat has taken precedence that goes much deeper into the psyche and impacts the daily lives of ordinary citizens the criminals have started to dig deeper into critical national infrastructure and such attacks demonstrate the reach of these events who could imagine that attacking and shutting down meat plants in australia would impact meat prices in north america for years government security specialists have predicted the inevitable cyber 9 11 an event originating as a digital attack that spills over into other aspects of society causing widespread harm to people and the global financial sector fear sells so it can be really hard to know what experts really fear might happen versus hype meant to market tickets to a new security conference or drum up attention on social media towards cyber crimes perpetrated by groups with alleged links to russia or china but there are some nightmarish scenarios that have precedents these are the scenarios that truly concern independent cyber security experts they fall into three common themes physical attacks that shut off or damage some aspect of critical services financial attacks that spin out of control and lead to bank runs and hackers changing data in a way that shakes our trust in the economy and critical institutions in the nation cyber attacks much like the jbs meatpacking and colonial pipeline hacks that cause major disruption to public services have occurred many times in the real world but it is easy to imagine how a similar attack could shut down basic services such as electricity or water supply which can and will adversely affect millions of people in 2015 ukraine s power grid faced massive outages after a cyber attack just two days before christmas in the middle of a cold wave around a quarter of a million residents were left without power in the middle of the winter in the second scenario financial regulators often talk about the risk of a contagion as a result of an attack on banks or institutions such as the national stock exchange the fear is that a cyber attack could create mass hysteria which will send customers rushing to banks in a panic to pull out their funds an attack with significant impact to financial systems resulting in people being unable to get to their money can cause just as much distress to the system as a major network outage imagine a crippling attack that just ripples through the financial sector if common citizens are unable to access atm machines or if credit cards and other banking functions stop working it would be very problematic and create mass panic which may even result in emergency like situations in the third scenario criminals or nation states could also change data like financial information on balance sheets there is some precedent here too in 2015 the international investment bank bny mellon faced a technical glitch that mispriced some of their securities this jammed the algorithms that are used for executing automated trades and the result was a swift 1 000 point drop in the stock market tom kellerman a former top cyber security officer for the world bank and chief cyber security officer of security firm carbon black in an interview with cnbc agreed that he was most afraid of data being altered instead of stolen or lost integrity of data is key if you lose your ability to trust the information that is coming out of the financial sector that is when things can turn dark and very quickly he said it is interesting to note that the us government even ran a training exercise in 2015 called the jade helm 15 it involved four out of the five branches of us military preparing for a scenario wherein the banking sector goes under a cyber attack from a foreign regime resulting in changing or loss of people s financial data still rising from all these digital threats is the potential for better policy and outcomes as the cyber realm has now come from being a world of techies to the world of geo politics political leaders all over the world have stood up and taken a note of the seriousness of the threats posed by cyber warfare the huawei 5g saga is an example where companies all over the globe policy makers and governments especially of denmark india japan and south africa have raised issues about the geopolitical neutrality and the subsequent threat to sovereignty from private corporations involved within the cyber realm in the case of huawei it is alleged that the chinese telecom company s 5g equipment is a vector for the chinese government to stage espionage however several realities exist simultaneously many countries have not issued a complete ban on huawei 5g technology and the company gains more ground by the day in markets where its low pricing is a key selling point yet global supply chain entanglement also means huawei is not the last time such questions will be raised about a digital infrastructure supplier what is needed is a sensible deep but not too generic cyber security regulation on an enterprise level the crucial challenge which india faces in terms of making a concrete cyber infrastructure can be solved by adopting the zero trust architecture the increase in work from home wfh bring your own device byod internet of things iot and hybrid cloud blurs the border between what is on premises and what is beyond the perimeter old school hardened network perimeters alone are no longer effective for maintaining enterprise security zero trust is a design approach to creating an information technology environment that could reduce an organisation s risk exposure in a borderless world in layman s terms zero trust architecture treats all users and all nodes as the potential threat and thus verifies every single point with utmost priority implementing zero trust architecture with a proper devops approach will certainly contain the damage as it tests everything and trusts nothing hedera hashgraph a zero trust network architecture protocol partly owned by the likes of google lg tata communications wipro boeing ibm among others negates the issue with most centralised networks that is a single point of failure adopting hedera hashgraph as a security layer is cost effective easy to implement energy efficient public but privacy enabled solution which can be adopted by institutions enterprises and individuals world over today the likes of nasa standard bank iit madras shinhan bank are already implementing the network within their own information technology environment and even reserve bank of india in a recent working paper referred to the hashgraph technology as a possible solution for all their rotary secure funds transfer and storage needs for common citizens like you and i industry experts have encouraged best practices and a greater awareness of the threats therefore on an individual level to protect your data from cyber breach the advice more or less remains the same do not click on unknown attachments always use strong and unique passwords enable two factor authentication update your operating system and other apps regularly and also keep an up to date backup of all your important files because even if it is not visible right away it appears that ransomware is here to stay lt gen abhay krishna retd former army commander of south western eastern and
