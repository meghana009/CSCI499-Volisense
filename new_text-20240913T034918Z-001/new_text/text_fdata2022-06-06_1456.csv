steve turley left and peter grange have both been volunteering at the carbondale wild west rodeo for 13 years chelsea self post independent every thursday before sundown the stands at the gus darien arena in carbondale fill with fans little cowboys and cowgirls excited to experience a local tradition that has been going on for close to two decades on hot and dry evenings dust envelops the massive bulls and their steadfast riders as they burst out of the chutes during the rainy monsoon season mud flies from under the hooves of barrel horses and their fearless racers whether rain or shine the rodeo goes on the carbondale rodeo started in 2003 and was revamped into a nonprofit two years later to officially become the carbondale wild west rodeo association this year is the 17th season it would be the 18th season but it s the 17th because of the year we missed in 2020 carbondale wild west rodeo board president mike kennedy said since day one the rodeo has been volunteer driven with a group of around 25 people who show up weekly to help out the only people who get paid are judges stock contractors announcers and security organizing and directing two dozen volunteers isn t an easy feat but is done smoothly and enthusiastically weekly by volunteer coordinator melanie cardiff carbondale wild west rodeo volunteer peter grange watches as the steers move through the alleyway before the start of the rodeo on thursday afternoon chelsea self post independent they re pretty much what make it happen we wouldn t be able to afford to pay people a reasonable wage to do it kennedy said i can t stress enough how important the volunteers are without them there wouldn t be a rodeo every week steve turley and peter grange are two of the longtime volunteers who have been showing up to the arena every thursday night to help put on a seamless rodeo for locals and visitors peter grange peter grange has been a cattleman all his life born and raised on his family s 250 acre ranch in basalt he couldn t imagine living and working anywhere else i was literally born on our ranch so that is home he said a lot of people look at the ranch and say we could sell it for millions of dollars but the land is special to us his great grandfather purchased the ranch in 1916 and in 2007 the family put a conservation easement on the land to keep it locked into agriculture this year will be grange s 13th year of volunteering at the carbondale rodeo and he is usually busy moving steers in a constant rotation into the roping box through the alley way and back into the holding pen his skill at the rotation means it often goes unnoticed sometimes i m like air traffic control grange said the way i see it if i do my job right nobody will have a second thought that i m here because the events move so seamlessly from one to the next carbondale wild west rodeo volunteer peter grange ties wraps on the horns of steers before the start of the rodeo thursday afternoon chelsea self post independent grange recognizes that there are nights when he may have to be a jack of all trades depending on what is needed as a cattleman sorting and working with the calves isn t far from what he does on a daily basis i raise cattle so having the ability to go in and sort calves off or if i need to get in there and re tie the wraps on the horns he said some people aren t used to cattle i ll tell them oh don t worry they re not going to bite you if you do it like this i m just comfortable around the livestock i mean i wouldn t get in the arena with a bull that s a different subject grange said with a laugh grange admits that some jobs at the rodeo are more glamorous than others for instance the dally ribbon roping event requires ribbons to be tied to the tail of the calves so i m the one that gets to do that and of course you re going to have to wash your hands after you re done because as the announcer says that s not guacamole he said as my uncle always told me it washes off if you ve got to get your hands dirty get your hands dirty grange is looking forward to getting back out to the rodeo grounds and helping put on a fun event that so many in the community look forward to each week it s fun to come out here and get to see people i haven t seen since last year he said i m looking forward to helping put on a top notch rodeo volunteers are always needed at the carbondale rodeo and anyone interested in helping is welcomed the rodeo always goes great when we ve got good volunteers and we re always looking for somebody who s willing to jump in and help grange said steve turley steve turley grew up on a farm in nebraska and as a little one participated in the little britches rodeo association i grew up in a farm town was in 4 h had horses when i was a kid and was always jumping on some calf and riding it he said he moved to the area 40 years ago during aspen s building boom when laborers were getting paid 10 an hour after working in a factory making pressure gauges at 4 25 an hour the pay increase was welcomed turley spent some time working as a carpenter and is now a tow truck driver he also spent 13 years working as a ranch hand helping to take care of horses on a 2 800 acre ranch south of carbondale that was once owned by charlie thomas he started volunteering with the carbondale rodeo 13 years ago the rodeo has been going on for quite a while but they really started beefing it up about 17 years ago he said they wanted to shut it down but some business guys here in carbondale said no let s get some sponsors and keep it going carbondale wild west rodeo volunteer steve turley walks through the holding pens behind the arena before the start of the rodeo on a thursday afternoon chelsea self post independent turley started out at the rodeo helping move the steers into the roping box after a volunteer asked if he could lend a hand these days turley is the arena director and can be found helping out with whatever is needed i make sure we have all the volunteers in the right spots that work in the arena he said i run the roping chute and kind of bounce back and forth to run the gate for the bull riders just a little bit of everything on the off days turley also helps maintain the pens and chutes and works on whatever maintenance is needed around the rodeo grounds similar to grange turley is looking forward to getting back out to the rodeo grounds and seeing some familiar faces it s a community thing you come out here and you know half the people anyway just from being here a lot of the locals like to come out because it s a tradition that s been going on here for years it s the western lifestyle he said both grange and turley agree that one of their favorite things about the rodeo each year is watching the young cowboys and cowgirls grow and excel in their respective events throughout the years a lot of the young kids the barrel racers the juniors they re so fun to watch to be out there riding their horse the first two or three nights of the rodeo and there s just tears running down their face and they re scared but by the time the rodeo season is over they re out there getting after it turley said watching them grow like that is pretty satisfying visual journalist chelsea self can be reached at 970 384 9108 or cself postindependent com

plus autologous stem cell transplantation and lenalidomide based maintenance conferred a significant pfs benefit among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma however no os benefit had been observed at the time of data cutoff according to results of the phase 3 determination trial presented during asco annual meeting and published simultaneously in the new england journal of medicine source adobe stock rationale and methods we sought to explore the impact of a triplet therapy in a cohort of newly diagnosed younger aged patients and how to best use transplant in these patients paul g richardson md director of clinical research at jerome lipper multiple myeloma center at dana farber cancer institute and a hemonc today editorial board member told healio paul g richardson richardson and colleagues randomly assigned 357 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to three cycles of lenalidomide bortezomib and dexamethasone rived and stem cell mobilization followed by five more cycles of rvd as induction remission therapy arm a compared with 365 patients assigned iv melphalan dosed at 200 mg m² plus autologous stem cell transplantation asct and two additional rvd cycles arm b followed by continuous lenalidomide maintenance in both arms until progression or intolerance patients in arm a and arm b had similar baseline characteristics including median age 57 years vs 55 years stage iii disease according to the international staging system 14 vs 13 and high risk cytogenetics 18 in both groups pfs served as the primary endpoint median follow up was 76 months key findings overall 291 patients in arm a and 290 patients in arm b received lenalidomide maintenance for a median duration of 36 months and 41 months researchers reported median pfs of 46 2 months in arm a compared with 67 5 months in arm b hr 1 53 95 ci 1 23 1 91 they observed a complete response in 42 of patients in arm a compared with 47 in arm b very good partial response in 80 vs 83 and partial response in 95 vs 97 5 among all evaluable patients n 251 those in arm a had a minimal residual disease negativity rate of 40 compared with 54 in arm b within 1 year of lenalidomide maintenance and 63 vs 53 received subsequent treatment twenty eight percent of patients in arm a underwent asct as first non protocol therapy at the time of data cutoff dec 10 2021 arm a had a 5 year os rate of 79 2 95 ci 80 88 vs 80 7 95 ci 81 88 for arm b hr 1 1 95 ci 0 73 1 65 researchers noted grade 3 or higher treatment associated adverse events in 78 of patients in arm a vs 94 in arm b of which 61 and 90 were hematologic p 0001 moreover although 10 of patients in arm a and 11 in arm b experienced secondary malignancies overall 10 patients in arm b developed aml mds vs none in arm a p 0 002 quality of life in patients undergoing asct early also declined significantly during transplant but recovered over time during maintenance we were able to show a remarkable pfs benefit in favor of early transplant with excellent pfs seen for both treatment arms and among the best reported so far richardson said however there was no os difference observed for early use of asct which we thought was important because the data are quite mature os with a median of over 6 5 years of follow up was essentially the same in fact even though in the delayed or deferred transplant arm only 28 of patients underwent asct this suggests that novel therapies being used as salvage are having a favorable impact on the one hand and that there also are other factors influencing os on the other additionally continuous maintenance appears to really matter in this setting with the best outcomes reported to date irrespective of treatment arm looking ahead ongoing research includes whole genome sequencing additional quality of life measures and correlative analyses researchers noted we showed high quality responses in both groups of patients and we saw encouraging rates of minimal residual disease for both arms although higher with early transplant richardson said we also saw better outcome for mrd positive patients undergoing transplant early vs not encouragingly we now have four drug combinations with markedly higher minimal residual disease negativity overall and we are evaluating next how much transplant adds in that setting and in the future whether transplant can be kept further in reserve for a select group of patients conversely should it be used regardless in patients with certain types of high risk disease we are increasingly beginning to see a more tailored approach as a key new direction additionally researchers need to better understand why certain subgroups of patients demonstrated more pronounced benefits he added for example we also saw that among the 18 of black patients in the study whose risk for myeloma is twofold higher than white individuals the benefit of transplant was less obvious he said so for these patients we may be able to conclude that should they and their families not want to pursue a transplant immediately and prefer to keep it in reserve this is a reasonable approach because our data indicate that they do not appear to lose a marked pfs benefit nor any os gain from such a strategy importantly with all of the new treatments in development and recently approved such as car t and specific small molecule treatments we have numerous exciting new options for all our patients and can further tailor treatment to each patient s need references richardson pg et al abstract lba4 presented at asco annual

new york americans at the low end of the income rung are once again struggling to make ends meet a confluence of factors the expiration of federal stimulus checks and surging inflation on staples like gas and food are driving an even bigger wedge between the haves and have nots while wealthier shoppers continue to splurge low income shoppers have pulled back faster than expected in the past two months they re focusing on necessities while turning to cheaper items or less expensive stores and they re buying only a little at a time it s a reversal from a year or so ago when low income shoppers flush with money from the government and buoyed by wage increases were able to spend more freely kisha galvan a 44 year old mother of eight children from ages 9 to 27 was able to stock up on groceries for the week and buy extras like clothing and shoes at walmart for her children last year but without the pandemic related government support and inflation hovering at a near 40 year high she is buying more canned food and depending on the local food pantry several times a week instead of once a week i shop meal to meal said the rockford illinois resident who has lived on disability for the

the winston salem city council will decide monday whether to join leaders from more than 160 u s communities including six in north carolina in supporting a proposed federal fee tied to the carbon dioxide content of fossil fuels under the energy innovation and carbon dividend act filed in the u s house in april 2021 funds collected from producers of crude oil natural gas and coal would be divided equally among u s citizens and lawful residents companies initially would be charged 15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide and the rate would increase by 10 per year treating carbon dioxide the leading human caused contributor to climate change as a commodity just like financial markets do with the fuels themselves would better capture the true economic impact of greenhouse gases said rajesh kapileshwari an engineer and member of a citizens committee that recommended the city council resolution the subsidized first cost of burning fossil fuels does not take into account the costs of resulting air pollution health problems ocean acidification rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases rise in global temperatures extreme weather events due to warming of oceans changes in precipitation leading to poorer food production etc explained kapileshwari a principal with ethos engineering who specializes in making buildings sustainable the energy innovation and carbon dividend act will ratchet up the cost of consuming fossil fuels step by step over the years until we have a market transformation away from the bad habits a real hunger while the legislation was introduced by u s rep ted deutch of florida and co sponsored by 29 of his fellow democrats the idea for a so called carbon tax has picked up support from across the political spectrum as a potentially powerful tool for slashing greenhouse gas emissions the pay as you pollute approach has long been the preferred potential policy for bob inglis a republican who served four terms in congress representing the greenville spartanburg area in south carolina before founding the energy and enterprise initiative at george mason university originally an opponent of policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions inglis said he had a change of heart after interactions with scientists and encouragement from his five children while the ranking member of the house energy and environment subcommittee inglis began advocating for a carbon tax the idea wasn t popular with many of his party colleagues one of whom defeated him in the 2010 republican primary but a generational shift driven by republicans who will have to live with the effects of climate change is pushing the party to address the issue while sticking to its economic principles inglis insisted there s going to be a real hunger among young republicans for answers on how we can solve this and how the free enterprise system can help drive that he said don t count winston salem city council member robert clark among republicans backing the energy innovation and carbon dividend act however the longtime west ward representative has already declared his opposition to the council resolution i can assure you particularly when it comes out of washington if you want to know what s in an act take the title and reverse it he said at a may 16 council meeting that s how misleading things can be coming out of washington i m concerned that this council would even consider voting on something when we have absolutely no idea what it is optimal and equitable while the vote likely won t be unanimous kapileshwari said he s confident the resolution will pass the fate of the legislation itself is much less certain kapileshwari is hopeful he added because assigning a value to emissions would help align the economy with efforts to influence climate change in my line of work the energy costs are directly proportional to the energy efficiency and energy conservation work that happens across all industries and truly across our economy he explained the higher the energy cost the more motivated people are to save energy purchase more fuel efficient cars and higher efficiency hvac systems it also spurs renovations of our wasteful buildings but the most convincing argument for passing the energy innovation and carbon dividend act is that it would have an immediate impact kapileshwari insisted there are dozens of ways to fight climate change including planting trees adding solar panels investing in energy efficiency electrification of cars sustainable land use sustainable agriculture eating a plant based diet and so on he said however carbon taxation is by far the easiest fastest optimal and equitable way of dealing with our climate crisis but don t just take his word kapileshwari added i actually used a simulation program designed by the big brains in mit to come to that conclusion he said nc support north carolina local governments that have passed resolutions supporting the energy innovation and carbon dividend act are asheville

african lawmakers chart new path for continental growth a forum of africa s heads of parliaments a brainchild of nigeria s speaker of house of representatives femi gbajabiamila met recently in abuja to chart a fresh path for a continent bogged down by humongous debt burden diseases hunger and bad governance tony akowe reports one of the objectives for the establishment of the conference of speakers and heads of african parliaments was to help governments across the continent fight against bad governance to this lately is added debt cancellation undoubtedly the continent has suffered a plague of bad rulers while africans heading global bodies have continued to demonstrate credibility and capacity to deliver this has yet to cascade to the continent as corruption insurrections diseases among others have continued to ravage africa and its peoples when the speaker of house of representatives femi gbajabiamila mooted the idea of a conference of african speakers and heads of parliaments his colleagues from across the continent keyed in little wonder vice president yemi osinbajo in his keynote address at the opening forum described the maiden event as a true expression of democracy because it represented the assembly of african peoples representatives at the event osinbajo canvassed a truly african synergy adding that only this could engender strong and visionary leadership the vice president believed that the covid 19 pandemic provided the opportunity for african leaders and parliamentarian to show strong will in addressing the health needs of the continent and prepare the continent to develop appropriate response for future health challenges as the pandemic exposed the decay in health infrastructures across the continent even though africa witnessed far less deaths than other continents he said the covid 19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on economies across the world destabilising health systems upending supply chains disrupting industries and led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives he argued that records available from the world bank revealed that the covid 19 pandemic successfully pushed 26 to 40 million people into extreme poverty on the continent osinbajo urged the forum to work with the executive arm of government on the continent to boost the relatively weak economic situation he disclosed that the nigerian government rolled out a stimulus package of about 7billion about n2 3 trillion to stabilise the economy adding that the implications of the huge deficits from these supplementary budgets must have kept legislatures and the executive awake at night but many realised and performed these hugely risky but historical assignments for him a post covid economic recovery strategy for africa must go beyond efforts of individual countries to forging greater collaboration and integration to drive sustainable economic growth and recovery across the african continent to achieve this he said our parliaments have a central role to play it is to them that the power to enact laws oversee government budgeting and international borrowing belongs and there are many opportunities for their proactive collaborative intervention a crucial concern for all african economies is how to improve liquidity reduce the debt burden and improve our balance of payments positions especially in the wake of the huge damage done to our finances by the pandemic stressing the need for debt cancellation osinbajo said one of the key issues discussed and agreed to at the preparatory meeting for this inaugural meeting was debt cancellation for african countries and this is already gaining considerable traction a practical initiative introduced in the immediate aftermath of covid 19 was the new sdr special drawing rights reallocation of 650billion which was implemented in august 2021 the allocation improved our balance of payments position by increasing the share of sdrs in the reserve assets of our countries thereby providing direct liquidity without raising our debt burdens so i think that african countries speaking in one voice can seek more sdr support vehicles such as the liquidity and sustainability facility lsf a trust for middle income countries multilateral and regional development banks as well as the poverty reduction and growth trust prgt presenting a paper on gender inclusive budgeting and planning in the covid 19 era un women country representative to nigeria and ecowas beatrice eyong said well structured and resourced parliament is essential to a vibrant democracy maintaining peace upholding the rule of law and human rights advancing gender equality and youth participation increasing economic prosperity and promoting social justice parliaments growing legislative oversight and representative responsibilities in these areas imply that all citizens have a vital stake in the institution she said she argued further that there was a strong desire by many parliaments on the continent and beyond to develop their capacities in response to the growing expectations of people for more efficient and effective service delivery from their representatives she said gender inclusive or responsive planning and budgeting can enable parliaments to achieve these expectations and thereby contribute to the attainment of the sustainable development goal sdg experiences from previous pandemics and large scale shocks show that these crises often affect men and women differently covid 19 was not different according to her parliaments have a key role to play in every step that needs to be taken to address the key variables affecting the continent and its people she advocated for strong parliaments with strategic leadership adding that the speakers should enact gender responsive legislations that provide a favourable legislative and policy environment for gender equality and gender inclusive or responsive planning and budgeting as well as women s political participation she argued further that since parliaments should oblige ministerial budgets to provide evidence of mainstreaming gender in their policies programmes and budgets parliaments should follow up through studies carried out with specific grb tools if the needs of the various social groups they represent are being satisfied on a yearly basis have been included in development planning and budgeting the representative of the united nations development programme undp in nigeria mohammed yahya said the global agency recognises the central role that parliaments and houses of assembly play in advancing national development agendas and its democratic values considering the fact that parliaments as platforms of elected representatives of citizens have a critical role to play in advancing people centered development promoting peace inclusive governance and advancing a nation s value system he stressed that human capital development is a process of building skills expertise and innovation that allows the individual to do their task more productively in other words it is the aggregate of investments in key areas such as health education training and talent migration that have propensity of enhancing productivity in the labour market as we all know the citizens that parliamentarians represent are the greatest assets of any country thus they must be invested in order to propagate the development of any nation proffering the ways forward the undp chief canvassed sound advocacy for policies and institutional reforms that position the health sector as a core aspect of social economic transformation in this regard there is a need for parliaments in playing its oversight role to pay attention to incentivising the systems to retain health sector professionals in developing countries and reverse the growing brain drain secondly there is a need for strong advocacy on strengthening the country and continental research and development capacity one such area is the ongoing discussions on the capacity of the continent to produce vaccines and limit dependency on donations osinbajo on his part believes that africa s post covid recovery must leverage the african continental free trade area afcfta the afcfta is a unique opportunity to consolidate africa s enormously large market which will create and recover millions of jobs reduce africa s import dependency boost intra africa trade and exports and strengthen intra africa cross border ties and trade relations the opportunities are simply mind blowing but they will involve the magic word collaboration recently afrexim and the afcfta secretariat working jointly launched the pan african payment and settlement system papss which provides a robust financial market infrastructure connecting african markets the system enables instant cross border payments in the respective local african currencies this is a big boost for cross border trade and will save african economies almost 5billion annually afrexim bank as the main settlement agent for papss provides settlement guarantees on the payment system and overdraft facilities to all settlement agents in partnership with africa s participating central banks papss will effectively eliminate africa s financial borders formalise and integrate africa s payment systems and simply make trade within africa using local currencies easier this is the way to go domestic legislation will be required as time goes on we must anticipate and be prepared to act on these promptly gbajabiamila drew home the need for africans to come together to advance their cause and ensure good governance he lamented the fact that the continent has failed to advance the cause of democracy over the years as military incursion and insecurity posed threats to democracy he said democracy on the african continent was under threat by military incursion in some francophone countries and loss of confidence on democratic government by the people he stressed that even in places where democratic governance is still in place confidence in public institutions has been at its lowest ebb africa has come of age yet there is no gainsaying that we are far from achieving the highest capability across the continent democracy is under threat and in retreat from sudan to mali guinea and chad elected governments have been usurped by military junta overturning years of progress and the hopes of millions even in the places where elected governments are still in charge public faith in the governing institutions is at an all time low when citizens lose confidence that democratic governments can meet their expectations democracy loses credibility and support and begins a death spiral this is the reality in too many places across our continent he argued that africa s destiny is not cast in stone our tomorrow is a consequence of today s choices the commitments we make and the priorities we choose to pursue despite the real challenges and present dangers this is also a time of abundant promise and possibility for us in africa technology has remade our world into a global village where a child with a computer and internet connection in lagos or addis ababa can compete in and succeed in a global marketplace that prioritises ideas and talent over religion ethnicity and tribe as leaders in this new world there is no decision more consequential than investing in africa s young people protecting them ensuring their health and wellbeing and providing them with a solid education upon which to build their future on insecurity he said the present insecurity and the rampaging uncertainty across the continent represent the single biggest threat to the well being of our children like the vice president gbajabiamila said the covid 19 has exposed the dire conditions of our social infrastructure and brought into stark relief the massive effort required to ensure that we are better prepared for next time he warned that there will be a next time he however said that despite predictions of disaster africa for the most part has managed this disease with evenness and the actions of many governments across the continent worked to keep the worst outcomes from manifesting on our shores but there is a lot of work to do he said much of that work will fall to parliaments across the continent he told his colleagues that as advocates and representatives of the people it is our responsibility to set the terms of our national development and ensure that government priorities reflect our citizens most pressing needs and highest aspirations we live in a time fraught with potential and danger and every governing decision we make and every action we take has the potential to substantially remake our world for good or ill this is in effect one of those defining historical moments the speakers resolved that there was the need for african countries to make special provisions in their laws that will tie loans to specific projects and programmes while taking steps to free themselves from lender nations and organisations africa they said must take appropriate steps to develop local institutions and inter african trade enact laws that will put in place serious measures against military intervention in governance on the africa continent they want strong punitive measures for unconstitutional overthrow of governments on the african continent saying african parliaments must stand together to resist military coups in all parts of the continent and jointly advocate for more punitive measures collectively as defenders of our democracies they want african countries to institutionalise mandatory regular reporting and publication of public debt reports adding that there should be legislation requiring approval from the legislature on any borrowing as well as limits and properly documented plans for borrowing tied to specific projects and programmes the speakers also said that african parliaments must ensure proper oversight to proactively reduce africa s debt profile while there should be greater oversight and increased budgetary allocations to ensure enhanced agricultural productivity and building of internal capacity for food production to eliminate africa s import dependency also they stressed the need to develop mechanisms to increase coverage and scope of social protection to aid citizens who live in poverty especially those affected by the recent pandemic legislative interventions are needed to ensure that across our continent we cater to the needs of the poorest and weakest as well as calling for support for operationalisation of the africa continental free trade agreement afcfta to develop competitive regional and global value chains enhance domestic resource mobilisation including effective public private partnership frameworks for infrastructure delivery on debt cancellation the speakers insisted that debt cancellation from international financial institutions is required to enable african countries to invest more revenue in social protection programme while the conference of speakers should press for this as a collective entity they also called for the building of internal capacity and local industries to enable local production and processing of raw materials for export while building resilience against external and internal shocks eliminating dependency on external institutions lenders and grantors president of the african development bank dr akinwunmi adesina however warned of an imminent food crisis saying african countries must begin to produce their own foods and stop relying on imports from developed nations he said many african countries rely on the importation of grains from either ukraine or russia pointing out that the continent has the capacity to produce its own food the russian war in ukraine has added another challenge to what we are facing in africa the dependency of african countries on russia and ukraine the war disruption has added to the looming food crisis in africa the african development bank has designed a 1 5 billion emergency food production plan to support african countries to avert the looming food crisis africa should be decoupled from food import dependency africa must feed itself and do so with pride the economic recovery must be felt in the day to day lives of people the recovery must create jobs and recover jobs lost focus on msmes the recovery must focus on youths and tackle debts of africa the recovery will require close partnership with the executive arm and legislative arm of government regardless of the challenges facing our country be the solution providers drive for an economic recovery that s felt by all while challenging the speakers and heads of parliament to help find a solution to the food and health crisis on the continent he said the covid 19 pandemic affected the growth and development of africa as well the rest of the world africa s confirmed covid 19 cases stand at 11 5 million people with 253 000 deaths africa s economic growth declined by minus 1 5 percent while over 26 million people fell further into poverty with about 30 million jobs lost the trajectory of economic recovery from the pandemic is shaped by access to vaccines and on this the divergence between developed economies and developing economies is stuck developed countries accounted for 63 of the people vaccinated globally africa our continent have only 16 percent of these people fully vaccinated which is extremely low compared to 63 percent of north america 69 percent for asia and so on we must not be complacent the next pandemic is just around the corner africa must build a healthcare defence system this must include development of local vaccines and building quality

the economic horizon for israel is cloudy and obscured local and international developments have plunged the country into a period of uncertainty with a continuous increase in the cost of living soaring housing and fuel prices inflation generally climbing interest rates and a negative may for the tel aviv stock exchange israel is holding its breath for more stories from the media line go to themedialine org israel managed to weather the storm of previous global financial crises both in 2008 when world economies took a hit and during the covid 19 pandemic the israeli economy remained resilient israel is also used to bouncing back from security crises the war in ukraine global inflation and world stock markets plummeting together with domestic hurdles are now testing israel according to the bank of israel inflation is at 4 while it has risen in the past year it remains significantly lower than in many other developed economies the central bank forecasts do not see it rising much higher in the coming years gross domestic product dropped slightly in the first quarter of 2022 and although the bank said the economy recorded strong growth it decided to raise the benchmark interest rate professor elise brezis head of the aharon meir center for banking and economic policy at bar ilan university in ramat gan the central bank forecast for the rest of 2022 may be a bit too sunny the current data is still influenced by the past by money already spent she told the media line but later this year people will see they have less money prices are higher and wages haven t risen accordingly an ariel view shows the the tel aviv stock exchange and the surroundings april 20 2022 credit matanya tausig flash90 perfect storm the high tech is essentially israel s lifeline said dr alex coman head of the operations excellence program at tel aviv university this helped the country through the pandemic when the tech sector was minimally hit dr alex coman tel aviv university while the bank of israel expects the economy to grow by over 5 this year brezis believes the figure while still positive will be lower the positive forecast shows the economy remaining vital thus supporting the rise in interest rates that has many in the public concerned in several interviews bank of israel governor amir yaron said the interest rate will be further increased during 2022 advertisement unemployment continues to be low the budget deficit is low and the shekel continues to be very strong despite a recent weakening yet the conditions for what many economists call a perfect storm exist globally the strength of the economy leans largely on israel s booming high tech sector which is home to thousands of startup companies and many established tech firms the high tech is essentially israel s lifeline said dr alex coman head of the operations excellence program at tel aviv university this helped the country through the pandemic when the tech sector was minimally hit the contribution came in the form of taxes entering the public treasury both from multimillion dollar deals that saw the purchase of israeli tech firms by investors and from above average salaries which pay above average income taxes according to the israel innovation authority in the economy ministry tech accounts for more than half of exports the sector produces 15 of gdp according to central bank data this time around israel will be affected by the global conditions not independent of the world said brezis the international bubble started to burst last month as israelis saw the nasdaq stock market crash in new york they buckled up as the us tech market sees companies laying off workers or completely shutting down israeli companies are carefully eyeing the nearing storm after years in which money flowed easily it seems about to slow down significantly salaries in the israeli high tech sector are more than double the average in the country companies will start looking for cheap labor outside of israel said coman this is already starting with companies outsourcing some of the junior positions at the beginning of may israeli grocery delivery startup avo announced it was firing almost two thirds of its employees and then later announced it was ceasing all operations in israel it also cut back its us activity the decision was made after company executives realized they would not be able to raise more capital in the current global climate avo could just be the beginning it is not the only israeli firm that struggles with attracting new investment as stock markets plummet investors are going to be less inclined to take risks on startups the appetite for risk further drops as interest rates rise around the world this has a domino effect that could impact israel israel also faces a housing crisis with a continuing rise in demand for real estate and a major lag in supply prices are soaring until this year interest rates were low making it attractive to take large mortgages with every rise in interest rates there is concern that people who managed to purchase a home will soon not be able to make payments especially as inflation rises this is a real burden on the israeli economy said brezis but israel s greatest challenge may be its political instability currently governing is a shaky coalition that could fall any day the government is doing a great job on the economy but it might not survive said brezis it wants to take care of issues but it cannot this is the main cause of uncertainty in the country with a fragmented coalition that has lost its majority and has difficulty agreeing on core issues there is much talk of the need for further reforms but little action it is very complicated to pass laws to change regulations said coman the strength of the israeli economy leaves room for optimism regarding its ability to weather the global storm however this immunity will remain provisional especially if conditions worsen

the company is among the first utilities in the united states to produce zero carbon hydrogen for blending with its natural gas supply minneapolis june 3 2022 prnewswire centerpoint energy nyse cnp today announced that its green hydrogen project in minneapolis is operational the project uses renewable electricity to safely split hydrogen from water and the zero carbon hydrogen is then blended at low concentrations with natural gas in the utility s local distribution system centerpoint energy is one of the first natural gas utilities in the united states to produce and add green hydrogen to its distribution system because there are no carbon emissions from either its production or end use green hydrogen has the potential to be an important zero carbon supplement to conventional natural gas centerpoint energy is minnesota s largest natural gas utility serving approximately 900 000 residential and business customers in the state the green hydrogen project is located on existing company property near downtown minneapolis the system was designed and packaged by a minnesota company and the major equipment for the project was made in the u s centerpoint energy is committed to evaluating innovative solutions that reduce carbon emissions and advance a clean energy future said scott doyle executive vice president utility operations with this pilot project we are exploring the potential of green hydrogen as a safe zero carbon energy resource that can be delivered through our local gas distribution systems to benefit both our customers and the environment the primary goal of the pilot project is to gain operational experience with the technology for making green hydrogen and how it can be integrated most effectively into the local natural gas distribution system to lower the carbon content of delivered energy the project s one megawatt electrolyzer is powered by renewable electricity and can produce up to 60 dekatherms 432 kilograms of hydrogen gas per day using approximately two gallons of water per minute the water is sourced from the municipal water supply and highly purified before it enters the hydrogen production system the green hydrogen produced by the system is added in low concentrations up to five percent to the natural gas in a low pressure section of centerpoint energy s local distribution pipeline system as a substitute for natural gas that would otherwise be used the green hydrogen is expected to avoid approximately 1 200 tons of co2 emissions per year in 2021 centerpoint energy successfully sought passage of the natural gas innovation act a landmark new energy law in minnesota that will allow the utility to invest further in innovative clean energy resources and technologies to reduce emissions including green hydrogen and renewable natural gas later this year the utility expects to submit its first innovation plan under the new law for review and approval by the minnesota public utilities commission last year

sales declines in the latest quarter noting cutbacks in items like furniture we are now in a new chapter where high inflation is greatly limiting the ability of consumers to make discretionary purchases especially of high ticket items big lots ceo and president bruce k thorn told analysts late last month we know that many americans now are once again living paycheck to paycheck the pullback among low income shoppers has not affected overall spending which is still up in april the government said retail sales outpaced inflation for a fourth straight month a reassuring sign that consumers the primary drivers of america s economy are still providing vital support and helping ease concerns that a recession might be near but analysts believe even affluent shoppers could retrench if the stock market continues to weaken marshal cohen chief industry advisor at market research firm the npd group inc said the stock market affects higher income shoppers psychologically and more losses on paper could make them cut back the spending mood has shifted from last october and november when the fed conducted a survey and found that almost eight in 10 adults were either doing okay or living comfortably when it came to their finances in 2021 the highest proportion to say so since the survey began in 2013 for those earning less than 25 000 the proportion that said they were doing at least okay jumped to 53 from 40 but inflation has taken a bigger bite out of personal budgets and wiped away some of the wage gains especially for those who earn less the national average cost of a gallon of gas for example has jumped to 4 76 from 4 20 a month ago and a painful 56 from a year earlier according to aaa at the northern illinois food bank which feeds people in 13 counties including galvan and her family the average monthly number of visits grew to more than 400 000 in the february through april period from 311 000 in the july through september period according to president and ceo julie yurko across the economy median wages jumped 6 in april from a year earlier according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta but even though that was the largest increase since 1990 it was still below the inflation rate of 8 3 meanwhile the poorest one fifth of americans have exhausted the savings they d built up during the pandemic in part through stimulus checks child tax credit payments and higher wages according to calculations by jeffries an investment bank americans bank accounts the other four fifths of u s households are still sitting on a large stockpile of additional savings since the pandemic with much of that held by the top fifth inflation is playing out differently within businesses that cater to shoppers with varying income levels michelle gass ceo of kohl s said some shoppers are trading up to premium brands like tommy hilfiger and calvin klein while others are going to lower price store labels macy s boosted its annual outlook based on the spending habits of its wealthier shoppers but its customers with median household income of 75 000 and below are switching more to its off price brand the current environment is making it difficult for retailers to pass on higher costs macy s for instance got pushback after raising prices on some casual clothing items and home accessories we re definitely seeing some balk at some of the prices macy s ceo jeff gennette recently told analysts on the company s earnings call we ve made adjustments there for the northern illinois food bank like many food banks food costs are spiking amid dwindling donations inflation and rising food costs mean the food bank has to make tough choices about our budget yurko said what foods can we provide consistently and what foods can we only provide if they are donated

new york ap americans at the low end of the income rung are once again struggling to make ends meet a confluence of factors the expiration of federal stimulus checks and surging inflation on staples like gas and food are driving an even bigger wedge between the haves and have nots while wealthier shoppers continue to splurge low income shoppers have pulled back faster than expected in the past two months they re focusing on necessities while turning to cheaper items or less expensive stores and they re buying only a little at a time it s a reversal from a year or so ago when low income shoppers flush with money from the government and buoyed by wage increases were able to spend more freely kisha galvan a 44 year old mother of eight children from ages 9 to 27 was able to stock up on groceries for the week and buy extras like clothing and shoes at walmart for her children last year but without the pandemic related government support and inflation hovering at a near 40 year high she is buying more canned food and depending on the local food pantry several times a week instead of once a week i shop meal to meal said the rockford illinois resident who has lived on disability for the past 15 years before we didn t have to worry about what we were going to get we just go get it the deep divide in spending was reflected in the latest round of quarterly earnings for retailers at the high end of the spectrum nordstrom and ralph lauren reported stronger than expected sales as their well heeled shoppers returned to pre pandemic routines lululemon also reported strong quarterly sales of its pricey athletic wear but on the other end walmart s customers are switching to cheaper lunch meats and half gallons of milk from full gallons kohl s a mid priced department store said its customers were spending less on each visit and gap slashed its annual financial outlook specifically citing the strain from inflation at its low price old navy chain both dollar tree and dollar general which historically benefit from shoppers trading down during difficult economic times raised their sales outlooks last month meanwhile discounter big lots suffered steep sales declines in the latest quarter noting cutbacks in items like furniture we are now in a new chapter where high inflation is greatly limiting the ability of consumers to make discretionary purchases especially of high ticket items big lots ceo and president bruce k thorn told analysts late last month we know that many americans now are once again living paycheck to paycheck the pullback among low income shoppers has not affected overall spending which is still up in april the government said retail sales outpaced inflation for a fourth straight month a reassuring sign that consumers the primary drivers of america s economy are still providing vital support and helping ease concerns that a recession might be near but analysts believe even affluent shoppers could retrench if the stock market continues to weaken marshal cohen chief industry advisor at market research firm the npd group inc said the stock market affects higher income shoppers psychologically and more losses on paper could make them cut back the spending mood has shifted from last october and november when the fed conducted a survey and found that almost eight in 10 adults were either doing okay or living comfortably when it came to their finances in 2021 the highest proportion to say so since the survey began in 2013 for those earning less than 25 000 the proportion that said they were doing at least okay jumped to 53 from 40 but inflation has taken a bigger bite out of personal budgets and wiped away some of the wage gains especially for those who earn less the national average cost of a gallon of gas for example has jumped to 4 76 from 4 20 a month ago and a painful 56 from a year earlier according to aaa at the northern illinois food bank which feeds people in 13 counties including galvan and her family the average monthly number of visits grew to more than 400 000 in the february through april period from 311 000 in the july through september period according to president and ceo julie yurko across the economy median wages jumped 6 in april from a year earlier according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta but even though that was the largest increase since 1990 it was still below the inflation rate of 8 3 meanwhile the poorest one fifth of americans have exhausted the savings they d built up during the pandemic in part through stimulus checks child tax credit payments and higher wages according to calculations by jeffries an investment bank americans bank accounts the other four fifths of u s households are still sitting on a large stockpile of additional savings since the pandemic with much of that held by the top fifth inflation is playing out differently within businesses that cater to shoppers with varying income levels michelle gass ceo of kohl s said some shoppers are trading up to premium brands like tommy hilfiger and calvin klein while others are going to lower price store labels macy s boosted its annual outlook based on the spending habits of its wealthier shoppers but its customers with median household income of 75 000 and below are switching more to its off price brand the current environment is making it difficult for retailers to pass on higher costs macy s for instance got pushback after raising prices on some casual clothing items and home accessories we re definitely seeing some balk at some of the prices macy s ceo jeff gennette recently told analysts on the company s earnings call we ve made adjustments there for the northern illinois food bank like many food banks food costs are spiking amid dwindling donations inflation and rising food costs mean the food bank has to make tough choices about our budget yurko said what foods can we provide consistently and what foods can we only provide if they are donated

regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages what can i do abbvie investors may no

russia s national settlement depository nsd which moscow had planned to use to service the country s eurobonds will suspend transactions in euros after the european union added the entity to its extended sanctions list the nsd said on friday earlier this week russia said it was replacing citibank which has stopped servicing the country s eurobonds with the nsd as the country risks its first major external debt default in more than a century last week a u s waiver allowing russia to service its eurobonds in the original currency of issuance expired in response moscow proposed a plan that envisaged the need for foreign bondholders to open rouble and hard currency accounts at a russian bank that would then convert roubles into forex and pay bondholders back via the nsd the danger of default looms larger now the nsd a russian version of western clearing houses euroclear and clearstream has said it will suspend operations in euros it will continue transactions in other foreign currencies as normal the nsd considers this situation to be an emergency we recommend adding foreign currency to nsd s correspondent accounts taking into account the risk analysis of such crediting it said in a statement the eu on friday broadened its sanctions against russia to punish it for what it calls a special military operation in ukraine that started on feb 24 targeting individuals russia s oil exports and major banks neither the nsd nor the finance ministry replied to reuters requests for a comment on eu sanctions analysts have said the sanctions would block nsd s accounts in euros as well as in euroclear and clearstream and will also make it impossible to service forex denominated bonds issued by the state and russian companies there were hopes that the euroclear nsd bridge could be renewed but in current circumstances this will be impossible until after sanctions are lifted or special waivers are granted dmitry polevoy head of investment at lockoinvest said the nsd holds 70 trillion roubles 1 12 trillion worth of client assets including 9 trillion roubles of foreign securities such as eurobonds linked to the russian state russia has around 40 billion of international bonds outstanding on which just under 2 billion of payments are due before the end of the year moscow has repeatedly said that it has cash and is willing to pay blaming the united states and europe for artificially putting it on the verge of its first default on international bonds since the bolshevik revolution more than a century ago this makes it impossible to sell foreign stocks held at the nsd but given that the nsd and euroclear have suspended cooperation earlier some investors were unable to make any deals anyway promsvyazbank said in a note source reuters

protocols finished another bumpy week of increased regulation and scrutiny the protocols that peg a digital asset to a fiat currency commodity or a mathematical formula based on some group of assets have been on the defensive since the collapse of the terrausd stablecoin ust token in early may observers of stablecoins which are supposed to be lower risk than other digital assets anticipated the extra attention particularly for algorithm based stablecoins such as ust on friday japan s parliament passed a legal framework around stablecoins to protect investors making the country one of the first first major economies to pass a stablecoin specific law the legislation which goes into effect in a year clarifies the definition of stablecoins as digital money that must be linked to the yen or another legal tender and guarantees holders the right to redeem them at face value the bill does not address existing asset backed or algorithmic stablecoins only licensed banks registered money transfer agents and trust companies can now issue stablecoins although japanese exchanges do not list them the law followed less than two weeks after a report in the korea times that south korean financial authorities would introduce measures to hold crypto exchanges to greater scrutiny following the implosion of ust and the luna token behind it a two day national assembly emergency seminar to discuss the debacle which may have victimized about 280 000 south koreans considered the role of exchanges and law enforcement among other topics we need to make exchanges play their proper role and toward that end it is crucial for watchdogs to supervise them thoroughly rep sung il jong of the ruling people power party said when exchanges violate rules they should be held legally responsible to ensure that the market functions well without any troubles the country s financial services commission plans to build close ties with law enforcers to monitor any illegal acts in the industry and protect investors rights said its vice chair kim so young technician s take bitcoin weighed down by 34k resistance support at 20k 25k bitcoin btc continues to face strong resistance at its 50 day moving average which currently sits at 34 000 the cryptocurrency has been anchored to the 30 000 price level over the past two weeks absorbing a majority of trading volume that could point to volatile price moves later this month on the daily chart bitcoin s relative strength index rsi is stuck below the 50 neutral mark which indicates slowing momentum behind the recent upswing in price the persistent decline in momentum means btc s six month downtrend remains intact the weekly rsi is the most oversold since march 2020 which preceded an uptrend in price this time however upside appears to be limited because of negative long term momentum signals still over the short term btc could stabilize above the 20 000 25 000 support zone the 200 week moving average currently at 22 179 is another gauge of long term trend support btc is on watch for a countertrend bullish signal per the demark indicators which could appear over the next two weeks that could pave the way for a short term price bounce which would delay additional breakdowns on the chart upside moves could be fleeting however with secondary support at 17 673 providing a more stable ground for capitulation important

two partial responses observed in heavily pre treated er breast cancer patients one ongoing cohort in er breast cancer has been expanded and new expansion cohort planned in er breast cancer patients with cyclin d amplification management and key opinion leaders to present results and provide update on expanded development of zotatifin in investor call on june 5th at 7 p m et 6 p m ct san diego and redwood city calif june 05 2022 globe newswire effector therapeutics inc nasdaq eftr a leader in the development of selective translation regulator inhibitors stris for the treatment of cancer today reported positive interim results of the company s ongoing phase 1 2 clinical trial of eif4a inhibitor zotatifin in patients with solid tumors that showed treatment was generally well tolerated resulted in suppression of multiple oncogenic drivers and demonstrated initial signals of clinical activity the interim data was presented today at the 2022 asco annual meeting in a poster entitled first in human phase 1 2 dose escalation and expansion study evaluating first in class eif4a inhibitor zotatifin in patients with solid tumors by funda meric bernstam m d chair of investigational cancer therapeutics and the nellie b connally chair in breast cancer at the university of texas md anderson cancer center as of the cutoff date of march 4 2022 interim results showed that zotatifin was generally well tolerated treatment emergent adverse events teaes related to zotatifin were mostly mild readily managed and reversible and included fatigue anemia diarrhea vomiting and nausea in the 25 patients who received the recommended phase 2 dose none exhibited zotatifin related grade 3 4 or 5 teaes in part 2 of the trial early signals of clinical activity were observed in two patients with breast cancer one patient with amplified cyclin d1 and an esr1 mutation who had progressed on prior treatment with fulvestrant experienced a confirmed partial response when zotatifin was combined with fulvestrant a second partial response which was awaiting confirmatory scan at the time of data analysis was observed with the combination of zotatifin fulvestrant and abemaciclib in a patient with pik3ca mutations both patients were heavily pretreated for metastatic disease having failed multiple lines of therapy prior to trial enrollment the low emergence of adverse events with this entirely new class of medicines is a very important point to highlight said dr meric bernstam coupled with the initial signals of activity these early results are encouraging for further development of zotatifin especially in er breast cancer in a pharmacodynamic analysis measuring protein expression modulation of protein translation by zotatifin was highly selective with less than 1 of protein expression altered patients treated with zotatifin demonstrated reductions in the expression of key oncogenic drivers including cyclin e1 and bcl 2 the most dramatic reductions in expression of these two proteins were seen in patients who showed the highest levels of expression prior to treatment with zotatifin we are very encouraged by these interim data analyses as they provide evidence that zotatifin has the potential to suppress a network of cancer driving proteins and still remain generally well tolerated most cancers require suppression at multiple points in a complex network of cancer drivers to effectively manage disease we saw encouraging results for down regulation of a number of oncogenic drivers which not only provides clinical proof of mechanism but also paves the way for how to combine zotatifin with other medicines said steve worland ph d president and chief executive officer of effector notably based on the evidence we have advanced to stage 2 of a simon 2 stage trial design in the cohort of patients treated with zotatifin and fulvestrant after progressing on a cdk4 6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy and plan to open a new cohort in patients with er breast with cyclin d1 amplification we look forward to generating more data in this cohort as the resulting dataset in a defined patient population could support a potential path to registration we anticipate reporting topline data from our current expansion cohorts by the end of 2022 as well as initial overall response rate data from the cyclin d1 amplified er breast cancer cohort in the first half of 2023 based on zotatifin s mechanism and results observed to date the company has expanded the cohort evaluating zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant in er breast cancer patients to 18 patients a new cohort evaluating zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant in er breast cancer patients with cyclin d1 amplification is being planned conference call effector management will host a

had enrolled a total of 54 patients with advanced solid tumors as of the cut off date of march 4 2022 37 in the phase 1 dose escalation portion and 17 in the phase 2 expansion portion of the trial the primary objectives of part one of the trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of zotatifin as a monotherapy in patients with defined advanced solid tumors determine the recommended phase 2 dose for zotatifin as a monotherapy and to evaluate the pk profile in part 2 the primary objective is to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of zotatifin as a monotherapy and as combination therapy in patients with defined advanced solid tumors about zotatifin eft226 zotatifin is a potent and sequence selective small molecule inhibitor of eif4a that is designed to supress expression of a network of cancer driving proteins including cyclins d and e cdks 2 4 and 6 and select rtks as well as kras we are currently investigating zotatifin in ongoing clinical trials for solid tumors and as

there are some days when i know what my topic will be what it must be these are times in which the universe gives the very appearance of handing to me my topic for the day on the proverbial silver platter with a giant hand descending from the clouds pointing at it and saying blog about this you idiot usually it s because a study is released or something happens or a quack writes something that cries out for rebuttal whatever it is it s big and it s unavoidable for me at least this is one of those days the reason it s one of those days is because just last friday as i was driving to work i heard a news story on npr about a study that had just been released in the journal of pediatrics the story as it was reported noted that the study being discussed looked specifically at a certain antivaccine trope and found for yet the umpteenth time that vaccines are not correlated with an increased risk of autism normally the news that a study had once again failed to find a link between vaccines and autism would be as surprising as a study finding that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west or finding that water boils at 100 c at sea level at this point the evidence is so utterly overwhelming that there is not a whiff of a hint of a whisper of a correlation between vaccines and autism that it has become irritating that antivaccine activists keep pressuring scientists to do the same study over and over again coming up with the same results over and over again and then seeing antivaccinationists fail to believe those same results over and over again apparently antivaccine activists think that if the same sorts of studies are done enough times there will be a positive result implicating vaccines as a risk factor for or contributing cause to autism by sheer random chance alone this might happen someday given the definition of statistical significance but so far there has not been a single large well designed epidemiological study by reputable researchers that has found a link then of course antivaccinationists couldn t resist weighing in on friday and saturday thus providing me with even more fodder for this post at that point the die was cast the final nail in the coffin of too many too soon its utterly expected result notwithstanding what makes the study reported on by npr interesting is that it looked specifically at a common antivaccine trope that started popping up a lot five or six years ago to my knowledge although it had been percolating for a couple of years before that this trope had its big debut when jenny mccarthy led an antivaccine protest march on washington dc in june 2008 coupled with the delightfully orwellian slogan green our vaccines quite honestly i had to hand it to the antivaccinationists too many too soon and green our vaccines were great slogans they were pithy simple and communicated the message that vaccines were toxic and that they shouldn t be given to young children from a scientific standpoint they were horribly wrong but from a propaganda standpoint they were brilliant not the least of which because too many too soon was much more difficult to falsify than other antivaccine tropes such as the roundly falsified claims that the mercury containing preservative thimerosal causes or contributes to autism that vaccines are loaded with toxins and the idea popularized by the now disgraced andrew wakefield that the mmr triple vaccine could result in autistic enterocolitis and autism itself this study looks right at the too many too soon hypothesis and finds zero evidence to suggest that there is anything to it as i said this could be completely predicted beforehand but antivaccinationists keep forcing scientists to do the same study over and over and over again in different ways they re still not convinced but we can always hope to convince the fence sitters the study itself was carried out by frank destefano cristofer s price and eric s weintraub from the cdc and abt associates and the complete study increasing exposure to antibody stimulating proteins and polysaccharides in vaccines is not associated with risk of autism is available to all online which is a lovely thing it also used publicly available data from a previous study published in 2010 that looked for associations between mercury exposure in thimerosal containing vaccines and autism by price et al the previous study price et al and this study destefano et al were both based on the same case control study a case control study is a type of retrospective study in which subjects with a certain condition cases are matched as closely as possible with subjects without the condition under study controls and the two groups compared to look for factors that correlate with the condition in the cases that s how an earlier study from 2007 that failed to find a link between thimerosal containing vaccines thompson et al was performed and that s how price et al and destefano et al were also performed being retrospective such a study can never be quite as rigorous as a randomized controlled trial or a prospective cohort study however given that thimerosal has already been removed from all infant vaccines other than the flu vaccine and there is a thimerosal free alternative and more importantly that it would be unethical to conduct a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial this sort of trial is the best evidence that we will be able to come up with i think it s worth briefly recapping the design of this study so that you don t have to spend too much time clicking on previous links basically the two groups that ended up being studied consisted of 256 children with asd and 752 matched controls the authors justify the study thusly the initial concerns that vaccines may cause autism were related to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine and thimerosal containing vaccines in 2004 a comprehensive review by the institute of medicine concluded that the evidence favors rejection of possible causal associations between each of these vaccine types and autism nonetheless concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persist with the latest concern centering on the number of vaccines administered to infants and young children a recent survey found that parents top vaccine related concerns included administration of too many vaccines during the first 2 years of life administration of too many vaccines in a single doctor visit and a possible link between vaccines and learning disabilities such as autism all of the foregoing concerns were reported by 30 36 of all survey respondents and were reported by 55 90 of parents who indicated that their children would receive some but not all of the vaccines on the recommended schedule another recent survey found that more than 10 of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations with most believing that delaying vaccine doses is safer than providing them in accordance with the centers for disease control and prevention s recommended vaccination schedule so basically this research was driven not so much by a scientific question as by a social imperative scientists have long known that there is no compelling rigorous evidence suggesting that vaccines cause autism or that too many too soon can result in or predispose to autism sadly it can t be repeated too many times as i m repeating here that antivaccinationists force scientists to keep reinventing the wheel in order to try to reassure the parents whose doubts are stoked by the misinformation and pseudoscience promoted by antivaccinationists before i get to the results in detail you already know the results in general i ll also reiterate a point i made when discussing price et al that this study had the strength that derives from the fact that the case and control populations were collected from three managed care organizations mcos that participate in the vaccine safety datalink a collaborative effort between the cdc s immunization safety office and nine mcos that was established in 1990 to monitor immunization safety and address gaps in scientific knowledge about rare and serious events that can occur after immunization the vsd uses a large linked database using administrative data sources at each mco from which data are gathered on vaccination vaccine type date of vaccination concurrent vaccinations medical outcomes outpatient visits inpatient visits urgent care visits birth data and census data consequently because of the detailed records maintained by these mcos investigators using vsd data are able to develop a detailed and accurate estimate of vaccine exposure from the computerized databases maintained by the mcos as well as the medical records of the cases controls all supplemented by standardized interviews with the parents in addition outcomes have been measured in clinical settings using standardized assessment tools in price et al the most up to date standardized assessment tools used to diagnose asds were used to identify cases and the same is true in destefano et al in addition in order to make sure that the controls did not include children with undiagnosed asd which would tend to decrease any apparent differences between the groups controls the lifetime form of the social communication questionnaire was administered as part of the interview with each mother for children who had indications of any neurodevelopmental difficulties several children were excluded from the control group in this manner finally the detailed medical records and databases maintained by the mcos allowed for the detailed determination of and control for many potential confounders another major strength of destefano et al is how the investigators chose to compare vaccine exposures basically they estimated total antigen exposure rather than just counting the number of vaccines they also looked at total antigen exposures from vaccines administered at single visits as well as the cumulative antigen exposure we evaluated antigen exposure for 3 age ranges according to 2 measures cumulative exposure to antigens within the specified age range and the maximum number of antigens received in a single day within the specified age range data were collected on a large number of covariates including child and family characteristics maternal exposures during pregnancy childbirth conditions early childhood health conditions and maternal healthcare seeking behavior ie kotelchuck prenatal care index cholesterol and pap smear screenings for those who aren t familiar with immunology an antigen is a substance that evokes the production of one or more antibodies in the case of vaccines an antigen could be a protein or polysaccharide in the case of killed vaccines in which extracts isolated from killed virus or bacteria are used to provoke the antibody response there can be dozens or hundreds of antigens an example is the whole cell pertussis vaccine which is not used anymore more modern vaccines tend not to be killed organism vaccines anymore but rather vaccines made of recombinant proteins protein fragments or polysaccharides such vaccines contain many fewer antigens but they are the specific antigens that produce an effective immune response against the organism the vaccines examined in the study ranged from a single antigen antigen per dose hepatitis b to 3 004 antigens per dose dtp hib using a strategy similar to the earlier price et al study destefano et al examined antigen exposure and compared the number of vaccine antigens to which the controls and the cases were exposed to what do you think they found yes i know i already told you what they found from the beginning nada zip nothing no correlation between antigen exposure from vaccines and the risk of developing autism or autism spectrum disorder asd or even asd with regression the results are summarized in table ii from the paper which shows that there is no correlation between cumulative vaccine antigen exposures and autism outcomes nor was there a correlation between maximal antigen exposure at one session of being vaccinated and autism outcomes this is as negative a study as i have ever seen there is not even a whiff of a hint of a whisper of an association between the number of antigens to which the cases and the controls were exposed and the subsequent risk of autism not only do the confidence intervals for the adjusted odds ratios all overlap 1 0 but they re very tight it doesn t get more negative than this in an epidemiological study leading the authors to conclude we found no evidence indicating an association between exposure to antibody stimulating proteins and polysaccharides contained in vaccines during the first 2 years of life and the risk of acquiring asd ad or asd with regression we also detected no associations when exposures were evaluated as cumulative exposure from birth to 3 months from birth to 7 months or from birth to 2 years or as maximum exposure on a single day during those 3 time periods these results indicate that parental concerns that their children are receiving too many vaccines in the first 2 years of life or too many vaccines at a single doctor visit are not supported in terms of an increased risk of autism they also note considerations of biological mechanisms should be taken into account when evaluating a possible association between autism and immunologic stimulation from vaccines early in life the infant s immune system is capable of responding to a large number of immunologic stimuli beginning at birth an infant is exposed to hundreds of viruses and other antigens and it has been estimated that an infant theoretically could respond to thousands of vaccines at once 15 the possibility that immunologic stimulation from vaccines during the first 1 2 years of life could be related to the development of asd is not well supported by the known neurobiology of asd which tends to be genetically determined with origins in prenatal development 19 22 although possible effects in early infancy cannot be ruled out completely it can be argued that asd with regression in which children usually lose developmental skills during the second year of life could be related to exposures in infancy including vaccines however we found no association between exposure to antigens from vaccines during infancy and the development of asd with regression in other words from the standpoint of prior plausibility there is no compelling reason to suspect that vaccines could cause autism because such a mechanism is not consistent with what we know about the neurobiology of autism consistent with this lack of plausibility the authors failed to find any correlations between exposure to antigens from vaccines and the risk of autism they sliced and diced the data in a variety of ways looking for correlations and didn t find any and their data are in agreement with a study by smith et al discussed by my good bud orac here that failed to find a difference in non autism neurodevelopmental outcomes between children who received all their recommended vaccines on time and those who were late or as i like to view it too many too soon versus too few too late yes there were limitations to destefano et al in that it was retrospective in addition as the authors discussed not all antigens are equal in evoking an immune response some have more epitopes areas on the antigen molecule that can trigger an immune response than others and the study didn t weight the antigens for the intensity of the immune response that they evoke even so the antigenic load has fallen dramatically and this study is based on the vaccine schedule of the 1990s indeed the authors note that the antigen load due to the vaccine schedule has fallen from several thousand in the late 1990s to an estimated 315 in 2012 this is a drop in the bucket compared to the number of antigens infants and children encounter every day as emily willingham notes matt carey and christine vara also agree the antivaccinationists attack not surprisingly even though this study was released on good friday with a holiday weekend fast approaching antivaccinationists were sufficiently displeased that they managed to launch a series of broadsides against the study it s instructive to look at the bad science and logical fallacies that populate such criticisms for instance dr bob sears who is despite his efforts to appear otherwise as antivaccine as they come went to facebook to rant against the study his complaints reveal such ignorance about statistical methods and basic epidemiology that it s worth a quick look i pretty much only have one major criticism of this study you would probably find the exact same results no matter what group of kids you studied pretty much all children in any given span of years receive the exact same number of shot antigens by the way an antigen is simply a protein or sugar germ related ingredient in a vaccine some vaccines only have a few some have many virtually all kids with autism have had the same shots as kids without autism so why would it even be useful to study this you ll get the same results every time whether you study 1000 kids or 100 000 kids they all get the same shots on the same schedule they would have gotten the same results if they d studies asthma cancer or any other chronic problem all this study proved is that all the kids in that hmo got about the same vaccines over that 5 year time period this doesn t give us any useful data on how vaccines would have or would not have influenced the rate of autism clearly dr bob doesn t understand the very concept of a case control study rather amusingly he says that virtually all the kids with autism have had the same shots as kids without autism without realizing that that very conclusion in a case control study would be pretty powerful evidence that vaccine exposure is not a risk factor for autism in actuality though he s misstating the conclusion of destefano et al anyway the real conclusion was that the number of antigens from vaccines a child sees which is a surrogate for vaccine load has no correlation with that child s risk of autism asd or asd with regression but if you really want hilarity take a look at what he proposes as an alternative now if i were to do a study and have several million bucks to fund it here s how i would look at the question of whether or not an increased number of vaccines relates to an increased risk of autism i would take a bunch of kids who had all the vaccines on the regular schedule and look at the rate of autism in that group we know that it s about 1 in 50 kids then i d take a whole bunch of kids who were only partially vaccinated and look at the rate of autism i would subdivide the partially vaccinated group into subgroups based on the total number of vaccines given during infancy i would perhaps have a group that delayed vaccines and hey while we re at it let s really go crazy and find a few totally unvaccinated kids just for fun on the other hand no let s not it would be totally unethical to subject a group of totally unvaccinated children to any type of medical research ok back to my study these data would then give us a true look at autism rates compared to number of vaccines given and the age at which they were given now that would be an interesting study unfortunately it s just too logical it s much better to study things in a confusing and illogical manner so you can get some results that the press can really sink their teeth into as i said dr bob s ignorance is quite striking because that s rather what was done in price et al for autism and thompson et al for other neurodevelopmental outcomes one notes that dr bob also doesn t tell us how he would compare these populations what sort of study would he do a case control oh wait he doesn t like case control studies finding them confusing and illogical no kidding it s very clear that he s confused maybe he would like a cohort study actually that s what he seems to be suggesting after all case control studies starts with the outcome presence or absence of disease or condition and then work back to exposure while cohort studies start with exposure and work towards outcomes each study type has its advantages and disadvantages but i get no sense that dr bob has any clue about when it is best to use one versus the other one notes for instance that sir richard doll used the case control study method to be among the earliest investigators to confirm a link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer while a b hill used a cohort design both produced the same results just from a different approach basically it s sour grapes dr bob just didn t like the outcome of of destefano et al his criticism of the study demonstrates that he has no understanding of the issues behind case control studies and his suggestion of an apparent cohort study doesn t address his rejection of destefano et al specifically the question of why he thinks the results of destefano et al are so flawed that a huge new multimillion dollar cohort study is necessary to address the question of whether vaccines increase the risk of autism instead he retreats to conspiracy mongering and antivaccine fear mongering so is anyone really surprised to see the journal of pediatrics study what were you expecting cdc researchers to publish as study that actually showed an increased risk of autism related to vaccines the cdc would never simply publish such a study i doubt anyone would anyone at the cdc who published such a study would be fired faster than they could sell their pharma stock yawn the pharma shill gambit how original of course the antivaccine crank blog age of autism is very unhappy as well but seems unable to muster any complaints much more coherent than those of dan olmsted who basically mindlessly parrots dr bob sears objections and anne dachel who could muster nothing more than a call for the usual vaxed versus unvaxed study and reinforcing my conclusion that antivaccinationists don t understand even the basics of clinical trial design epidemiology or ethics perhaps the most amusing misunderstanding of basic epidemiology and the nature of a case control study comes from homeopath heidi stevenson of gaia health who tries to argue well i ll let you see for yourself as initially pointed out this study was done on the assumption that there is no connection between autism and vaccinations therefore there was no reason to do such a study why would you do a study on whether there s an association between autism and vaccinations before you believe that there s been a study demonstrating such a connection if this were legitimate science then there d be no reason to do it uh no this study was done to see if there was a connection between vaccine and autism detectable as a difference in vaccine antigen exposure between cases and controls stevenson digs herself in even deeper in terms of showing how little she understands what a case control study is when she writes this study even if well done would be meaningless simply because it jumps the gun it makes no sense to do a study on the relative degree of a potential toxin s effect on autism when no study has yet been done to determine that there is one since no such study has been done that officially implicates vaccines as the cause of autism as explained earlier what s the point in doing a study focused on the relative degree of harm this is pure duplicity on the part of the cdc one notes that sir richard doll s case control study was done before his and a b hill s cohort study does stevenson doubt that smoking is an enormous risk factor for lung cancer no case control and cohort studies are different methodologies that each have advantages and disadvantages compared to the other however if a case control study as well done as destefano et al is so completely negative there is no scientific justification for proceeding to do a cohort study yet that s exactly what dr sears and a homeopath are demanding because they think that a different study methodology will show them what this methodology didn t no doubt if someone did a cohort study of the type they want and it was negative they d proceed to demand a case control study stevenson also tries to nitpick aspects of the study for instance she complains that more controls were eliminated than cases the reasons for this were explained in both price et al in more detail and in destefano et al namely that they were deemed ineligible because they didn t meet the protocol requirements indeed in my previous post on price et al i reproduced the flowsheet that showed exactly how cases were ascertained and how subjects who fell under various exclusion criteria were eliminated this study uses the same subjects so the same flowsheet applies one wonders whether stevenson bothered to look up price et al whether she did or not stevenson appears not to understand the concept of a case control study and how the cases and controls have to be matched as closely as possible for everything other than the condition that differentiates them then stevenson lays down this doozy they looked at the number of antigens given to each child both overall for their first two years and the number given on single days this presumes that the number of antigens rather than the number of vaccinations is the issue it completely ignores adjuvants and other vaccine ingredients including known toxins such as formaldehyde mercury and sorbitol 80 among others so which is it too many too soon or the toxins i can t tell i guess it s whatever argument happens to be convenient that day for the antivaccinationist making it the evolution of the antivaccinationist over the last decade or so the reasons antivaccinationists advance for their fear and loathing of vaccines as an alleged cause of autism have evolved in response to what can be considered the selective pressure of scientific studies it s not surprising that that evolution has involved a tendency to migrate to hypotheses i m being really generous using that word here i admit whose main trait is to become more difficult to falsify for instance back in the late 1990s and early 2000s the two predominant ideas were that mmr causes autism this idea was most common in the u k thanks to andrew wakefield or that the mercury in the thimerosal preservative in childhood vaccines caused autism the favored notion in the u s these were straightforward hypotheses that could be falsified using epidemiological studies of relatively simple design and they were falsified roundly then came the toxins gambit which postulated that vaccines were full of vile substances ranging from antifreeze to formaldehyde to aborted fetal tissue this one was more difficult conceptually in that there are a number of chemicals in vaccines but they are all present at doses that are harmless however saying that was a harder sell and the idea behind the toxins gambit was to force scientists to have to test each chemical each adjuvant each ingredient individually an difficult enough task given the number of chemicals and then in various combinations an impossible task that the task was impossible was the very point of course no matter how many trials scientists did antivaccinationists could always say what about this adjuvant or this combination of adjuvants which brings us to too many too soon it appeared to be a hypothesis that was impossible to falsify but destefano et al came about as close as it s ethically possible to do to falsifying the hypothesis no wonder that all that antivaccinationists are left with are calls for vaxed versus unvaxed studies and pharma shill ranting as i m so fond of saying the vaccine autism hypothesis is not pinin for the fjords it is no more it has ceased to be it s expired and gone to meet its maker it s a stiff bereft of life it rests in peace if antivaccinationists hadn t tried to nail it to the perch it d be pushing up the daisies its metabolic processes are now istory it s off the twig it s kicked the bucket it s shuffled off is mortal coil run down the curtain and joined the bleedin choir invisible it is an ex hypothesis there i feel better now

dr olukayode oyeleye business a m s editorial advisor who graduated in veterinary medicine from the university of ibadan nigeria before establishing himself in science and public policy journalism and communication also has a postgraduate diploma in public administration and is a former special adviser to two former nigerian ministers of agriculture he specialises in development and policy issues in the areas of food trade and competition security governance environment and innovation politics and emerging economies feeding the world in the decade ahead and beyond has become an issue of great concern realities of demographics technological advancement economics politics logistics climate related events and epidemics are becoming more obvious in their impacts on the global food systems to the extent that they cast doubts on the possibility of reaching significant milestones in specific aspects of the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs on or before the end date of 2030 of immediate concerns are the sdgs 1 2 and 3 which respectively emphasise no poverty zero hunger good health and wellbeing respectively with the higher level of interdependence between the developed and developing countries more than ever before a world without poverty hunger and poor health is most difficult to contemplate in the circumstances of uncertainties and heightened risks that emanate from natural and man made causes global crises may therefore not be restricted by national boundaries or north south dichotomy it is now a known fact that technological breakthroughs have led to an ever widening gap between the poor and the rich with the rich getting richer and the poor even poorer on a global scale this impinges on the poor s access to nutritious foods ultimately negatively affecting their health and wellbeing although the problem is not restricted to the poorer countries of the world no place illustrates this crisis in the developed countries better than san francisco a tech city with so much affluence to the extent that many who do not fit into the emerging tech economy after being forced out of jobs had to flee the city or simply became homeless beggars living under bridges and overpasses lately the sudden and draconian lockdowns in most countries of the world had a domino effect on food production and supplies to the extent that many commercial and subsistence farmers in rich and poor countries respectively could not avert food wastage in the us for instance many large scale dairy farmers had to spill away milk in large volumes many crop farmers had to plough their harvests into the ground to serve as manure and many others were simply left to waste on the field in the absence of farm labour due to movement restrictions such was the magnitude of waste that except for government cushioning interventions many of them would have called it quits with farming with the resultant effects that food production would have diminished drastically things were not different or were perhaps even worse in poorer or developing countries in the southeast asia the prevalence of many small scale farm holdings rendered them particularly vulnerable to food waste then as the enforcement of lockdowns was indiscriminate and near total in china the lockdowns were total for the most parts and still linger till now in some provinces in many parts of the world including africa the lockdowns were compounded by other confounding variables global locust crisis took a toll on pakistan east africa and the sahel wiping out crops and damaging farms leading to one crisis with another thus forcing governments to fight on two fronts in nigeria many egg producers had to throw tonnes of eggs away and had to downsize the number of birds fed during the lockdowns to save costs and also because they could not access the market many of them left poultry farming and closed down their farms the worldwide disruption in the supply chain and logistics during the peak of the lockdowns meant that foods were locked out in the production centres away from consumption centres the impacts extended beyond the lockdowns well into today with the greater complexity in global governance more complex and rather fluid nature of interdependence among and between countries the rising population and increasing rate of urbanisation a crisis has become apparent in a world of 7 79 billion people half of which now live in the urban centres feeding the world has never been more challenging of course food price inflation was a natural consequence authoritative sources have affirmed that even now food prices are skyrocketing around the world as recently as in january international prices for major food items reportedly climbed to a level near the heights of the global food price crises of 2007 to 2008 and 2010 to 2011 according to the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao trade restrictions however played a key role in exacerbating the global inflation of food prices then unlike now rising prices in international commodity markets have started threatening food security even before russia invaded ukraine on february 24 the problem has been most acute for the poor in low income countries where rising food import costs weigh heavily on economies and on personal incomes as food accounts for about half of consumption baskets and 20 per cent of imports the impacts are closer home as domestic food prices have reportedly increased well over 10 per cent year on year in countries including ethiopia gambia guinea haiti malawi mozambique sierra leone and south sudan mozambique has been particularly hard hit since the 2019 cyclones that devastated food production and displaced over 80 000 people international food policy research institute ifpri wrote that rising food prices have a greater impact on low income households which spend a large share of their income on food the surge in consumer food prices in many low income countries partly explains the recent rise in global food insecurity brash politically motivated policy decisions are expected to be made by many countries on internal food security concerns in months ahead particularly if the ukraine invasion by russia persists net food import dependent countries face grim prospects as some net food exporters are cutting back on their food exports for a variety of reasons african countries sadly are mostly net food importers midway into the last month of may in a surprise move the government of india the second largest wheat producer after china suspended the export of wheat as severe heat waves have damaged a lot of crops exacerbating tight global supplies since the russian invasion of ukraine began thereby pushing up prices to new record highs to date no fewer than 20 countries have reportedly declared severe restrictions on food exports that cover one tenth of globally traded calories in the aftermath of the avoidable and profligate war that is putting the global food supply in a tailspin towards the end of april indonesia the world s largest exporter of palm oil temporarily banned the export of palm oil thus impacting global food prices even further and exerting extra pressure on already high cooking oil prices globally the ban was later lifted a month later in may the blockade on the main maritime access to ukraine since the war began has made export of wheat from ukraine very difficult wheat import dependent countries in africa have felt the impact so significantly egypt provides a good case study of what happens to africa when major food exporters withhold their stock egypt a country that depends on wheat from ukraine for nearly 40 per cent of its calories has been particularly affected affirmation that africa a continent proclaimed at various times in many high profile populist platforms including the world economic forum as having 60 percent of the world s remaining uncultivated arable land remains a net importer of food is a paradox it is a cause for worry as only seven per cent of this arable land is irrigated while about 65 percent of africa s 60 per cent arable land is reportedly too damaged to sustain viable food production according to a report titled no ordinary matter conserving restoring and enhancing africa s soil africa suffers from the triple threat of land degradation poor yields and a growing population this population which has doubled overall and tripled in urban areas in the past three decades has not been matched with commensurate increase in agricultural production and food security this raises a number of social economic and political issues of great concerns at the regional levels the peculiarities of challenges vary widely from droughts to pests diseases wars and insecurity in somalia a combination of terrorism and climate challenges has combined to devastate the country s food security prospects in the foreseeable future in recent times the rural urban population drift has increased as many rural farming households have left the rural countryside that is plagued with droughts after losing their crops and animals to perennial droughts the urban centres especially the capital city of mogadishu are particularly unsafe because of the periodic attacks on innocent population by bomb explosions the tenuous ceasefire that has slowed down the tigray war may provide enough respite for farmers to return to the farms in war zone of ethiopia this ceasefire if it stands may help in boosting ethiopia s food supply in 2023 nigeria is the source of 65 percent of certified seeds sold and used in west african countries the implications for regional food security are far reaching with significant impact on the production of staples within the ecowas sub region particularly in chad niger burkina faso mali insecurity has become a limiting factor for food production in the sub region with ample effects on nigeria extending eastwards into cameroon and beyond cameroon is particularly beset and weighed down by insecurity from within and without to the north cameroon is grappling with boko haram separatists are disrupting the peace in the southwest while the spill over of crisis from central african republic is disturbing the eastern part of the country altogether this is harming food security in such a naturally well endowed cameroon the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo is no stranger to regular attacks by armed bandits along the border with uganda which has seriously hindered food production in the region it remains to be seen how africa that struggles with these challenges hopes to feed itself and the wider world the russian ukraine war should wake africa up to a deep sense of responsibility in food production as any country or region of the world that has the food has the power to determine its supply and the price and by extension the political influence on import dependent countries and africa has many of them

by chen weihua in brussels china daily global updated 2022 06 06 09 42 for eu fossil fuels come in from the cold on path away from russian energy the european union hopes that the russia ukraine conflict will hasten a shift away from its dependence on russian energy to a faster takeup of renewables but it also expects that short term trade offs from a spike in the use of fossil fuels are unavoidable in achieving its goals at an eu summit on may 30 member states agreed to a partial ban on russian oil ending seaborne imports by the end of the year but exempting oil delivered by pipeline in the fifth round of sanctions unveiled in april the eu had agreed to phase out russian coal imports by august the european commission said it would phase out dependence on russian gas well before the end of the decade according to its repowereu plan announced on may 18 that aims to reduce dependence on russian fossil fuels and rev up the region s green transition the eu is russia s largest energy client last year the bloc imported from russia about 40 percent of its natural gas needs 46 percent of its coal and 27 percent of its oil in trade worth about 100 billion euros 107 billion the repowereu plan with 300 billion euros 321 billion in funding has set an ambitious goal of raising the eu s 2030 target for renewables from the current plan of 40 percent to 45 percent it also includes diversifying the eu s supplies from other sources and investing in infrastructure for liquefied natural gas imports the eu and its member states have stepped up efforts to reach out to other oil and gas suppliers in the past months including the united states norway azerbaijan and those in the middle east some eu states indicate that they may even have to resort to dirty coal by reactivating old decommissioned coal fired power plants european commission executive vice president frans timmermans who is in charge of the eu s green deal with the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 admitted in a news conference on the repowereu plan that we have no choice but to look for fossil fuel alternatives in the short run the problem is especially acute for germany the region s largest economy the new government of chancellor olaf scholz pledged in december to phase out coal by 2030 instead of the previous goal of 2038 but german energy companies are considering getting retired coal fired thermal power plants back online a bill submitted last month by robert habeck germany s minister for economic affairs and climate action ordered that coal fired plants due to be shut down be placed in reserve as part of a contingency plan to ensure the country s electricity supply in case russia cuts natural gas supplies on short notice as in the case of poland and bulgaria in late april and the netherlands and denmark over the past week coal fired power plants generated about 30 percent of germany s electricity last year short term it may be that as a precaution and in order to be prepared for the worst we have to keep coal powered plants on standby and maybe even let them operate habeck who belongs to the environmentalist greens party told german public radio deutschlandfunk bad time for germany the energy crisis has come at a bad time for germany which is determined to decommission its last three nuclear reactors by the end of the year italian prime minister mario draghi whose country also depends heavily on russian energy has said the country will increase the domestic production of gas and may reopen coal fired power stations to ensure energy security the reopening of coal fired power stations could be used to make up any shortfall in the immediate future draghi said while emphasizing the importance of switching to renewables in the future romanian environment minister barna tanczos is of the same view saying we will have to restart the coal fired power plants as a temporary move france is in talks with the united arab emirates to reduce russian oil purchases which will stop after the imposition of the eu ban on russian crude oil according to a reuters report there are discussions with the united arab emirates we have to find an alternative to russian oil finance minister bruno le maire told europe 1 radio on sunday ingvild sorhus the lead european carbon analyst at refinitiv a financial markets data and infrastructure provider said that while the eu is fundamentally reorienting its energy policy after the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict a massive deployment of low carbon and energy efficient technologies cannot be done overnight hopefully the decarbonization efforts in the repowereu plan could pick up quickly enough to offset these adverse impacts on eu emissions she told china daily erik solheim a norwegian politician and former executive director of the united nations environment programme said in the short run the conflict may affect the green shift negatively as it encourages new developments of oil and gas and makes them more profitable but in the long run he said the conflict will speed up the green shift european commission president ursula von der leyen vowed that 95 percent of the 300 billion euros in the repowereu plan will be dedicated to clean energy but critics have denounced the decision earmarking a huge amount for oil and gas infrastructure and lng terminals in a letter to von der leyen signed by 150 business leaders in may the eu was called on to avoid investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure and instead accelerate the push toward electrification renewables and energy efficiency it is time for all of us to take the necessary steps to strengthen europe s energy security and resilience by accelerating the green transition the letter said

regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages what can i do abbvie investors may no

like several others have noted it s a great recipe with a couple of simple mods i agree with others that the ratios for the rice broth and veg are a bit off i think i added closer to 1 cup of rice at least if not a little more which resulted in what i guess i would call a soupy porridge for the greens i basically decided on the amount just based on look intuition definitely also seasoned it to taste with various other seasonings the recipe did not call for overall though super easy to make and to clean up it s a good healthy comfort food staple especially since i basically always have the ingredients on hand raleigh louisiana this exceeded my expectations for such a simple recipe i added shredded chicken breast at the end because i had it used escarole and added it to simmer in the last 5 minutes of the rice cooking would do the same for kale etc do not miss the chili oil if you like some spice i like the broth rice ratio here it began as rice soup and leftovers were porridge and just as good as the first serving this is a keeper alex d san francisco ca i think someone should check the rice broth ratio i used 2 cups of broth to 1 2 cup rice and it was still soupy best to leave the cheese for the cheese board because the chili oil was overpowering and i didn t get any of the cheesy taste i admit i may have added too much ken boquete panamá i made it with vegetable broth because that is what i had in the pantry and recipe was fabulous i ve passed it on to several friends and family members it was easy economical and delicious i will make it again anonymous ohio this looks absolutely delicious sondra pennsylvania i tweaked a few things but it was delicious i used 12 cups of mushroom stock 1 cup of same rice as the recipe 1 bunch of kale two big handfuls of spinach 8oz total of baby bell shitaki and oyster mushrooms same amount of extra sharp cheddar and the chili oil came out great kangaroo albany ny i really liked this i reduced broth to 4 cups and added some minced garlic to it i used one bunch of chard came out close to risotto without all the work anonymous clearwater florida good base recipe i sautéed the chard one bunch in a little oil with about 20 cloves of garlic and a splash of white wine before throwing it in the broth vicious california needed some mods but it s a very cozy quick simple dish that we enjoyed for a weeknight dinner first the greens ratio is way off we did about 3 4 bunch of kale and called it because there were so many greens in there relative to rice and broth topped with momofuku chili crunch which brought a much needed kick will make again easy weeknight healthy dish andrea this dish was terrible the portions seem way off and was basically wet salad i am a loyal ba reader subscriber but this was not it renatta gorski

for eu fossil fuels come in from the cold on path away from russian energy the european union hopes that the russia ukraine conflict will hasten a shift away from its dependence on russian energy to a faster takeup of renewables but it also expects that short term trade offs from a spike in the use of fossil fuels are unavoidable in achieving its goals at an eu summit on may 30 member states agreed to a partial ban on russian oil ending seaborne imports by the end of the year but exempting oil delivered by pipeline in the fifth round of sanctions unveiled in april the eu had agreed to phase out russian coal imports by august the european commission said it would phase out dependence on russian gas well before the end of the decade according to its repowereu plan announced on may 18 that aims to reduce dependence on russian fossil fuels and rev up the region s green transition the eu is russia s largest energy client last year the bloc imported from russia about 40 percent of its natural gas needs 46 percent of its coal and 27 percent of its oil in trade worth about 100 billion euros 107 billion the repowereu plan with 300 billion euros 321 billion in funding has set an ambitious goal of raising the eu s 2030 target for renewables from the current plan of 40 percent to 45 percent it also includes diversifying the eu s supplies from other sources and investing in infrastructure for liquefied natural gas imports the eu and its member states have stepped up efforts to reach out to other oil and gas suppliers in the past months including the united states norway azerbaijan and those in the middle east some eu states indicate that they may even have to resort to dirty coal by reactivating old decommissioned coal fired power plants european commission executive vice president frans timmermans who is in charge of the eu s green deal with the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 admitted in a news conference on the repowereu plan that we have no choice but to look for fossil fuel alternatives in the short run the problem is especially acute for germany the region s largest economy the new government of chancellor olaf scholz pledged in december to phase out coal by 2030 instead of the previous goal of 2038 but german energy companies are considering getting retired coal fired thermal power plants back online a bill submitted last month by robert habeck germany s minister for economic affairs and climate action ordered that coal fired plants due to be shut down be placed in reserve as part of a contingency plan to ensure the country s electricity supply in case russia cuts natural gas supplies on short notice as in the case of poland and bulgaria in late april and the netherlands and denmark over the past week coal fired power plants generated about 30 percent of germany s electricity last year short term it may be that as a precaution and in order to be prepared for the worst we have to keep coal powered plants on standby and maybe even let them operate habeck who belongs to the environmentalist greens party told german public radio deutschlandfunk bad time for germany the energy crisis has come at a bad time for germany which is determined to decommission its last three nuclear reactors by the end of the year italian prime minister mario draghi whose country also depends heavily on russian energy has said the country will increase the domestic production of gas and may reopen coal fired power stations to ensure energy security the reopening of coal fired power stations could be used to make up any shortfall in the immediate future draghi said while emphasizing the importance of switching to renewables in the future romanian environment minister barna tanczos is of the same view saying we will have to restart the coal fired power plants as a temporary move france is in talks with the united arab emirates to reduce russian oil purchases which will stop after the imposition of the eu ban on russian crude oil according to a reuters report there are discussions with the united arab emirates we have to find an alternative to russian oil finance minister bruno le maire told europe 1 radio on sunday ingvild sorhus the lead european carbon analyst at refinitiv a financial markets data and infrastructure provider said that while the eu is fundamentally reorienting its energy policy after the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict a massive deployment of low carbon and energy efficient technologies cannot be done overnight hopefully the decarbonization efforts in the repowereu plan could pick up quickly enough to offset these adverse impacts on eu emissions she told china daily erik solheim a norwegian politician and former executive director of the united nations environment programme said in the short run the conflict may affect the green shift negatively as it encourages new developments of oil and gas and makes them more profitable but in the long run he said the conflict will speed up the green shift european commission president ursula von der leyen vowed that 95 percent of the 300 billion euros in the repowereu plan will be dedicated to clean energy but critics have denounced the decision earmarking a huge amount for oil and gas infrastructure and lng terminals in a letter to von der leyen signed by 150 business leaders in may the eu was called on to avoid investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure and instead accelerate the push toward electrification renewables and energy efficiency it is time for all of us to take the necessary steps to strengthen europe s energy security and resilience by accelerating the green transition the letter said

a much hyped collaboration items from gucci s collaboration with adidas first announced in february go on sale june 7 for adidas the collection comes on the heels of another luxury partnership with balenciaga gucci has reported uneven growth in recent quarters even as rivals have found success with timeless ultra expensive merchandise gucci and adidas have had months to build hype for the collection that goes on sale this week from the first glimpse on the runway in milan in february to the full lookbook revealed last month to an odd episode in may where chinese social media users were seemingly outraged by the existence of a non waterproof umbrella with a listed price of 11 100 yuan 1 600 the umbrella will almost certainly sell briskly nonetheless along with gucci s 850 spin on the gazelle sneakers and other items that mix and remix the two brands logos adidas needs luxury collaborations like this one and a recent team up with balenciaga to close the hype gap with nike which has proven far more adept at generating brand heat over the last couple of years all that buzz has real world consequences nike s stock is up about 15 percent since june 2020 adidas is down 30 percent for gucci an attention grabbing collaboration featuring products with mass appeal at luxury prices is par for the course the question is whether adidas x gucci represents the latest chapter in that particular playbook or the start of a new one gucci remains one of the most talked about luxury brands its instagram post announcing the adidas partnership has over 1 2 million likes but its sales haven t grown at the same pace as rivals that have better balanced conversation driving moments with clothes and accessories that luxury consumers view as timeless investments the bottom line kering is holding an investor day this week where it s expected to delve further into its strategy for gucci as well as saint laurent which has found enormous success with a less hype driven approach to luxury advertisement robert williams contributed to this item change is coming whether fashion wants it or not the global fashion summit formerly the copenhagen fashion summit runs june 7 8 it will be the first in person edition of fashion s biggest sustainability event since the pandemic the industry faces the prospect of tough new environmental and labour regulations worldwide for its first in person gathering since the pandemic the event formerly known as the copenhagen fashion summit has a new name to emphasise the global nature of the problems its attendees hope to solve there s plenty to chew over from exciting new materials to progress toward circular fashion and backsliding in the treatment of garment workers there will be plenty of calls to action but looming over the proceedings is the growing likelihood that fashion will be forced to clean up its act whether it wants to or not from the eu to the uk to the us lawmakers are pushing rules that would address fashion s contributions to climate change and the checkered history of labour relations members of the new york state legislature and the european commission who are active on these issues are among the speakers the bottom line the fashion industry likes to say that it can address its own ills pointing to investment in new technologies and retail concepts such as resale as evidence but progress has been uneven and grindingly slow helping to explain the momentum behind regulatory fixes consumer confidence the us government releases inflation data for may on june 10 prices are rising at their fastest pace in decades with gasoline food and other staples stretching budgets some retailers that cater to low income consumers have suffered while sales remain strong at many higher priced brands how is the american consumer feeling these days economists are warning about a possible recession and gasoline prices are at a record high yet in surveys most people say they re feeling more optimistic about their personal finances than the economy as a whole and most importantly for the fashion industry they continue to shop they re just being more selective about where last year when government stimulus checks were arriving in mailboxes each month brands and retailers of all sorts benefitted today high inflation means paychecks don t go as far especially for low income consumers that helps explain why sales have suffered at walmart and target not to mention gap inc s old navy while higher priced retailers from ralph lauren to nordstrom seem to be doing just fine the bottom

mumbai bankers expect the reserve bank of india rbi to deliver its second rate hike which governor shaktikanta das described as a no brainer in the forthcoming monetary policy committee meeting that ends on june 8 most expect the increase to be in the range of 25 50 basis points 100bps 1 percentage point the central bank had hiked its repo rate at which it lends to banks by 40bps to 4 4 in an off cycle meeting on may 4 during 2022 so far more than 45 central banks across advanced economies and emerging markets have raised policy interest rates and or scaled back liquidity many central banks hiked interest rates in back to back policies said state bank of india group chief economist soumya kanti ghosh in a report it added that a 50bps rate hike is likely however the rbi is likely to remain accommodative in terms of liquidity according to ghosh there are a number of risks for growth and inflation these include the geopolitical crisis elevated oil commodity prices fuel price hike and rupee depreciation also the us federal reserve has announced a sharp increase in interest rates resetting these according to ghosh if the rbi increases the repo rate by 75bps then there would be an interest cost of rs 23 114 crore on retail and micro small medium enterprises msme consumers this is because 39 2 of the loans are linked to external benchmarks ebrs most of them are linked to the repo rate this is likely to hurt demand he added that data shows that there is no evidence of interest rate sensitiveness of savings as deposits continued to rise when rates dropped all these facts make us believe that the peak repo rate in current cycle might be anchored at 5 5 to get the optimal outcome as impact of large increases of real interest rate on deposit is uncertain said ghosh axis bank chief economist saugata bhattacharya expects the rbi to raise the repo rate to 5 75 by the end of the current financial year he added that the central bank may front load increases given that inflation has been over its tolerance levels for the past four months while the rate hike is being termed as inevitable the markets are waiting to see the rbi s projections for inflation as well as for withdrawal of liquidity the yields on government bonds are much higher than what current interest rates warrant this means that dealers are factoring in steep rate hikes going ahead said a dealer according to a report by bank of america securities the rbi would hike its inflation forecast from 5 7 now to around 6 5 for fy23 as for gdp growth estimate we see fy23 real gdp growth at 7 4 yoy a shade higher than rbi s 7 2 forecast we don t expect the rbi mpc monetary policy committee to make any changes to their growth estimate the report said bofa has forecast a 40bps hike in the repo rate this month which will be followed by another 35bps hike in the next mpc meet in august the key thing is that rbi mpc exits ultra accommodation by august and takes policy repo rate to the pre pandemic level of 5 15 accordingly until then we expect the rbi mpc will retain the stance as accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation the report said

by david ho investing com oil was up on monday morning in asia after saudi arabia raised the price steeply for its crude sales in july a sign that supplies remain tight even though opec agreed to accelerate its output increases over the next two months rose 0 62 to 120 46 by 10 06 pm et 2 06 am gmt and jumped 0 67 to 119 42 for its flagship arab light crude to asia to a 6 50 premium versus the average of the oman and dubai benchmarks up from a premium of 4 40 in june state oil producer aramco tadawul announced on sunday the decision arrived despite a call last week by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies together called opec to increase output in july and august by 648 000 barrels per day or 50 more than previously planned mere days after opening the spigots a bit wider saudi arabia wasted little time hiking its official selling price for asia its primary market seeing knock on effects at the futures open across the oil market spectrum said stephen innes spi asset management managing partner in a note saudi arabia also increased the arab light osp to northwest europe to 4 30 above ice brent for july up from a premium of 2 10 in june but it held the premium steady for barrels going to the united states at 5 65 above the argus sour crude index asci the opec decision for output hikes is widely thought of as unlikely to meet demand as several member countries including russia are unable to boost output meanwhile demand is soaring in the united states amid the peak driving season and china is easing covid lockdowns while that increase is sorely needed it falls short of demand growth expectations especially with the eu s partial ban on russian oil imports also factored in commonwealth bank analyst vivek dhar said in a note

for eu fossil fuels come in from the cold on path away from russian energy the european union hopes that the russia ukraine conflict will hasten a shift away from its dependence on russian energy to a faster takeup of renewables but it also expects that short term trade offs from a spike in the use of fossil fuels are unavoidable in achieving its goals at an eu summit on may 30 member states agreed to a partial ban on russian oil ending seaborne imports by the end of the year but exempting oil delivered by pipeline in the fifth round of sanctions unveiled in april the eu had agreed to phase out russian coal imports by august the european commission said it would phase out dependence on russian gas well before the end of the decade according to its repowereu plan announced on may 18 that aims to reduce dependence on russian fossil fuels and rev up the region s green transition the eu is russia s largest energy client last year the bloc imported from russia about 40 percent of its natural gas needs 46 percent of its coal and 27 percent of its oil in trade worth about 100 billion euros 107 billion the repowereu plan with 300 billion euros 321 billion in funding has set an ambitious goal of raising the eu s 2030 target for renewables from the current plan of 40 percent to 45 percent it also includes diversifying the eu s supplies from other sources and investing in infrastructure for liquefied natural gas imports the eu and its member states have stepped up efforts to reach out to other oil and gas suppliers in the past months including the united states norway azerbaijan and those in the middle east some eu states indicate that they may even have to resort to dirty coal by reactivating old decommissioned coal fired power plants european commission executive vice president frans timmermans who is in charge of the eu s green deal with the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 admitted in a news conference on the repowereu plan that we have no choice but to look for fossil fuel alternatives in the short run the problem is especially acute for germany the region s largest economy the new government of chancellor olaf scholz pledged in december to phase out coal by 2030 instead of the previous goal of 2038 but german energy companies are considering getting retired coal fired thermal power plants back online a bill submitted last month by robert habeck germany s minister for economic affairs and climate action ordered that coal fired plants due to be shut down be placed in reserve as part of a contingency plan to ensure the country s electricity supply in case russia cuts natural gas supplies on short notice as in the case of poland and bulgaria in late april and the netherlands and denmark over the past week coal fired power plants generated about 30 percent of germany s electricity last year short term it may be that as a precaution and in order to be prepared for the worst we have to keep coal powered plants on standby and maybe even let them operate habeck who belongs to the environmentalist greens party told german public radio deutschlandfunk bad time for germany the energy crisis has come at a bad time for germany which is determined to decommission its last three nuclear reactors by the end of the year italian prime minister mario draghi whose country also depends heavily on russian energy has said the country will increase the domestic production of gas and may reopen coal fired power stations to ensure energy security the reopening of coal fired power stations could be used to make up any shortfall in the immediate future draghi said while emphasizing the importance of switching to renewables in the future romanian environment minister barna tanczos is of the same view saying we will have to restart the coal fired power plants as a temporary move france is in talks with the united arab emirates to reduce russian oil purchases which will stop after the imposition of the eu ban on russian crude oil according to a reuters report there are discussions with the united arab emirates we have to find an alternative to russian oil finance minister bruno le maire told europe 1 radio on sunday ingvild sorhus the lead european carbon analyst at refinitiv a financial markets data and infrastructure provider said that while the eu is fundamentally reorienting its energy policy after the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict a massive deployment of low carbon and energy efficient technologies cannot be done overnight hopefully the decarbonization efforts in the repowereu plan could pick up quickly enough to offset these adverse impacts on eu emissions she told china daily erik solheim a norwegian politician and former executive director of the united nations environment programme said in the short run the conflict may affect the green shift negatively as it encourages new developments of oil and gas and makes them more profitable but in the long run he said the conflict will speed up the green shift european commission president ursula von der leyen vowed that 95 percent of the 300 billion euros in the repowereu plan will be dedicated to clean energy but critics have denounced the decision earmarking a huge amount for oil and gas infrastructure and lng terminals in a letter to von der leyen signed by 150 business leaders in may the eu was called on to avoid investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure and instead accelerate the push toward electrification renewables and energy efficiency it is time for all of us to take the necessary steps to strengthen europe s energy security and resilience by accelerating the green transition the letter said

a decent dividend plus a bargain price adds up to an incredible opportunity for investors to consider if there s an upside to a down market it s that not every company whose shares get punished will end up in the dustbin of history as the market declines quite often great businesses with solid long term prospects get put on sale giving investors a chance to buy at great prices when those businesses also pay supported sustainable and often growing dividends then investors who buy the shares can get paid for their patience as they wait for a recovery to help figure out whether such opportunities are emerging in today s market three investors and fool com contributors named beaten down dividend stocks that look like they could be screaming buys this june they uncovered stanley black decker swk 0 71 home depot hd 1 44 and 3m mmm 0 01 read on to find out why they feel that way and decide for yourself whether any or all of them deserve a spot in your portfolio the right tool for your portfolio eric volkman stanley black decker stocks don t get much more beaten down than toolmaker stanley black decker the company s stock has cratered by almost 40 so far in 2022 and its price is teasing its one year low that s hardly fair stanley black decker is a top name in the tools and associated goods space and has been for years it owns some of the top tool brands you ll find in millions of american closets and garages outside of the two that comprise the company s name it also sells the craftsman and dewalt lines among numerous others like many of the best dividend stocks stanley black decker has historically managed to consistently if unspectacularly grow revenue and post a bottom line profit but this has been overshadowed lately by a notable increase in the costs of raw materials a key input for the company as a result it recently cut its net profit and free cash flow guidance for full year 2022 which sent investors scurrying for the exits never mind that in its first quarter the company trounced the average analyst earnings estimate for its first quarter or managed to increase revenue 20 year over year thanks in no small part to a clever and complementary acquisition of gardening equipment purveyor mtd stanley black decker is doing what it can to cope with the increase in raw material costs notably raising prices for its products but that crunch with raw materials won t last forever and even while it does the company will continue to operate in an environment where key business drivers like the frothy u s housing market should continue to improve the recent investor exodus has left stanley black decker rather cheap on its valuations it trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of less than 12 and a price to book value barely above 1 both rather low compared to other manufacturing stocks meanwhile although 2022 probably won t be a banner year for the company analysts are expecting a much sunnier 2023 collectively they are anticipating a nearly 17 per share increase in net earnings finally a weakened share price means a meatier dividend yield stanley black decker s currently stands at nearly 2 7 a very attractive figure when matched not only against stocks in its sector but also the hallowed grouping of dividend aristocrats that it s a part of home depot is an excellent business selling at a fair price after the sell off parkev tatevosian home depot one of my favorite beaten down dividend stocks to buy now is home depot the company has had a wild couple of years starting with a surge in revenue at the pandemic s onset followed by the slowing growth in recent quarters however investor pessimism surrounding home depot s prospects as economies reopen is providing a lower price to potential investors indeed home depot s stock is down 28 off its highs short term fluctuations aside home depot has done an excellent job growing revenue expanding profit margins and raising earnings per share over the longer run that s good news for dividend investors because ultimately dividends are paid out of earnings home depot s revenue went from 75 billion to 151 billion in the previous decade the operating profit margin expanded from 10 4 to 15 2 during that same time it all flowed to the bottom line it grew earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 20 over 10 years that undoubtedly helped home depot raise its dividend payment from 1 16 in 2013 to 6 60 in 2022 that means income investors in 2013 who held their stock are getting nearly six times the dividend they signed up for today s income investors can expect home depot to boost the dividend over the next decade as well the fall in home depot s stock has it trading at a fair valuation of a price to earnings ratio of 19 and a price to free cash flow ratio of 28 investors can never be faulted for paying a reasonable price for an excellent business home depot is an outstanding beaten down dividend stock to buy for those reasons an industrial titan whose legal troubles are keeping its shares down chuck saletta 3m industrial titan 3m s shares currently trade for substantially less than they did five years ago in part due to ongoing legal and environmental costs associated with its business such costs are unfortunately common to many companies especially ones with long histories of operations and broad scale product lines that people rely on for things like health and safety that softness in its shares offers investors a decent opportunity to buy a part of a world class company at a reasonable price 3m trades at around 15 times trailing earnings and closer to 13 times its anticipated forward earnings in addition its shares sport a 4 yield thanks to a dividend that has increased for 64 consecutive years yet which only consumes around 62 of its earnings perhaps even better analysts are expecting only modest earnings growth of around 6 6 annualized over the next five or so years a growth rate like that gives investors good reason to believe the company can keep up its trend of dividend increases over time it also means the market doesn t have incredibly high expectations built in which when combined with its reasonable current valuation could help moderate the risks of further declines giving further reason to believe in its future 3m has a strongly embedded culture of innovation this is how the same company that makes post it notes and scotch tape can also make products as varied as n95 face masks and car repair kits that culture of innovation means that while the future is never certain there s a good chance 3m will find a way to adapt and thrive in it get paid for your patience stanley black decker home depot and 3m are solid companies that look like they have the staying power to make it through this current down market and on to brighter days ahead the market s recent sell off has made them available at reasonable prices while their dividends offer investors cold hard cash for their patience as they wait for the potential of a better future if there s an upside to a down market it s that offers like this only tend to come around when those brighter days look like they re far far away nobody really knows how long it will take for the market to recover getting paid decent and potentially growing dividends while you wait for that day to come certainly makes it a much more palatable proposition so decide for yourself which of these companies may deserve a spot in your portfolio and get yourself in a better spot to ride out the rockiness
these two stocks will pay you in your sleep and alleviate your concerns about the ongoing tech sell off the stock market has been unpredictable in recent months and as a result investors have headed for the exits the s p 500 has contracted 14 year to date and the nasdaq composite which comprises a wider range of speculative growth stocks has drawn back 22 over the same time period this is unsurprising considering the current state of the global economy with inflation ascending to 40 year highs the fed s decision to conduct numerous interest rate hikes in response as well as unresolved issues bound to the russo ukrainian war investors have fallen out of love with high priced growth stocks such types of companies never interested the great warren buffett who is famous for picking low value stocks with resilient business models and attractive dividend yields it s during times of considerable uncertainty that buffett s wisdom and investing strategy come in handy the most after all the star stock picker is quoted for saying only when the tide goes out do you discover who s been swimming naked this sentence is certainly relevant in today s economic environment as investors continue to be tested by the stock market s volatility here are two stocks to consider buying now that together make up 22 of buffett s investment portfolio 1 bank of america as one of the largest banks in the world bank of america bac 0 45 has fallen 21 year to date despite its strong outing in the first quarter of 2022 total sales finished in line with wall street estimates increasing 1 8 year over year to 23 2 billion and diluted earnings per share beat consensus expectations by 7 5 concluding at 0 80 the company s earnings report demonstrated that in the face of surging inflation consumer spending habits remain positive this was evidenced by its 980 billion in payment volume in q1 equal to 14 1 growth year over year the company s balance sheet continued to expand in q1 as well total loans and leases increased 10 year over year 993 billion and total deposits grew 9 9 to 2 1 trillion bank of america s efficiency ratio which shows how well a bank controls its expenses decreased 100 basis points quarter over quarter to 66 a lower efficiency ratio is better because it indicates that a bank is spending less to generate more revenue in addition the bank pays a dividend with a 2 32 yield at present this means investors are receiving a quarterly payment of 0 21 share irrespective of the company s stock price movement investors can choose to reinvest their dividends or use the proceeds to pay for other expenses with the stock trading at just 10 4 times earnings today now may be the optimal time to accumulate shares of this mega bank stock 2 coca cola the coca cola company ko 0 24 isn t a flashy business but the multinational beverage corporation knows how to deliver up 7 since the start of 2022 the warren buffett favorite posted a strong report in q1 the company s total revenue outperformed wall street forecasts by 6 8 expanding 16 3 year over year to 10 5 billion and its diluted earnings per share eps exceeded consensus estimates by 10 4 surging 23 1 to 0 64 the beverage company s operating margin also finished at 32 5 vs 30 2 in the prior year we are pleased with our first quarter results as our company continues to execute effectively in a highly dynamic and uncertain operating environment noted james quincey chairman and ceo of coca cola in the earnings call this statement characterizes the company s bread and butter consistency because coca cola is a consumer staples enterprise its products are essential regardless of the economic climate this explains why the beverage juggernaut performed so well in its opening quarter compared to many other companies that continue to face pressure from the macroeconomic environment coca cola rewards its shareholders in a major way with its 0 44 share quarterly dividend which translates to a yield of 2 70 the company s consistent and resilient business has allowed it to raise its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years knowing that and applying a long term approach just think about where the company s dividend could be 50 years down the road if i had to guess coca cola will still be around and the company s dividend will be much higher than it is today
russia s invasion of ukraine has sparked the largest refugee crisis in europe since world war ii in just over a hundred days close to 7 million ukrainians have fled across their nation s borders with the vast majority finding sanctuary within the european union ukraine counts four e u member states as its neighbors all of whom opened their borders for what was a mass exodus in an unprecedented move following the russian attack the european union as a bloc invoked an emergency power not used since it was conceived two decades ago and granted ukrainians a kind of blanket protection the temporary protection directive as it s known gives those who receive it an extended right to move freely within the european union as well as permissions to work and access to health care education and housing it is a very generous offer far beyond the classical asylum protections margaritis schinas vice president of the european commission told me last week during a visit to washington i would say it s europe at its best advertisement schinas whose portfolio includes coordinating the european union s continental approach to asylum and migration policy thinks that many of these refugees may in the long run not return to their homeland i anticipate that this offer is so generous that regardless of the evolution of the war at least 2 5 million to 3 million people will stay he said that s a figure multiple times larger than the number of syrian and afghan war refugees given asylum by the e u in recent years for schinas it s a positive development he described many of the ukrainian refugees as highly educated and skilled people who can immediately incorporate into our systems especially when the continent as a whole faces demographic decline and a significant skills gap in certain critical sectors many of the refugees have tapped into networks of the ukrainian diaspora and found housing and accommodation while tens of thousands of citizens across the european union britain and the united states among other countries have registered to host or sponsor ukrainian refugees ukrainian schoolchildren are able to access their curriculums digitally and though coronavirus vaccination rates in ukraine were relatively low the surplus stock of vaccines in the european union means there s plenty to go around advertisement all of this schinas observed has led to the continent s traditional opponents to immigration on the far right being relatively muted about this major ukrainian influx which for now appears to have caused minimal strains in host nations but onlookers elsewhere are less impressed the reception for ukrainians stands in stark contrast to how europe on the whole has viewed asylum seekers from other parts of the world the slow burning crisis provoked by the war in syria in 2015 left deep political scars on the continent e u member states clashed over how to shoulder the burden of the influx while the arrivals of hundreds of thousands of non white non christian migrants inflamed the nationalist far right across europe share this article share even last year after the fall of the afghan government in kabul to taliban militants a statement from e u interior ministers prioritized thwarting illegal migration from the region and border management capacity over protections for the afghan people who bore witness to two decades of a failed western military adventure in their country advertisement the russian ukrainian war revealed the ugly face of europe it showed their racism against arab and african immigrants despite all the human rights slogans wrote marwa el shinawy in a column for daily news egypt adding that european governments seem to believe that the protection of refugees is a right for europeans only and that the rest of the races are not human beings perhaps one pointed illustration of this can be seen in poland whose right wing nationalist government had fumed over the prospect of resettling a handful of syrian refugees but has opened its doors for millions of ukrainians from next door in 2015 the refugees were dark skinned muslims and warsaw slammed its borders shut wrote andreas kluth former editor in chief of handelsblatt global a publication based in germany now they re fellow christians and slavs and poland has warmly welcomed more than half of the 6 7 million ukrainians who ve fled abroad schinas is aware of the criticism but rejects accusations of racism to those who somehow imply that skin color is a factor in european migration policy let me be crystal clear he said it is not advertisement the brussels official argued that the war in ukraine on the e u s immediate doorstep is a unique circumstance that triggered a different legal mechanism than the earlier waves of migrants we give protection to people who flee from war he said this does not translate to an automatic right of admission for everyone who comes to the european union but schinas added that the 2015 migration crisis was a catalyst which galvanized the european union into some sort of belief that migration was a common issue compared to seven years ago the bloc has far greater funding and capacity to absorb migrant influxes and monitor borders but no matter the consensus around welcoming ukrainians the e u still lacks political unity for setting a policy on asylum seekers schinas thinks one will emerge soon which will require unanimity among the bloc s 27 member states it is mind blowing that europe has the biggest single market in the world we account for 20 percent of the world s gdp said schinas and can pursue major policy goals including issuing shared debt and instituting the world s most aggressive climate goals
file people fish in the sacramento san joaquin river delta s elk slough near courtland calif tuesday march 24 2020 a proposal in the california state senate aims to keep more water in california s rivers and streams to benefit endangered species of fish under the plan the state would spend up to 1 5 billion to buy up senior water rights that farmers use to take water from the state s rivers and streams to grow their crops ap photo rich pedroncelli file after decades of fighting farmers in court over how much water they can take out of california s rivers and streams some state lawmakers want to try something different use taxpayer money to buy out farmers a proposal in the state senate would spend up to 1 5 billion to buy senior water rights that allow farmers to take as much water as needed from the state s rivers and streams to grow their crops if state officials owned those rights they could leave the water in the rivers to benefit endangered species of salmon and other fish advertisement california has been mired in drought for most of the last two decades prompting intense scrutiny of the state s complex water system and how it might be modified to ensure steady supplies during exceptionally dry periods including a separate state proposal that would pay farmers to grow fewer crops to save water current readings show about 98 of the state has severe drought conditions as california heads into summer months that rarely produce any significant precipitation many areas have begun restricting water use for homeowners largely by reducing outdoor use such as lawn irrigation and farmers have had their allocation from the two major state owned water systems reduced in some cases down to zero legally all of the water in california is the property of the government but farmers have water rights that let them take water for agriculture farmers have used those rights governed by a complicated system based on seniority and other factors to turn california s central valley into an agricultural powerhouse that provides much of the nation s fruits nuts and vegetables advertisement but siphoning off all that water also has disrupted the fragile ecosystem of the san joaquin sacramento river delta the largest estuary on the west coast and home to endangered salmon and other fish environmental groups and farmers have battled for years over state and federal rules governing just how much water can be diverted for agriculture which uses far more water than any other sector of the economy now with california having a record budget surplus of nearly 100 billion democrats in the state senate have proposed using up to 1 5 billion to buy senior water rights by either buying the land associated with the rights buying just the right itself or putting an easement on the land that requires the water to be used for fish and other fauna and flora the proposal is part of budget negotiations between lawmakers and gov gavin newsom s administration that should wrap up by the end of this month advertisement it s like we re taking a page from corporate america and we re buying back stock said state sen bob wieckowski a democrat who represents the san francisco bay area and is chair of a budget subcommittee overseeing environmental spending while 1 5 billion sounds like a lot of money it wouldn t buy that much water regulators measure water by acre foot defined as enough water to cover 1 acre 0 4 hectares of land to a depth of 1 foot 30 centimeters that s the equivalent of 325 851 gallons 1 2 million liters a typical household uses 1 acre foot of water each year farmers collectively use up to 35 million acre feet of water each year according to the water education foundation advertisement the 1 5 billion would be enough to buy about 200 000 acre feet of water based on an average price of 7 500 per acre foot according to tom birmingham general manager of westlands water district the largest agricultural water district in the country still birmingham says the idea makes an awful lot of sense because it is a means by which conflict can be avoided right now the only way to get more water flowing in rivers and streams is to get state and federal regulators to change the rules they can do that by requiring more water be left in rivers and streams but that means less water for farmers those rule changes often prompt lawsuits which can take a decade or longer to resolve said lester snow a former secretary of the california natural resources agency and regional director of the u s bureau of reclamation advertisement we need a way to take much quicker action and i think acquiring water rights for that purpose is one of the ways to do that he said with climate change we just don t have that kind of time for this to work farmers would have to voluntarily sell their valuable water rights something birmingham says shouldn t be a problem lots of farmers try to sell their water rights to westlands water district every year birmingham said for many farmers their children simply are not interested in continuing to farm birmingham said advertisement but state sen brian dahle a republican running for governor whose family has been farming in california for 92 years said the only reason farmers would be willing to sell is because state officials are driving them out of business with burdensome regulations this makes my blood boil it s ridiculous dahle told his colleagues during a legislative hearing on the proposal you are forcing them into a corner where they have no other option john mcmanus executive director of the golden state salmon association said as with any legislative proposal the devil will be in the details he said he d want to see rules that make sure any additional water purchased by the state will remain in the rivers and not be removed by someone else with water rights farther downstream advertisement but he is hopeful the program will work because he said there are about six native fish species that are on life support right now because we don t have enough water flowing through the delta so anything that can be done to address that problem is appreciated he said
when i wrote this piece initially last week i identified 6 ukrainian units that filmed themselves rebelling against their chain of command these rebellion videos came on the heels of the surrender of more than 2500 members of the azov battalion at mariupol now the number is 12 that is 12 different units in the donbas they all voice the same complaints about their chain of command for not properly supplying them with the weapons and equipment they need to fight this is not your normal troop bitching about conditions all soldiers in all wars throughout history have passed the time
writer and fly fisher roderick haig brown dreamed of a time when the north pacific ocean would grow a lot more salmon haig brown was probably the most famous and influential fly fisher in north america during his lifetime the author wrote from his home on the banks of campbell river on vancouver island he sat at a desk with a view of the river far from where the arbiters of great writing resided at the time the new yorker regularly reviewed his books always favourably and in 1976 the new york times reported on his death from the 1930s to the 1970s haig brown led readers into the realm of pacific salmon chinook sockeye coho chum and pink in his 1941 book return to the river a lyrical story about one fish that moved a critic to call the author an immortal in the field of nature writing haig brown dug into the soul of a fish he created a world from a wild chinook salmon s point of view allowing the reader to tag along on the cyclical path of a fish named spring from birth to death in an oregon stream her life story is both wondrous and harrowing spring s journey reflected all that haig brown fretted about over 80 years ago logging that decimated streams dams that blocked rivers and development that buried creeks he fretted about hatchery fish too haig brown clearly understood salmon and what they needed to thrive they needed habitat not hatcheries and yet haig brown like many in the pacific northwest also wished for more fish sometimes we get what we wish for but we don t get what we want or need today wild salmon populations are struggling in the pacific northwest of north america and yet there are more salmon in the north pacific ocean than there were a century ago more than when haig brown wrote in his 1964 book fisherman s fall that he was optimistic enough to believe that the north pacific ocean can grow a lot more salmon than are using it right now and i hope i shall live long enough to see its capacity become a question of immediate moment the capacity of the ocean is a question of immediate concern there are at least 243 hatcheries strung along salmon habitat from california to alaska and more feeding fish into the north pacific via hatcheries in russia japan and south korea cannery operators in oregon built the first salmon hatchery on the west coast to supplement their catches in the late 19th century annually since 1988 the five salmon producing countries release over five billion hatchery salmon most hatcheries are industrial affairs eggs and sperm come together in white plastic buckets and fry are released after some months of growth with streams so degraded more like tenements than habitat crowded with juvenile wild and hatchery fish living fin to fin competing for food and ripe for diseases and parasites some hatcheries avoid problem environments by trucking their juvenile salmon to better release sites hatchery fish also diminish the genetic robustness of wild salmon when later in their lives they enter spawning grounds and interbreed and like boats hatchery fish are money pits how much a hatchery salmon costs varies per hatchery but 20 years ago a researcher calculated that to keep salmon swimming in the columbia and snake river basins in oregon washington and idaho the price tag was us 400 per fish by the time haig brown published his first book in 1931 the science had already aligned against fish hatcheries in his writings haig brown shared a vision for restoring and protecting salmon habitat instead of relying on hatchery fish how did we get so far from his ideals at first it was mainly politics and blind faith in technology today the reliance on hatcheries is a combination of politics law and desperation almost a century ago a canadian scientist revealed that hatcheries were at best failed experiments and at worst monuments to delusional thinking in the early 1920s fisheries biologist russell earl foerster arrived at cultus lake which drains into the lower fraser river to run a salmon hatchery built by the province 10 years earlier he floated the idea of establishing a research station as well foerster had a few questions including whether raising fish in hatcheries worked were the wild runs of salmon at cultus less or more productive compared with the hatchery fish raised at a creek downstream of the lake without any evidence that playing god with fish was a good idea hatcheries had proliferated across the pacific northwest after the u s government built the first national hatchery in 1872 in california canada built its first west coast hatchery in 1884 salmon runs were already diminishing but there was no political will to protect or restore habitat fisheries managers declared artificial spawning the price of progress an economic journey measured in dollars mostly benefiting the few who ran timber companies mining operations and canneries when the university of washington launched a fisheries department in 1919 students studied canning technology and fishing methods it took 10 years for the focus to switch to biology and conservation spring the chinook at the centre of return to the river ran a gauntlet of development for almost 500 kilometres that her ancestors had not haig brown wrote there were poisons in it and obstructions across it and false ways leading from it she is terrified when a spillway tosses her to the base of a dam as she swims past vancouver washington and portland oregon the columbia river is a nasty stew containing the foulest of ingredients sewage and industrial waste but the strongest fish make it overburdened with death and decay there was still in it enough life to support their brief passage haig brown wrote salmon nation the pacific northwest region that indigenous communities had successfully managed for thousands of years by understanding what salmon and in turn humans need to thrive a home became a giant experimental lab playing around with salmon ruled the day at cultus lake researchers tested hybridization between salmon species they transplanted eggs far from natal streams and they experimented with fish feed for hatchery fry when beef liver became too expensive as feed researchers compared salmon offal canned salmon and halibut meal nothing was nearly as good as beef liver and halibut meal produced the smallest fish if it didn t outright kill them foerster s 12 year experiment comparing hatchery sockeye and wild runs became a classic in the field of salmon research he showed for the first time in a published scientific paper the language of newcomers to the land that in the early stages of salmon development most fish die as eggs hidden beneath gravel salmon are vulnerable to the fish raccoons and ducks that find them as alevin with yolk sacs still attached to their bodies flies and other small creatures eat them as fry salmon can escape some predators but they re still food for great blue herons bigger fish and other hungry animals foerster also found that artificially fertilized eggs hatched at higher rates than naturally fertilized eggs and he determined that when hatchery managers incubate and release fry juvenile salmon flood a stream more fish there was however a very big but hatchery raised fish were no better at returning from the ocean over the years we ve come to know hatchery salmon often lack the skills to navigate life the way spring does learning life lessons like what to eat not all tiny things in the water are edible and that a dark head against a light sky could be a killer the early advantage for hatchery fish foerster showed failed to hold what then was the point of spending money on artificially raising and feeding salmon when haig brown was writing return to the river at his desk in longhand the hatcheries he worried about were in the u s during spring s return journey when she and her cohort are so close to their home stream they can smell it a wooden rack strung across the river blocks the salmon fisheries managers plan to strip them of eggs and sperm for a new hatchery the fish are restless once more for the 20th time or the 50th time spring came up to the rack she worked along with less patience now turning away from it turning sharply back rolling heavily in the strong current so that her back showed and went down before the quickening movement of her tail by 1934 understanding that running a hatchery was about the same as tossing cash directly into the ocean the bureaucratic precursor to fisheries and oceans canada decided against them in 1937 canada s federally run hatcheries closed fisheries scientists in alaska confirmed foerster s findings and alaska hatcheries closed too in the book making salmon historian joseph taylor points out that closing the hatcheries was a victory for fiscal restraint that masqueraded as a triumph for science foerster presented his work at a 1929 fisheries conference in seattle washington as the depression deepened and government budgets shrank so did enthusiasm for hatcheries but it was a lot easier to close them where spawning habitat remained relatively intact in b c and alaska farther south a mishmash of jurisdictions a cozy relationship with industry and a larger population clamouring for more development and more hydroelectric power cemented hatcheries as the fisheries policy of choice it s not that b c has no dams but there are fewer than in the u s northwest in the 1950s haig brown led a commission that studied the environmental effects of building a dam just over 300 kilometres from the mouth of the fraser river in b c to build a dam he wrote was a betrayal of salmon and their meaning that the fish s value was far more than economic and preserving the salmon was an act of faith in the future the dam project died taylor a fisherman turned academic teaches history at simon fraser university early on he says hatcheries were simply a political panacea fish culture emerged as a default solution to a problem around the politics of land use taylor says that s really the story but by the 1960s hatcheries had stuck around long enough for managers to be lulled into thinking technological improvements new drugs to control disease better feed would make the next wave of hatcheries the best thing in fisheries since the invention of the boat engine but really it s more like a stubborn belief that salvation lies in technology and that trumped good old fashioned conservation haig brown always insisted that streams needed protection but he also felt the siren call of technology and its promise of problem solving in return to the river the main human character the senator believes the fisheries biologists he meets these white coated young men were the symbol of america s salvation by the time haig brown updated an edition of fisherman s fall in 1975 the annual catch in most salmon fishing countries was dropping again i am convinced that the only thing that can restore the sport to its former splendor is more fish and i am equally convinced that it is perfectly possible to have more fish he wrote if better technology could produce more fish he was in in 1974 peter larkin the first provincial fisheries biologist in b c wrote an influential essay play it again sam an essay on salmon enhancement that s equal parts enthusiastic and skeptical larkin spells out the foibles humans might bring to hatcheries and other means of boosting fish populations the lack of continuity in research the lack of true experimentation and muddy goals but as larkin noted politically salmon enhancement is a natural the other option was to cut the fishery larkin called salmon enhancement a gamble but one worth taking canada reversed its earlier decision and gambled that technology could restore populations and double the annual commercial catch by 2005 launching the salmonid enhancement program in 1977 they funded hatcheries and spawning channels and fertilized lakes and streams to promote the growth of fish food in the early 1980s the university of british columbia hired ray hilborn today a well known fisheries scientist at uw with funding provided by the sep it was a total failure hilborn says of the program the catch went down it did nothing to improve canadian fisheries he says though he adds that it s tough to say what would have happened without the program still by 2005 the commercial catch had almost halved from 1970s levels at 31 811 tonnes or 54 6 per cent of the average by 2019 the catch was 3 423 tonnes or about five per cent of the catch 42 years before alaska like b c revisited its hatchery policy in the 1970s amid salmon declines and officials there also decided the time had come to invest in salmon enhancement in washington already dotted with hatcheries a year after the sep launched the state began its own program to double the salmon harvest through hatcheries runs were on the decline and again reducing fishing pressure is never popular even if it s the right thing to do plus a series of court rulings that gave indigenous communities back their rights to fish apparently panicked fisheries managers the state poured 30 million into tribal programs over more than 10 years tribes built their own hatcheries to guarantee access enshrined in treaties and through the law courts to salmon these hatcheries keep alive indigenous cultural practices larkin wisely surmised that the rush to build hatcheries and other enhancements was swept in on a prevailing mood of optimism that this time things would be different in one blow two problems could be solved larkin wrote in 1979 how to find enough fish to occupy the fleet and how to compensate for the loss of salmon habitat larkin s advice to avoid past mistakes was often disregarded as hilborn notes today and in many papers in the past ideas around monitoring outcomes and specifying clear measurable goals fail to stick when it comes to many hatcheries and other salmon enhancements by 1994 an economist concluded that the economic costs of the sep would exceed the benefits by c 600 million as haig brown hoped more fish swim the ocean but they re not evenly distributed geographically overall salmon catches increased between the 1970s and 2010s russia s total catch increased by 4 9 times and the u s catch mostly in alaska went up 2 6 times in japan and b c catches decreased whether fishers were harvesting wild or hatchery salmon in fact japan s catch is almost entirely hatchery chum salmon the canadian catch from 2019 to 2021 looks to be only 6 1 per cent of the 1970s average nor is the wealth of fish evenly distributed across species in a 2018 study fisheries scientist greg ruggerone and dfo scientist jim irvine shocked those who pay attention to salmon with the fact that the north pacific hosted more salmon in 2015 than in 1925 when foerster was at cultus lake but the problem was nearly 70 per cent of those fish were pink salmon ruggerone says in 2018 and 2019 more pinks returned to spawn than any year the scientists studied it was just phenomenal he says and troublesome for other salmon species over a 15 year time frame ruggerone and his colleagues found that hatchery chinook from the salish sea in washington state saw a 60 per cent reduction in survival in the years they compete for food with the odd year pinks it s quite dramatic he says manufactured pinks are duking it out in the ocean with wild fish and competing with other hatchery fish that may have a better reason for being there conservation hatcheries sometimes offer the last hope for particular runs of fish for instance russian river coho in northern california snake river fall chinook in idaho and okanagan river sockeye in b c those conservation efforts paying attention to genetics using locally adapted broodstock raising juveniles in enriched environments among others are paying off though barely for russian river coho a whiff of desperation haunts hatcheries a strong whiff of nostalgia haunts return to the river in 1941 haig brown knew he was witnessing a fundamental change to the environment and the fishery the senator is like the author a fly fisherman and an adept naturalist who watches salmon probably more often than he catches them but like so many the senator acquiesced to progress for one more year they would spawn as they were meant to spawn and fry and fingerlings would grow from their spawning as they were meant to grow from the natural abundance of the river and the rack might go out again or they might decide against using it another year he played with his hopes but he felt in his heart he was seeing the end of it the last natural spawning of the chinooks that belonged to his river here we are today 80 years later with an upended environment and with a grim duty to look around take our bearings and say well where do we go from here as larkin wrote clear goals are important more fish however proved a simplistic problematic and greedy goal hatcheries are not cures for what ails salmon nation they are interventions that if used judiciously may offer life support to a few patients sunsetting hatcheries because wild fish are thriving would be the ultimate success story to restore salmon populations requires a thoughtful long term vision habitat restoration is key and in some instances a conservation hatchery that keeps distinct salmon populations alive during the long process of undoing extensive damage to watersheds also across the board policies that separate hatchery fish and wild fish could give the fish more breathing room in their habitats it s feasible hilborn says you can move the run timing of a hatchery stock quite readily it doesn t take much selection to get them to come earlier or make them come later to cleave apart wild from hatchery fish and the different populations would mean a fundamental shift in the style of commercial fishing moving toward terminal fisheries in which weirs or traps rather than hooks and nets catch fish in the river on their way home to spawn once standard practice from alaska to northern california and in japan and russia weirs allow for more targeted fishing on the lower klamath river in oregon and california for instance indigenous managers erected a weir for 10 days during peak chinook migration leaving it open at night to allow migration upriver to spawning grounds and to other communities with weirs fishers can aim for hatchery fish identifiable by a clipped adipose fin an experimental fish trap near the mouth of the columbia river in oregon is a new take on the old technology guiding fish into a trap where they can swim freely and fishers can select which fish to harvest a weir could also help separate vulnerable wild salmon populations from the healthy ones once a genetic baseline is established you could do real time dna testing that technology is available says michael price who studies salmon on the skeena river on b c s north coast i know this is a difficult thing to say because you don t ever want to necessarily trade one livelihood for another but if you move more of that fishery into the river you still have commercial fisheries but they re more selective the lax kw alaams band has proposed fitting a fish trap on the skeena river where an abundance of hatcheries and artificial spawning channels has led to lower salmon diversity roughly 70 per cent of the sockeye heading home come from one of those enhancements as hilborn points out none of those solutions addresses the disease or competition issues nor can anyone control the ocean but managers can control hatchery fish right now there is no shared vision across the five countries on the role of hatchery fish randall peterman a fisheries scientist and professor emeritus at simon fraser university has called for international co operation since the early 1980s almost 40 years ago peterman and his colleagues had already noted the competition between salmon populations in the ocean b c sockeye came back smaller and less abundant in years when the bristol bay alaska sockeye were abundant any efforts at enhancing sockeye populations were a classic case of the law of diminishing returns the effort and money sunk into enhancement did not translate into consistently more fish and there have been numerous papers documenting that international linkage since then peterman says so this is not a country specific problem it s an international problem only in the past couple of decades has salmon research focused on the ocean now more unpredictable with climate change salmon are definitely responding to warming waters pinks are having their day in the sun while chinook and coho populations sputter along the fundamental problem with chinook and coho is ocean survival hilborn says you won t solve that through stream restoration the miracle fish read more it seems logical that easing the burden on wild fish would interest all salmon nations we need to be thinking in those terms peterman says you can t continue to pump out fish into a common pasture the ocean and expect continuous commensurate benefits back in 1984 peterman proposed a way to keep track of hatchery fish create an international body to monitor and co ordinate salmon enhancement funded by a tax on each juvenile salmon released countries pumping out the most fish would bear most of the cost today peterman muses about a cap and trade system similar to the one used by b c to control carbon emissions all five countries belong to the north pacific anadromous fish commission that organization however has no authority to regulate hatcheries says president doug mecum the npafc enforces a drift net ban and shares information on production and survival trends of salmon among members fundamentally each country is responsible for and has authority over their own programs mecum says ideally the different parties would come together in a forum on some sort of ongoing basis and say well how are things going for your program and for your program he says and have you thought about this and have you thought about that and can we have a conversation around that it sounds great but i don t know how you would do it plus some scientists remain skeptical that ocean capacity is a problem dfo suppresses science and pushes salmon farms critics tell mps read more salmon hatcheries are the sum of poor choices made over 150 years by fisheries managers often having no idea what they didn t know about salmon habitat and the ocean magical thinking is no substitute for humility even larkin when making a case for salmon enhancement wrote but natural systems being what they are there is always a good chance that our best efforts will turn out to do more harm than good the number of hatchery fish outmuscling wild in the north pacific is not catastrophic not yet the proportion of pink hatchery salmon for example is only 15 per cent of the total pinks in the north pacific but what if that percentage grows fisheries managers have faced political pressures and economic pressures countless times in the past managers don t act soon enough the crisis is upon them and then finally they act but it s often too late peterman says here s a case where we can get in sooner than usual we just need to get ahead of this one if history is a guidebook getting ahead of a crisis seems damn near impossible in his beloved classic from 1946 a river never sleeps haig brown wrote the salmon runs more surely and easily than almost any other resource can be made to last and serve indefinitely can even be grown back to or beyond their full glory will we let them next can we have too much pink salmon pumped by the billions into the north pacific these hatchery fish are upending marine ecosystems
any discussion on permanent work from home must be prefaced by noting wfh isn t merely a first world issue but one that is relevant to a relatively small cohort of people for the vast majority of workers such as nurses teachers chefs truck drivers and manufacturers working from home is impossible musk s edict simply brings in line tesla s office workers with its far larger manufacturing staff who never had the luxury of permanently working from home the entire debate centres on mostly well paid highly educated employees who are likely to be closer to the top 1 per cent than the bottom wealth status aside wfh advocates argue that permanent remote work allows for greater flexibility and converts wasted hours of commuting into well deserved leisure time but simply because some people love staying in tracksuits turning on zoom and not opening the front door other than for their uber eats delivery that doesn t make it a net positive advertisement my kids love watching their ipads and eating chocolate but that doesn t mean they should spend all day watching bluey and eating easter eggs when you start thinking about second order effects permanent work from home as opposed to allowing flexibility when required is a terrible idea why working from home is bad for you finishing at 4 30pm to make dinner and watch netflix may sound like fun but there is increasing data that shows employees who work from home are suffering from increased loneliness and isolation as well as being unable to detach from work a study by the american psychiatric association found that most workers experience negative mental health effects those impacts are even more pronounced for people living alone but it s not just mental health that suffers the ability to progress a career is materially jeopardised by working from home the best way to get a promotion is to be close to the person doing the promoting advertisement not only do younger team members lose the ability to learn they also lose the chance to showcase their abilities work from home is perfect for task fillers people who are content in their role but don t want to create real value or show initiative it robs ambitious younger team members of the opportunity to grow but the far more insidious element of working from home for team members isn t the loss of opportunity but the ability for businesses to use wfh as the ultimate bait and switch that is if your job can be done from brighton or parramatta or chatswood it can probably also be done from bangalore or johannesburg for a lot cheaper for employers seeking to reduce labour costs working from home gives them the perfect opportunity to trial and slowly implement a remote workforce this is already slowly happening in some large australian organisations but working from home isn t just bad for team members it s also bad for business advertisement why working from home is bad for business the loss of productivity with staff out of the office has been well documented but far worse than losing face time is losing the ability to collaborate the capacity to feed off the energy enthusiasm and ideas of colleagues creates real magic in a workplace when team members become task fillers organisations no longer create and evolve but become what jeff bezos would call day two businesses those experiencing stagnation followed by irrelevance followed by excruciating painful decline the biggest problem for business though especially in a labour market that remains highly constrained is that wfh commoditises your workforce a software developer or accountant working from home is far more likely to accept a slightly more lucrative job offer why because they no longer have any intrinsic connection to their employer research shows that having friends at work significantly increases engagement and unsurprisingly loyalty smart employers use the office environment not as a cost centre but as a retention tool a means to differentiate their employment brand from competitors advertisement real connections with colleagues are far more important to most people than a pay rise working from home makes that connection almost impossible unsurprisingly since we mandated four days a week in the office earlier this year we haven t seen a single regretted departure there have however been multiple regretted resignations from team members with agreed flexible working arrangements as benjamin graham observed in the short term the market is a voting machine in the long term it s a weighing machine the employment market is no different like a weighing machine what will happen in the coming years is ambitious intelligent hard working and creative people will return to offices around the world businesses that work hard to create the best environments will soak up this talent others like the big lazy corporates or government bodies will attract a different type of worker the task filler and that s fine too what does the sharemarket think about the future of working from home zoom the ultimate work from home stock has seen its share price slump more than 80 per cent it is now trading lower than when the pandemic started adam schwab is an author and co founder of global travel business luxury escapes

a new study finds dysfunction can be highly contagious in the workplace and leaders who behave badly can change the norms of what is expected and permissible and sometimes pollute the entire work ecosystem nichelle carpenter an associate professor of human resource management in the rutgers university school of management and labor relations said a review of 70 studies involving more than 7 000 workplace units and 391 000 employees found multiple factors can influence the behavior of entire teams and even departments in a company she said in many workplaces leaders are essentially the role models for what is considered appropriate behavior and if a leader is abusive over time it can become something that more and more workers are engaging in the impact of a nasty boss she said if a boss or supervisor is abusive nasty or negative it can cause widespread dysfunctional interpersonal behaviors in employees that could mean people engaging in bullying behaviors towards fellow teammates but it also results in dysfunctional behaviors towards the organization so like theft sabotage increased absenteeism she said she noted it can also cause workplace aggression verbal or physical and in some instances employees misusing confidential information getty stock she said when people feel they are not treated fairly then it s more likely workers are going to take out some of those frustrations on either each other or on the organization itself productivity drops she said as these negative behaviors become more prevalent there is usually an accompanying decrease in productivity and a drop in customer satisfaction maybe people take longer to respond to customer questions or concerns people might actually engage in some of these dysfunctional behaviors towards customers she said carpenter pointed out in these kinds of situations there may also be a higher employee turnover rate because many people will not feel comfortable working in this type of toxic environment the study also found organizations that follow best practices for staffing training and performance management are a lot less likely to have widespread dysfunction she said traditionally when these kinds of problems arise the focus has been on a single individual but the study suggests the entire context of a workplace situation needs to be looked at and considered the study was published in the journal of management another rutgers study published in the journal of organizational behavior examines how adopting a bottom line mentality can short circuit work teams that study found when the leader of a team focuses too narrowly on a single goal such as opening new customer accounts generating more marketing leads or increasing sales revenue everything else goes out the window and productivity is stifled david matthau is a reporter for new jersey 101 5 you can reach him at david matthau townsquaremedia com click here to contact an editor about feedback or a correction for this story see the must drive roads in every state nj county fairs make a comeback check out the schedule for 2022 updated 4 10 a current list of county fairs happening across the garden state for 2022 from rides food animals and hot air balloons each county fair has something unique to offer fairs are listed in geographical order from south nj to north nj
peak inflation or peak dollar by stefan gleason web posted june 6 2022 talk of peak inflation is helping to drive investor inflows back into stock and bond markets as the narrative goes inflation readings have hit their highs for the year the federal reserve will hike rates until monetary policy normalizes then declare victory over the very problem its policies unleashed this rosy scenario gained some traction in late may after the government reported personal consumption expenditures data the fed s preferred core pce measure came in at 4 9 annually in april down from 5 2 in the previous month conveniently for central bankers and wall street cheerleaders the core rate excludes volatile food and energy prices unfortunately for those who live in the real world there are no signs that food and energy prices are done rising per gallon gasoline costs hit fresh records across the country over memorial day weekend and officials in europe are warning of energy shortages and power blackouts extending into the winter meanwhile africa faces a looming famine after critical grain supplies from russia and ukraine have been cut off other parts of the world face poor harvests due to drought united nations secretary general antonio guterres said on may 18th that the spectre of a global food shortage haunts the global economy perhaps some americans will take heart in the fact that any price spikes in foodstuffs and fuel will be excluded from core inflation but nobody who feels the impact of these rising costs on their household budget should be convinced that inflation has peaked even if cost pressures do peak at some point this year inflation as measured officially or unofficially will almost certainly remain elevated above the fed s 2 target federal reserve notes will continue depreciating and they may even begin to depreciate more rapidly against foreign currencies the u s dollar index hit a multi year peak of 104 9 on may 11th the buck had been rallying strangely at the same time as it was losing purchasing power at the fastest rate in decades over the past couple weeks though the federal reserve note has slid against the euro and other major fiat currencies if phony dollar strength has indeed peaked that may help send the message more broadly to investors that cash is no safe haven the safest currency in an environment where fiat currencies are all depreciating in real terms is hard currency that means gold and silver the ultimate alternative to all paper and digital assets we are likely far from a secular peak in gold and silver prices in terms of u s dollars silver would need to more than double from here just to match its previous high and gold has yet to experience the sort of parabolic move seen in other commodities this year but regardless of where nominal prices head next owners of physical bullion can rest comfortably knowing that their form of money will retain real value over time stefan gleason is president of money metals exchange the company recently named best overall online precious metals dealer by investopedia a graduate of the university of florida gleason is a seasoned business leader investor political strategist and grassroots activist gleason has frequently appeared on national television networks such as cnn foxnews and cnbc and in hundreds of publications such as the wall street journal thestreet and seeking alpha home

the proposal by senate democrats aims to keep more water in california s rivers and streams to benefit endangered species of fish sacramento calif after decades of fighting farmers in court over how much water they can take out of california s rivers and streams some state lawmakers want to try something different use taxpayer money to buy out farmers a proposal in the state senate would spend up to 1 5 billion to buy senior water rights that allow farmers to take as much water as needed from the state s rivers and streams to grow their crops if state officials owned those rights they could leave the water in the rivers to benefit endangered species of salmon and other fish california has been mired in drought for most of the last two decades prompting intense scrutiny of the state s complex water system and how it might be modified to ensure steady supplies during exceptionally dry periods including a separate state proposal that would pay farmers to grow fewer crops to save water current readings show about 98 of the state has severe drought conditions as california heads into summer months that rarely produce any significant precipitation many areas have begun restricting water use for homeowners largely by reducing outdoor use such as lawn irrigation and farmers have had their allocation from the two major state owned water systems reduced in some cases down to zero legally all of the water in california is the property of the government but farmers have water rights that let them take water for agriculture farmers have used those rights governed by a complicated system based on seniority and other factors to turn california s central valley into an agricultural powerhouse that provides much of the nation s fruits nuts and vegetables but siphoning off all that water also has disrupted the fragile ecosystem of the san joaquin sacramento river delta the largest estuary on the west coast and home to endangered salmon and other fish environmental groups and farmers have battled for years over state and federal rules governing just how much water can be diverted for agriculture which uses far more water than any other sector of the economy now with california having a record budget surplus of nearly 100 billion democrats in the state senate have proposed using up to 1 5 billion to buy senior water rights by either buying the land associated with the rights buying just the right itself or putting an easement on the land that requires the water to be used for fish and other fauna and flora the proposal is part of budget negotiations between lawmakers and gov gavin newsom s administration that should wrap up by the end of this month it s like we re taking a page from corporate america and we re buying back stock said state sen bob wieckowski a democrat who represents the san francisco bay area and is chair of a budget subcommittee overseeing environmental spending while 1 5 billion sounds like a lot of money it wouldn t buy that much water regulators measure water by acre foot defined as enough water to cover 1 acre 0 4 hectares of land to a depth of 1 foot 30 centimeters that s the equivalent of 325 851 gallons 1 2 million liters a typical household uses 1 acre foot of water each year farmers collectively use up to 35 million acre feet of water each year according to the water education foundation the 1 5 billion would be enough to buy about 200 000 acre feet of water based on an average price of 7 500 per acre foot according to tom birmingham general manager of westlands water district the largest agricultural water district in the country still birmingham says the idea makes an awful lot of sense because it is a means by which conflict can be avoided right now the only way to get more water flowing in rivers and streams is to get state and federal regulators to change the rules they can do that by requiring more water be left in rivers and streams but that means less water for farmers those rule changes often prompt lawsuits which can take a decade or longer to resolve said lester snow a former secretary of the california natural resources agency and regional director of the u s bureau of reclamation we need a way to take much quicker action and i think acquiring water rights for that purpose is one of the ways to do that he said with climate change we just don t have that kind of time for this to work farmers would have to voluntarily sell their valuable water rights something birmingham says shouldn t be a problem lots of farmers try to sell their water rights to westlands water district every year birmingham said for many farmers their children simply are not interested in continuing to farm birmingham said but state sen brian dahle a republican running for governor whose family has been farming in california for 92 years said the only reason farmers would be willing to sell is because state officials are driving them out of business with burdensome regulations this makes my blood boil it s ridiculous dahle told his colleagues during a legislative hearing on the proposal you are forcing them into a corner where they have no other option john mcmanus executive director of the golden state salmon association said as with any legislative proposal the devil will be in the details he said he d want to see rules that make sure any additional water purchased by the state will remain in the rivers and not be removed by someone else with water rights farther downstream but he is hopeful the program will work because he said there are about six native fish species that are on life support right now because we don t have enough water flowing through the delta so anything that can be done to address that problem is appreciated he said
