as the heir to the throne the prince of wales has always needed to surround himself with clever courtiers and king charles cancer diagnosis has made that need even more urgent the completely unnecessary controversy over prince william s mothering sunday photograph of his wife the princess of wales and their three children was a clear demonstration that he is not receiving wise advice after some of the world s biggest picture agencies were forced to kill the image over fears it had been digitally manipulated sources at kensington palace were quick to suggest it was not edited by officials catherine then felt the need to post a personal apology on social media the following morning accepting all the blame herself like many amateur photographers i occasionally experiment with editing she explained i wanted to express my apologies for any confusion caused by the family photo we shared yesterday i hope everyone who celebrated had a really happy mother s day when the photo of kate with the children was handed to her officials they should have scrutinized it i m told william and kate are still haunted by the tragic death of a nurse at a hospital where catherine was treated in 2012 making it clear that the apology was from her alone she signed the statement with a c for catherine as i made clear in our special edition of the daily mail s hit show palace confidential on monday it was wrong for catherine to be thrown under a bus in this way the couple s handsomely paid communications experts are responsible for photographs issued by kensington palace whoever happens to be holding the camera they should have taken the blame their communications secretary lee thompson who was appointed to great fanfare in 2022 must be an expert in public relations why did this supposed pr spinner who previously worked for america s nbc television group allow catherine to make a personal mea culpa instead of issuing a statement from kensington palace it seems to me that he and other senior officials seem more anxious to avoid tarnishing their own reputations than to protect our future queen as she recovers from major surgery even if we accept that catherine altered the photograph when it was handed over to her officials who had no doubt encouraged her to share such a happy picture they should have scrutinized it in his senior position thompson would have known that media organizations are increasingly concerned about the digital manipulation of images british newspapers will not run news photographs that have been altered in this way kate and communications secretary lee thompson at a polo event in surrey last year have you made any changes to the picture thompson could have asked his boss or indeed are you sure you don t want to wear your wedding rings given the ridiculous online speculation so why does this royal couple have such a strong instinct to protect their staff from public criticism instead it was catherine with typical generosity and kindness who assumed full responsibility i am told she and william are still haunted by the tragic death of a nurse at a hospital where catherine was treated in 2012 jacintha saldanha who worked at king edward vii s hospital in marylebone london took her own life three days after falling for a prank call by two australian radio djs posing as the queen and prince charles she had transferred the call to a colleague who was looking after catherine the conversation that the two thieves subsequently had with the other nurse about the duchess s state of health was broadcast by the station ms saldanha who was from india left three handwritten notes one of which blamed the radio stunt for her death in an email to her colleague she wrote this is all my fault and i feel very bad that this involves you please accept my apology prince william wrote a moving letter to his family afterwards saying jacintha and her colleagues looked after us really well and i m just so sorry that someone who cared so much for others found herself in such a desperate situation william and catherine s friends tell me that mrs saldanha s death made a deep impression on them the tragedy made the couple even more determined that no one working for them should ever be publicly humiliated i hope william makes sure he appoints officials who are willing to ask tough questions and give him unwelcome advice there should be no room in the palace for yes men sign up for richard s palace confidential newsletter

text size this story is part of the may 22 edition of sunday life see all 12 stories there is a line in hollywood interviews where questions about the subject s work life and personal life intersect how they are navigated depends on everyone s mood in the moment though pr minders notoriously dislike them but as actor jennifer connelly and i ease into a conversation about her new film top gun maverick we begin with a definitely work related question is tom cruise a good kisser for a split second the question takes her by surprise it is a work related question i assure her as she is playing the love interest to the film franchise s star tom cruise in the long awaited top gun sequel i honestly can t the 51 year old begins before laughing at my somewhat improbable logic there is no way to answer that question it s an impossible question to answer jennifer finally declares i will say it was such a satisfying moment in their relationship and so earned jennifer says so i really liked that i really liked the moment and how it was shot and tom cruise was a wonderful person to work with he has a very strong presence he has a lot of magnetism he s also incredibly engaged in what he s doing if he s talking to you he s incredibly engaged in that conversation and present that s really striking to say top gun maverick has been decades in the making would be an understatement the original top gun was released in 1986 and starred cruise as pilot pete maverick mitchell val kilmer as tom iceman kazansky and anthony edwards as nick goose bradshaw maverick s best friend those characters and their interactions are writ large in pop culture the sequel picks up some three decades later when maverick now involved romantically with jennifer s character penny benjamin is called back to duty to train young pilots for a new mission one of them is bradley rooster bradshaw miles teller goose s son an encounter which forces both men to reckon with their grief jennifer connelly plays penny benjamin alongside tom cruise as captain pete maverick mitchell in top gun maverick i thought in the original the storyline with goose that it was dramatic and moving but i do think that there s something especially poignant about this storyline between maverick and goose s son jennifer says and maybe that is appropriate for the point in his life in which we meet maverick in this chapter it does seem to feel like he s taking stock of the way he s relevant who he is what he has left to do what he needs to confront it is quite self reflective i love that about the film i thought it gave the movie its own reason to be beyond just being an homage advertisement on the kleenex index of emotion churning stories we could give it a score of three and a half perhaps four out of five the film s director joseph kosinski has beautifully woven two threads the fast paced mission story but also the more personal story which involves jennifer s character penny into one i can t remember him precisely articulating how the stories fit together jennifer says but we did talk about how she fits into his life who she is to him and who he is to her i like their story i like that we had heard mention of this woman so we know she s always been in his life and they have clearly moved in and out of each other s lives a few times in the early 1980s still in her early teens jennifer landed two roles which had a huge impact on her fledgling career the first was in once upon a time in america directed by sergio leone a legendary crime thriller directed by a legendary director it was followed by phenomena directed by another italian auteur the horror master dario argento loading early in her career jennifer was known for supporting roles in films such as jim henson s fantasy labyrinth 1986 which also starred david bowie the neo noir crime thriller mulholland falls 1996 alex proyas s dark city 1998 which was filmed in sydney and ron howard s a beautiful mind 2001 for which she won the oscar for best supporting actress she stepped away from film around the time of her first child s birth in 1997 returning several years later to more complex leading roles such as the traumatised dahlia in the horror psychological thriller dark water 2005 grief damaged mother grace in reservation road 2007 and the mentally unstable virginia in dustin lance black s virginia 2010 i don t tend to think of things in general as being that binary jennifer says referring to the two acts into which i have carved her filmography certainly things have changed but then i started working as a child so the roles have changed because it would be weird advertisement i think there have been more chapters than just two jennifer says but if i were going to split my career into two chapters then the shift would probably be when i really consciously took on making movies as my own choice and that happened once i became a mum when i bring up the subject of her husband british actor paul bettany jennifer s face is infused with warmth still she s not sure how to explain the magic of him you may have noticed that i m bad at picking one thing one moment that was the turning point one quality that defines and so on she says i struggle to think in those singular terms i have met paul i tell her and always found him charming the stuff one sees what he presents he is that jennifer says he s a really generous person with his love and his kindness i think that is something people feel in public people that he works with i think he makes people feel appreciated and cared for and loved that is genuine and in his personal life he is that way he s a remarkably good friend and i think all of his friends would say that about him she adds he s always there always available always someone they can rely on so i think that s one quality that you see and is actually the way he is and i think it s one of the really special things about him connelly believes enormous ground has been gained in the wake of the metoo movement credit paola kudacki trunk archive snapper images jennifer has three children son kai from a relationship with photographer david dugan and two children with paul son stellan and daughter agnes what i ve learnt so far as a parent is that every relationship is different she says it s so hard to make these general statements because the relationships that i have with each of my three kids is so different because of the things that we ve gone through and they came here as such different people as an actor in hollywood jennifer has always pushed for a louder voice in terms of the work she is doing and she believes enormous ground has been gained in the wake of the metoo movement things are still far from ideal but the improvement she says has been substantial advertisement i think there s still room for things to go further but i do think things have changed jennifer says i ve had experiences and i won t say the experiences i ve had where i ve read something a change in a script and said i don t think you can position a woman in this way they didn t necessarily see it but they re open to hearing that conversation and that point of view and that s great the culture of film sets has changed too she says especially how intimacy scenes are filmed that there are now intimacy co ordinators on film sets which never existed before i mean it was crazy before in the 80s people just went la la la and pretended it wasn t happening now everything is discussed and agreed upon connelly says the introduction of intimacy co ordinators on set has been a big step in changing the culture in the 80s people just went la la la and pretended it wasn t happening now everything is discussed and agreed upon it is also valuable she says not to over emphasise the moment so it s still possible to have a scene in a movie which has intimacy and it s still a scene so it s not real life any more than the rest of it is real life for now jennifer is pleased that top gun maverick is finally making it to theatres it was filmed in 2018 and 2019 and its planned release in 2020 was delayed by the pandemic there were re shoots and there was additional filming so it doesn t feel that long to me jennifer says everything about this pandemic was nothing like anything any of us had experienced so it didn t feel particular to this film and its release but i am glad it s coming out and that we ll be able to go to movie theatres to see it top gun maverick is in cinemas may 26 to read more from sunday life magazine click here
amsterdam in may 2022 dana lixenberg 1964 amsterdam returns to revisiting an archive in 1989 lixenberg then still a novice photographer moved to new york where she quickly gained international recognition for her work for magazines such as newsweek vibe new york times magazine the new yorker and rolling stone as well as with personal projects after returning to amsterdam in 2018 lixenberg revisited the polaroids she had made between 1993 as 2010 as a regular part of her photo shoots and which now stirred memories of meetings journeys and collaborations these polaroids are now presented for the first time in the publication polaroid 54 59 79 which is created with designer and publisher roger willems of roma publications the form and content of the eponymous exhibition in huis marseille closely follows this publication an ode to the polaroid the exhibition takes us back to the heyday of printed media and the last period in which its photography was predominantly analogue polaroid 54 59 79 refers to the type names of the peel apart film that lixenberg was using at the time these prints had a characteristic materiality and a unique colour palette when the polaroid corporation went bankrupt in 2008 halting the production of 4 5 peel apart polaroids its impact was enormous fuji continued producing colour peel apart film for a while and when lixenberg s stock of polaroids ran out after two years she proceeded to use fuji s instant film but fuji as well as today s generation of polaroid manufacturers never managed to equal the quality of the original polaroids also on artdaily maureen paley opens an apparent brightness by esther pearl watson at morena di luna the polaroid cassette fitted into the same 4 5 field camera that lixenberg used to make her photographs the instant polaroids served as a test and reference material for lighting and composition if necessary lixenberg showed them to her subjects to gain their trust but more often she would hide the pictures during the shoot to avoid any unrest nearly always she would give away one or more polaroids as a keepsake and for this reason few if any of these remain for some of the shoots the image quality of the polaroid pictures was not the photographer s aim nor was it a selection criterion for inclusion in the book or this exhibition a good polaroid could really frustrate me because it meant i had missed that specific emotion on film lixenberg explains she made her polaroid tests in between shooting usually in black and white to keep the development time to a minimum some she pulled open too soon or too quickly leaving them underdeveloped or with uneven patches and others were marked by notes scratches or fingerprints traces of the photo shoot that attested to the uniqueness of the polaroids and to their utilitarian function a portrait of the united states the collection of polaroids reflects the american culture lixenberg encountered in the 1990s and 2000s the images make us aware of the passing of time since our view of some of the public figures in the photos is inextricably coloured by our knowledge of the course of their later lives for instance lixenberg photographed an album cover for whitney houston who died in 2012 and a then young donald trump in 1998 for new york magazine with hundreds of photos the exhibition polaroid 54 59 79 presents a portrait of the united states between 1993 and 2010 an ode to the polaroid film and an intimate glimpse into the work process of one of the most renowned photographers in the netherlands dana

submerged under rising seas in 2015 lixenberg s lifetime achievement imperial courts 1993 2015 a portrait series on the residents of a public housing project in the watts district of los angeles was

any investment that has generated wealth since before the coronation must have firm foundations that is true for the 36 investment trusts that predate the queen s accession to the throne they have survived the stock market crashes that peppered the early 1970s october 1987 black monday 2000 the bursting of the dotcom bubble 2008 and 2020 in the wake of the pandemic some of the oldest trusts have invested customers money through the reign of six monarchs so what is the secret to their longevity looking ahead among the 36 trusts in existence longer than the queen s reign some could provide excellent future returns the earliest trusts were created under queen victoria to allow ordinary investors to benefit from global industrial expansion foreign colonial was the first established in 1868 and investing in government bonds from across the world including south america later scottish american funded the construction of the us railways while scottish mortgage offered mortgages to malaysian plantation owners who produced the rubber used in the tyres of the model t ford car several trusts have the word scottish in their name as they were founded so that dundee merchants who were profiting from a boom in sales of jute a natural fibre had somewhere to stash their money john newlands an investment trust historian says f c was started to give the investor of moderate means a chance to make money it is a role the trust still fulfils he says fads fashions and arcane financial schemes have come and gone over the past 70 years but investment trusts have survived and thrived based on granite like foundations since their inception the assets held by the uk s oldest trusts have changed for example f c s biggest holdings are now shares in tech giants microsoft alphabet and apple while scottish mortgage holds covid vaccine maker moderna and electric car giant tesla in its portfolio myron jobson head of personal finance at investment platform interactive investor says the trusts nimbleness to adapt to fundamental economic shifts by changing the investments they favour confirms the robustness of their strategy annabel brodie smith a director of the association of investment companies says portfolio changes prove the ability of these stalwarts to adapt she adds it s reassuring for investors to see that over the last 70 years investment companies have survived bouts of market turbulence platinum performances according to investment platform aj bell over the past 20 years scottish mortgage has turned 1 000 into 13 150 blackrock smaller companies founded in 1906 as the north british canadian investment company has turned the same sum into 9 349 no trusts predating the queen s accession would have lost money over 20 years the lowest return is 106 3 per cent from aberdeen diversified income growth james carthew investment trust specialist at fund data group quoteddata agrees the flexibility older trusts have shown has been key to their success saying one of the strengths is their ability to adapt to changing market environments an independent board steers the trust hiring and firing investment managers adapting objectives and driving down management fees however carthew says most of the older trusts focus on equities so investors wanting to invest in different types of assets such as property infrastructure and renewable energy will need to look at newer trusts kyle caldwell fund specialist at interactive investor says people must also be aware that investment trusts have features making them riskier than competing vehicles such as unit trusts or open ended investment companies the managers can borrow money to increase a trust s exposure to equities improving returns if stock markets are rising but perpetuate losses if share prices are sliding and because trusts are traded on the stock market their share price may not fully reflect the value of the underlying assets he says they were once derided as dinosaurs run by fuddy duddies but 70 years since the queen s accession to the throne they are thriving rather than becoming extinct the funds to pick among the 36 trusts in existence longer than the queen s reign some could provide excellent future returns caldwell likes uk focused city of london founded in 1891 and run by job curtis since 1991 curtis focuses on high yielding cash generative businesses top holdings

per cent a year shares in scottish mortgage have almost halved from their november 2021 peak but three year returns still stand at 52 per cent carthew says the company s focus on identifying and backing future market leaders should ensure strong long term returns he adds the longevity of these trusts and the strong corporate governance that keeps them focused on the needs of investors makes them ideal long term savings vehicles i d expect most to still be around in 70 years time
hamish mcrae big question at this stage of economic cycle is always the same to what extent is market turmoil a warning of disaster to come where to find safety we have had another of those scary rip roaring weeks that you get in bear markets there was the warning of an apocalyptic rise in food prices by the governor of the bank of england consumer prices were up 9 per cent on a year ago and less publicised but more scary the retail price index was up 11 1 per cent shares in the us slithered down further making this the worst start to a year for something like 80 years and let s not talk any more about bitcoin being a store of value be patient to what extent is the financial market turmoil a warning of economic disaster to come the big question at this stage of the economic cycle is always the same to what extent is the financial market turmoil a warning of economic disaster to come not all bear markets signal economic recession and let s remember that this is a bear market in us high tech companies which because they are so huge affects the entire american investment landscape it is not a bear market in the share price of large uk enterprises for the ftse100 index is just about square on the start of the year nor is it a bear market in uk house prices which are still edging up i think three things are happening one is that the madcap exuberance of the high tech boom is well and truly over companies such as netflix will be ranked on their ability to make profits not to increase the numbers of subscribers real profit matters more than imagined prospects the second which applies to the uk as well as the us is that free money is also over the experiment of near zero interest rates below zero in europe is finished and i suspect will not happen again in our lifetimes and the third is that there is a general awareness that the present bout of disruption has big economic costs that as yet cannot be quantified but these three negative forces will not necessarily result in a serious recession there is a huge difference between the miserable frightening plunge in economic activity that occurred after the financial crash of 2008 with unemployment shooting up or indeed the even nastier recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s and the grungy couple of years that lie ahead so this is certainly a time to look for safety and that is what we will all do but it is not the time to allow ourselves to be frightened even if the governor of the bank of england is frightened enough to use what i think is silly inappropriate language to describe the problems ahead so where is safety well the first area is not one about investment how to manage a stock of wealth it is about income how to ensure the flow of resources the answers will be different for people at different stages of life but the point is the same if you have a secure flow of income you are in a safe position despite whatever happens to your stock of savings there have been many stories about investors mostly young ones who put their savings into cryptocurrencies and have lost the lot that is horrible and i feel angry when i look at the ways in which people were lured into investing in them but if they have solid earnings they have time to dig their way out and safety in savings cash is terrible in that it will lose 10 per cent of its real value in a year bonds are terrible and i have seen some calculations that this has been the worst start to the year for investors in gilts uk government bonds since the 1970s the 30 year bull market in bonds is clearly over and it may well be that there will be a 30 year bear market ahead even if that is overly pessimistic there is no safety there so we come back to the basics that global equities and property have been better investments over the past 150 years than anything else well managed companies produce profits and pay dividends property in growing economies produces rental income and both give some protection against inflation i think in the months ahead it is quite likely that share prices worldwide will slide down further and it is hard to feel confident about property prices either but the big lesson of previous investment cycles is that it is very hard to get the timing right so safety is in spreading risks not selecting a single asset type and safety is being patient to urge patience may not be uplifting sorry about that but at a time like this i think it is wise

regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages what can i do abbvie investors may no

five warning signs the end of dollar hegemony is near it s no secret that china and russia have been stashing away as much gold as possible for many years china is the world s largest producer and buyer of gold russia is number two most of that gold finds its way into the russian and chinese governments treasuries russia has over 2 300 tonnes or nearly 74 million troy ounces of gold one of the largest stashes in the world nobody knows the exact amount of gold china has but most observers believe it is even larger than russia s stash russia and china s gold gives them access to an apolitical neutral form of money with no counterparty risk remember gold has been mankind s most enduring form of money for over 2 500 years because of unique characteristics that make it suitable to store and exchange value gold is durable divisible consistent convenient scarce and most importantly the hardest of all physical commodities in other words gold is the one physical commodity that is the hardest to produce relative to existing stockpiles and therefore the most resistant to inflation that s what gives gold its superior monetary properties russia and china can use their gold to engage in international trade and perhaps back the currencies that s why gold represents a genuine monetary alternative to the us dollar and russia and china have a lot of it today it s clear why china and russia have had an insatiable demand for gold they ve been waiting for the right moment to pull the rug from beneath the us dollar and now is that moment this is a big problem for the us government which reaps an unfathomable amount of power because the us dollar is the world s premier reserve currency it allows the us to print fake money out of thin air and export it to the rest of the world for real goods and services a privileged racket no other country has russia and china s gold could form the foundation of a new monetary system outside of the control of the us such moves would be the final nail in the coffin of dollar dominance five recent developments are a giant flashing red sign that something big could be imminent warning sign 1 russia sanctions prove dollar reserves aren t really money in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine the us government has launched its most aggressive sanctions campaign ever exceeding even iran and north korea russia is now the most sanctioned nation in the world as part of this the us government seized the us dollar reserves of the russian central bank the accumulated savings of the nation it was a stunning illustration of the dollar s political risk the us government can seize another sovereign country s dollar reserves at the flip of a switch the wall street journal in an article titled if russian currency reserves aren t really money the world is in for a shock noted sanctions have shown that currency reserves accumulated by central banks can be taken away with china taking note this may reshape geopolitics economic management and even the international role of the u s dollar russian president putin said the us had defaulted on its obligations and that the dollar is no longer a reliable currency the incident has eroded trust in the us dollar as the global reserve currency and catalyzed significant countries to use alternatives in trade and their reserves china india iran and turkey among other countries announced or already are doing business with russia in their local currencies instead of the us dollar these countries represent a market of over three billion people that no longer need to use the us dollar to trade with one another the us government has incentivized almost half of mankind to find alternatives to the dollar by attempting to isolate russia warning sign 2 rubles gold and bitcoin for gas oil and other commodities russia is the world s largest exporter of natural gas lumber wheat fertilizer and palladium a crucial component in cars it is the second largest exporter of oil and aluminum and the third largest exporter of nickel and coal russia is a major producer and processor of uranium for nuclear power plants enriched uranium from russia and its allies provides electricity to 20 of the homes in the us aside from china russia produces more gold than any other country accounting for more than 10 of global production these are just a handful of examples there are many strategic commodities that russia dominates in short russia is not just an oil and gas powerhouse but a commodity superpower after the us government seized russia s us dollar reserves moscow has little use for the us dollar moscow does not want to exchange its scarce and valuable commodities for politicized money that its rivals can take away on a whim would the us government ever tolerate a situation where the us treasury held its reserves in rubles in russia the head of the russian parliament recently called the us dollar a candy wrapper but not the candy itself in other words the dollar has the outward appearance of money but is not real money that s why russia is no longer accepting us dollars or euros in exchange for its energy they are of no use to russia so instead moscow is demanding payment in rubles that s an urgent problem for europe which cannot survive without russian commodities the europeans have no alternative to russian energy and have no choice but to comply european buyers must now first buy rubles with their euros and use them to pay for russian gas oil and other exports this is a big reason why the ruble has recovered all of the value it lost in the initial days of the ukraine invasion and then made further gains in addition to rubles the top russian energy official said moscow would also accept gold or bitcoin in return for its commodities if they want to buy let them pay either in hard currency and this is gold for us you can also trade bitcoins here s the bottom line us dollars are no longer needed or wanted to buy russian commodities warning sign 3 the petrodollar system flirts with collapse oil is by far the largest and most strategic commodity market for the last 50 years virtually anyone who wanted to import oil needed us dollars to pay for it that s because in the early 70s the us made an agreement to protect saudi arabia in exchange for ensuring among other things all opec producers only accept us dollars for their oil every country needs oil and if foreign countries need us dollars to buy oil they have a compelling reason to hold large dollar reserves this creates a huge artificial market for us dollars and forces foreigners to soak up many of the new currency units the fed creates naturally this gives a tremendous boost to the value of the dollar the system has helped create a deeper more liquid market for the dollar and us treasuries it also allows the us government to keep interest rates artificially low thereby financing enormous deficits it otherwise would be unable to in short the petrodollar system has been the bedrock of the us financial system for the past 50 years but that s all about to change and soon after it invaded ukraine the us government kicked russia out of the dollar system and seized hundreds of billions in dollar reserves of the russian central bank washington has threatened to do the same to china for years these threats helped ensure that china cracked down on north korea didn t invade taiwan and did other things the us wanted these threats against china may be a bluff but if the us government carried them out as it recently did against russia it would be like dropping a financial nuclear bomb on beijing without access to dollars china would struggle to import oil and engage in international trade as a result its economy would come to a grinding halt an intolerable threat to the chinese government china would rather not depend on an adversary like this this is one of the main reasons it created an alternative to the petrodollar system after years of preparation the shanghai international energy exchange ine launched a crude oil futures contract denominated in chinese yuan in 2017 since then any oil producer can sell its oil for something besides us dollars in this case the chinese yuan there s one big issue though most oil producers don t want to accumulate a large yuan reserve and china knows this that s why china has explicitly linked the crude futures contract with the ability to convert yuan into physical gold without touching china s official reserves through gold exchanges in shanghai the world s largest physical gold market and hong kong petrochina and sinopec two chinese oil companies provide liquidity to the yuan crude futures by being big buyers so if any oil producer wants to sell their oil in yuan and gold indirectly there will always be a bid after years of growth and working out the kinks the ine yuan oil future contract is now ready for prime time and now that the us has banned russia from the dollar system there is an urgent need for a credible system capable of handling hundreds of billions worth of oil sales outside of the us dollar and financial system the shanghai international energy exchange is that system back to saudi arabia for nearly 50 years the saudis had always insisted anyone wanting their oil would need to pay with us dollars upholding their end of the petrodollar system but that could all change soon remember china is already the world s largest oil importer moreover the amount of oil it imports continues to grow as it fuels an economy of over 1 4 billion people more than 4x larger than the us china is saudi arabia s top customer beijing buys over 25 of saudi oil exports and wants to buy more the chinese would rather not have to use the us dollar the currency of their adversary to buy an essential commodity in this context the wall street journal recently reported that the chinese and the saudis had entered into serious discussions to accept yuan as payment for saudi oil exports instead of dollars the wsj article claims the saudis are angry at the us for not supporting it enough in its war against yemen they were further dismayed by the us withdrawal from afghanistan and the nuclear negotiations with iran in short the saudis don t think the us is holding up its end of the deal so they don t feel like they need to hold up their part even the wsj admits such a move would be disastrous for the us dollar the saudi move could chip away at the supremacy of the us dollar in the international financial system which washington has relied on for decades to print treasury bills it uses to finance its budget deficit here s the bottom line saudi arabia the linchpin of the petrodollar system is flirting in the open with china about selling its oil in yuan one way or another and probably soon the chinese will find a way to compel the saudis to accept the yuan the sheer size of the chinese market makes it impossible for saudi arabia and other oil exporters to ignore china s demands to pay in yuan indefinitely moreover using the ine to exchange oil for gold further sweetens the deal for oil exporters sometime soon there will be a lot of extra dollars floating around suddenly looking for a home now that they are not needed to purchase oil it signals an imminent and enormous change for anyone holding us dollars it would be incredibly foolish to ignore this giant red warning sign warning sign 4 out of control money printing and record price increases in march of 2020 the chair of the federal reserve jerome powell exercised unfathomable power at the time it was the height of the stock market crash amid the covid hysteria people were panicking as they watched the market plummet and they turned to the fed to do something in a matter of days the fed created more dollars out of thin air than it had for the us s nearly 250 year existence it was an unprecedented amount of money printing that amounted to more than 4 trillion and nearly doubled the us money supply in less than a year one trillion dollars is almost an unfathomable amount of money the human mind has trouble wrapping itself around such figures let me try to put it into perspective one million seconds ago was about 11 days ago one billion seconds ago was 1988 one trillion seconds ago was 30 000 bc for further perspective the daily economic output of all 331 million people in the us is about 58 billion at the push of a button the fed was creating more dollars out of thin air than the economic output of the entire country the fed s actions during the covid hysteria which are ongoing amounted to the biggest monetary explosion that has ever occurred in the us when the fed initiated this program it assured the american people its actions wouldn t cause severe price increases but unfortunately it didn t take long to prove that absurd assertion false as soon as rising prices became apparent the mainstream media and fed claimed that the inflation was only transitory and that there was nothing to be worried about of course they were dead wrong and they knew it they were gaslighting the truth is that inflation is out of control and nothing can stop it even according to the government s own crooked cpi statistics which understates reality inflation is rising that means the actual situation is much worse recently the cpi hit a 40 year high and shows little sign of slowing down i wouldn t be surprised to see the cpi exceed its previous highs in the early 1980s as the situation gets out of control after all the money printing going on right now is orders of magnitude greater than it was then warning sign 5 fed chair admits dollar supremacy is dead it s possible to have more than one reserve currency these are the recent words of jerome powell the chairman of the federal reserve it s a stunning admission from the one person who has the most control over the us dollar the current world reserve currency it would be as ridiculous as mike tyson saying that it s possible to have more than one heavyweight champion in other words the jig is up not even the chairman of the federal reserve can go along with the farce of maintaining the dollar s supremacy anymore and neither should you conclusion it s clear the us dollar s days of unchallenged dominance are quickly ending something even the fed chairman openly admits to recap here are the five imminent flashing red warning signs the end of dollar hegemony is near warning sign 1 russia sanctions prove dollar reserves aren t really money warning sign 2 rubles gold and bitcoin for gas oil and other commodities warning sign 3 the petrodollar system flirts with collapse warning sign 4 out of control money printing and record price increases warning sign 5 fed chair admits dollar supremacy is dead if we take a step back and zoom out the big picture is clear we are likely on the cusp of a historic shift and what s coming next could change everything zerohedge
as an ordained anglican priest patrick moriarty is not exactly what one would call a typical jewish school principal he is used to quizzical stares when he informs people that he has been headmaster since 2013 of london s pluralist jewish community secondary school one of the largest jewish day schools in england with over 1 000 students i have always lived in and around the jewish community said moriarty at the last school i taught at about 25 of the students were jewish and growing up about 30 40 of the kids at my school were jewish while he is involved with many jewish activities through his job his favorite comes every passover when he has a special role to play in the lead up to the holiday when jews are forbidden not only to consume leavened products but also to own any jewish people sell their chametz leavened products to non jewish purchasers for the duration of the festival i love this wonderfully bizarre ritual said moriarty with a chuckle when i came to jcoss i was the obvious person to purchase the chametz he doesn t just buy a loaf of bread or a jar of mustard each year he purchases the entire 50 million state of the art jewish secondary school with all its associated leavened products inside for a few pounds some years its purchased for 1 or whatever we have in our pockets said moriarty and when the holiday is over he sells it back for the same price it s a deal that works well for both him and the school patrick has his own strong faith and his own community but he is our chametz purchaser said sara levan director of jewish life at jcoss who organizes the annual sale each year he goes off into a corner with our school rabbinic consultant michael pollack it s a gentlemen s agreement i would say michael writes up the contract it s usually a couple of handwritten lines i am a broker in that i make sure the deal goes through in the bible the jewish people are commanded to eat unleavened bread over passover for much of history this meant that jewish people discarded all their leavened products and did not own any chametz during the eight day holiday including anything made with wheat barley oats spelt or rye however as food storage improved and especially in the late 18th century as jewish people entered the liquor business it became very costly for them to rid themselves of all their leavened products to help businesses manage their stock and prevent immense financial loss by discarding chametz rabbinic scholars devised the sale of chametz ritual that is used by millions of jewish people around the world this transfer of ownership allows jews to abide by the requirements not to own any chametz by selling it to a non jewish buyer with the option to purchase it back after passover moriarty takes his role each year as the purchaser of all chametz products at his school seriously i think that s why it works for me at jcoss so well he said religion and rituals are faintly absurd and deeply serious once you are in one religion you can then understand the absurdity of another to the community it becomes deeply meaningful and profoundly significant i say ok i will join in your absurd and deeply significant ritual that s what religion is absurdity on one hand and profundity on the other moriarty will not be the only one purchasing chametz this year many thousands of transactions will take place in jewish communities around the globe in melbourne australia andre bonnici who is roman catholic is a beloved barber located in ripponlea the heart of the tightknit ultra orthodox community my dad was a barber in ripponlea he said as was my grandpa as the barber servicing local jews from a variety of backgrounds bonnici is familiar with many different sects standing look haircuts including leaving the sidelocks unshorn and he has performed many an upsherin the customary first haircut for hasidic boys at age 3 since 2016 he has also held an important role as the purchaser of chametz from the nearby shaarei tefillah synagogue rabbi arieh berlin selling chametz to andre bonnici courtesy rabbi arieh berlin a few years ago rabbi arieh berlin the head of the synagogue and a regular client of bonnici s came into the barbershop with a special request rabbi berlin asked me if i would consider purchasing the chametz on behalf of his congregation bonnici recalled he used to sell it to another rabbi and then that rabbi would on sell it but that rabbi was going back overseas and he wanted to know if i would consider buying it instead the answer was an immediate yes i have known andre since i came to melbourne over 20 years ago berlin said and he has always been my barber because he was so familiar with jews and the jewish customs it made it easier to ask him it s easy to see why berlin asked bonnici he is an extremely popular figure among his mainly ultra orthodox clientele who appreciate his sense of humor and easygoing nature but each year bonnici takes his chametz ownership one step further while he owns the chametz he really owns it i always choose a customer who i know and conduct a home visit i usually come in and take a bottle of liquor last year one of them had a nice bottle of chocolate liqeuer he said before adding with a laugh my wife loved that one the first year i did a home visit he said i went to rabbi berlin s house he had his friends over for dinner he let me in and told me to take whatever i wanted i chose a tasmanian bottle of whiskey a nice one recalling that visit berlin noted that his guests who also get their hair cut at bonnici s barber shop put the barber up to it they told him that they were eating at my house andre said he had come to take the scotch i told him it s yours it s in the garage berlin doesn t mind that bonnici conducts annual home visits and acknowledges that until the items are purchased back after passover bonnici is indeed the rightful owner of these leavened products i knew andre would actually feel comfortable to come into jewish homes said berlin i encouraged him he did it to a few people the families of shaarei tefillah who are also clients at bonnici s barber shop know these visits are all in good fun and the bottles of liquor are always returned when the chametz is sold back after passover finishes albeit slightly lighter than they were taken my family has been here 52 years said bonnici we have been told many times we are honorary jews halfway across the world at anshe sholom b nai israel synagogue in chicago an annual chametz selling ritual also takes place rabbi david wolkenfeld sells the community s chametz to carol ann edwards nasser a local real estate agent who is presbyterian it s a special relationship that has spanned many years i already knew carol anne because she was the realtor who helped us buy the apartment near the synagogue and she has experience with complex sales her business partner is also a member of our synagogue said the rabbi edwards nasser knows that the sale of chametz requires extra details that are not part of other transactions she facilitates in her day job it is a very elaborate sale she said for weeks leading up to passover the synagogue collects forms from the community and people list where they keep their chametz and as the festival approaches wolkenfeld gathers a stack of forms authorizing him to sell the community s chametz each year on the eve of the holiday the community gets together to witness the sale of their leavened products to edwards nasser i pay for it she said when the congregation buys back the chametz i am entitled to get my money back but i usually donate it to the torah fund the community is certainly grateful for all her assistance over passover it s a wonderful model of interfaith cooperation and carol anne helps us to celebrate our holiday wolkenfeld reflected edwards nasser takes her obligations seriously and has deep love and respect for the jewish people
the ukrainian port town of mariupol is the hometown of the azov battalion a special operations detachment of the ukrainian national guard with a past neo nazi association which is one self evident reason the russian high command chose the city to serve as an example for vladimir putin s denazification campaign in the last few months the siege of mariupol has witnessed the most thorough destruction of a european city since the bombing of dresden in the process of committing numerous war crimes and likely crimes against humanity the russian army leveled the city s housing stock to the ground the fighting reportedly killed tens of thousands of civilians and most of the city s nearly half million residents have fled even as tens of thousands more remain trapped in basements and bunkers under ruins without access to medicine water electricity or basic health care these include the parents of several of my friends and acquaintances incidentally ethnic jewish and armenian citizens of ukraine one the lithuanian filmmaker mantas kvedaravičius was killed in mariupol as he was filming the war the ukrainian army put up remarkable resistance to the russian invasion of the city which of course was numerically and technologically superior in the process the defenders of mariupol were reported to have tied down at least 12 russian battalion tactical groups after the russians laid siege to the city many surviving ukrainian fighters retreated into the azovstal iron and steel works which provided sanctuary to between 1 000 and 2 000 besieged ukrainian soldiers a third of whom were reportedly wounded these soldiers and service members belonged to the ukrainian marines the border guard the army and territorial defense battalions as well as the azov battalion while talks were in progress to free those pinned down in azovstal over the last few weeks russian artillery and cruise missiles continued to bombard the compound daily and apparently massacred many of the soldiers and civilians taking shelter inside of it the survivors vowed never to surrender and pleaded with the ukrainian government and the international community for intervention and extraction according to available reports individual members of the ukrainian forces who surrendered to the russians were summarily executed on may 11 the wives of azov soldiers made a trip to the vatican to plead with pope francis for humanitarian intervention kateryna prokopenko right wife of azov battalion commander denys prokopenko and yuliia fedosiuk second from right whose husband was also trapped in azovstal talk with pope francis in st peter s square at the vatican on may 11 2022 ap photo domenico stinellis a jewish ukrainian solider within azovstal vitaly barabash called upon the israeli government to intervene and on may 12 azov deputy commander svyatoslav palamar gave an interview to haaretz playing up the ukrainian israeli connection like in israel there is also terror against us we are not nazis palamar pleaded for more aide from the jewish state and the rest of the civilized world to rescue his besieged unit the azovstal plant is already being compared to masada haaretz informed palamar where jewish fighters who rebelled against the roman empire barricaded themselves in and in the end all of them were killed palamar appeared to agree with the analogy which is not normative behavior needless to say for a neo nazi group on tuesday after prolonged negotiations involving foreign diplomats at the highest levels the civilians hiding inside of the metallurgical plant were reportedly evacuated and the wounded ukrainian soldiers are being exchanged for russian pows azov commander denys prokopenko stated that the ukrainian forces in azovstal had fulfilled their orders and had constituted a distraction to the russian army for 82 days the battle of mariupol seems to have concluded the azov battalion was originally one of many volunteer formations forged in 2014 in order to resist russian proxies and the russian regular army in eastern ukraine at the time the hollowed out ukrainian state had no capacity to fight back against moscow as innumerable critics with limited understanding of ukrainian politics never tire of pointing out the founder of azov andriy biletsky is indeed a figure who holds racist and white supremacist views early azov was home to all sorts of freakish characters and biletsky certainly sought and maintained relationships with neo nazi groups throughout russia and europe like many other private militias of the early post maidan period there were also allegations of criminal activity against the recently demobilized men of azov who were often used as hired guns to settle local conflicts in the summer and fall of 2014 azov distinguished itself by the ferocity with which it successfully fought against the russian led separatists then attempting to occupy mariupol paradoxically at least for purveyors of kremlin propaganda which holds that ukrainians have been oppressing ethnic russians most azov members are in fact russian speakers and disproportionally hail from the russian speaking regions of ukraine even more ironically according to my friend anton shekhovtsov the preeminent scholar of the russian and ukrainian far right on average they speak better russian than the russian invaders this fact alone dismisses blatant kremlin lies about azov allegedly fighting against russian speakers in eastern ukraine in june 2014 when azov helped liberate mariupol from pro russian forces it proved not only azov s combat effectiveness but also their truly pro ukrainian position because of its proven fighting abilities azov started to attract more volunteers and many of them had no political background at all related there were certainly valid concerns about radicalism and warlordism at the time and the far right elements within azov were distrusted by the majority of the public as well as by senior figures in the government when azov was incorporated into ukraine s national guard in the autumn of 2014 placing it in the chain of command of the interior ministry then president petro poroshenko was rightly fearful of the potential for disgruntled or uncontrollable veterans of azov and other volunteer groups to pose a possible threat to the state poroshenko ensured that members of the security services were integrated into the battalion in order to keep an eye on the men identified as potentially independent minded loose cannons these days the ranks of the battalion are drawn from the regular countrywide pool of military and national guard recruits the influence of biletsky dissipated as soon as he left azov in october 2014 his later attempts to create a parallel movement the national corps were the result of his de jure exclusion from the military and his declining influence the confederation of right wing political parties that he corralled into a common platform during the 2019 elections failed to win more than 2 of the national vote while the jewish presidential candidate volodymyr zelensky won with 73 the original post maidan composition of azov was quickly diluted and the ghost of biletsky was replaced with regular officers of the interior ministry by 2017 the battalion as a whole remained distinguished but for its martial prowess not for some distinct political ideology it was naturally around this time that the ukrainian government found itself under increased international pressure including from the u s congress for its normalization of azov it is indisputable that azov was home to all sorts of nasty characters when it was first founded and like many fighting forces including america s it doubtless still contains some white supremacists racists and chauvinists today but it is no longer a practically or ideologically racist organization any more than the u s army could still be called segregated after 1948 i myself have drunk with scandinavian former volunteer members of azov they were pagans and odinists and had the rune tattoos to show for it a swedish sniper who had served in the battalion once told me that his experience in the unit which included service alongside ethnic greek turkish georgian and azerbaijani soldiers transformed him from a white racist into a conservative nationalist progress a donbas born jewish political consultant with whom i regularly drink in kyiv remains a proud azov reserve officer when i recently asked another azov officer about the battalion s reputation for racism he objected to the premise we are not racists he insisted without irony we have right wing patriots serving with us of every race every creed every color every religion but even the unit s right wing ideological heritage has diminished as it s been forced by circumstances to professionalize if azov began in 2014 15 by drawing in volunteers attracted to its ideology or reputation for fierce fighting ability it now depends for recruits on allocations by the interior ministry which tightly oversees its promotions and officer commissions

during the first century of our era the roman philosopher lucius annaeus seneca wrote to his friend lucilius that life would be much happier if things would only decline as slowly as they grow unfortunately as seneca noted increases are of sluggish growth but the way to ruin is rapid we may call this universal rule the seneca effect seneca s idea that ruin is rapid touches something deep in our minds ruin which we may also call collapse is a feature of our world we experience it with our health our job our family our investments we know that when ruin comes it is unpredictable rapid destructive and spectacular and it seems to be impossible to stop until everything that can be destroyed is destroyed the same is true of civilizations not one in history has lasted forever why should ours be an exception surely you ve heard of the climatic tipping points which mark for example the start of the collapse of earth s climate system the result in this case might be to propel us to a different planet where it is not clear that humankind could survive it is hard to imagine a more complete kind of ruin so can we avoid collapse or at least reduce its damage that generates another question what causes collapse in the first place at the time of seneca people were happy just to note that collapses do in fact occur but today we have robust scientific models called complex systems here is a picture showing the typical behavior of a collapsing system calculated using a simple mathematical model see figure 1 figure 1 the seneca curve from bardi s the seneca effect 2017 the intensity of something as a function of time going left to right for intensity imagine it is the value of a financial stock it grows slowly then it declines rapidly when the company generating it goes bankrupt but we can also make simple nonmathematical models of collapse look up the term stick bomb and you ll find many examples of geometric structures made from popsicle sticks that appear stable until you shift one of the sticks away from the others then the whole thing suddenly disappears in a small explosion of flying sticks a harmless kind of seneca effect a stick structure is a very simple thing but it embodies the essence of the mechanism of collapse because it is a network a network is composed of many elements or nodes connected to one another by links in a stick bomb the nodes are the points where the sticks touch each other while the sticks themselves are the links when you remove one of the links you weaken the nearby nodes when one node lets go of a link the collapse moves to other nodes this is sometimes called a cascading failure another name for the seneca effect it is a curious feature of cascading failures that all the elements in the system collaborate to bring the system down entirely but it is a characteristic of networks that small perturbations are rapidly transmitted to the entire structure recall the proverbial straw that broke the camel s back a straw is a very small thing it weighs almost nothing but it can bring down a thousand pound camel or consider how small cracks can grow until they eventually destroy the largest structures that s how failures occur figure 2 a popsicle stick bomb it is kept together by its networked structure separate one of the sticks from the others and it explodes it turns out that large networks are not any less prone to collapse than small ones in fact they might actually be more sensitive to perturbations think of ancient rome when seneca wrote that ruin is rapid he may well have noticed the first cracks in the stupendous structure of the empire a few centuries later it disappeared its ruin was rapid considering that roman civilization had been standing for more than a thousand years the collapse of the roman empire has fascinated historians for centuries why did it happen many different explanations have been proposed but perhaps we can get closer to the right one by noting that the roman empire was a network it was kept together by a large number of connections among people who exchanged food goods services and more most of these connections had a common element they were created by money in turn roman money was based on precious metals silver and gold that the romans mined in northern spain as long as the mines were producing the romans could mint coins to pay their soldiers bureaucrats workers and artisans yet there was a big problem with this system mining was expensive it was done mainly by slaves and even though the slaves were not paid they still required food shelter and tools as mining went on the easy veins of precious metals were exhausted forcing miners to dig deeper and for less concentrated veins maintaining the same amount of production then required increasing effort over time more miners more food more shelter more tools in any case there was a limit to the depth that mines could reach already in the time of seneca the first century ce the problem of mine depletion may have been felt by the third century ce roman mining production collapsed at that point gold started vanishing from the empire most of the gold that was in circulation went to china to pay for luxury items like silk eventually no gold meant no money no money meant the troops couldn t be paid and if the troops couldn t be paid the barbarians invading the empire couldn t be repelled and how to pay the bureaucrats the judges the police and the maintenance of roads no wonder the empire collapsed as seneca had written ruin is rapid let s consider another example one closer to our times you might remember blockbuster the american video rental company that for some time was the largest of its kind in the world with around 65 million registered customers at its peak blockbuster too was a network one formed by the links that the company had with its customers but by the early 2000s those links started breaking down the company was losing customers because its business model had become obsolete blockbuster reacted by charging its remaining customers more that led to more customers disappearing a vicious cycle of link snapping that quickly ended in bankruptcy in 2010 blockbuster s revenues followed a typical seneca curve or cliff see figure 3 figure 3 the collapse of blockbuster data from david reiss what about our civilization will it collapse too we don t depend on gold like the roman empire nor on customers like blockbuster but we do depend on critical nodes that make up a vast network the energy production system the financial system the climate system and many more if any one of these subsystems defaults it could send out reverberations that generate a cascade of failures bringing the whole system down we ve seen ominous shocks just in the last century the world wars the great depression the 1973 oil crisis the 2008 financial crisis the covid 19 pandemic what will be the next shock when it arrives our civilization could quickly become just another paragraph in future history books and if something goes really wrong with the earth s climate well there may not be anyone left to read them i m aware that all this sounds a bit pessimistic but planning for the worst possible scenario is not pessimistic it is simply prudent it is what you do when you put on your seat belt before driving a car so let s ask ourselves practical questions can anything be done to avoid collapses or at least to reduce the damage they cause perhaps the first person who reasoned in scientific terms about how to avoid collapses was the american scientist jay forrester 1918 2016 he was one of the main developers of the field known today as system science to him we owe the idea that when people try to avoid collapse they usually take actions that worsen the situation forrester described this tendency as pulling the levers in the wrong direction forrester s idea is powerful and helps explain why things go bad so fast so often consider the ancient romans again they tried to stop the collapse of their empire by putting all the resources they had into keeping their military as strong as possible it seemed like a good idea you need a strong army to stop the barbarian invasions but to pay the soldiers they had to raise taxes and they didn t realize that doing so would hemorrhage the very system they were trying to keep alive the romans pulled the levers in the wrong direction as is typical empires tend to bankrupt themselves with excessive military expenses in more recent times it happened to the soviet union it may well be happening in parts of the western world today how about blockbuster the managers of the company understood that their customer base was eroding so they spent a lot of money on advertising that worked for a while but it left them with less money for technology improvements spending dwindling resources on advertising the old product rather than upgrading to a new one was pulling the levers in the wrong direction one final example the miracle of shale oil you probably heard some years ago about peak oil the supposed tipping point that would lead to the irreversible decline of global oil production according to some models the gradual depletion of oil reserves should have led to a maximum production level the peak at some moment during the first decade of the 21st century perhaps causing the ruin of our entire civilization needless to say it didn t happen oil production continued to increase from this some concluded that peak oil will never occur a bit of an overinterpretation oil remains after all a finite resource but apart from this the reason global oil production has continued to increase is that a lot of money was poured into the extraction of shale oil in the united states using hydraulic fracking technology this kind of oil is expensive to produce but it did avert collapse for now yet depletion is already a concern for the shale oil industry now too and a collapse in the production of liquid fuels risks occurring very very rapidly another seneca cliff another example of pulling the levers in the wrong direction the resources invested in developing and producing shale oil would probably have been better spent on renewables or energy efficiency surely you can think of more examples of forrester s effect from your own personal experience so we know what not to do when facing collapse don t pull the levers in the wrong direction but what should we do then there are no fixed rules but doing the right thing often involves counterintuitive decision making one possibility is to circumscribe the damage in order to save most of the structure if you divide a system into small independent subsystems you can prevent the cascade of failures from propagating over the network if the subsystems do not communicate with each other then the failure cannot move so easily from one to another it is a well known strategy in materials science composite materials are stronger than homogeneous ones because their internal boundaries can stop a crack from expanding in economic systems we say that small is beautiful in social systems the movement called transition towns is based on the idea that a village is more resilient than a whole state and a federation of smaller states may be more flexible in facing difficulties and absorbing shocks than a larger centralized state another idea that may help avoid collapse is to strive to maintain a certain balance among the elements of the system here we can learn something from elinor ostrom the first woman to receive the nobel prize in economics when ostrom examined the decision making methods of successful social systems she found that they operate as a network in which all the decision makers in a certain sector are also stakeholders in that sector and that decisions are always made by negotiated agreements in other words you should avoid rigid military style management in which the decision makers do not necessarily suffer personal consequences from their decisions because it is especially prone to collapse perhaps ostrom s advice is not so different from what the ancient chinese philosopher lao tzu had said in the tao te ching rigidity leads to death flexibility results in survival

regularly recognized as leaders in the field individually and our firm is both feared and respected among the defense bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages what can i do abbvie investors may no

provides update on strategy and regional flake graphite exploration program back to video lomiko believes that early stage development of this strategy combined with a current emphasis on metallurgical testing of its flake graphite at la loutre and a committed vision to work with the kitigan zibi anishinabeg kza first nation and local communities is important to becoming a leader and operator of choice in the region at the same time the company is looking at opportunities in the carbon offset market and carbon neutral mine planning carbon offset projects include forestry conservation renewable energy and community projects where every tonne of emissions reduced by an environmental project creates one carbon offset or carbon credit article content belinda labatte ceo and director of lomiko stated our team is keen to take on new opportunities in the region around our la loutre property as we develop the potential for natural flake graphite via organic growth and acquisition we plan to lead the responsible development of regional graphite assets with community and first nations engagement water management and stewardship initiatives and carbon offset projects that further advance our carbon neutral model of graphite development the company has staked approximately 14 255 hectares of mineral claims 236 claims in total on six projects in the laurentian region of quebec and within first nations territory these new claims lie within a 100 km radius of the company s flagship la loutre graphite project and 28 claims are directly contiguous to la loutre with the company claim package now covering 4 528 hectares the highest graphite grades are commonly associated with rock contacts between marble and paragneiss or quartzite which is the host rock present in the grenville province and at la loutre large disseminated natural flake graphite mineralization occurs at a number of places in the grenville province metamorphic belt located in canada s quebec and southeastern ontario jurisdictions and the conglomeration of this mineralization in close proximity in the region presents opportunities in the future for responsible and low impact mining or quarry activities that are unique to this region this regional exploration program will cover numerous under explored graphite showings primarily occurring within paragneiss units of the grenville geological belt the claims staked are largely accessible and situated close to road access and qualify as early stage greenfield exploration lomiko intends to initiate exploration of these prospective graphite targets with high definition airborne magnetic and time domain electromagnetic surveys this work will be followed by geological prospecting and sampling surveys based on ground targets generated by the airborne surveys lomiko will engage with communities and the kza as this work evolves please refer to figure 1 for details top stories get the latest headlines breaking news and

a sign reading hawthorne cradle of aerospace is seen in hawthorne calif on april 20 2022 alisha jucevic bloomberg tim berry was working as an engineer at space exploration technologies corp earlier this year when he started looking for a new job he found one less than a mile from his old employer s front door berry is in hawthorne california a largely working class city of 88 000 that s about a 10 minute drive from the los angeles airport he s one of a small army of aerospace professionals who have descended on hawthorne in recent years drawn by elon musk s spacex the most valuable startup in the u s many highly skilled engineers have stayed put because of the city s cheap rent and burgeoning aerospace startup scene berry s new employer is launcher a company that helps get satellites into orbit at low cost he says he wouldn t have taken the job if it had involved traveling too much further i m not a big fan of the east coast or new york sorry berry says instead he kept his commute entirely intact i was super happy to actually be able to still work in hawthorne local officials are pleased if a bit surprised by the city s turn as a startup hub hawthorne has a lot to offer says councilman david patterson it s close to the vibrant aerospace scene in los angeles which houses many startups of its own but it isn t as cripplingly expensive there was an effort a few years ago to create an accelerator in hawthorne patterson says but the idea never got beyond the discussion stage it turns out the city didn t need one for seven of the past 10 years musk s companies spacex and tunneling venture boring co were the only startups in the city to attract venture capital by 2020 startups in hawthorne not owned by musk brought in a respectable 105 2 million and last year those startups attracted 356 7 million according to research firm pitchbook the city is on pace to double that number this year many cities have tried to create their own versions of silicon valley some more successfully than others buzzy destinations like austin texas the recently adopted home of musk and miami have attracted fleets of software developers during the pandemic s remote work explosion san francisco still lays claim to twitter but hawthorne is a different kind of boomtown startups in the city haven t been buoyed by the ease of zoom meetings so much as by the ready availability of actual physical space that and a surplus of the kinds of people who know how to use mills lathes and 3d printers it s a good time to be a hub for high tech manufacturing as stock markets stumble less tangible inventions like cryptocurrencies have faced a reckoning and many engineers and coders increasingly don t want to only manipulate ones and zeros or sell targeted ads they re looking to create real objects just as the rise of software based companies like google and facebook in the early 2000s led to a roughly two decade era when software ventures became the dominant type of startup the success of spacex and other hardware companies is helping change entrepreneurial ambitions venture capitalist marc andreessen summed up the industrial fervor with his 2020 cri de coeur it s time to build in recent years venture capitalist and engineering attention alike has gravitated toward physical inventions especially airborne ones of course in hawthorne as with any success story there s an uncomfortable side too familiar themes of gentrification and inequality gnaw at the edges even as the city is poised for tremendous growth named for novelist nathaniel hawthorne the city holds an early claim to fame as the childhood home of the beach boys it was also the sometime residence of jim thorpe the first native american to win an olympic gold medal and also to marilyn monroe then norma jeane baker the greater los angeles area has a storied history of aeronautics innovation and hawthorne s first taste of aerospace stardom came in 1939 when aviation pioneer jack northrop founded his company there musk s spacex as a scrappy startup moved into former northrop corp buildings in 2008 spacex quickly became an established member of the space industrial complex with facilities across the country and a critical role in the celestial ambitions of the u s in 2016 a few engineers left the company but stayed in neighboring el segundo california founding second order effects a consulting firm to help other startups as well as bigger companies the creation of second order effects helped spark the startup scene in the region says shaun arora of mila capital advisors who has been backing firms in the area for years arora says he s seen an uptick in the number of startups in hawthorne in the past few years it helps he says that companies run by musk tend to burn employees out even while inspiring them spacex teaches people that hard work and optimism can make the impossible possible arora says at the same time many alums i speak with say that while the company purpose was compelling they felt professionally under appreciated the talent pool of rocket savvy engineers seeded by spacex was a major draw for max haot the founder of launcher who decided to locate his company in hawthorne after considering other places like austin new orleans and pasadena california haot has hired at least 14 former spacex employees for his hawthorne based team of about 55 people another perk hawthorne is cheap launcher s 24 000 square foot facility was so much more affordable than space in slightly fancier nearby towns like el segundo haot says plus while those neighboring cities may house big warehouses landlords there are busy refurbishing them for higher rent uses more suitable for software based companies haot looked at some warehouses that were once wired for 1 000 or 2 000 amps of electrical power and which after renovation were only able to handle a few hundred amps that s fine for most businesses but not for the orbit startup where engineers are working on electricity intensive projects like figuring out how to power rockets and running multiple 3d printers at once joel ifill founder of precision airdrop company dash systems is also taking advantage of hawthorne s low rents he s paying well below 2 a square foot ifill s business operates just north of spacex out of a hangar at hawthorne municipal airport hangar space is usually some of the cheapest square footage you ll find in major cities he says in its cavernous digs dash has room for its cessna 208b grand caravan turboprop plane desks a small engineering shop and an area with a carpet a coffee table and a sofa perfect for watching the steady stream of small aircraft taking off and landing that includes occasional sightings of musk s jet ifill doesn t currently employ any spacex alumni but he found plenty of other big companies in the area to choose from those include lockheed martin boeing and northrop grumman all with offices in el segundo we have people from tesla virgin galactic wet design he says referring to a water engineering company based in sun valley 30 miles north some hawthorne startups have little to do with rockets or satellites ring the next generation doorbell company now owned by amazon com is based in the city so is stellar pizza an automated pie company run by former spacex engineers most however take a space tack another example is venturi astrolab based out of a former bus bench factory just south of spacex venturi makes rovers that founder jaret matthews hopes will be selected for nasa s future artemis lunar missions we re building big robots matthews says we need a lot of space to test them that includes indoors as well as a covered area behind the building strewn with basalt to better simulate moon conditions besides himself matthews s team includes several former spacex hands downtown hawthorne doesn t yet look like a thriving business hub its main drag features car dealerships rundown storefronts and a 24 hour laundromat that s where luis castaneda a part time handyman was sitting on a recent afternoon he has noticed more upscale workers in town he says and blames them for rising prices the room he rents costs 700 a month he says compared to 400 for a similar room 10 years ago when he first arrived in the city alejandra alarcon 29 grew up in hawthorne in a house she her mother her brother and grandmother shared almost every house on the block had a similar demographic mix now she says newcomers households typically contain a couple with a dog and no children she admits to mixed feelings about spacex its offshoots and the ensuing prosperity for the city spacex brings jobs to hawthorne she says i m not convinced spacex brings jobs to hawthorne residents alarcon commutes about seven miles north each day for her job at a university in the westchester section of los angeles she likes having a new brewpub or two in her hawthorne neighborhood but finds it disconcerting as well when i walk into these spaces i stop feeling like i m in my hometown because everyone looks so different to the people i grew up with she says everyone i grew up with was working class alarcon was stunned to see a glitzy looking new apartment complex open last year it s on crenshaw boulevard a seven lane road two miles east of the town s largely abandoned shopping mall rents at the building called the millennium south bay run as much as 3 725 for a two bedroom an agent at the building s office said far higher than the 2 285 median in the city according to zillow the new building s website promises easy access to the beach and other local restaurants but the most enticing amenity at the millenium is of course the spacex headquarters located just one block up the street workers at the launcher

long term trend of exchange rates depends on economic fundamentals the long term stability and value of the chinese yuan and its status as a rising international currency remain solid despite the currency s recent weak performance against the us dollar officials and currency experts said wang chunying deputy head of the state administration of foreign exchange said that the recent depreciation of the yuan is a short term change and did not alter the behavior of the yuan in registering two way fluctuations while staying largely stable at a reasonable level for a super large economy like china the long term trend of exchange rates mainly depends on domestic fundamentals wang said in an interview with xinhua news agency after a sell off that sent the exchange rate of the onshore yuan against the greenback down to 6 81 on may 13 its weakest level since september 2020 the yuan has shown signs of stabilizing as of friday afternoon the onshore yuan has strengthened to around 6 67 against the dollar wang added recent cross border capital flow fluctuations in the securities market will not affect the long term trend of global investors increasing holdings in yuan denominated assets which provide stable investment returns and the benefit of diversifying their portfolios the increase in the weighting of the yuan in the currency basket of the special drawing rights a global reserve asset created by the international monetary fund is a sign of the confidence of the international community in china s financial markets wang said the imf said on may 14 that it has lifted the yuan s weighting in the sdr currency basket to 12 28 percent from 10 92 percent effective from aug 1 keeping the yuan the third top currency in terms of share in the basket the yuan retained its position as the fifth most active currency for global payments by value in april with a share of 2 14 percent compared with 1 95 percent a year ago and 2 2 percent in march according to the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication or swift maximilian wieland an economist at vanguard investment strategy group said that the recent yuan weakness is mainly attributable to a strong dollar amid market expectations over aggressive tightening by the united states federal reserve and the impact on china s economy of a resurgence in covid 19 cases however we expect both external and domestic forces pushing down the yuan to abate going forward putting a floor under the recent yuan sell off even raising the prospect of some modest appreciation he said while the exchange rate of the onshore yuan has weakened by about 6 percent against the dollar so far this year the declines of the euro the japanese yen and the british pound against the greenback are bigger and have stood at approximately 8 percent to 10 percent during the same period official data showed chen jia a researcher at the renmin university of china s international monetary institute said the stability of the yuan relative to many other currencies and the country s robust inflows related to trade and foreign direct investment have combined to alleviate the capital outflow pressure brought on by a strong dollar the nation has maintained cross border net capital inflows even with a weaker yuan as cross border receipts by china s nonbanking sectors outnumbered payments by 16 2 billion in april up 57 percent compared with a month earlier the safe said
the animal save movement bears witness to animals headed for slaughter a pig en route to slaughter jo anne mcarthur the ghosts in our machine we animals media pigs in a crowded truck jo anne mcarthur we animals media when i think of participating in animal save vigils i think of the freezing cold temperatures that the animals endure in transport as well as the sweltering heat the photojournalist jo anne mcarthur the founder of we animals media tells me when i put my camera to the openings in the truck walls i m hit with the smells from inside which are particularly bad on hot days the conditions are crowded the lens fogs up the animals are panting or wide eyed often both a pig in a crowded truck jo anne mcarthur we animals media mcarthur has been part of the animal save movement a global network co founded by anita krajnc since its inception it began in 2010 as toronto pig save when krajnc an animal activist and friend of mcarthur saw truckloads of terrified pigs carted into a slaughterhouse on her morning walks with her dog mr bean today their goal is to hold a vigil at every slaughterhouse until they re shuttered for good it s been incredible to see it grow from the commitment of one person who wanted to start vigils in solidarity with animals so that people could bear witness mcarthur says anita has been greatly influenced by activists and writers like gandhi and tolstoy who believed in bearing witness being at the front lines and helping now there are chapters globally and millions of people are drawn to see to learn trucks carrying hundreds of pigs to slaughter arrive at quality meat packers in toronto jo anne mcarthur we animals media at animal save vigils everyone knows that the animals in the transport trucks can t be rescued but learning about their suffering and educating the public can help save future generations from their fate the animals in these trucks are usually crowded together forced to stand in their own waste pigs might stand on top of one another screaming in pain and fear it is legal to transport animals without access to food or water in unbearable heat according to animal justice 1 59 million animals arrive at slaughterhouses in canada dead or dying each year pigs inside a transport truck on route to farmer john slaughterhouse in los angeles jo anne mcarthur we animals media for participants the vigils provide a chance to peer into the eyes of individual animals during some of the most frightening moments of their lives on sweltering days like the ones mcarthur remembers so vividly activists might also offer water to thirsty animals while the trucks stop in traffic pigs are known to push their snouts to the holes to receive water and bits of watermelon squealing with stress but also momentary relief they enjoy being stroked on the nose although the trucks are so crowded that not all can reach the holes for that moment of contact activist touching pig in a transport truck jo anne mcarthur we animals media the vigils and the vegan potlucks that sometimes follow also foster lifelong connections within the community strengthening the resolve of people working on the frontlines on behalf

fearman s pork inc slaughterhouse the driver was charged with careless driving causing death animal save activists continue to fight for justice and honor her memory by attending vigils seeing people come together as part of the animal save movement makes mcarthur proud and hopeful it s mind boggling to know that all of this suffering is unnecessary she says all of this farming growing producing

when i look back at the people s national party s pnp 2016 general election campaign i vividly remember how important it was for the team to convey to the general population that we had fixed the economy this we incorporated in mesages such as never before has jamaica had a fiscal surplus we have been able to pay our public sector workers who have held strain we are bringing down our debt to gdp ratio jamaica is on the right path the extent to which our economy has been resilient is built on the foundation laid by our former minister of finance dr peter phillips between 2012 and 2016 and the portia simpson miller led administration their courage reversed a 40 year trend of deficit spending thereby creating an economic environment with a 7 5 per cent fiscal surplus reducing our debt to gdp ratio from 140 per cent to manageable levels which is the foundation on which this current low interest rate environment has been built this low interest rate is the primary reason the jamaican economy was not devastated in 2020 and we should give the credit where it is due however in february 2016 the pnp lost 14 of its 42 seats and became the opposition how was this possible when the international monetary fund imf and other multilaterals praised the pnp government of the day for making the right decisions without encountering riots tantamount to what occurred in greece many would argue that a combination of elements created the perfect storm for defeat but the truth is if you want to lead a group of people to a destination they must first understand the overall value of the journey and why they should trust you to take them the fact is that the jamaican people never understood the importance of a fiscal surplus the positive impact of reversing deficit spending or how decreasing the debt to gdp ratio would increase their purchasing power to buy more or improve the roads and water conditions in their communities regardless the jamaica labour party jlp took advantage of the situation and told the people vote for us and you will 1 5 million tax free to improve your lives however this discussion is not about who had the best political slogan instead it s about identifying what s needed to get jamaicans to appreciate macroeconomic issues particularly interest rates and how they affect their everyday lives did the pnp fail to communicate its message or is financial literacy the real crisis among our people it would have been hard not to notice that year to date the stock market in the united states has lost almost 15 per cent in response to the us federal reserve raising interest rates by half a per cent two weeks ago the fed has declared its intention to continuously raise interest rates to curb the eight and a half per cent inflation rate in the us which is the highest it s been in 40 years a full appreciation for the impact of interest rate increases is that a three per cent increase in the rate would incur a cost to the us government that is higher than its national defence budget based on the current us debt if as projected by analysts the us federal reserve rate moves to four per cent or higher by the end of the year people worldwide will seek to convert their currencies to us dollars and place them in us banks and securities in response banks in other countries will increase their local banking saving rates to discourage people from converting to us dollars this increase would be at least four per cent above the fed rate add to this possibility a bank s inclusion of their margin for administration and profit and you can see the probability of double digit lending rates by the end of this year were this to happen the result would be a major reduction in a person s disposable income as their mortgage car loan and hire purchase payments would increase so interestingly even though the fed decisions are outside of our control they directly impact the pocketbooks of ordinary jamaican people here at home the bank of jamaica boj which operates as an independent body and controls local inflation as one of its core responsibilities has set a target of four to six per cent however as of april 2022 jamaica recorded an inflation rate of 11 8 per cent as a counter to inflation the boj has moved the policy interest rate from 0 5 per cent in august 2021 to 4 5 per cent in march 2022 the next review is slated for may 19 2022 after this article has been submitted and may see the boj increasing the rate again what would add more fuel to the inflation fire is to go back to deficit spending which the pnp eradicated during its last term in office and if jamaica went back to the days of borrowing money to finance expenditure spending more than the country earned such a move would drive interest rates even higher therefore the boj must explain to jamaicans whether it can impact inflation when to a large extent it is driven mainly by external factors why many jamaicans don t understand how inflation or interest rates affect them and are unaware of how to plan or budget if they move higher furthermore they cannot directly link surging oil prices globally the devastating impact of the russia ukraine war on grain fertiliser and cooking oil prices and the supply chain disruptions out of china to the erosion of their purchasing power money matters one of our essential responsibilities as leaders is to do all we can to improve the jamaican economy thereby increasing our populace s disposable income to give them more purchasing power but we must teach them too how interest rate movements and inflation affect their ability to buy goods and services financial literacy is the knowledge and understanding of critical financial skills from budgeting and saving to investment and retirement planning and the ability to put them to use several countries have financial literacy in their schools curricula for example financial education is mandatory for grades 7 and 9 students in denmark in addition adolescents participate in an annual event called global money week organised by finance denmark and the danish union of teachers of mathematics during which financial professionals speak to students at local schools in 2014 israel mandated personal finance instruction in schools and educated its secondary school students through a financial education month in the school system in which banking investment and general economics were taught today the dilemma facing all governments operating in this extreme financial environment is their failure to communicate the problems and how they will impact the people and the national objectives our government should first have a wide range of public consultations with people across jamaica to help them understand the economic fundamentals and more importantly they should introduce financial literacy in our secondary education curriculum these measures would go a far way in helping the average jamaican to understand the solutions needed for a country to budget save and invest which in turn will help them to plan their domestic affairs but if they continue to speak at our people as opposed to with our people it will only lead to misinformation rigidity and more social unrest furthermore beating them with extensive financial jargon won t help if they can t make ends meet jamaicans will come if they trust you and understand the objectives it s time we start explaining the economy effectively to our people hear from them how they are being affected and find common ground in the best interest of our country lisa hanna is member of parliament for st ann south eastern people s national party spokesperson on foreign affairs and foreign trade and a former cabinet member cont
engagements by chidi amuta in an election season the briefcases of political salesmen are full of assorted marketing pitches not even the most outrageous and unexpected ideas are off limits conflicting notions and ideas tumble and clash for headlines in a crowded and confused market place the public is desperate for words of encouragement and perhaps something new and different from the old worn out clichés of politics someone will end terrorist insurgency in less than three months one aspirant will chase back boko haram and iswap to the sahel and find them alternative theatres of war there one hopeful will bring back our girls except that he forgot the girls are all women now and nearly all proud mothers another will eradicate poverty in one term only yet another will eliminate unemployment within a year somebody has promised to stop nigerian doctors and nurses from emigrating to better climes the count is endless and still rising behind all the promises no empirical data no studies just empty promises and vacuous expressions of intention and wishes our present pains and adversity leave us not much choice than to absorb it all somehow the hope endures that perhaps something good might emerge from even the wombs of adversity and the sporadic outbursts of insanity despite the repeated ritual of political promises the pageant of presidential aspirants for 2023 has yielded something new in our desperate search for a leadership type that can rescue us from the concoction of ills plaguing the land the ongoing scramble for the presidential gate pass has yielded a novel leadership type the mad man as president has emerged as a leadership model that the 2023 politicians want us to seriously consider as appropriate incumbent governor of rivers state mr nyesom wike in the course of his nationwide campaigns for the presidential candidacy of the pdp had occasion to put forward a case for the mad man president in his gubernatorial estimation our national problems have assumed an insane and other worldly dimension that a normal president may no longer fit the bill in his view nigeria is a crazy country a virtual asylum with insane problems it requires only a mad man as president in 2023 to address these problems in their insane enormity mr wike got a bit of the headlines he desired and deserved except that most of the commentators did not find the suggestion quite out of character even then there is a body of opinion out there that would agree with mr wike s proposition purely out of frustration with present realities and tested approaches to leadership while a section of the public was sufficiently magnanimous to accord mr wike his poetic license or right of deviant opinion the mainstream wrote his thesis off as evidence that our politics has now trespassed into the zone of insanity in which major political aspirants may in fact need psychiatric evaluation themselves maybe we should not write off mr wike so quickly only last wednesday former president olusegun obasanjo while receiving another of his numerous presidential aspirant pilgrims in abeokuta added his voice to the mad man theory of leadership in obasanjo s weighty view the problems besetting the nation are so gigantic in scope and herculean in scale that they need a leader who is both passionate about nigeria and who has a touch of madness to get the nation back on the right footing for him the next leader must be prepared to deploy unusual methods and do unfamiliar things to solve a barrage of unusual problems the trouble with the nigerian mad man doctrine of leadership is not in its novelty we are sufficiently frustrated to embrace just about anything that shows up in the name of a solution but the disturbing reality is that there may in fact be a statistical basis for prescribing that we might as well choose a mentally challenged as a communal hero to find solutions to our leadership crisis a few months ago a group of nigerian mental health experts came up with the shocking revelation that close to half of the nigerian population 100 million may be afflicted with one form of mental health challenge or the other of this number 50 million are actually mentally ill in a clinical sense this is in the sense that they are likely to commit murder or suicide at the slightest inkling the other 50 million cannot make a precise determination as to whether they are mad unbalanced or too dazed by everyday reality in a nation that is prone to drive people crazy this epidemic of national madness means that on an average day far too many people are likely to jump off the railings of the third mainland bridge in lagos and plunge into the lagoon so many more are likely to commit rape incest or abuse a minor some might even set a market on fire just to have a good laugh the trouble with nigeria s mental health statistics is that the total number of alleged mentally challenged people 100 million is almost equal to the population of abjectly poor nigerians those living on less than 2 a day but then the poor are not necessarily mad more problematic is the fact that it is these poor folks who are embarrassed by the symptoms and displays of madness among the well off ones so the socio economic explanation of the roots of mental illness will not hold water here the very poor cannot understand why for instance a man or woman who is already rich should be charged with a crime of misappropriating billions of dollars ordinary people cannot comprehend whether rich and privileged thieves are necessarily mentally healthy let us not crucify the 2023 emergency political theorists for smuggling this mad man leadership theory into our political lexicon or thinking the mad man theory of leadership is really not so new in political theory it was first proposed and popularized by late us president richard nixon simply put it sought to present the us president as unpredictable and potentially insane his powers are so awesome and powers so overwhelming that he is capable of inflicting the greatest damage to america s adversaries in a precise but unpredictable manner it was popularized as part of the nixon administration s foreign policy in a bid to deter america s adversaries especially the ussr and soviet bloc countries the mad man theory prepared the world to expect the worst from the us president at any time it worked for a while before it was discarded as the world s stock of mad leaders increased beyond the borders of the two great powers in opposition during the cold war in the leadership of nations the mad man often comes to power either through normal democratic means or is propelled by non democratic forces of national history hitler was elected so was mussolini and even stalin in nearly all cases power insanity creeps in as an effect of power absolutism what is disturbing however is that all instances of the mad man as leader in history have been associated with dictatorships of the most vile and bloody kind baby doc duvailier of haiti idi amin dada of uganda belong in this cast the danger in allowing democratic systems to elevate mad men to apex power is the damage they usually do to both the democratic system and the nation itself even normal presidents elected through the best democratic systems need to be checked from degenerating into personal insanity because of the aphrodisiac of power the us electorate adjudged donald trump a normal president when he assumed power in 2016 months after allowing him to exhibit traits that bordered on clinical insanity a group of over 100 mental health experts had to subject his behavior to psychiatric evaluation and handed down an unsavory conclusion that he could be unhinged this was not before he nearly destroyed the american citadel of democracy on january 6th 2021 by endorsing and directing a mob invasion of the capitol it is therefore unsafe for our democracy both in 2023 and beyond for leaders to be advocating for the deliberate enthronement of a mad man to ascend the pinnacle of national power simply because the nation s problems appear crazy it is quite understandable that the 2023 elections are coming at a time when our national problems have been allowed to degenerate to insane levels yes indeed our insecurity has grown from isolated boko haram sectarian insurgency in borno state to envelope the entire north east north west and now parts of north central periodic highway robberies have grown into assured bandit takeovers of major arterial highways all over the country annual remembrance parades of biafra by massob have grown into an armed guerilla movement and bloody insurgency in the south east organized crime syndicates in parts of delta and edo states have become sophisticated networks of robbery kidnapping extortion and voodoo ritual killing syndicates what used to be restricted to serial fraud letter writing has grown into sophisticated cybercrime networks with thousands of undergraduates and urban youngsters as subscribers and active practitioners that is not all faith that used to distinguish our peoples in terms of differential beliefs has become weaponized as nigeria is now divided into religious factions willing and eager to draw the blood of each other to advance the cause of one world faith over the other the sense of community and unified diversity that has been the marker of nigeria s exceptionalism has given way to a landscape of hate and the spontaneous hurling of hateful abuse across all divides the politics of factions has degenerated into angry regionalism tribalism and vicious ethnocentrism in the midst of the shouts of hate we can no longer hear each other speak as everyone is howling at everyone human life has become trivialized as angry mobs are ever ready to incinerate fellow citizens at the slightest provocation or altercation no one dares go towards our economic problems no one knows now how much we are owing foreign creditors or domestic contractors estimates indicate that we spend over 96 of revenue to service debts our children that troop out of schools and universities cannot find work for their idle hands and able minds an informal poverty republic has lodged in place as nigeria is now globally recognized as the leading home of some of the poorest people in the world in a republic within a republic of over 100 million abjectly poor people perhaps this is the landscape that has encouraged the new political gladiators to insist that our problems as a nation are insane in dimension gigantic in scope and frightening in expanse as they may be they remain normal economic social and national security problems except that they have been allowed to spiral out of control in the last seven years the responsibility for the state in which we find our nation lies squarely at the doorstep of the outgoing buhari administration never in the history of independent nigeria has an administration been bestowed with so much hope and trust only to serially fail the people the nation the world and the very operatives of the system of government what the aspirants of 2023 are angling to inherit therefore is an empty shell of a nation but it can be rescued not by enthroning a mad man as president the impulses that have driven the argument for a touch of madness in leadership to rescue the nation lie squarely in the serial failures of the buhari administration that abysmal failure stares us in the face in every direction it demonstrates how a national edifice can be destroyed in just under eight years but the failure of the last seven years is not a failure of system it is a failure of specific operators of what should be a workable system the mad man theory of leadership assumes a necessity to overturn the system it allows the new leader to discupt the established order to breach due process to truncate the established order in order to reach urgent goals and re write the rules if necessary in order to get us there quickly it may even allow for the leader to adopt a purely personal and idiosyncratic approaches to problem solving with the justification that the nation has entered an emergency mode the risk of the mad man option is that a personality cult based on the wrong ideas could develop the established order of governance could be permanently damaged the general order of administrative governance the financial instructions that guide government transactions and the observance of due process could be seriously damaged the personalization of governance could destroy democracy by enthroning an authoritarianism of the mad man as a political deity in the process democracy could suffer permanent damage as the new mad man redefines democracy to suit his personalized model technically therefore whatis required in 2023 is not the enthronement of a mad man but the elevation of an enlightened dynamic leader who can manage diversity reunite the nation and inspire progress rather than disrupt the system and replace order with rudderless flux we do not need a collective of mad men and women either to rescue a nation simply because it is beset with magnified problems of national development and existence the president we need now is therefore not a mad man but a rational deviant it is somebody who is enlightened assured firm decisive and systematic a knowledgeable president who is passionate about nigeria and its many missed opportunities is the one we are waiting for he or she does not need to be mad in any sense but he must be constructively subversive of the present hegemonic order and its conservative bedrock which has brought us to this brutish pass nigerians await that personage and that hour

the constant increase in inflation continues to squeeze consumer budgets more so than in the past 40 years however now may be the best time to put long term savings in the stock market as historically it has been shown that investing in equities stocks is generally a good way to outrun inflation in general the average annual return of the s p 500 index is about 10 per cent which is higher than the 8 3 per cent annual inflation rate seen in april 2022 in the united states investors purchase these shares with the expectation that a company will grow and generate returns in the form of capital gains and or dividend generation apart from this income investing in equities has other advantages when buying shares the shareholder becomes a part owner of the business unlike bonds shares carry voting rights and therefore shareholders may exercise some sort of control over the company also shareholders have limi ted liability which means that if the company goes bankrupt the maximum that a shareholder may lose is his total investment made in the shares existing shareholders are also normally given first preference for rights issues shares issued at a lower price than the current market price and bonus issues free shares given to shareholders instead of dividends on the other hand stocks are riskier than many other asset classes because money is invested based on the belief that a company will do better in the future there is no collateral security protecting the investment and typically there are no guaranteed dividends furthermore the price of a stock is based on several fluctuating factors which are sometimes out of the company s control such as industry specific news and changes in market trends and consumer appetites although a shareholder has voting rights in a company smaller investors who invest in larger institutions have less of an impact on corporate decisions finally in cases where companies go bankrupt shareholders are the last to receive any sort of repayment for their investment after all other costs debtors and other stakeholders are repaid local investors tend to hold equity investments for the long term and are generally interested in companies which pay regular dividends noelle micallef there are a large variety of names to choose from thereby providing investors with diversification opportunities equities are normally classified as either growth stocks or value stocks the former relates to those companies that are considered to have future potential hence an investor may deem that the current price is relatively cheap as compared to what the company will be valued in the future alternatively value stocks are usually larger more established companies which analysts believe are undervalued on the market in times of inflation interest rates are usually increased to combat rising prices a way of valuing stocks is to discount future expected cashflows using a discount rate which in turn would be driven by prevailing interest rates all else being equal a higher inflation rate implies that the value of future income would be worth less in present value therefore growth stocks which generally expect a higher volume of cash flows in the future as compared to value stocks are proportionately more negatively impacted than value stocks in times of inflation the malta stock exchange has seen a rise in new equity listings over recent years with a record of over 221 million being listed in 2021 the first few months of this year have also been quite busy with ax real estate plc and m z plc listing a total of nearly 90 million worth of shares and aps bank plc announcing that it is planning to implement an initial public offering it should be noted however that local investors tend to hold equity investments for the long term and are generally interested in companies which pay regular dividends this limits liquidity on the local market having said this the increase in companies listing locally in recent years and a generally more open approach towards equity investments may indicate signs that the equity market may become more active in the foreseeable future whilst investing in equities is important in inflationary periods investors should continue to protect their port folios via diversification and rebalancing for instance having investments spread across stocks bonds and more furthermore within each asset class it is important to hold a variety of industries and sectors finding the right balance is essential to make profits on long term investments noelle micallef is a

commentary as the russo ukrainian war enters its third month western countries sympathy and support for ukraine has been increasing and their awareness of the russian threat has also been growing confrontation between the two camps has been escalating reflecting a return of the cold war this confrontation has been adversely affecting the world as well global production chains have been strained and poor countries face challenges because of shortages of food supplies and rising prices the russian government has threatened the use of nuclear weapons in view of its military setbacks in response to the western countries military supplies for ukraine moscow declared that western transport vehicles would become targets on april 26 the united states assembled senior defense officials from 40 countries for a meeting in germany to discuss military aid for ukraine this was a large scale mobilization exercise with significant demonstration effect two days before the meeting u s secretary of state antony blinken and secretary of defense lloyd austin visited kyiv and announced the objective of weakening russia so it could pull out of ukraine american media then quoted western officials indicating that the biden administration was planning to impose severe military and economic damages on russia apparently this is a long term strategy the united states and the european union have been exerting pressure on china in several international meetings recently warning beijing against interfering with their sanctions against russia u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman on april 21 declared that the sanctions against russia would also be applicable to china should it choose to provide material support to russia china obviously wishes to avoid sanctions from the western world it was reported that china unionpay had refused to cooperate with russian banks being sanctioned to offer credit card services some chinese firms particularly those with international associates are now beginning to accept washington s demands to deliver the required financial data in order to maintain their listings in the u s stock exchange although for most chinese companies the 2024 deadline is still an ongoing issue china has so far refrained from providing russia with direct military aid thus avoiding confrontation with the western world the cold war atmosphere is increasingly affecting international organizations for instance the exercise of veto by permanent members of u n security council members is seen to block progress in resolving important world issues including the russia ukraine war the international community is now concerned that the cold war s division of blocs of countries and legitimacy of their vetoes may render the united nations even less effective last month a resolution was decided that would allow a general assembly debate within 10 working days on any decision blocked by veto power in the security council at the meeting the security council would need to present a report citing the reasons for the veto although considered a mild approach to the problem it may be a small positive step and exert some broader international pressure on the security council to agree more often on east versus west matters when the u n was established it realized that it had no power to sanction major powers the league of nations provided a solid example today its members understand the organization s limitations the resolution although criticized by russia may be a small step in trying to improve the functioning of the security council in the g 20 financial ministers meeting last month there was no release of a joint declaration because of the members differences thus the international community has limited expectations of the g 20 summit in october although there may be a wish for the g 20 to replace the g 7 in promoting international cooperation and contributing to global economic development as it involves a broader spectrum of countries getting results may also be difficult at present g 20 members like china india south africa and the host indonesia have no intention of condemning russia their differences with the western countries will likely mean that no major agreements can be reached many countries do not wish to return of the cold war the eu continues to acquire energy from russia some russian banks still enjoy the use of the swift system china works hard to avoid western sanctions but constructive cooperation is difficult to come by for example indonesia had originally hoped to achieve strong economic recovery through global international cooperation and amid the pandemic developed countries had intended to offer assistance to developing countries for mutual benefit with the war in ukraine however developed countries will now have less resources for the combat of the pandemic poverty alleviation and the economic growth of developing countries the war adversely affects the global production chains and the international financial energy and commodity markets the price is borne by all countries but the poor ones suffer the most the rising food prices is an obvious example the impact of the war is not limited to the direct casualties and destruction confrontation damages the spirit for international cooperation zero sum thinking now dominates the foreign policy of most countries the war in ukraine is not going to end soon and the struggle between opposing camps will continue and could even escalate the world will thus pay a heavy price views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

u s a ammoland com the iwi x95 is not a new firearm by any stretch but it s the first rifle to ever convince me of a bullpup s worth and where most gun reviews on the internet tend to be somewhat limited in their duration simply because of cost or time constraints i ve spent a few years carrying running and abusing the hell out of this little israeli carbine and as such i ve become acutely aware of its shortcomings as well as its strengths so while the majority of early reviews of the x95 were glowingly positive how does the compact blaster hold up after all this time let s dive in and find out but before we get started i wanted to mention that while i normally keep rifles relatively stock when doing reviews this review is a long term one so i equipped the little bullpup with a few key upgrades to make it better suited to me personally but none of these additions alter the gun s functionality in any meaningful way israel weapon industries tavor x95 bullpup rifle chambered in 5 56 223 the x95 is the civilian version of the israeli micro tavor both firearms operate via a long stroke piston driven system that is famous for its durability and reliability it s the same basic method of operation used on the akm as well as the m1 garand available in both 5 56mm and 300blk the x95 feeds from standard ar 15 magazines stanag pattern that are available in basically any capacity physically possible the body of the x95 is constructed almost entirely of polymer with the barrel action and mechanical components all being steel these polymer components are available in od green fde and of course plain ol black i choose the latter because everything goes with black but back to the internals for a moment while the x95 s long stroke gas piston method of operation tends to make firearms heavier and suffer from a very forward center of balance this is because a long stroke piston utilizes a bolt carrier group affixed to the piston resulting in a large heavy mass this also has the adverse effect of adding to the recoil impulse since said mass is traveling at high velocity inside the firearm the latter of which makes these types of firearms extra tiring to shoulder for longer durations of time because the forward weight has leverage against the shooter themselves but since the israel weapon industries tavor x95 rifle is a bullpup these weight concerns don t apply bullpups core design and shortcomings if you re not familiar with the term don t worry despite what you read not everyone on the internet is an expert so let me save you a few minutes of googling the term a bullpup is a firearm whose action the moving components behind the barrel is located behind the pistol grip instead of in front of it the benefits of this system are a better center of balance and a shorter overall firearm without sacrificing barrel length and thus effective range in a nutshell bullpups were developed to give infantry the full capabilities of a standard rifle in a compact package the size of a submachine gun but like everything in life there s no free lunch and these designs aren t without their faults for instance bullpups are prone to heavy spongy triggers since they have to utilize a trigger bar to connect the trigger to the hammer over the distance to the action a prime example of a bullpup with a rough trigger is steyr s aug whose trigger feels like a cross between a staplegun and a nerf toy which is to say spongy overly heavy and long as hell additionally bullpups normally suffer from an awkward manual of arms and especially so when reloading because a shooter needs to reach under their armpit to insert a fresh magazine and this becomes doubly difficult when done from a prone position israel weapon industries tavor x95 rifle a better bullpup so does the x95 buck these trends overcoming the shortcomings of the core design well it does and it doesn t as for the trigger the x95 s trigger is excellent for a bullpup firearm while not much better than a mil spec ar 15 trigger the pull feels normal and it breaks with reasonable crispness there are aftermarket options available but i found that the factory trigger was sufficient for appropriate distances with the x95 and the terminology used in that last sentence is intentional but we ll get to that later in the article the manual of arms is a different story while the x95 s use of a push button magazine release located in close proximity to the pistol grip is excellent and objectively an upgrade of the full sized tavor reloading is still fairly awkward in all fairness inserting a mag into the magazine well isn t difficult but it certainly isn t anywhere near as quick or easy as an ar 15 but this can be overcome with sufficient training and practice the bolt release however is remarkably strange overly sensitive and just odd in its implementation between the pistol grip and the magazine well the bolt release is a large boxy protrusion on the bottom of the gun with practice its weird design can actually be beneficial since a shooter could potentially insert a magazine and drop the bolt on it simultaneously the problem with this design is two fold first the release is nearly hair triggered so it s very easy to accidentally drop the bolt prematurely and force the shooter to have to re charge the weapon annoying but not the end of the world but it s when attempting the lock the action open that this design s shortcomings becoming glaringly obvious because the release is subdued into the body of the gun itself there s not much for the shooter to grab to hold it open and as i stated early the release is on a hair trigger so placing the gun on a shooting table with the action open even a little too rough will cause the release to disengage and slam the action forward again annoying but not a deal breaker the only part of that design i really have an issue with is how these awkward mechanics making clearing malfunctions a total pain in the ass to the point that you feel like you need three hands to properly clear a jam the good news in the 3 540 rounds i ve fired through my personal x95 at least according to my logbook i ve had 2 firearm related malfunctions and both were with the same magazine this is despite the fact that i ve only cleaned the gun once and oiled it twice the oiling was only necessary after 1 000 rounds of winchester 3 gun ammo fired with my personal silencerco saker asr 762 attached had the entirety of the internals coated in a thick dry carbon residue presumably without the accelerated wear and carbon buildup caused by the addition of a suppressor the gun could have gone without cleaning for 4 or 5 000 rounds iwi x95 rifle downsides remember how earlier in the article i wrote about appropriate distances that s because the x95 out of the box is a 2 5 3 moa rifle meaning it s only capable of slightly under three inch groups at 100 yards and this might seem ludicrous to ar 15 shooters accustomed to inexpensive 1 moa rifles but you need to remember this is a compact firearm utilizing the same method of operation as an ak in essence the israel weapon industries tavor x95 bullpup rifle is a compact lightweight ak with better ergonomics designed for somewhat limited engagements now that said even a 3 moa firearm is capable of reliability engaging two legged aggressors out to 400 yards just not slamming small steel swinging targets at the distance another drawback is the gun is its tendency to blow carbon back in the shooter s face when paired with a traditional sound suppressor i found that a thorough cleaning dramatically reduced this but the only real solution i found thus far is to use a cleaner suppressor like those from oss which captures the majority of the hot gas and carbon blowback before it has a chance to enter the weapon s receiver but on a very positive note the fact that the center of balance is much closer to the shooter means that the added weight and length of a steel suppressor aren t nearly as noticeable israel weapon industries tavor x95 rifle verdict with an msrp of 2 000 many shooters will find the x95 s appeal to be a tough pill to swallow but the gun s relative inaccuracy in my opinion is a fair trade off for the reduced size and weight as well as its quick handling nature and if a shooter wants something easy to maneuver in tight spaces or store in a backpack that has flawless reliability the iwi x95 is king but before you commit to buying one you might want to pitch it as the perfect home defense gun for your wife first that or invest in a

textron aviation is continuing to work on raising production rates as demand remains robust despite war in ukraine a volatile stock market and inflation its top executive says of course we re watching that as everybody is ron draper textron aviation president and ceo told media during a pre ebace briefing every day the stock market is a surprise it hasn t affected conversations or demand we re still taking lots of orders we ve announced fleet orders we re in discussions with others on multi aircraft orders so the market s still strong and growing the company s order backlog at the end of march 2022 totaled 5 1 billion up 1 billion from a year ago it is a backlog that is allowing for stability in production stability in pricing opportunities for customers to plan replacements and pace the supply chain hiring needs according to the market draper says we continue to see the market growing he says its expanding in all segments and we re seeing people coming into the market from fractionals and charters to whole aircraft ownership in piston market in turboprops and in jets we re seeing concept customers stepping into whole aircraft ownership across our product portfolio some of our partners and fleet operators are stepping up for more and more purchases of aircraft flight activity continues to be strong at rates higher than pre pandemic levels he says with activity reaching the largest year over year increase in february customers are flying more than they ever have before in recent times draper says reporting that activity is up in every region of the world and that s exciting news he says one of the strongest increases year over year is in europe as the rest of the world recovers from covid or gets back to work and flying activities are really picking up that s good for the industry that s good for us from a service and an aircraft production standpoint the preowned market is in uncharted waters with record low amounts of inventory for sale he says that s good if you own an airplane today your values are up substantially and so our customers are happy with that draper says at the same time the company is investing in its products we ve continued to do that over the years and it s yielding great results for us he says in the last 10 years the company has introduced more than 15 clean sheet or upgraded products at the same time textron aviation has felt minimal impact from sanctions put on russia following its invasion of ukraine i think we had in our backlog five small aircraft of caravans down into pistons that were sold to russia that we re unable to deliver to russia draper said there s very minimal parts sales that were going to airplanes that are owned by russian entities that we can no longer sell to but it s really not material for us textron aviation does not work with russian suppliers so it also did not impact the company s direct supply chain it has had a second or third tier supplier impacted by the sanctions a move the company is working through he says as ebace prepares to open textron aviation notes that more than 1 800 of its turbine aircraft are in service in the european region we are thrilled to be back at ebace draper says it s great to be back with customers textron aviation plans to showcase five aircraft at the geneva show including ebace debuts of its citation cj4 gen2 citation xls gen2 and beechcraft king air 360 it also will display its citation longitude and citation latitude at the static display a bell 429 helicopter will also be exhibited in addition the company will highlight its aftermarket products and services at its exhibit at the palexpo convention center its aircraft will fly to the show on sustainable aviation fuel saf as its order book grows so does textron aviation s expansion of service capabilities it currently is adding a 4 000 ft 2 addition at its dusseldorf germany service center facility with space dedicated to increased parts inventory draper says it also is adding a mobile service unit in madrid in may textron aviation delivered the first skycourier turboprop to a customer following faa certification in march the year so far has also brought certification and delivery of the citation xls gen2 and citation m2 gen 2 the beechcraft denali turboprop marked its first flight last november as it looks to the future textron aviation is using a three phase approach to sustainability one is in energy consumption nearly all of the energy consumed at its kansas facilities come from sustainable sources with nearly 80 of its north american energy coming obtained through sustainable wind energy in addition all its jets are capable of running on saf something that its wichita campus keeps on hand for customers lastly the third element is in the design of future products and how to make them more sustainable that may be everything from current propulsion sources how do we make those engines more fuel friendly draper says such as the catalyst engine for the beechcraft denali the engine is 20 more efficient than the current offerings in addition the company is focused on designing interiors from sustainable sources its citation xls on display at ebace features an interior using materials from sustainable sources it s a customer choice draper says lastly the company has set up a wichita based division called eaviation to invest in future designs using alternate sources of propulsion and new technologies in may it acquired pipistrel based in slovenia pipistrel s velis electro is the first and to date only electric aircraft to receive full type certification from easa meanwhile draper says the u s pilot shortage is yet to affect the company directly textron aviation employs about 120 pilots within the company and has little turnover now some of our customers might have a little bit of trouble getting a second pilot or a third pilot for their flight department or something he says but the business aviation world doesn t deal with the numbers like the airlines some of our customers that are larger like wheels up or netjets that have hundreds and hundreds of pilots and you see them advertising quite a bit out there and offering incentives etc to attract pilots into their space in some cases the shortage has been a benefit to the company because it is selling cessna 172 trainers to flight schools around the world where they are scrambling to produce more pilots he says
during the first quarter of 2022 argentina s foreign debt fell due to payments made to the imf the effect of the fall in foreign exchange and the growth of gross domestic product compared to the same period of the previous year the country s external debt which now stands at 69 5 of gdp reached 80 during 2021 these data place argentina in the average of the region which stands at 65 3 while the debt of emerging countries is two points lower at 63 and the global debt rises to 103 2 due to the fact that in mature markets public indebtedness reaches 127 according to a report by the international surety institute iif global debt now exceeds 305 trillion dollars due above all to the rise in the debt of china and the united states the report highlights argentina as a country that manages to reduce its public debt during the first four months of 2022 compared to the last four months of the previous year however these good data only affect the public sector for their part companies reveal that their non financial corporate debt fell from 19 1 to 16 6 of gdp argentina is a country used to living with high levels of debt despite a slight drop in 2021 that continues to be maintained during the first four months of 2022 what are the consequences of high public debt the economic crisis caused by the covid 19 pandemic and negative interest rates have led to skyrocketing indebtedness worldwide state debt crises come out of nowhere and plague states until they take out new loans that allow them to repay their debt and which are also free of charge due to negative interest rates this seemingly perfect strategy would be the lifeline for many states but if creditors lose confidence in the solvency of the countries their interest rates would rise and the deal would no longer be so profitable faced with this situation states have three options option one cut public spending and try to pay for the war with taxpayers money however this option poses risks like those suffered in greece during the 2010s when the government s austerity policy led millions of citizens to lose their jobs and caused the country s productive capacity to disappear second option suspension of debt repayment as argentina did during 2022 this is the most risky option because it could lead to huge debts for banks which could end in bankruptcy and stagnation of the economy third option the central bank prints more money to pay off the state debt this is the strategy used by germany in 1923 however although apparently the easiest solution this choice caused the reichsmark the currency used in germany between 1924 and 1948 to lose its value in a few months causing hyperinflation turning to the central bank as a way to solve public debt is not one of the best options however in times of need it does not seem such a terrible solution as the european central bank ecb already demonstrated at the peak of the debt crisis when its president at the time mario draghi promised to buy unlimited government bonds if necessary the ecb will do everything in its power to preserve the euro said mario draghi in 2012 and managed to put an end to the crisis with just one sentence americas coordinator josé antonio sierra
introduction today s column presents brief commentary on three topics namely 1 the estimated break even prices for guyana s crude 2 likely brent crude oil price going forward and 3 the world bank s prediction of a guyana boom cycle going forward the presentation on break even prices simply wraps up last week s treatment of modelled cost shares for exxonmobil s five already announced projects to 2025 6 break even price as indicated this is a summary wrap up comment on last week s presentation of a modeled cost shares for exxon mobil crude oil cost of production in the stabroek bloc covering its first five projects to target year 2025 6 stock analysts writing in seeking alpha recently have estimated these break even prices as follows in us per barrel projects 1 4 cost 35 25 32 29 respectively over the long term the range is projected at 27 t0 29 usd b and production at 2 1 to2 5 million barrels per day brent crude price below i reproduce substantially the recent energy information administration eia forecast of brent crude prices to 2023 eia global liquid fuels forecast the eia s april short term energy outlook steo reports on elevated uncertainty due to a number of factors especially related to the russia ukraine war the steo assumes u s gdp growth of 3 4 in 2022 and 3 1 in 2023 following 5 7 in 2021 global gdp growth of 4 0 in 2022 and 3 7 in 2023 are also predicted compared to 6 0 in 2021 variations in macroeconomic outcomes are expected to affect energy markets significantly supply uncertainty arises from the conflict in ukraine opec production decisions and the rate at which u s oil and natural gas producers increase drilling the brent crude oil spot price averaged us 117 per barrel in march a us 20 increase from february crude oil prices increased following the russia ukraine war russian sanctions and other actions contributed to falling oil production and created significant market uncertainties over further oil supply disruptions these events occurred against a backdrop of low oil inventories and persistent upward oil price pressures global oil inventory draws averaged 1 7 million barrels per day b d from the third quarter of 2020 through the end of 2021 eia estimates that commercial oil inventories in the oecd ended q1 2022 at 2 61 billion barrels up slightly from february which was the lowest level since april 2014 the eia expects the brent price will average us 108 b in q2 2022 and us 102 b in the second half of 2022 the average price is expected to fall to us 93 b in 2023 however this price forecast is highly uncertain actual price outcomes will depend on the degree to which existing sanctions imposed on russia any potential future sanctions and independent corporate actions affect russia s oil production or the sale of russia s oil in the global market also other oil producers response along with macroeconomic developments will impact global oil demand and price formation going forwards although russia s oil production is reduced in the forecast eia still expects that global oil inventories will build at an average rate of 0 5 million b d from q2 2022 through the end of 2023 eia expects this will put downward pressure on crude oil prices however if production disruptions in russia or elsewhere are more than it forecasts the resulting crude oil prices would be higher than their current forecast further the eia estimates that 98 3 million b d of petroleum and liquid fuels was consumed globally in march 2022 an increase of 2 4 million b d from march 2021 it forecasts that global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels will average 99 8 million b d for all of 2022 which is a 2 4 million b d increase from 2021 however this forecast is down by 0 8 million b d from last month s forecast as a result of downward revisions to global gdp growth from oxford economics they forecast that global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels will rise by 1 9 million b d in 2023 to average 101 7 million b d the outlook for economic growth and oil consumption in russia and surrounding countries continues to source eia steo april 2022 the table below shows brent crude oil prices historical and estimated over ten years 2014 2023 boom cycle writing recently on guyana s economy the world bank has offered the opinion that guyana s oil resources are locked in a boom cycle for the next two years and beyond going forward the gdp growth rates for last year and projected for this year are 21 3 percent and 49 7 percent respectively indeed between the year of guyana s first oil 2019 and 2030 the world bank projects its gdp will more than treble in value of course by then the share of the oil and gas sector in gdp will exceed 25 percent further the per capita gdp will be around us 17 000 close to high income other development partners share this view thus the economic commission for latin america eclac has offered a 2021 growth rate of 18 5 percent and projects this year at 46 0 percent conclusion next week i continue with other indicators of the condition of guyana s nascent petroleum driven economy
minnesota congresswoman ilhan omar and 25 other house democrats on friday called for a federal probe of the nation s concentrated baby formula industry amid a national shortage that has prompted emergency action from lawmakers and the white house we are writing to urge the federal trade commission ftc to work with relevant federal agencies to investigate the u s baby formula industry and study any unfair or unsustainable practices like deceptive marketing price gouging and stock buybacks that may be weakening our nutritional formula supply and ultimately harming our constituents states the democrats letter to the agency s chair lina khan abbott makes 43 of all formula its factory was shut down because it gamed safety tests skipped repairs to cut costs instead it spent 10 billion on dividends for wealthy shareholders since 2019 pic twitter com 07c7pdmhre more perfect union moreperfectus may 20 2022 while acknowledging that the ongoing covid 19 pandemic has caused supply chain issues the letter also suggests that the gradual consolidation of the baby formula market may be worsening these disruptions and deficiencies highlighting that abbott nutrition nestlé perrigo and reckitt benckiser collectively control about 90 of the u s market this type of high market concentration may come at the cost of decreasing market redundancy and flexibility while increasing the risk of sector wide shortages even if a single plant ceases manufacturing the document notes referencing abbott s recent facility closure and recall the lawmakers are also concerned about how the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic could be contributing to such alarmingly high concentration in the industry due to exclusive contracts granted for the program which boosts formula access for low income families we must make sure that no corners are being cut on any level when nutritional formula is such a necessity for many americans the letter asserts that is why we are requesting that the ftc use its 6 b authority to conduct a wide ranging study on the consolidation of the nutritional formula industry as the letter lays out the ftc should work with other federal partners to provide a report on the economic and health impacts of the formula industry s fragile supply chain and manufacturing capabilities it should also include an analysis of business and financial practices by these formula companies that could be contributing to declines in affordability consumer choice and product quality lastly this report should have recommendations to congress and regulators on improving federal programs and regulatory or enforcement actions to strengthen domestic supply prevent future shortages and stabilize formula prices for all american families the democrats are hoping for a response from khan within the next month their call for ftc action came within hours of the guardian reporting on financial documents and whistleblower testimony about how abbott used recent windfall profits to enrich shareholders even as equipment at a factory that was later shut down in connection with bacterial contamination was failing and in need of repair president joe biden on wednesday invoked the defense production act to increase the u s supply of baby formula and launched operation fly formula which is using defense department planes to speed up imports biden is also expected to sign the access to baby formula act which congress approved this week the legislation allows the u s department of agriculture to waive requirements to enable families to keep buying formula with their wic benefits the house also passed a bill to provide 28 million in emergency funding for the u s food and drug administration to address the formula shortage and prevent similar events in the future but that measure faces an uncertain future in the senate join us in defending the truth before it s too late the future of independent journalism is uncertain and the consequences of losing it are too grave to ignore to ensure truthout remains safe strong and free we need to raise 50 000 in the next 10 days every dollar raised goes directly toward the costs of producing news you can trust please give what you can because by supporting us with a tax deductible donation you re not just preserving a source of news you re helping to safeguard what s left of our democracy this piece was reprinted by truthout with permission or license it may not be reproduced in any form without permission or license from the source
may 22 marks national maritime day congress established it in 1933 in commemoration of the steam ship savannah and her maiden voyage which was the first trans atlantic journey ever made by a steam powered vessel in the 203 years since the savannah departed her eponymous port in georgia for liverpool england oceangoing technology has come a long way and maritime shipping has become a supply chain backbone that keeps goods arriving from all over the world much of this shipping activity travels along the great circle route off western alaska the oceans surrounding alaska are special they re pristine a source of food and a place for adventure recreation and commerce accidents on these waters can damage lives and communities for generations as the exxon valdez oil spill in 1989 demonstrated following that disaster congress passed the oil pollution act of 1990 opa90 to better protect our coastal waters by requiring industry funded response capabilities and incentivizing safer shipping practices to prevent such incidents from occurring again since then industry operations technology and the environment have evolved giving rise to shipping routes unforeseen 30 years ago in western alaska and the u s arctic as a result opa90 s original intent is no longer well served as it has not kept pace with those changes stakeholder knowledge and advancements in maritime operations can and should be leveraged to modernize regulations making them better suited for the 21st century and the evolving maritime activity off alaska fortunately the u s house included language in the coast guard authorization act of 2022 named after alaska congressman don young which updates spill response requirements to meet the evolving challenges of our large state and remote waters it s an important step in the right direction i m pleased to join alaskans from across the state in urging the u s senate to update opa90 in this proactive way for the future health of our oceans fish stocks and communities the authorization act makes important and needed updates to opa90 by creating more clarity and transparency in the regulatory process establishing minimum requirements for oil spill response capabilities and tailoring those updates to the vast remote and sparse regions of alaska s coastal waters the simplest oil spill to clean up or maritime incident to salvage is the one that never happens however the current system of opa90 regulations has made prevention efforts more challenging over the years due to arbitrarily interpreted regulations and modern technology not being taken into consideration the proposed solution in the authorization act requires development of clear consistent and transparent oil spill prevention and response rules for western alaska these not only benefit shippers operating in alaska but also regulators stakeholders and local communities one clear set of rules will prevent confusion reduce risk and set clear expectations for all parties involved collaboration in the development of these new regulations is critical and the authorization act requires engagement from a variety of stakeholders such as shipping and fishing interests alaska native organizations recreators and state regulators the updated rules will reflect the values of alaskans and the reality of the unique maritime challenges we face off our remote coastline this update to opa90 also comes at a critical time the arctic region holds great potential shippers are looking north to reduce costly global transits by traveling through the arctic ocean cruise companies are expanding their horizons with voyages through the northwest passage and nations are grappling with the security and environmental challenges posed by a warming circumpolar north protection and maintenance of the pristine arctic environment is a top priority in these complicated and challenging discussions the proposed updates to opa90 proactively address incident prevention and response rules that work for alaska at a defining moment of arctic policy deliberation as we reflect on the history of global shipping we must also look forward and set the stage for what the next 50 years of alaska ocean health and commerce the late congressman young was instrumental in crafting the original opa90 so it s fitting that the 2022 coast guard authorization act is named in his honor the legislation charts a positive future for the maritime industry and alaska s oceans one of cooperation collaboration clarity and consistency like congressman young the legislation aims to ensure that one of our most vital resources our oceans continues to thrive for generations to come it has passed the house and like other alaskans i m hopeful it is improved passes the senate and becomes law so alaska s oceans have the protections they truly deserve buddy custard is the president and chief executive officer of the maritime safety and oil spill response organization alaska chadux network he possesses extensive knowledge and expertise from working in maritime operations in both the public and private sectors including serving with the u s coast guard for over 30 years attaining the rank of captain and as an executive for an oil exploration and production company operating in the u s arctic outer continental shelf

embraer executive jets has received a boost in orders from first time buyers which make up 38 of embraer s order backlog for business jets the market is stronger than ever michael amalfitano embraer executive jets ceo said in a pre ebace briefing with the weekly of business aviation so we re pretty excited to see this base of the marketplace growing amalfitano says if i was to sum up the marketplace it s robust it s resilient it s clearly a market that s emphasizing the things that are important to these first time buyers in health safety privacy and being able to go where they want to go versus the travel bans of commercial travel being a little bit more restricted as we go through these past couple of years embraer is returning to the european business aviation conference exhibition with its phenom 300e light jet and the praetor 600 super midsize jet on static display we re seeing not only the benefit that flexjet brings to the fractional marketplace but we re getting a lot of traction clearly more so domestically so far but we ll see europe follow in terms of corporate flight departments in terms of its international expansion amalfitano says so we re very excited to have the 300e and the praetor 600 on display for embraer buyers technology and sustainability are exciting developments he says the things that our planes have in terms of leading edge technologies and advancements has been a big part of why they have gravitated to our products amalfitano says as you know the market seems to be strongest at its base right now whether it s something as small as the vision jet that cirrus makes all the way through our praetor 600 up to the super midsize those segments are very strong driven by the fact that you can t find a used airplane the percentage of pre owned fleet for sale on the market is in the single digits which has helped new aircraft he says embraer has a strong backlog amalfitano notes the company is selling aircraft for delivery into the third quarter of 2024 across its product lines the strength of the backlogs obviously for across all the families have really gravitated to these customers who say i want the best aircraft that i can find from the marketplace that gives me the bespoke travel solutions i want to travel mobility security and health and safety for my business and family so we re getting a big lift off of that embraer continues its guidance to deliver from 100 and 110 aircraft in 2022 he says the variance in the forecast is driven by the supply chain in 2021 the company delivered 93 business jets according to general aviation manufacturers association data you re trying to create balance in terms of making sure your supply chain can keep up with the demand because it s off the charts across all four products from entry level light mid and super mid amalfitano says a frequent question is whether first time buyers will return to charter and to the commercial airlines he says we would say no in our case amalfitano says we re seeing that these buyers could always buy an airplane they always had the wealth to buy their own jet they may have charter they may have been in turboprops or helicopter or pistons they had some interest in activity in aviation and with their wealth they could buy and operate an aircraft but they never had a reason to do it now health and safety issues sustainability and technology advances are convincing them to buy to protect their company their employees and families he says new buyers and longer lead times have brought a change in its sales approach we ve been very active amalfitano says we have a greater than 80 stickiness with customers so we do a lot of engagement a lot of collaborative learning in terms of education in that regards whether that be configurators so they can see and feel and understand their aircraft that is important because new buyers want to receive delivery of their aircraft quickly and with the backlogs they have to wait he says so what are you doing to keep them interested in your brand educating them about your family your products what you can do to support them in terms of service embraer introduces buyers early to its customer service and support pretty exciting stuff amalfitano says we re riding the wave like you d expect us to as an oem in terms of the strength of the marketplace in response embraer is raising production rates but you have to be smart about balancing the demand which is at a peak with the supply chain and logistics are at a trough he says if you re not smart about how you manage your production rate growth then you could find yourself in a tough sport with those customers so we re being very smart about how we grow embraer is closely managing its suppliers sub tier suppliers plant and assembly line it has employees on the plant floor to make sure aircraft in production are meeting timelines we don t want to get over our skis just because of the exuberance in the marketplace today amalfitano says we want to manage that so we can have pricing discipline and we can have quality and safety discipline that is critical to the industry in terms of the russian market and its sanctions embraer does not have russian exposure in its business aviation segment amalfitano says and it has limited exposure as a company you see a little bit of impact obviously more logistically because you have to take care of service and parts but there s nothing in terms of customer exposure overall embraer customers are not speculative buyers and are not concerned about the impact of the russian invasion of ukraine inflation and the stock market he says they re managing through that amalfitano says i think middle america is more impacted by some of the news that we see they can sustain a lot of the noise that we see so i don t see any real risk as we move forward

goal of developing the rok u s alliance into a global comprehensive strategic alliance and we discussed relevant actions to that end moreover we engaged in a candid conversation building friendship and trust today i also realized that president biden and i see eye to eye on so many fronts over the past 69 years the rok u s alliance has evolved into the linchpin of peace and prosperity in the region now a longstanding mission of denuclearizing north korea as well as the covid 19 crisis shifting trade order supply chain realignment climate change democracy in crisis and numerous other new challenges confront our alliance these challenges can be tackled only when countries sharing the universal values of a liberal democracy and human rights come together the rok u s alliance sets an exemplary model of such solidarity korea and the u s as global comprehensive strategic allies stand ready to meet these challenges collectively and shape a rules based order in that process these aspirations that president biden and i share are well reflected in the joint statement we re adopting today in the negotiations leading up to the joint statement our two countries deputies have

currently north korea is struggling with a covid 19 crisis putting aside political and military considerations i am more than willing to provide assistance from humanitarian and human rights perspectives i call on north korea to respond to this proposal positively and begin taking practical steps towards denuclearization we live in an era where economy is security and security in turn is economy supply chain disruptions resulting from a change in global security order are directly linked to the lives of our people to adapt to the new reality the rok u s alliance must also evolve further not just with words but with actions we should ceaselessly strive to deliver real benefits that can impact the peoples of our two countries president biden and i in the field of semiconductors batteries civil nuclear power space development cyberspace and other emerging industries agree to step up our practical cooperation market shocks stemming from a shifting international order will also be actively addressed through our collective response and as a first step our offices of the president will launch an economic security dialogue so that in supply chains advanced science and

countries civil nuclear industries committed to work together moreover our two nations with regard to the defense industry now emerging as a future growth engine concurred to initiate discussions on a reciprocal defense procurement agreement that can be likened to an fta in the defense sector korea amid the ravages of war achieved a remarkable growth with the help of the united states and the wider international community the world now recognizes us as an advanced democracy the 10th largest economy and a cultural powerhouse we stand ready to proactively fulfill the role expected of us by the international community to honor our responsibility and commitment the indo pacific is a region important to both our countries our two nations will work in concert to build a rules based order in the indo pacific and taking that first step is to participate in the indo pacific economic framework with a view to expanding our contributions and roles in the region we will also work to formulate a relevant strategy our two countries in response to immediate global challenges will pursue even closer coordination a tragedy brought on by russia s invasion of ukraine must be resolved swiftly so

security in addressing the existential threat to humanity posed by climate change our two countries will endeavor to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets and 2050 net zero emission goals through even greater coordination the friendship and trust i have forged with president biden today will pave the way for further reinforcing our bilateral partnership for a new era towards this goal i hope our two countries will engage in frequent communication and close consultation with each other thank you next we re going to invite the president of the united states for his statement president biden thank you for all the time that you gave me today particularly our private conversations and the incredible hospitality and welcome we ve received i m honored to be able to be to meet you so early in your tenure and it s a pleasure to get to know get to know you personally i m delighted to be back in your beautiful country and at a time when the alliance between the republic of korea and the united states has never been stronger more vibrant or i might add more vital and i believe that this trip is coming at a particularly interesting moment because we re seeing so many expectations in asia and the broader indo pacific region being updated i i m looking forward to it even occurring more my administration is pursuing an economic strategy designed to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out and it s paying dividends even in the face of historic economic challenges our economy is providing and proving to be resilient in fact just yesterday an independent analysis projected that the american economy is poised to grow at a faster rate than china than the chinese economy for the first time in 45 years since 1976 and our relationship with our allies including i m proud to say the republic of korea are closer than they ve ever been and our people are growing even closer as we speak our businesses are blazing new trails together and and it all goes to my core belief something i ve said for a long time it s never a good bet to bet against the united states of america we re a nation that is all about one thing possibilities endless possibilities and that optimism is a commitment and commitment to an innovation where breaking barriers is something that koreans and americans share yesterday the president and i visited a factory where korean and american innovation are working in tandem to produce the most advanced semiconductors in the world and i welcome the billions of dollars of investment that korean companies like samsung are making in the united states investments that will bring our two countries even closer together cooperating even more closely than we already do and help strengthen our supply chains secure them against shocks and give our economies a competitive edge today president yoon and i discussed the broad range of issues as he s mentioned today i apologize for repeating him on both regional and global terms the cooperation between the republic in korea and the united states is vital to our shared strategic progress at least we both believe that from fighting this pandemic to strengthening global health security health systems and so that we can better be prepared for the next major global health event and there will be others from increasing our climate ambitions to accelerating climate solutions like development of electric vehicles from standing up to our shared for our shared democratic values and defending a rule based international order against threats in stability our alliance is making important contributions to shape the future for our children and korea s strong and its dynamic economy is a powerful example of that for the rest of the world i also want to thank the people of korea for their strong support for the people of ukraine putin s war against ukraine isn t just a matter for europe it s an attack on democracy and the core international principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and the republic of korea and the united states are standing together part of a global response with our allies and partners around the world to condemn russia s flagrant violations of international law and to hold russia accountable and to support the people of ukraine tomorrow the president and i will be visiting with the korean and american troops who are still serving side by side even today decades after our troops first fought valiantly together to preserve the freedom of the republic of korea it s emblematic of our strength and our continuing strength and of the durability of our alliance and our readiness to take on all threats together and today president yoon and i committed to strengthening our close engagement and work together to take on challenges of regional security including addressing the threat posed by the democratic people s republic of korea by further strengthening our deterrence posture and working toward a complete denuclearization of the prin of the korean peninsula as the president has already spoken to promoting stability across the taiwan straits as well and ensuring freedom of navigation including in the south china sea and beyond so thank you again mr president for your warm welcome for your commitment to strengthening our alliance and for explan expanding our global partnership i look forward to years to come now i believe who asks the first question moderator as interpreted now we re going to open the floor for questions and answers the presidents of the two countries will be designate a person that will be asking questions now we ll be taking a question from a korean journalist will be posing a question to the korean president so please raise your hand and the president will designate a person for the question q as interpreted thank you for this opportunity to pose a question my name is han ji hoon yonhap news agency first regarding the concept of economic security a number of koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar so what are the benefits the korean economy can gain from the economic security promote cooperation what are the real benefits that can be experienced by the korean people and in addition to that you talked about universal values solidarity and alliance and you very much underscored that point but if there are for example countries that cannot share those values for example strong export regulations or controls that the united states is imposing on other countries do you think you can take resort to those measures as well president yoon as interpreted as you may be very well aware economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels let s say for example this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people and important industrial goods for them to be produced for example let s say that we re trying to produce and manu a car the unique system of semiconductors and for example we had inaudible water issues recently and so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production and to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy and this is in turn related to the national security as well as military security and in the past we had the wto system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order but due to the covid 19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain so it is very important to stabilize the supply chain and especially our two countries the united states and korea we share the values of democracy and human rights and among the likeminded countries they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain that is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security the nscs of the offices of the president are given that authority to deal with this issue and for example if there are any difficult issues to be resolved then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security and we decided to pursue this goal going forward in addition if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market there could be possible shocks and when that happens the two countries can step in to help with each other and also related to the military security and also economic security especially in relation to the export of defense items what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields this is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words empty promises it is going to be an alliance that takes action together and we decided to evolve our alliance even further and the united states and korea we advocate democracy human rights and freedom and even those countries that are not sharing those specific values for the world peace of course we re not trying to exclude them in the process but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values so especially we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values moderator as interpreted now we ll take the question from the american journalist who will be posing questions to the american president please raise your hand president biden trevor hunnicutt q thank you first of all president yoon your joint statement mentions a number of initiatives that you ll be taking on the security front but it doesn t mention whether you asked the president for nuclear bombers submarines or aircraft carriers are those of interest to you and do you expect that the president will be deploying them and for you president biden there is no mention in the joint statement about whether there would be any preconditions for you meeting with north korea s kim or providing vaccines to north korea and so i wanted to see if there are any preconditions for that and then ahead of your meetings in tokyo i understand that they will be asking for you to consider rejoining the tpp that was negotiated by president obama could you talk a little bit about your thinking about whether this indo pacific economic framework can lead to a bigger trade deal in the region thank you president biden would you like me to go first the answer with regard to would i meet would i provide vaccines for north korea and would i prepare to meet the answer is yes we ve offered vaccines not only to north korea but to china as well and we re prepared to do that immediately we ve gotten no response with regard to whether i would meet with the leader of north korea that would be dependent on whether he was sincere and whether it was serious what was the other question you asked me q the tpp the tpp and whether there s room for a broader trade deal to come out of the indo pacific economic framework we understand that japan and others would like you to consider reconsider joining president biden well i think what you re going to see is what we re talking about in terms of this this arrangement we re discussing now it s it s quite significant and what we re talking about is as it was pointed out an economic strategy that for the ind the entire indo pacific region and it s working on in critical areas in the supply chain not just the semiconductors but a range of other products as well semiconductors which is we ve already discussed a little bit infrastructure and making sure we make available the capacity to provide modern infrastructure to many of the countries in the region who may not have the capacity three the a digital economy dealing with cybersecurity standards and sharing major standards of data access based on the boundaries within trust and that we that needs to be done in our view as well as a clean and renewable environment clean energy technologies a global minimum tax the tax side of the equation just like we we recently negotiated and deal with establishing foreign product practices act effect internationally all that is quite broad and it is separate from and also semi inclusive of what the tpp was about so this is the objective that i have in mind we have in mind at the front end here president yoon as interpreted a journalist from the u s posed me a question regarding extended deterrence let me address that question every day we re seeing north korea advancing its nuclear and missile capabilities and president biden and i shared grave concerns and more than anything else we believe that this is something that merits our utmost attention president biden also reiterated and reemphasized his commitment the u s commitment to effective extended deterrence and at the same time key to our combined defense capability is the combined military exercises and we are going to step up our exercises and we will be coordinating between ourselves regarding the deployment of u s strategic military assets we will take some time in coordinating between ourselves and regarding the cyber threats or the threats emanating from north korea s asymmetrical capabilities we will continue to consult with one another as to how to counter those threats and at the same time we will reactivate the edscg and we will continue to advance and step up our high level consultative mechanisms i hope that i answered your question moderator as interpreted so we re taking questions from korean journalists and american journalists but so we ll go back to the korean journalists so please keep your question to just one item q i am cho young min from channel a thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to pose a question we this is an extension of the previous question we talked about how to respond to the evolving nuclear threat of north korea that you said that you re going to present an action plan to strengthen the effect of extended deterrence so regarding that action plan i wonder what kind of specific discussions you had today did you see eye to eye on this action plan president yoon as interpreted in the past when it came to extended deterrence we just talked about a nuclear umbrella that was what i thought about extended deterrence in the past but beyond that there could be many other aspects including fighters bombers and missiles so regarding the timely deployment of such strategic assets we did engage in the discussions today and going forward i believe that there will be more concrete discussions between our two sides that was our agreement and it will be between our nscs and also as i already stated in the course of answering the question from the u s journalist in order to prepare against a possible nuclear attack our two countries combined military exercises i believe should be stepped up in many aspects we had that discussion thank you moderator as interpreted we are going back to the american journalist posing questions to the american president this is going to be the last question so please keep your question to just one item president biden seung min with the washington post q thank you mr president you are here in the region to promote the united states economic cooperation with south korea and japan but the two countries have been locked in a trade dispute on top of their bilateral relationship deteriorating for a number of reasons over in recent years so what kind of a role would the united states play here in resolving those and other disputes so that your administration can further your goal of of bolstering your economic alliance with the region and then i have a question for president yoon president biden you only get one laughter q one per leader president biden i m protecting him laughter the answer is that we discussed that in generic terms the fact is that i ll be going from here to tokyo and discussing this as well i think it s critically important that we have a very close trilateral relationship including economically as well as as militarily and i think you ll see that there are ways to deal with some of the trade barriers that were placed some of which by the way were placed by my predecessor which we re we re looking at very closely right now so i think there s a lot of room to move in addition to that if you know i think you covered the fact that i spend a lot of time with the asean nations as well as the quartet there s there s a whole range of things have changed there is a sense among the democracies in the pacific that there s a need to cooperate much more closely not just militarily but in terms of economically and politically and so we talked in at some length about the need for us to make this larger than just the united states japan and and korea but to the entire pacific and the south pacific and the indo pacific and i think this is an opportunity you know you ve heard me say it a hundred times i m sorry to the american press to repeat it but i really do think we re at an inflection point in world history things are changing so rapidly i think you re seeing that what you re going to see more of is this is going to be competition between democracies and autocracies and i mean that sincerely and unfortunately i think i m being proven to be correct not just here but around the world and again we talked at length about this is a not only just regional but it s also a global alliance in effect of how we re going to respond and i don t mean a formal written alliance but for example if you notice korea and japan have both stepped up in support of ukraine you find that in the quad is supporting ukraine so there s a whole range of things that affect whether or not democracies can be sustained in the midst of this incredible change that is taking place we both agreed that it could and should be and that together we can play a major part in having that done thank you appreciate it q your cabinet nominees are overwhelmingly male south korea consistently ranks low among developed countries on professional advancement of women and you yourself during your presidential campaign proposed abolishing the ministry of gender equality what role should a leading world economy like south korea play in improving the representation and advancement of women and what will you and your administration do to improve the state of gender equality in this country president yoon as interpreted if you look at the public officials sector especially the ministers in the cabinet we really didn t see a lot of women advancing to that position thus far probably in various regions equal opportunities were not fully ensured for women we have actually a quite short history of ensuring that so what we re trying to do is to very actively ensure such opportunities for women moderator as interpreted this concludes the joint press conference the presidents of the two countries will leave the room first president biden thank you moderator as interpreted this concludes the joint press conference in the interest of time and they have other schedules to attend to later on so we would like to thank the journalists once again for their time here and also for constructive questions thank you 4 51 p m

dear asparagus i do love you so but i am writing to let you know that out of economic necessity i think we should start seeing other local spring vegetables on my plate our relationship is not over not by a long shot i will always fall prey to your charms when you show up at farmers markets in maine in early may then i will spring for a 6 ½ pound bundle of organic spears steam them perfectly adorn them with only butter and salt and keep you all to myself but after that cozy rendezvous for two i simply must play the field to best feed my friends and family i m not really complaining about your price tag and i ve seen non organic local spears selling for as little as 8 pound while i m not a grower myself i understand the work required to raise asparagus sustainably this far north and i know you must be harvested by hand hands that need to earn a a living wage still if i spend 12 pound for any vegetable my budget dictates that i must make it last a couple of meals therefore i m turning to techniques i learned in culinary school for stretching expensive ingredients skills that make eaters feel their portion of the ingredient is much bigger than it is there are two ways for me to slice and dice you asparagus to make you appear more abundant in the bowl when you re raw i can use a potato peeler to shave you lengthwise like a carrot holding the spear just below its delicate flowering tip between my left thumb and index finger i will lay it on top of an overturned 4 quart saucepan this position gives my right hand knuckles ample room above the countertop to whittle the spear into six thin ribbons if i split the tip in half lengthwise and then into quarters the total yield per spear will be 10 pieces that number makes a more substantial impression than one lonely spear would when you re blanched for three minutes in boiling salted water and then shocked in ice water to set your spring greenness i can store you in the fridge for days from there i will cut one spear into more than a dozen bite sized pieces by splitting it lengthwise down the middle and then slicing those on the diagonal which makes the pieces appear bigger than a straight cut would a dozen pieces can make you appear plentiful in dishes from spring vegetable stir fries to goat cheese and asparagus pizza pies advertisement no matter how i cut you from now on expect to find friends in the bowl with you in her book vegetable literacy vegetarian chef deborah madison says you play well with other spring vegetables like peas fava beans green garlic young turnips and sorrel let me add to that list maine fiddlehead ferns off label products like kale rabe bolting winter greens any storage crops hanging around multi colored carrots watermelon radishes and gnarly celery root and last but not least farm fresh spring eggs i can make a quick satisfying meal breakfast lunch or dinner out of three blanched asparagus spears two eggs and a single king oyster mushroom in a nonstick skillet in a glug of olive oil i ll brown the thickly sliced mushroom i ll crisscross the spears over the cooked mushroom bits and crack eggs into the space between the asparagus posts i ll cover the skillet and wait for the contained heat to finish cooking the eggs a sprinkle of aleppo pepper flakes will add a finishing touch of color and spice for a lighter meal i can assemble a bowl of shaved yellow carrots thinly sliced purple daikon radish and torn tender spinach placing asparagus ribbons and quartered tips prominently on top i m confident eaters will recall you as a main ingredient to transform this asparagus forward lunch into dinner i ll toss in handfuls of cooked grains and beans and dress it with a homemade vinaigrette so you see my very dear in both senses of the word local asparagus i absolutely do treasure our time together i have no intention of dropping you like a hot potato just know that i may prepare you as the filling for said spud as i work to stretch my food

london ap tesla ceo elon musk promised that taking over twitter would enable him to rid the social media platform of its annoying spam bots now he s arguing _ without presenting any evidence _ that there might be just too many of those automated accounts for the 44 billion deal to move ahead the sharp turnaround by the world s richest man makes little sense except as a method to scuttle or renegotiate a deal that s becoming increasingly costly for musk experts said and while such hardball tactics aren t uncommon in corporate mergers the way it s happening in a highly public seemingly erratic conversation on the very platform musk wants to buy has little precedent in effect musk is negotiating the future of twitter on twitter that s the hook he s trying to grab onto as the reason for him to potentially walk away or negotiate the price down lower said brian quinn an associate law professor at boston college he is torpedoing the deal trying to talk down the deal musk took to twitter early tuesday to say his deal to buy the company can t move forward unless the company shows public proof that fewer than 5 of the accounts on the social media platform are fake or spam that followed a friday tweet that said the deal was on hold pending more bot details causing twitter stock to plunge by nearly 10 and monday comments at a miami conference suggesting he wanted a lower price for the company experts say musk can t unilaterally place the deal on hold although that hasn t stopped him from acting as though he can if he walks away he could be on the hook for a 1 billion breakup fee musk also spent much of monday in a back and forth with twitter ceo parag agrawal who posted a series of tweets explaining his company s effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5 of twitter accounts are fake it s a message that twitter has been disclosing to the u s securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low in his tweet tuesday musk said that 20 fake spam accounts while 4 times what twitter claims could be much higher my offer was based on twitter s sec filings being accurate he added yesterday twitter s ceo publicly refused to show proof of 5 this deal cannot move forward until he does that kind of language makes no sense quinn said the disclosures he s complaining about are the same disclosures the company has filed at the sec for quite a bit of time there s nothing new here quinn said in the run up to the transaction the company gave him the opportunity to engage in due diligence and kick the tires and look around he waived due diligence and said no i don t want to see any more twitter declined to comment getting cold feet about mergers is nothing new it sometimes leads prospective buyers to look for changed conditions that can get them out of a deal or offering price it was the covid 19 pandemic in part that led french luxury powerhouse lvmh the parent company of louis vuitton and other apparel and wine brands to say it was abandoning a planned takeover of u s jeweler tiffany co in 2020 tiffany sued to enforce the deal and lvmh lashed back in the end the famed jeweler agreed to a slightly reduced buyout price by matt o brien and tom krisher
dan moisand guest columnist q my husband and i want to help pay for my grandson s college costs but a friend of mine at lunch said that if i gift more than 15 000 to him there is a tax is there really a tax if i pay for my grandson s college cindy in rockledge a cindy there is a tax on gifts but you should be able to pay for your grandson s college without incurring the tax there are several gifts you can make that are completely exempted from the gift tax you may gift an unlimited amount to your spouse or a qualified charity specific to your question a cash gift paid directly to a university for tuition on behalf of a student is exempt from the tax so is a gift paid directly to an institution such as a hospital for certain health care expenses when a gift goes to a non spouse non charitable recipient for general use by the receiver the gift tax can apply if it exceeds the annual gift tax exclusion for 2022 the exclusion is 16 000 this limit is indexed to inflation it was 15 000 last year the exclusion allows you to gift up to 16 000 of assets each to as many people as you like without incurring a gift tax because the exclusion is per person your spouse is also able to gift 16 000 to as many people as he would like that simple construct can be employed in creative ways more looks like inflation s here to stay how should i invest to stay ahead of it more here s a topic of truly high interest will the federal reserve board kill my bonds for instance say you wanted to help your daughter and her husband buy a house both you and your husband could give your daughter 16 000 for a total gift of 32 000 since the exemption is per person you could also give your son in law 16 000 each making the total tax free transfer 64 000 further the exemption is per year so if they don t plan to buy until 2023 and additional 64 000 can be gifted without gift tax after jan 1 2023 so yes there is an annual limit but with some planning it is possible to transfer more under the right circumstances these dollar amounts refer to the fair market value of the asset transferred gifts such as what i just described do not necessarily need to be made in cash in some cases gifting shares of stock other investments or other assets can have additional tax benefits even if you go over the annual limit you may avoid gift taxes by filing form 709 and using some of your unified credit let s go back to the house buying example and pretend your daughter and son in law need 100 000 right away to buy their dream home you and your husband maximize the use of the annual exclusion to make gifts of 64 000 gift tax free you could also gift them the additional 36 000 free of gift tax by using some of your credit for 2022 the unified credit equates to 12 060 000 of assets per person assuming you have not yet used any of your credit prior to this you could gift the additional 36 000 and would still have 12 024 000 that could be left to your non spouse non charitable heirs or gifted during your lifetime free of estate or gift tax your husband would still have his full 12 060 000 available take note that without congressional action the unified credit is scheduled in 2026 to reduce back to the prior scale when the trump era tax provisions expire estimates put the 2026 exempted amount at around 6 million per person families with significant assets and the desire to keep estate and gift taxes to a minimum should consider gifting techniques that take advantage of this current higher exemption nonetheless with some planning and proper accounting gifting larger amounts without paying gift taxes is easily done for most americans under current law dan moisand cfp is a past national president of the financial planning association and has been featured as one of america s top financial planners by at least 10 financial planning publications he can be reached at www moisandfitzgerald com or 321 253 5400 ext 101
you cannot change the culture by simply asking politely says former democratic state sen hannah beth jackson who co authored the law that was struck down the patriarchy was not about to take this one sitting down in 2018 then gov jerry brown signed a bill into law making it a requirement that all publicly held california corporations put women on their boards of directors the arithmetic was simple by the end of 2019 all boards were to have at least one female director by the end of 2021 boards with six or more directors were to have at least three female directors boards with five directors were to have two hefty fines would be levied on noncompliant companies advertisement the law has proved to be a stunning success i could slam you with all kinds of statistics but suffice to say that in 2018 the year before it took effect women held only 15 5 of director seats on the boards of publicly held corporations in california by 2021 they held 32 of board seats today 99 of the companies affected by the law have at least one woman on their board some have two or three but just as california was blazing a trail for the rest of the country the old guard objected right wing legal groups decried what one called the woman quota law and argued it violates the california constitution s equal protection clause the government should not force people to put a job candidate s sex above his or her individual traits declared the pacific legal foundation any law that puts equal numbers above equal treatment undermines the very concept of equality haven t we learned though over the course of american history that equal numbers result in equal treatment advertisement unfortunately los angeles county superior court judge maureen duffy lewis who was appointed in 1987 by republican gov george deukmejian agreed with the law s opponents so did my colleague nick goldberg who while lauding the law s goal wrote last week that he found it too intrusive a related law requiring boards of public corporations to increase the number of directors from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups by the end of this year was tossed by a different los angeles judge last month in her may 13 ruling duffy lewis said that the state failed to prove that publicly held corporations headquartered in california engaged in purposeful and intentional unlawful discrimination in filling board seats advertisement she wrote that the state had not produced a single identifiable victim of gender discrimination and therefore had not proved its case but how would a victim even be identified boards are chosen in secret you don t toss your name into the ring you get tapped on the shoulder as one witness in the trial testified boards have a propensity to select persons they already know isn t that actually a pretty good definition of systemic discrimination if you golf with people who look like you and lunch with people who look like you and network with people who look like you why would you ever feel the need to reach beyond your circle unless someone say the state gave you a nudge the notion that change is going to happen on its own is just pie in the sky said former democratic state sen hannah beth jackson who co wrote the law with her colleague toni atkins the senate s president pro tem you cannot change the culture by simply asking politely jackson had tried that once already in 2013 jackson introduced a resolution a request basically that asked california s publicly traded companies to add women to their boards over the next five years women s representation grew from an ultra paltry 15 5 below the national average of 16 5 to a slightly less paltry 16 that was it jackson told me obviously it was not working you cannot say pretty please with a cherry on top we have got to have legislation to change the culture it s the reason we have public policy advertisement california secretary of state shirley weber has vowed to appeal the decision which she said in a statement emailed to reporters ignores critical and substantial evidence of discrimination in the director selection process the good news is that the california law tenuous though it may be at this point has already exerted a powerful influence it absolutely elevated the conversation about board diversity throughout the country and internationally as well said annalisa barrett a senior advisor at the auditing firm kpmg and an expert on corporate governance and board diversity advertisement many studies barrett said show a link between diversity in the boardroom of gender as well as race and better financial performance kpmg issued a report on the early impact of the then new law and concluded that fears about boards making token appointments were unfounded and though it is true she added that other studies find a correlation but not a causality between the two i always tell people to think of any team you ve been part of you ve seen the benefits of having diverse voices in the room companies and institutions are starting to see it too a few states inspired by california have enacted board diversity measures though they tend to focus on disclosure about board composition rather than quotas advertisement last year the securities and exchange commission approved nasdaq s new diversity rule requiring companies on the exchange to have at least two diverse board members e g female lgbtq or a person of color or explain why they don t the investment research firm msci analyzed u s companies between 2011 and 2016 and found that organizations that began the five year period with at least three women on their board did much better on such metrics as return on equity and earnings per share than companies that began the period with no female directors three female directors they concluded represented a tipping point think of it this way jackson suggested if you have one woman on a board the guys expect her to get coffee if you have two the women fight over who gets the coffee but if you have three women on a board they tell you to get your own damn coffee advertisement abcarianlat

inflation woes thank congress for its out of control spending and the federal reserve s system of printing money not backed by goods and services high inflation and the dollar s velocity of

opinion katherine hirschfeld guest columnist editor s note this is the second in a three part analysis on plans for turnpike expansion in parts of south oklahoma city and norman the next column will focus on proposed solutions in my previous column i proposed that the oklahoma turnpike authority was not acting in the interest of residents with its plans to expand the turnpike system across the state in some ways this is obvious drivers don t like paying tolls and rural residents don t like losing cherished family homes and farms to eminent domain but there is an additional downside to the access oklahoma plan that has not gotten as much attention the potential for the authority to shift the costs of its anticipated 5 billion in new debt to the public in the form of massive toll increases part i should hundreds of oklahoma families be forced from homes for sake of toll roads to better understand how this could happen we need to take a short trip to pennsylvania and go for a drive on the fabled pennsylvania turnpike how much does it cost to get to philadelphia from pittsburgh the answer may surprise you for an out of state driver the 300 mile round trip between pennsylvania s two largest cities brings 158 in toll charges a pickup pulling a trailer will pay about 227 and a class five commercial truck hauling heavy freight could shell out as much as 800 pennsylvania residents have complained about the high cost of driving on the state turnpike for years in 2021 a local merchant described yearly toll increases as bleeding people dry in 2018 a coalition of trucking industry groups and motorists sued arguing that the crushing expense of tolls was unfairly burdening interstate commerce the lawsuit failed but the complaints were valid the pennsylvania turnpike has the highest toll charges per mile in the united states and they are headed even higher tolls have increased between 5 and 6 annually since 2006 increases are projected to continue at a minimum of 3 per year until 2050 more oklahoma promised to make toll roads free after 75 years here s where that promise stands why is it so expensive to drive across pennsylvania there are three interrelated reasons 1 excessive debt 2 bad legislation 3 entrenched corruption the pennsylvania turnpike has one of the highest debt burdens of any turnpike system in the united states in 2019 the authority owed approximately 12 billion for its 550 miles of turnpikes and was described by one financial reporter as on the brink of collapse at that time the turnpike earned very good revenue about 1 498 per mile according to one study only 19 of those dollars slightly more than 1 went to support the turnpike the rest of the money was siphoned off for debt payments leaving the turnpike essentially bankrupt despite solid earnings where did all the debt come from this is where bad legislation and entrenched corruption come in in 2007 pennsylvania passed laws requiring the turnpike authority to contribute a percentage of its earnings to fund state transportation initiatives when the authority couldn t make the required payments the gap was filled by borrowing banks and bond brokers were eager to help fees for municipal bond offerings average around 1 of the total principal of the loan this does not sound like much until you do the math one percent of a 1 billion bond offering means 10 million in fees for banks and brokerage houses before any interest payments are even collected according to a number of historians and journalists much of the pennsylvania turnpike s borrowed money flowed into a vast informal economy of kickbacks graft and corruption political leaders of both parties in pennsylvania were reported to give high paying managerial jobs at the turnpike to unqualified friends and family members some of whom allegedly never showed up for work in 2014 state prosecutors claimed the turnpike operated on a pay to play scheme complete with bid rigging and kickbacks for lucrative construction contracts despite the near bankruptcy of the turnpike authority and the numerous corruption scandals pennsylvania s turnpike bonds have continued to receive positive investment grade ratings in 2021 an analyst for fitch explained this assessment came about in part because the pennsylvania legislature does not impose limits on toll rate increases this means that every increase in turnpike debt can be offset by a parallel increase in toll charges in other words the turnpike authority can shift the costs of its excessive borrowing on to unsuspecting motorists for years to come more despite lawsuits oklahoma turnpike authority moves ahead with norman area toll expansion now let s travel back to oklahoma and put this knowledge to use if the oklahoma turnpike authority s plan to add 5 billion in new debt to its existing 2 billion debt load is approved how much is it going to cost the average citizen to drive from oklahoma city to tulsa or joplin in 10 or 15 years so far the ota isn t saying but readers should recognize that oklahoma already has two of the three elements in place that led to pennsylvania s outrageous toll charges excessive bond debt at the ota and plenty of recent credible allegations of financial mismanagement and corruption in our state government for these reasons citizens should be extra wary of the ota s grand expansion plans and press their elected representatives to support an independent audit of the agency s finances before another bond deal can be approved otherwise the access oklahoma plan could very well take us all down the road to pennsylvania and in this economy that s a trip no one can afford to take note an astute reader pointed out an error in my previous column my statement that the interest and fees on ota s bonds goes to out of state banks was incorrect while wells fargo is the lender for ota s recently approved 200 million line of credit bank of oklahoma financial securities was one of the underwriters of the most recent 2020 bond issue i regret the error katherine hirschfeld is a professor of anthropology at the university of oklahoma
michigan is sitting on a 6 billion budget surplus and republicans who control the state legislature know just how they want spend it on their own re elections of course that s not how gop leaders describe their proposal to slash a variety of taxes including the state income tax in time for the november election in which all of michigan s 148 legislative seats will be up for grabs as framed by senate majority leader mike shirkey and house speaker jason wentworth the great gop tax giveaway is designed to return money to taxpayers whose assets have been eroded by inflation and a plunging stock market it sounds generous downright generous until you remember that the tax revenues republican lawmaker want to siphon off belong to all of us while the tax relief they propose would disproportionately benefit michiganders at the top end of the income scale so it s really just a reverse income redistribution scheme with the biggest prizes reserved for the state s most affluent residents not coincidentally those residents are also the most likely to live in republican leaning districts and own real estate assets whose value has leaped in a red hot housing market economists trace michigan s better than expected tax collections to two factors the impact of federal stimulus money distributed to families and businesses under the trump and biden administrations and a dramatic spending shift from tax exempt services to taxable consumer goods but uncle sam s largesse has dried up and consumers are likely to resume their pre pandemic spending habits assuming they continue spending at all as the stock market plunges and the housing market cools so it s foolish to assume that michigan s tax collections will continue to exceed expectations especially if legislators succeed in slashing the income tax rate besides providing a windfall for michigan s most comfortable households an income tax cut would jeopardize michigan s solvency in the not very distant future forcing the state to slash services when the budget surplus gop legislators are so eager to parcel out to constituents is a fond memory as eric bussis the state treasury department s chief economist warned legislators friday a resumption of pre pandemic spending patterns alone could reduce michigan s sales tax collections by 2 billion annually dereliction of duty cutting taxes isn t just fiscally irresponsible it s lazy at bottom it represents a cowardly evasion of the legislature s primary responsibility which is to invest tax dollars in a way that enhances our state s value for everyone michigan may have a temporary budget surplus but it also suffers from decades of disinvestment in its physical infrastructure educational resources and social safety net free press lansing bureau chief paul egan notes that the 15 3 billion in general fund revenues the senate fiscal agency expects the state to collect in fiscal 2024 represents only a 0 1 increase over 1968 collections after factoring in inflation and the 17 billion in school aid fund revenues anticipated for 2024 represents an inflation adjusted reduction of 3 2 since 1995 every michigander who drives a car sends a child to public school or relies on municipal water and sewer service knows firsthand the price of that chronic neglect it shows up in our auto repair bills our 41st in the nation high school graduation rate and emergencies that have left residents from benton harbor to flint dependent on bottled water and it has left michigan at a disadvantage in attracting new employers and retaining the young college educated residents those employers value even more than than low taxes confronting those deficits is hard work it requires legislators to study how other states have addressed similar challenges successfully and tailor those best practices to michigan s unique circumstances it means inventing and funding pilot projects some of which are bound to fail to discover which one will make our state smarter safer and more efficient how much easier it is to return the money voters have elected you to invest wisely ideally with a flourish of pomp and publicity as if you had just rescued the cash from a burning house asking only that constituents remember your generosity at election time a win win for republicans and here s the kicker the legislators championing this tax rebate don t actually care whether taxpayers actually get the money as long as you blame the other party if you don t that s why the 2 5 billion tax cut they sent to gov gretchen whitmer s desk is even more generous than the one whitmer vetoed just two months ago as shirkey and wentworth see it their kabuki theater is a win win if the democratic governor signs a tax cut bill republicans get the credit for initiating it if whitmer vetoes it her party reaps the blowback for withholding the cash republicans were ready to fling at their constituents whitmer who would have to deal with the revenue shortfall republican legislative leaders seem bent on precipitating if she s re elected to a second term has so far rejected their reckless tax cutting proposals she s countered with proposals to distribute part of the state s current bounty in the form of a 500 rebate to every working family an election year gambit that has the advantage of protecting the state from an enduring reduction in tax revenues but fiscal irresponsibility is contagious whitmer who campaigned on a promise to repeal the pension tax her predecessor championed as a way to pay for business tax cuts has already backed off her sensible demand that legislators find replacement revenue before jettisoning the levy on retirement income she s also said to be entertaining the prospect of a gas tax holiday many economists think would divert revenue from road maintenance to oil companies without spurring any significant reduction in consumer fuel prices whitmer favors some of the more narrowly targeted tax breaks included in the republican omnibus package including an increase in the earned income tax credit for low income wage earners and the pension tax repeal the question is how big an election year giveaway she ll indulge to get the republican votes she needs for her own priorities what voters ought to demand is that every candidate who proposes to cut taxes explain how michigan will catch up to what other states spend on roads schools and public transportation when tax collections return to pre pandemic levels or at what point we should simply give up trying brian dickerson is the

these passive income powerhouses with yields ranging between 5 5 and 12 can combat historically high inflation and make patient investors richer over time there s no question that this has been a challenging year for investors since hitting their respective all time closing highs during the first week of january both the dow jones industrial average and s p 500 have tumbled into correction territory i e fallen at least 10 things are even worse for the growth dependent nasdaq composite which shed nearly 30 of its value since hitting its record high in november this turbulence looks to be directly related to growing fears of a recession in the united states first quarter gross domestic product retraced by a surprising 1 4 and historically high inflation certainly appears to be adversely affecting lower income consumers as evidenced by walmart s and target s latest operating results dividend stocks can be your golden ticket to riches however when examined with a wider lens the latest corrections including the nasdaq bear market serve as an opportunity for patient investors to pounce eventually all notable declines in the market are completely wiped away by a bull market rally arguably one of the smartest ways to put your money to work during a recession is to buy dividend stocks companies that pay a dividend are often profitable on a recurring basis and are time tested in the sense that they ve navigated their way through recessions before what s more dividend stocks have a rich history of outperformance relative to their non dividend paying peers according to a report from j p morgan asset management a division of the nation s largest bank by assets jpmorgan chase dividend stocks averaged an annual return of 9 5 between 1972 and 2012 comparatively public companies that didn t offer a payout averaged a meager 1 6 annual return over the same time frame dividend stocks have the potential to mitigate near term downside combat historically high inflation and ultimately make patient investors richer over time what follows are three extremely safe high yield dividend stocks for investors to buy if the u s dips into recession at t 5 49 yield the first exceptionally safe high yield income stock to buy with recession fears mounting is telecom behemoth at t t 0 43 when adjusted for the company s warnermedia spinoff at t shares are actually higher for the year even though at t s high growth glory days are long gone the company does have a number of catalysts capable of generating modest organic growth and slowly but surely moving its share price higher for example at t s biggest catalyst is the 5g revolution for the next couple of years it ll be investing billions of dollars in upgrading its wireless infrastructure to handle 5g because it s been about a decade since consumers and businesses have been privy to a notable upgrade in wireless download speeds the expectation is that we ll witness a sustained device replacement cycle through the midpoint of the decade the key here is that data consumption should increase as 5g becomes more widely available and data happens to be where at t generates its juiciest margins from its wireless operations the other transformative move was the aforementioned spinoff of warnermedia which was subsequently merged with discovery to create a new media entity warner bros discovery the completion of this merger resulted in at t receiving 40 4 billion in cash it also allowed the company to reduce its base annual payout to 1 11 from a little north of 2 don t worry you ll still be netting a healthy 5 5 yield what s important is that the 40 4 billion in cash along with the capital saved from paying a lower annual dividend will help at t address some of the debt on its balance sheet having substantially more financial flexibility should allow at t which is valued at an incredibly low forecast price to earnings ratio of 8 in 2022 to outperform in a challenging environment agnc investment corp 12 03 yield another extremely safe high yield dividend stock to buy with recession fears growing is mortgage real estate investment trust reit agnc investment corp agnc 1 93 without getting overly technical mortgage reits like agnc aim to borrow money at low short term rates and use this capital to purchase higher yielding long term assets such as mortgage backed securities mbs that s why they re called mortgage reits the goal for these companies is to maximize their net interest margin which is the difference between the average yield on assets owned minus their average borrowing rate one of the best aspects of the mortgage reit industry is that it s highly transparent investors simply need to look at treasury yield curves and fed monetary policy to get an understanding of how mortgage reits are performing at the moment things are challenging for agnc a flattened yield curve and rising interest rates have weighed on its book value most mortgage reits tend to trade very close to their respective book values however rising interest rates should also help the company s mbss generate higher yields over time this means patient investors should experience net interest margin expansion sooner than later with agnc equally important is the fact that agnc almost exclusively purchases agency securities 66 9 billion of its 68 6 billion in investment assets are of the agency variety agency securities are protected by the federal government in the event of default this protection allows agnc to prudently use leverage to its advantage in order to boost its profitability if you still need more convincing consider this agnc has averaged a double digit yield in 12 of the past 13 years which means it can put historically high inflation in its place enterprise products partners 7 04 yield the third extremely safe high yield income stock to buy if the u s officially enters a recession is oil and gas company enterprise products partners epd 1 86 for some of you the idea of putting your money to work in anything having to do with oil or natural gas may not sit well after all it was just two years ago that covid 19 lockdowns led to a historic demand drawdown for crude oil this is the same drawdown that briefly pushed west texas intermediate oil futures to negative 40 a barrel but what if i told you that enterprise products partners wasn t impacted in the least by the volatility experienced during the pandemic enterprise products partners not so subtle secret is that it s a midstream operator it handles the transmission storage and in some instances the processing refining of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids the beauty of midstream operators is that the vast majority of them utilize volume based or fixed fee styled contracts this means they can accurately predict their operating cash flow for a given quarter or year this predictability proves critical since it allows enterprise products partners to set aside capital for new infrastructure projects and to make acquisitions without adversely impacting its profitability or quarterly distribution speaking of quarterly distribution at no point during the 2020 economic meltdown caused by the pandemic did the company s distribution coverage ratio dcr fall below 1 6 the dcr measures the amount of distributable cash flow generated in a year relative to what was actually paid to shareholders a figure below 1 would signify an unsustainable distribution schedule with crude oil and natural gas now hitting multidecade highs we re liable to see drilling and exploration activity pick up this should further solidify enterprise products partners payout which has grown in each of the past 23 years
amazon shares are down a lot on retail industry headwinds but the stock looks like a value now it has been a trying time for amazon com amzn 1 35 investors the stock is down 35 on the year and is down some 43 from its all time highs with rising interest rates to start the year high growth technology stocks sold off hard and last week poor retail earnings reports from walmart and target seemed to confirm investors worst fears over inflation s effect on retail sales since these are the two businesses amazon dominates it sold off hard but with the company repurchasing stock and a stock split on the horizon is now the time to buy when others are fearful current woes in the retail segment the hints of last week s retail destruction were actually forecast by amazon back in its april first quarter earnings report total sales growth decelerated to just 7 down from 44 a year ago despite accelerating cloud growth operating income actually declined from 8 7 billion a year ago to just 3 7 billion when stripping out operating profit from amazon web services aws amazon s north american and international retail operations actually tallied a combined 3 8 billion operating loss keep in mind that this includes things like advertising and prime subscriptions which may be high margin so the losses in its pure retail business were likely even worse as was confirmed by walmart and target amazon struggled as revenue growth decelerated amid the economic reopening meanwhile freight and logistics costs rose sharply due to rising fuel prices and since amazon had so aggressively expanded its capacity during the pandemic it found itself with more capacity and employees than it needed as e commerce revenue slowed as if this weren t bad enough management guided to even lower overall growth next quarter of 3 to 7 and for operating income to get worse somewhere in the range of a loss of 1 0 billion to a gain of 3 0 billion but aws is a bright spot if investors looked under the hood a bit they might have been a bit more enthusiastic around amazon web services the company s leading cloud computing platform enterprises generally save money and become more agile when they switch to the public cloud over building their own data centers so this shift should continue even if there is an economic slowdown last quarter aws revenue accelerated 37 from the 32 growth in the year ago quarter while aws operating income grew 53 as margins expanded the margin expansion was largely due to amazon extending the useful life of its server hardware but that should be a permanent change over the past 12 months aws by itself has generated nearly 21 billion in operating income up 43 for 2022 aws operating profit could be more than 25 billion putting net profit somewhat higher than 20 billion amazon s market cap right now is 1 1 trillion or about 55 times that figure even with interest rates higher today given aws s leading position and the long term growth prospects of the cloud that wouldn t be a crazy price to pay for aws alone and newer innovations could help customers deal with inflation with its inventive culture amazon also has a lot of projects going on besides its e commerce platform and cloud computing new initiatives such as just walk out technology and the project kuiper initiative for satellite delivered broadband could help just walk out which allows for a cashier less retail experience has the potential to materially lower costs at amazon fresh grocery stores and other third party retailers that adopt the platform lower costs could enable amazon fresh stores and other retailers to lower prices helping with inflation and labor shortages for consumers ditto for project kuiper which has the potential to deliver broadband to underserved communities at lower costs than traditional solutions since these projects don t generate material revenue yet they are largely overlooked by investors a historically low valuation meanwhile amazon stock is currently trading at a low valuation at least relative to its history on both enterprise value to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and price to sales metrics while amazon has traded at a lower price to sales ratio in the last 10 years that was before it broke out aws in its financial results starting in 2015 another indication that amazon may be undervalued is that management is actually repurchasing stock which the company does only rarely the last time it did so was in 2011 2012 during another swoon in the stock price that wound up being a good buying opportunity for long term investors it all adds up to a good looking buy today amazon will split its stock on june 3 which isn t very far from now while stock splits usually lead to increased interest from retail investors this is anything but a normal period should the u s economy dive into a deep recession it s possible amazon shares could go lower however barring that extreme scenario an awful lot of bad news appears priced in today while the near term is highly uncertain the cloud business alone could be a good buy meanwhile i d suspect the retail business will improve possibly as soon as prime day in the third quarter and the holiday shopping season furthermore new innovations like just walk out and project kuiper give investors new potential businesses to look forward to which aren t accounted for at all in the current price add in share repurchases and i suspect investors with a five or 10 year time horizon will feel pretty good about buying amazon shares at today s prices if you have the capital and a long time horizon there s no need to wait for the split
amazon com stuck with too much warehouse capacity now that the surge in pandemic era shopping has faded is looking to sublet at least 1 million square metres of space in the united states and could vacate even more by ending leases with landlords according to people familiar with the situation the excess capacity includes warehouses in new york new jersey southern california and atlanta said the people who requested anonymity because they re not authorised to speak about the deals the surfeit of space could far exceed 1 million sq m two of the people said with one saying it could be triple that another person close to the deliberations said a final estimate on the square footage to be vacated hasn t been reached and that the figure remains in flux an amazon fulfillment centre in baltimore us ap amazon could try to negotiate lease terminations with existing landlords including prologis an industrial real estate developer that counts the e commerce giant as its biggest tenant two of the people said in a sign that amazon is being careful not to cut too deeply should demand quickly rebound the 1 million sq m the company is looking to sublet is roughly equivalent to about 12 of its largest fulfillment centres or about 5 per cent of the area added during the pandemic
these reits are high value companies with strong growth prospects turning 200 000 into 1 million by 2030 would be quite the feat to make it simple let s call that 7 5 years that would mean pulling off a 24 return every single year it s close to impossible to do that with normal growth stocks much less real estate investment trusts reits which are traditionally structured to produce income not growth the three reits we ll discuss today innovative industrial properties iipr 1 61 americold realty trust cold 2 09 and vici properties vici 1 29 each have unique macro tailwinds that could launch their stock up significantly over the next 7 5 years 1 innovative industrial innovative industrial is a reit specializing in cannabis grow facilities cannabis growers have a notoriously hard time obtaining financing marijuana is still illegal at the federal level so banks won t work with cannabis companies to get around this issue innovative industrial specializes in sale leaseback transactions when a cannabis grower starts earning a ton of money it often puts that money into a building because no bank will hold the deposit once it needs the cash to expand it can sell the building to innovative industrial and lease it back the leases work out for both sides innovative gets a long term lockup and annual escalators with a strong business and a triple net agreement where the tenant is responsible for associated costs and the grower gets to use that cash and fix its lease cost cannabis is a booming business and innovative is the first mover in its niche that has led to incredible growth revenue of just 6 million in 2017 grew to 205 million in 2021 an operating loss of 110 000 in 2017 grew to an operating profit of 135 37 million in 2021 that growth came with marijuana still illegal at the federal level and in most states if politics are trending toward federally legal marijuana innovative industrial will likely be the go to financier for grow facilities what s more the stock has cratered this year down over 40 so far part of that drop is attributable to a short report that came out recently recommending investors short the stock because of its tenant concentration it is true that tenant concentration currently poses a risk for the company but that concentration a result of the current legal environment innovative operates in but in a world where marijuana is legal at the federal level concentration risk will pose a far greater threat to innovative 2 americold normally you wouldn t look at 120 year old businesses for growth stock ideas but americold could be the exception the industrial reit is one of the world s largest owners of temperature controlled warehouses it owns 249 warehouses with about 1 5 billion cubic feet of storage room worldwide it grew steadily for over 100 years and now e commerce is pushing that growth to a new level revenue is up 52 over the last three years the pandemic made grocery delivery more normal and now many businesses are looking for distribution centers and warehouses where they can store groceries to be more efficiently delivered to consumers americold operates not only the warehouses where food producers and farms ship food but also distribution centers and transportation equipment it also manages customer owned warehouses according to a recent management presentation americold has an 18 share in the north american temperature controlled warehousing market and 5 8 of the global market as those markets grow it has the expertise to be at the forefront of not only developing and purchasing new locations but also consulting with third parties to manage their facilities don t be surprised if it becomes an attractive acquisition candidate for one of the e commerce giants in a few years unlike innovative industrial americold has no customer concentration issues its largest tenant makes up 7 of revenues and its top 25 have leased from americold for an average of 35 years of those top 25 customers 96 use americold s technology integration and 92 use its value add services these are the services that should attract new customers as the market grows 3 vici properties vici properties is a hospitality reit that has triple net leases with gaming hotel and entertainment destinations it has 3 8 million casino square feet across 43 properties in 15 states the properties have about 58 000 hotel rooms and 63 000 gaming units the reit was formed in 2017 and has raised 12 billion in equity capital to invest 29 5 billion since then in las vegas alone it owns caesars palace las vegas harrah s las vegas and the venetian resort las vegas the reit has structured its leases well 97 of them have annual escalators based on the consumer price index cpi meaning rents go up if inflation is high like it is right now it also protects itself from inflation with 100 triple net leases the weighted average lease term is 43 2 years and 80 of its rent roll is on the s p 500 the next step for vici is closing its recent purchase of mgm growth properties it will then own the mgm grand and mandalay bay in las vegas as well vici has shown an affinity for strong growth and smart leasing as gaming grows in popularity and like marijuana potentially becomes legal in more places vici s properties and opportunities to purchase and develop even more will become increasingly more valuable no risk no reward each of these reits could post massive growth over the next seven years right now that is still potential energy savvy investors know that there is risk involved when betting that potential energy becomes kinetic trends could move in different directions than we expect marijuana could become even more federally illegal consumers could go back to shopping at grocery stores in person and hospitality rental rates could drop but investors who want to turn 200 000 into 1 000 000 can only do it by investing in potential
recent volatility helps highlight that a mix of holdings is a smart approach it s always smart to build diversification into a long term portfolio markets and sectors go in and out of favor and it helps to have some of your investments working at all times that s even more important when building a portfolio within a specific sector many see electric vehicles as the future of transportation and it makes sense to have a hand in it as the sector blossoms that of course is what pushed these stocks to unsustainable valuations in the excitement brought by the potential profits now stock prices have significantly retreated from previous highs offering a better opportunity to begin to build a diverse mix of ev holdings here are two that would be a good place to start tesla the valuation discussion tesla tsla 5 59 is the undisputed ev leader and trailblazer for the entire sector but it took years for the business to mature the stock rose ahead of the company s execution however keeping many people from owning it from a valuation perspective there was always the chance of failure and even ceo elon musk said that his company was within about a month of bankruptcy when it was ramping up its model 3 mass production in 2017 but tesla plowed ahead and sales have soared over the past several years with the company itself projecting production can increase by around 50 annually for several more years that revenue is also going to continue to soar tesla s new manufacturing plants ramping up in austin texas and near berlin should help the company achieve that growth rate if the company achieves 50 growth in revenue this year at recent prices the stock would be trading at a price to sales ratio of below 10 that s not cheap but a long term investor isn t holding for just one year looking further out a 50 growth rate would quickly bring that valuation metric to a more reasonable level and while the price to earnings p e ratio is still extremely high based on 2021 net income of 5 5 billion that too should drop as the business grows that highlights one of the main risks for tesla as an investment too however based on 2021 net earnings tesla s p e stands at more than 130 so the share price has already built in some of the company s ongoing growth that s another reason investors need to frame any investment here for the long term nio expanding its reach tesla s new plant in europe shows the company sees that as a target market but its first facility outside the u s was built in shanghai there was good reason for that too china is the largest automotive market in the world and the government has been supportive of the ev industry nio nio 5 35 is one of the leading growing ev companies in china it recently surpassed its 200 000th vehicle delivery and has entered the european market nio isn t yet profitable which gives it a higher risk profile than tesla especially given potential political risks unique to chinese investments but its established presence in china along with a move into europe gives it a foothold in what should be the largest ev markets going forward in its 2021 global ev outlook the international energy agency predicted that china and europe will still be the dominant global ev markets in 2030 making up 65 of ev sales nio is expanding its product line along with its geographic reach it recently began deliveries of its first sedan model beyond the luxury et7 the et5 mid size sedan will launch later this year a mass market sub brand has also been discussed by nio s ceo and recent reports say that plan is getting closer to reality while both tesla and nio are high risk investments that s part of investing early in a fast growing sector that s also why it s smart to own a more diverse mix of stocks in that sector one can help mitigate that risk by making incremental investments as the companies successfully execute growth tesla and nio are two stocks that make a good starting point for adding ev investments to a portfolio built for the long haul

the struggling e commerce company still has a lot to prove contextlogic wish 3 00 the parent company of the e commerce marketplace wish has burned a lot of investors since its ipo in december 2020 wish priced its ipo at 24 but it started trading at just 22 75 the stock subsequently soared to an all time high of 31 19 last february during the meme stock rally but it now trades at less than 2 a share wish initially dazzled investors with its rapid revenue growth rates but it lost its momentum shortly after its public debut investors also dumped e commerce stocks as the pandemic induced lockdowns ended and rising interest rates sparked a sell off in speculative and unprofitable companies those headwinds turned wish into a penny stock but it still looks fundamentally cheap at just over one time this year s sales could wish stage a massive comeback from these depressed levels or is it far too late to bet on a turnaround what happened to wish wish is an american e commerce platform that sources most of its products from chinese merchants this cross border approach enables it to sell products at lower prices than many domestic retailers at the time of its ipo wish served more than 100 million monthly active users maus but over the past year it lost its maus and last 12 month ltm active buyers at an alarming rate metric q1 2021 q2 2021 q3 2021 q4 2021 q1 2022 maus millions 101 90 60 44 27 ltm active buyers millions 61 52 46 38 28 wish lost those shoppers as it grappled with ongoing quality control and shipping issues which could be largely attributed to its overwhelming dependence on chinese merchants it was also repeatedly accused of selling dangerous counterfeit and illegal products and those accusations led to its removal from france s app stores and search engines last year as wish s base of active shoppers shrank it reduced its marketing expenses to stabilize its losses however that strategy also reduced the visibility of its brand and narrowed its moat against amazon s third party sellers in china and alibaba s aliexpress which facilitates similar cross border sales can wish s new ceo save the company the deterioration of wish s core business led to the departure of its founder and ceo piotr szulczewski earlier this year his successor foot locker s former executive vijay talwar has been focusing on narrowing wish s losses to rightsize its business and improve its free cash flow but at the same time wish is trying to set aside more cash to provide subsidies for its higher quality merchants expand its logistics capabilities and integrate more video capabilities like wish clips into its marketplace that balancing act is very difficult because wish s revenue hasn t stopped sliding on a sequential basis yet it s been narrowing its net and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda losses sequentially over the past year but its net and adjusted ebitda margins continue to decline as its revenue plummets metric q1 2021 q2 2021 q3 2021 q4 2021 q1 2022 revenue in millions 772 656 368 289 189 net income in millions 128 111 64 58 60 net margin 17 17 17 20 32 adjusted ebitda in millions 79 67 30 23 40 adjusted ebitda margin 10 10 8 8 21 in the second quarter wish expects its adjusted ebitda loss to widen sequentially to 90 million 100 million as it gradually ramps up its ad spending again and sells its products at even lower prices it didn t offer any top line guidance but it said its revenue in april the first month of the second quarter had declined about 30 compared to january which puts it on track for another sequential decline in the second quarter can wish survive this transformation wish s free cash flow came in at negative 148 million in the first quarter compared to negative 354 million a year earlier and it still had 1 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that s barely lower than its current market cap of 1 1 billion wish s low debt to equity ratio of 0 5 also gives it some breathing room to take on additional debt but it could struggle to secure attractive interest rates in this difficult market wish s management is making the right moves but it can t fix the business until it stabilizes its sequential growth in maus and revenue accomplishing that goal will be very difficult especially since larger e commerce leaders like amazon and alibaba are already struggling as supply chain and inflationary headwinds rattle their e commerce businesses wish won t go bankrupt anytime soon and its depressed valuations should limit its downside potential however i wouldn t touch this stock until it shows some signs of life especially when shares of better run e commerce companies are still on sale
by nicole goodkind cnn business to badly misquote john lennon everybody s talking about inflation stagflation capitulation globalization stagnation this ation that ation ation ation ation all we are saying is please make it end americans view inflation which is near 40 year highs as the top problem facing the country today by a very wide margin no other concern comes close members of the federal reserve the central bank tasked with deflating inflation from 8 3 to its goal of around 2 are now raising interest rates in an attempt to cool the economy a policy induced economic slowdown is a painful endeavor markets briefly crashed into bear territory friday and many analysts believe a recession is unavoidable that s okay medicine doesn t have to go down easy if it works fast and it works well but inflation rates have been increasing sharply since august 2021 and have been out of the normal 2 to 4 range for a full year now a growing distrust in the fed s capabilities and a belief that they ve become entangled in a policy error has raised the question what happens if the fed can t get inflation under control and we re stuck in a long term cycle of elevated inflation and recession why it matters record high inflation has created a multi layered crisis at its core it represents a political crisis for the democrats defending their very tight majority in congress and a crisis of faith for economists who misjudged the persistence and significance of rising prices as a transitory blip and may have missed their chance to get ahead of the curve most importantly it s a crisis for the american wallet the average price for a gallon of gas has surpassed 4 in all 50 states for the first time ever food prices were 9 4 higher in april 2022 than in april 2021 the largest annual increase in 41 years americans have seemingly shifted into survival mode target and walmart reported last week that discretionary spending is easing as customers struggle to cover basics like food fuel and shelter this is different the federal reserve is likely borrowing ideas from its 1994 playbook the last time the central bank successfully raised interest rates and executed a soft landing but things are different now we re dealing with a serious labor shortage caused by baby boomers ready to exit the workforce a significant pandemic reduced labor participation rate and a productivity slowdown globalization is in retreat as the pandemic and war in ukraine have led to significant energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions these are uncharted waters for all of us said liz young head of investment strategy at sofi inflation hasn t been this high since the year i was born the economy will recover she said but it s going to be a slow burn markets will continue to tumble and prices will remain elevated for a while she added i think we might have to stay there for a little while i don t know that we re going to bounce back out of it very quickly trust in the central bank is also lagging investors are calling for a three quarter point rate hike at the conclusion of the fed s june meeting despite fed chair jerome powell s assurances that an increase that high isn t on the table even former fed chair ben bernanke said the central bank had erred in its approach to addressing 40 year high inflation part of the lack of confidence stems from the increase in broad and fast social media and communications outlets and has nothing to do with what s going on at the central bank said howard silverblatt senior index analyst at s p dow jones indices a continuous real time feed of news and analysts makes it easier to judge the fed s actions and not their outcomes you know them so much better now said silverblatt you see all of the nooks and crannies timing is everything inflation rates don t always come down just look at the 1970s when the us economy suffered three recessions during which the underlying inflation problem never went away stagflation is probably the worst word of vocabulary for financial markets because it s the worst of both worlds inflation stays high and the economy slows said leo grohowski chief investment officer at bny mellon wealth management i think we re getting a whiff of stagflation now but the ghost of the 1970s lingers on in all fed governors minds and they ve said they ll ratchet up their hawkishness no matter what it means for markets and the economy the process of getting inflation down to 2 will also include some pain but ultimately the most painful thing would be if we were to fail to deal with it and inflation were to get entrenched in the economy at high levels and we know what that s like powell said in a recent marketplace interview grohowski says he sees inflation sticking for the remainder of this year and some of next but that it is not yet entrenched in the economy and will come down by 2023 still sentiment is not the same for investors and consumers among economists and analysts said grohowski there s the expectation that there will be some relief and that we re most likely right now living through peak inflation but consumers are worried that today s inflation rates are going to continue for longer they may not be wrong while prices for certain goods will fall quickly energy and housing prices will likely remain high for some time according to the fed we don t think inflation is entrenched said grohowski but we admit that there is concern because parts of inflation are stickier than most economists and even the fed expected davos is back and the world has changed the world economic forum which famously combines high minded panels with flashy parties is back in person in davos switzerland for the first time in two years the conference aims to bring important people together to tackle pressing issues like inequality climate change the future of technology and geopolitical conflict but the logic behind inviting some of the wealthiest people on earth to solve these problems from a resort town looks even shakier these days billionaires added 5 trillion to their fortunes during the pandemic according to a report from oxfam published in january the world s richest 10 men saw their collective wealth more than double meanwhile tens of millions more people around the world were pushed into extreme poverty the event takes place against the backdrop of the worst cost of living crisis in decades in both developed and many developing economies soaring food and fuel prices are already causing hunger and hardship fanning instability triggering protests and

the uk health security agency ukhsa said new figures would be released on monday after it registered 20 cases on friday asked if community transmission was now the norm in britain ukhsa chief medical adviser susan hopkins said absolutely also read britain offers smallpox vaccine as monkeypox cases spread in europe britain is seeing daily infections of the rare monkeypox virus that are unconnected to any travel to west africa where the disease is endemic a health official said on sunday the uk health security agency ukhsa said new figures would be released on monday after it registered 20 cases on friday asked if community transmission was now the norm in britain ukhsa chief medical adviser susan hopkins said absolutely we are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west africa which is what we ve seen previously in this country she told bbc television we are detecting more cases on a daily basis hopkins declined to confirm reports that one individual was in intensive care but said the outbreak was concentrated in urban areas among gay or bisexual men the risk of the general population remains extremely low at the moment and i think people need to be alert to it she said adding that for most adults symptoms would be relatively mild the first uk case was announced on may 7 in a patient who had recently travelled to nigeria the disease is also spreading in europe and north america monkeypox can be transmitted through contact with skin lesions and droplets of a contaminated person as well as shared items such as bedding and towels symptoms include fever muscle aches swollen lymph nodes chills exhaustion and a chickenpox like rash on the hands and face they usually clear up after two to four weeks there is no specific treatment but vaccination against smallpox has been found to be about 85 percent effective in preventing monkeypox education secretary nadhim zahawi said the uk government had already started buying up stocks of smallpox vaccine we re taking it very very seriously he told the bbc
these hedge fund managers were buying stocks even as the market was falling the nasdaq composite fell 9 in the first quarter as many investors weighed concerns about the strength of the economy even so a wave of form 13 fs recently filed with the u s securities and exchange commission suggests that some asset managers remain bullish on growth stocks in the first quarter billionaire chase coleman of tiger global management added over a million shares of crowdstrike holdings crwd 3 09 to his hedge fund making it the third largest position in the portfolio likewise billionaire james simons of renaissance technologies doubled down on tesla tsla 5 59 and the stock now ranks as the second largest holding in his hedge fund clearly these professional money managers see something they like in both companies but let s take a closer look before you add them to your own portfolio here s what you should know 1 crowdstrike holdings crowdstrike is the gold standard in endpoint and cloud workload security its cloud native architecture is the foundation of that success as it allows the company to crowdsource tremendous amounts of data from the devices on its network in fact its falcon platform captures trillions of security signals each week and it leans on artificial intelligence ai to surface insights and prevent cyberattacks that forms a powerful network effect each new data point makes crowdstrike s ai models a little better at identifying malicious activity meaning each new customer creates incremental value for all existing customers and vice versa to add crowdstrike has further differentiated itself with a broad suite of software beyond endpoint and cloud workload security including solutions for identity protection threat intelligence and managed services financially crowdstrike is firing on all cylinders its customer base jumped 65 to 16 325 in the past year and the average customer spent 24 more evidencing the successful execution of its land and expand growth strategy in turn revenue climbed 66 to 1 4 billion and free cash flow jumped 51 to 442 million looking ahead crowdstrike is well positioned to maintain that momentum the company puts its market opportunity at 67 billion by 2024 and its capacity for innovation should keep it on the cutting edge of cybersecurity for example crowdstrike recently debuted the industry s first fully managed identity threat protection service that means organizations that lack the time or talent to handle their own security can outsource it to crowdstrike and adding identity protection to that service is especially significant because 80 of cyberattacks start with compromised credentials in summary crowdstrike has a strong presence in a critical industry and its market opportunity should only get bigger as digital transformation creates more attack surfaces for hackers with that in mind coleman s decision to add shares to his hedge fund makes a lot of sense more importantly with the stock price down 50 from its high now is a great time to buy a few shares for your own portfolio 2 tesla in the first quarter tesla once again ranked as the leading electric vehicle ev brand capturing a 15 5 market share the company also continued to take share in total car sales across its three core geographies china europe and the u s but the real story was tesla s operating margin in the first quarter revenue rose 81 to 18 8 billion but gaap earnings surged 633 to 2 68 per diluted share what drove that accelerated growth on the bottom line tesla posted an industry leading operating margin of 19 2 fueled by increased production pricing power and initiatives like single piece casting that figure is likely to drop in the near term as production scales at the new factories in berlin and texas but that uptick in capacity should make tesla even more efficient in the long run even more exciting ceo elon musk announced plans for an ev robotaxi the company aims to reach volume production by 2024 which puts tesla one step closer to realizing its goal of launching an autonomous ride hailing platform on that note musk believes the company s full self driving software will be safer than a human driver by the end of the year paving the way for software to become the most important source of profitability for tesla s car business asset manager ark invest has a similar outlook in a recent report the firm says autonomous ride hailing platforms could generate 2 trillion in profits by 2030 while boosting global economic output by 26 trillion on that note tesla has more real world driving data than any rival which arguably makes it a frontrunner in the race to build a fully autonomous car if you think self driving cars sound like science fiction what about intelligent machines musk believes tesla s autonomous humanoid robot known as optimus will ultimately be worth more than the car business the company could have a prototype as early as this year and full scale production could start next year the biggest argument against tesla is valuation it s currently worth more than the next seven automakers combined and the stock trades for 12 8 times sales but if tesla executes on its vision of robotaxis and autonomous robots that multiple may look cheap in hindsight renaissance technologies clearly believes in the company but should you add the stock to your own portfolio that depends on your risk tolerance if you can handle volatility and you believe in tesla s vision i think it s worth buying a few shares for what it s worth i own the stock and i have no plans to sell

consider shopify shop 2 04 roku roku 1 60 and sofi technologies sofi 2 87 shopify making commerce better for everyone brian withers shopify the average consumer hasn t heard of shopify but its platform enabled 597 million shoppers to buy 175 billion in goods online in 2021 millions of merchants large and small use its software and services to manage all aspects of their online business from running websites to warehousing their products and shipping to end customers the stock has sold off more than 75 since mid november but i think the market is underestimating the long term potential of this gem let s take a look at some recent results metrics q1 2020 q1 2021 q1 2022 gross merchandise value gmv 17 4 billion 37 3 billion 43 2 billion change yoy 46 114 57 revenue 470 million 987 million 1 2 billion change yoy 47 110 22 the table above gives investors a good picture of what happened to the company s growth during the pandemic the first quarter of 2020 was the beginning of the pandemic before the company saw an incredible boost in sales as people were cooped up at home as in store retailers are once again open it s not surprising growth has slowed but comparing the revenue and gross merchandise value over the two year period it s astounding revenue from the most recent quarter is 2 6 times the value from q1 2020 and gmv is up 2 5 times but somewhat unbelievably the stock is down over 50 during that period bears would say the company is spending more and the operating income in its most recent quarter turned negative with growth slowing the market is looking for companies to turn profits but since the beginning leadership hasn t been focused on the short term in his 2015 letter to shareholders co founder and ceo tobi lütke said shopify has been about empowering merchants since it was founded and we have always prioritized long term value over short term revenue opportunities we don t see this changing this idea still holds true today as the company is making significant investments in simplifying fulfillment for its merchants the shopify fulfillment network gives entrepreneurs and small businesses access to state of the art fulfillment capabilities including a fleet of robots by way of its purchase of 6 river systems in 2019 recently it s taken another step to simplify fulfillment by announcing a 2 1 billion acquisition of deliverr which will provide merchants with end to end logistics services these investments will drive additional expenses in the short term but create incredible value for customers over the long term i ve been a shareholder for more than five years and this e commerce platform is one of a small handful of my never sell stocks even though the bears may be scared off with additional spending the balance sheet is still incredibly strong boosted by 7 25 billion in cash and cash equivalents it can afford to run a negative operating margin for years as it bolsters its platform for customers with the stock down considerably it s a great opportunity for patient investors to add some shares of this e commerce specialist on a mission to make commerce better for everyone think you know roku think again danny vena roku streaming video has gotten a bad rap lately giving investors a big dose of uncertainty content spending has gone through the roof and competition has ratcheted up to levels few could have imagined just a few years ago as a result any company associated with streaming is being viewed as suspect that suspicion has resulted in a compelling opportunity for roku investors while the streaming pioneer has dabbled in originals the amount of programming has been small by hollywood standards so roku isn t at risk of getting caught up in the spiraling content budgets that plague many streaming video providers additionally roku makes the bulk of its revenue from the digital advertising shown on its platform marketers have been loath to pass it by as the company boasts more than 61 million active accounts on the other hand roku offers more than 10 000 streaming channels with popular and niche content for virtually any viewer this results in a sticky and growing ecosystem that has staying power some investors mistakenly believe that roku is beholden to the set top boxes it has long sold at or near cost but its namesake devices only represent a small part of the equation the company developed an operating system the roku os that it licenses to a large and growing number of international connected television companies this results in a rare win win because the smart tv manufacturers don t have to reinvent the wheel and roku s account base grows there s also the popular misconception that roku will suffer when subscribers abandon paid streaming services in favor of cheaper ad supported options however the shift actually benefits roku as it will boost the company s advertising revenue additionally with industry leaders including netflix and walt disney s disney reportedly adding lower cost tiers supported by advertising roku is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend by increasing the marketing spend on its platform last year roku s total revenue grew 33 year over year but its platform revenue which includes advertising grew 49 it s worth noting that there was some slowing in its active account growth and streaming hours the result of tough comps and supply chain issues those issues are almost certainly fleeting and will abate over time though they persisted into early 2022 cord cutting has accelerated in recent years and shows no signs of slowing these former cable viewers aren t forgoing in home entertainment entirely they re just getting it from a different source most of it from streaming video advantage roku bargain hunting investors will also relish in roku s stock price which has been dragged down roughly 80 in recent months by the plunging market its valuation which currently trades at less than three times forward sales is a bargain not seen since late 2017 given the large and growing opportunity and its industry leading and channel agnostic platform roku stands to profit from these trends for years to come sofi a rare combination of fintech and traditional banking under one umbrella will healy sofi technologies sofi s stock history makes it easy to dismiss it went public when a special purpose acquisition company spac bought it many spacs have performed poorly soon after launching and sofi is no exception it has lost more than half of its value since its debut on june 1 after its merger with social capital hedosophia holdings v took it public however investors who think that poor start is a harbinger of a challenging future may want to look again the company continues to build competitive advantages as it offers multiple lending banking brokerage and financial planning services sofi added one of these advantages when it acquired galileo financial technologies through this purchase sofi took over the galileo platform a fintech driven ecosystem that handles fund flows with speed security and precision it also expanded its offerings earlier this year by purchasing golden pacific bank that move gave this company a bank charter although block combines fintech and traditional banking for business customers sofi is one of the few to offer this combination of banking and fintech capabilities to individuals still even with these attributes it faces significant challenges sofi began as a student lender and this loan category has suffered amid moratoriums on student loan repayment moreover it inflicted damage upon itself at least temporarily with the leak of its q1 earnings report this caused shares to drop 18 before the market halted trading for three hours following the may 10 report nonetheless these concerns did not stop total members from rising 70 year over year to 3 9 million nor did it prevent sofi from posting a record adjusted net revenue of 322 million in q1 a 49 increase year over year though it reported a comprehensive loss of 115 million for the quarter it improved from the 178 million loss in the first quarter of 2021 additionally even with the massive loss in the stock it has risen by approximately 50 since reaching its post earnings low also at a price to sales ratio of just over 4 its sales multiple has fallen by half since last fall this lower valuation amid massive customer growth and an expanding ecosystem has arguably made sofi one of the top growth stocks to buy
bitcoin vs gold how do both assets compare as a store of value right now the bitcoin community insists that the crypto asset is a digital version of gold just like the yellow metal it can be used as a safe haven for wealth several wealthy investors institutions celebrities and corporations have added bitcoin to their reserves but how does this innovative new digital asset compare to the world s oldest and most popular store of value here s a closer look sign up for our moneywise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from wall street s top firms track record gold obviously has a longer track record than its digital rival while bitcoin was created 13 years ago gold predates human civilization the earliest record of gold being used for decoration dates back to 4000 bc there s a chance it was used for other purposes perhaps barter even prior to that over those four millennia gold has played a pivotal role in global politics and economics in fact most global currencies were pegged to the value of gold until 1971 put simply gold has had much more time to prove its status as a store of value but just because bitcoin is new doesn t mean it s less secure the underlying blockchain has never been hacked and the asset has certainly helped create more wealth than gold over the past 13 years convenience while gold has a wide head start bitcoin is arguably more convenient to invest in unlike physical gold bitcoin can be stored online or on a software wallet it can be moved across the world in a matter of minutes for minimal costs currently the average bitcoin transaction costs about 1 50 and is likely to be completed in about 10 minutes by comparison physical gold needs to be stored securely physically moved and protected around the clock making it less convenient for the digital age volatility although bitcoin is easier to store and transact with it s also much more volatile than gold according to portfolio optimization bitcoin s standard deviation a measure of how much it can move beyond its average price in either direction is 4 34 compare that to gold s standard deviation of just above one if you re looking for a more stable asset gold is clearly the better choice correlation correlation is a key factor when measuring the riskiness of a particular asset if the price of a given asset moves independently from the economy or other traditional investments adding that asset can significantly lower the risk of your overall portfolio correlation coefficients range from 1 0 a perfect negative correlation to 1 0 a perfect positive correlation 0 shows no correlation at all bitcoin s correlation to u s stocks has reached as high as 0 66 so it s not the best way to lower the risk profile of a traditional portfolio the gold stock relationship changes over time depending on different economic conditions but in times of extreme stock market volatility gold prices have a low or even negative correlation with the s p 500 central bank reserve assets gold is used as a reserve asset by central banks across the world a key factor that makes it stand apart from bitcoin nations hold gold reserves as a safe haven with countries like france the united states and germany each holding close to 80 of their total reserves in gold this use as a reserve asset puts a theoretical floor on the value of gold bitcoin is just beginning to gain acceptance from governments worldwide el salvador made bitcoin legal tender last year and several other nations like brazil and mexico are considering the same some governments are also thinking about the digital asset as a way to circumvent sanctions russia for instance is considering accepting bitcoin as payment for its oil and gas exports distribution gold is naturally distributed across the world australia has the largest proven reserve of gold at 20 of global capacity meanwhile gold that has already been mined is widely distributed among jewelry buyers corporate buyers and central banks until recently the majority of bitcoin mining was done within china but ever since china s crackdown on crypto mining the percentage of computer energy used in the process the so called hashrate is more widely distributed across the world in fact no country currently accounts for more than 35 of mining capacity bitcoin that has already been mined is similarly well distributed the largest bitcoin holding belongs to the network s anonymous founder satoshi nakamoto nakamoto holds 1 million bitcoin which is about 4 7 of total supply public companies hold roughly 1 culture in some parts of the world storing wealth in gold is deeply ingrained in local culture for example it s an essential part of rituals and marriages in india which is why indian households are sitting on a 1 5 trillion hoard of gold bitcoin is rapidly gaining cultural credibility too according to several surveys roughly half of north american millennials said they would put a portion of their savings in bitcoin crypto s role in internet culture and meme investing is making it a bigger force in the global economy whether this cultural revolution displaces gold remains to be seen bottom line gold is certainly more stable and time tested than bitcoin however bitcoin s drawbacks are quickly being resolved and younger investors are adopting it in greater numbers over time the world s most popular

at the end of may 2003 america was on the verge of one of its longest running most expensive wars in iraq yet iraq war boosters were feeling vindicated by the swift march on baghdad which had fallen within weeks and the swift collapse of the regime new york times columnist thomas friedman a fan of the iraq war appeared on charlie rose to crow about this rousing success on may 29 2003 the brief clip below from that interview the full interview can be found here is a fascinating glimpse into the id of washington insiders like friedman before the invasion in march of that year and for the first few months at least of what was to prove a long occupation he appears to still think it was the right choice he wrote last june in a column on syria that you can t go from saddam to switzerland without getting stuck in hobbes a war of all against all unless you have a well armed external midwife whom everyone on the ground both fears and trusts to manage the transition in iraq that was america and the only reason iraq has any chance for a decent outcome today is because america was on the ground with tens of thousands of troops to act as that well armed midwife reasonably trusted and certainly feared by all sides to manage iraq s transition to more consensual politics i don t ever remember a time in my five years in iraq where the us was generally seen as a trusted midwife by a majority or even a large minority of people whether or not iraq might have a found a better less bloody way out from the shadow of saddam hussein without an invasion and occupation is now something forever unknowable i just made the below transcript from the above clip i ve omitted most uhms and the like and may have made one or two errors since the audio is a bit compromised rose now that the war is over and there s some difficulty with the peace was it worth doing friedman i think it was unquestionably worth doing charlie and i think that looking back that i now certainly feel i understand what the war was about and it s interesting to talk about it here in silicon valley because i think looking back at the 1990s i can identify there are actually three bubbles of the 1990s there was the nasdaq bubble there was the corporate governance bubble and lastly there was what i would call the terrorism bubble and the first two were based on creative accounting and the last two were based on moral creative accounting the terrorism bubble that built up over the 1990s said flying airplanes into the world trade center that s ok wrapping yourself with dynamite and blowing up israelis in the pizza parlour that s ok because we re weak and they re strong and the weak have a different morality having your preachers say that s ok that s ok having your charities raise money for people who do these kinds of things that s ok and having your press call people who do these kind of things martyrs that s ok and that build up as a bubble charlie and 9 11 to me was the peak of that bubble and what we learned on 9 11 in a gut way was that bubble was a fundamental threat to our society because there is no wall high enough no ins agent smart enough no metal detector efficient enough to protect an open society from people motivated by that bubble and what we needed to do was to go over to that part of the world and burst that bubble we needed to go over there basically uhm and uh uhm take out a very big stick right in the heart of that world and burst that bubble and there was only one way to do it because part of that bubble said we ve got you this bubble is actually going to level the balance of power between us and you because we don t care about life we re ready to sacrifice and all you care about is your stock options and your hummers and what they needed to see was american boys and girls going house to house from basra to baghdad uhm and basically saying which part of this sentence don t you understand you don t think we care about our open society you think this bubble fantasy we re going to just let it go well suck on this ok that charlie was what this war was about we could have hit saudi arabia it was part of that bubble we could have hit pakistan we hit iraq because we could and that s the real truth what s maybe most interesting about this bizarre set of views was that they were so commonplace back then al qaeda has hit the united states so we must hit back at them not just at al qaeda or the people who might have directly assisted them but a much bigger them a whole civilization who had started to loom in the sight of people like thomas friedman as an existential threat to america saddam hussein had nothing to do with 9 11 the iraqi people had had nothing to do with 9 11 were there people there who were delighted to see the us get a bloody nose from osama bin laden yes the previous decade had seen a us backed sanctions effort targeting saddam hussein that crippled the country never mind that saddam brought that upon his people with the invasion of kuwait average people were the ones who suffered the most in 1999 unicef estimated that the mortality rate for children under the age of five had doubled in central and southern iraq since sanctions were imposed from 56 dead children per 1 000 between 1984 1989 to 131 per 1 000 between 1994 1999 i don t begrudge them their anger not least because they weren t doing anything to harm people here in the us i never understood the terror that seemed to grip so many americans after 9 11 perhaps because by that point i d covered small wars and grasping poverty we haven t seen the likes of in the us for generations across southeast asia a few years prior i covered the independence of east timor the murder of monitor stringer sander thoenes there was what led me to getting picked up by the paper and he was just one of over 100 000 excess deaths in the tiny country during indonesia s 24 year occupation for comparison that was one in seven people in east timor one in seven americans dying as the result of war and occupation would be 44 million people i had schoolmates who died in the towers one dear friend who departed from the heights of tower two just minutes before it would have been too late and who struggled with survivor s guilt about the colleagues who stayed at their desks for years after most reckoned the plane that had crashed into the first tower was an accident not a terrorist attack it effected me as it effected almost all americans but it didn t seem that hard to keep some perspective and having lived in muslim majority indonesia since 1993 and spending the years after 9 11 covering al qaeda and aligned militant groups in the region i d learned enough to know that a war that could be painted as against muslims in general would suit al qaeda right down to the ground such a reaction is what they wanted since they reckoned that would yield them a bonanza of new recruits mr friedman has gone from strength to strength in the years since with handsome speakers fees for him to explain his theories about how the world is changing and evolving but that brief clip above shows a man whose analysis is easily swayed by emotion by sentiment what they needed to see was american boys and girls going house to house from basra to baghdad and basically saying which part of this sentence don t you understand you don t think we care about our open society you think this bubble fantasy we re going to just let it go well suck on this is not the sort of comment that comes from dispassionate reasoned analysis it comes from fear we learned in a gut way that bubble was a fundamental threat to our society that s not really learning as horrible as that attack on us was there was no fundamental threat to our society we have done a good job in the years since increasing security to the point that in some views we have actually threatened our own open society ourselves and preventing any further major attacks on our soil did the invasion of iraq and taking out a very big stick accomplish that no finally even the notion of a terrorism bubble in the 1990s was a bit of a myth the decade that the 9 11 attacks began so horrifically was among the safest ones when terrorism in the skies is considered ever since supplanted by the last decade there were 469 fatalities for passengers crews and passengers for commercial fliers in the 2000s 256 of those on 9 11 in the 1990s there were just under 400 fatalities in the 1980s there were about 1 400 and in the 1970s there were just over 800 killed when total number of commercial flights are included to make apples to apples comparisons the most dangerous decade was the 1930s with 616 fatalities per billion passenger flights the 2000s had 22 per billion flights taken get stories that empower and uplift daily by signing up you agree to our privacy policy already a subscriber log in to hide ads if there has been a terrorism bubble it appeared to have burst around 1991 judging by this graph at the global terrorism database maintained at the university of maryland with funding from the department of homeland security terrorism though surged again after 2003 largely with a rise in terrorist incidents in afghanistan and iraq associated with the wars being fought in those lands at this time of looking back let s try to remember the track records and quality of argument presented by people whose views and advice are sought before the wars of our future
