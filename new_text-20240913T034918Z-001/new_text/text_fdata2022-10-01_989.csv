everyone from political pundits to people on the street have issued forth on the new uk government s tax cut laden growth plan recently but it was a rare public rebuke from the international monetary fund imf that really impacted financial markets days after the government made its mini budget announcement the imf warned that large and untargeted fiscal packages could work at cross purposes to monetary policy referring to current efforts by central banks around the world to fight rampant inflation it also suggested the government should reevaluate its tax measures and provide more targeted energy crisis support at its next budget currently scheduled for november 23 investors responded by beating an even hastier exit from government bond markets and sending the pound plummeting within hours of the imf statement the bank of england had announced a plan to try to calm the markets the imf s decision to comment on uk tax policy was significant and clearly had an impact on traders and investors and while the uninitiated may be blissfully unaware of the imf s existence it has played a key role in supporting economies in trouble since the middle of the last century upholding global financial stability the imf was established in 1944 at the bretton woods conference which sought to stabilise global finances after the second world war based in washington d c it is an international organisation with 190 member states from afghanistan to the uk and us right through to zimbabwe its mandate is to uphold international financial stability which it tries to do by monitoring global macroeconomic developments and providing governments with advice and training on economic policy management most importantly perhaps the imf frequently acts as a lender of last resort for its members this means it provides countries in dire financial straits with much needed money in the form of loans in return these countries must agree to certain austerity measures depending on the situation this can include tax hikes and drastic spending cuts alongside other substantial economic reforms in the last few years governments in ecuador and pakistan among others have hiked interest rates cut back on public spending programmes and reduced subsidies on household essentials such as fuel and food to meet the imf s performance criteria as a result the imf has become one of the world s most controversial organisations since the performance criteria it uses are based on the imf s worldview the question of whether its advice is adequate proportionate and effective is often subject to debate for imf advocates the sometimes draconian measures it mandates are necessary to restore investor confidence boost economic growth and help countries become more competitive in the long run as such the imf can work like a seal of approval for a country s policy plans helping governments to shore up international confidence in their economies to its critics the imf has used its policy leverage to advance reforms that have increased poverty and inequality leaving countries with deep social and political scars for years after accepting its help for example during the ebola crisis in 2014 15 the imf was criticised for contributing to underfunded health systems that prevented effective government responses to the epidemic moving markets regardless as the recent case of the uk shows an imf verdict on government policy proposals can significantly affect financial markets for countries with immediate financing needs typically developing economies restoring investor confidence with an imf intervention can be critical to the successful resolution of financial crises but the imf has also used its magic shield to rescue uk governments from global financial woes in the past in fact since the fund s creation the uk has called upon the imf 11 times its last imf rescue happened in 1976 when stagflation and political stalemate forced the uk government to ask for a loan to halt speculative pressures on the british pound the imf provided not only financial relief but also stability to a newly elected british administration by helping to calm market nerves about the uk economy this time the imf offered up its thoughts on the current economic situation in britain rather than being invited to intervene but instead of curbing speculation about the uk s financial viability the statement had the opposite effect markets panicked mortgage lenders continued to pull their offerings and investors kept unloading government bonds forcing up yields and the cost of government borrowing add the plummeting british pound in the mix and the current situation is in danger of becoming a textbook financial crisis but the imf s assessment is in line with international experts and ratings agencies in doubting that tax cuts will help reignite uk economic growth instead it argues that the cuts will further expand the budget deficit without a sound fiscal plan this will increase the need for new government debt at a time of rampant inflation deteriorating global economic conditions and rising interest rates which affect the cost of financing for the government such debts may become unsustainable for the uk taking into account the reaction of market participants to the imf s statement and that the bank of england felt the need to intervene in the bond market afterwards the imf assessment seems to have carried weight certainly the uk in debt distress is the last thing the world needs many governments in developing and emerging markets are struggling to keep their own economies afloat right now while awaiting financial relief from western banks and the imf but the uk s central position in global financial markets means any panic in the city of london can spread quickly to global financial markets from this perspective the imf s recent comments about the uk can be seen an attempt to prevent the world from slipping further into a winter of despair authors

high inflation is a kind of dangerous disease sometimes it is fatal to face this disease in such circumstances delicate manipulations and highly skilled economic policymakers are required because if inflation is left unchecked at high levels it can lead to the destruction of an entire generation a shocking example of such a historical disaster is what happened after the first world war where countries like germany austria and russia experienced extreme uncontrolled high inflation with the consequences we all know another typical example is the uncontrolled high inflation in latin american countries which led to economic disaster while strengthening totalitarian regimes therefore all countries should be cautious about this disease especially today when policymakers face an unprecedentedly high inflation rate for everyone involved with the phenomenon of inflation whether it concerns politicians or investors and traders it is most important to clarify the causes that cause inflation how to deal with it and the consequences of dealing with inflation let s get the blame squarely clear it s all about printing money inflation is a phenomenon that has its roots in monetary policy it is essentially the result of an excess amount of money in the economy relative to the actual amount of money produced by industries services natural resources and innovation sometimes the prices of certain goods and services increase because of significant discoveries in natural resources or innovation indeed discovery or innovation creates new wealth and therefore new money and an increase in price levels for some goods and services but this cannot create inflationary conditions the only ones who can do that are governments governments are the ones who control the money in the economy therefore governments decisions about the amount of money in the economy are responsible for inflation governments do not accept this responsibility and primarily shift it to other entities they usually focus on irrational decisions and behaviours of some entrepreneurs unions and consumers or they shift the blame to exogenous conditions such as irrationally high commodity prices or to irrational geopolitical actions of some states indeed all of the above seem like they could be responsible for creating inflation however this cannot be true for one simple reason because neither unions consumers businessmen nor anyone else is able to print money only government central banks print money and the fact is that all economic evidence proves that the correlation between the increase in the amount of money and inflation is absolute the same does not happen with the aforementioned factors such as the behaviour of businessmen consumers and commodities none of these coefficients is identified with inflation in the long term in fact in every part of the world and in every period of history the printing of excess money is the only reason that sooner or later always creates an increase in inflation wherever and whenever it occurs therefore the sole responsibility for inflation wherever and whenever it occurs is the government and only the government but the reasonable question is why are governments driven to print money and thus increase inflation we force governments to print money the truth is that governments print money and therefore increase government spending not because they want to but because citizens and businesses demand it indeed the fundamental reason governments print money is because they are under intense pressure from each of us look at what happens in times of crisis like the pandemic the financial crisis of 2008 or the european debt crisis just a few years ago everyone called for increased public spending on the plausible argument that businesses and households needed support remember mr draghi s famous statement that the central bank in other words the governments of european countries will do whatever is necessary to ensure price stability i e print as much money as is needed to support the economies and markets money trees do not exist all that exists are taxes the result of everyone s demand for money printing by governments was increased government spending but while government spending is rising and everyone knows especially governments that there are no money trees no one ever wants to talk about how this spending will be repaid there is only one way for governments to pay for their spending through taxes the rule is simple taxes must always equal government spending if spending increases taxes must also increase however raising taxes on citizens and businesses is a highly unpopular practice that governments avoid implementing directly governments only raise taxes directly when forced to do so because they have no other alternatives so if they don t raise direct taxes they have to do something else hidden taxation how governments always win the alternative for governments is to create hidden taxation techniques whereby everyone will be required to repay government spending still no one will be able to blame the governments directly the method devised and always followed to finance government spending is to raise money by governments through inflation essentially inflation is a type of tax where governments extract money from taxpayers in many different ways the main ones being governments print money and as a result people and businesses increase their deposits significantly remember what happened in the last few years as bank deposit accounts soared to record levels with money printing and the pandemic then through a complex process which is detailed in my book financial economics strategic risk investment management under cover governments force commercial banks to buy the bonds issued by their central banks using their customers deposits that is individuals and businesses who especially in times of crisis believe that their financial wealth is secured in commercial banks then for some time central banks create a low interest rate environment for government bonds thus the cost of borrowing for governments that continue to print money while increasing their spending to finance people and businesses is meagre to zero but issuing bonds increases public expenditure and obviously the national debt however since the cost of spending and deficits is zero and always less than inflation inflation in the long run wipes out both deficits and public debt this is how depositors repay government spending as this is the ultimate goal of governments the government debt created by increased government spending is compensated by the inflation created by money printing the depositors alternative is to invest in the real economy increasing aggregate output and thereby helping to reduce the debt to gdp ratio either way governments are the winners τhe result of inflation and the cause of inflation as mentioned above there is the counter argument that inflation is due to other factors such as unions pressures to increase workers wages however this narrative is far from the truth the difference between the effect of inflation and the cause of inflation needs to be clarified rising wages are the result not the cause of inflation the fact is that there is no evidence to prove that the increase in wages can create inflation in the mid term and long term similarly another view is that inflation results from international events such as rising energy prices for example today after the war in ukraine the narrative is that energy prices are skyrocketing worldwide and generating intractable global inflation but this narrative is not easily supported and the proof is that inflation despite the spike in energy prices varies significantly from country to country a rapid increase in energy prices can indeed create imbalances in markets however there is no evidence that energy prices generate inflation in the medium or long term at the end of the day the printing of money can cause an increase in energy prices and not the other way around the evidence shows that the government s excess money supply creates inflation nothing else the question is not whether a government is able to stop the rise of inflation since governments control inflation it can easily be assumed that governments can tame inflation whenever they want the strategy they should follow is straightforward if they print less money inflation will stabilize or decrease this is the only way they can stop the rise of inflation but the question is not whether a government can stop the rise of inflation the answer is that it can the critical question is whether the government has the will to do this to this question the answer is not simple the point is that if one is addicted to the conditions of printing money it is difficult to get rid of those conditions they are all addicted to money printing printing money not only has positive consequences for governments but it also has positive consequences for many of us in reality when governments print money many individuals and entities benefit an excess supply of money helps businesses grow significantly and production increases as does consumption but if the money printing policy continues for a long time the government is taking huge risks as time goes on and inflation increases significantly there is a point where we all lose and this is where governments must step in to tame inflation today we seem to be at precisely that point it is the point where governments should have the will to tame inflation but when governments decide to tame inflation at the beginning of this effort they will face significant difficulties as they will be forced to reduce the money supply and therefore slow economic growth also at the beginning of this effort unemployment will increase this is a scenario that no one wants to face everyone has become addicted to the previous conditions of excessive money printing and inflation and although people and entities claim that they lose from inflation and nobody wants it the truth is somewhat different rising prices benefit the value of their wealth since inflation increases the value of their real estate when in reality as with countries debts it is inflation that pays off much of their borrowing as explained earlier governments are the ones who benefit the most but people and businesses also benefit from inflation inflation widens inequality and produces populism and totalitarianism not all people and entities have the same wealth to benefit equally from inflation this means that a significant increase in inflation would gradually create a large gap between people and a similarly large gap between entities which would lead to totalitarianism characteristic examples are countries like latin america and recently in countries like turkey where inflation widens the gap and leads to totalitarian regimes suppose western countries do not immediately take measures to tame inflation in that case sooner or later it is very likely that they will find themselves in situations similar to those after the first world war the gap will widen and populism will dominate significantly increasing the global risks and geopolitical instability under these circumstances in a period such as the present where inflation tends to remain for a long time at high levels it would be a great mistake for governments to abdicate their responsibility for the cure of inflation by seeking its treatment from exogenous factors such as exerting pressure to reduce commodity prices or exert pressure on business people or trade unions such efforts would have only short term results given that governments are responsible for inflation it stands to reason that they should also be accountable for its cure governments must take full responsibility for curing inflation the fact is that governments should commit to a plan to reduce the money supply and stick to it investors and traders should know that this means a reduction in money printing so in the beginning everyone will have to deal with the negative consequences of this enormous challenge the success of this plan will depend on whether and to what extent there will be a gradual de escalation of inflation to the extent that households and businesses can adapt to the new conditions the plan should be implemented gradually because a sharp reduction in the money supply would be disastrous so it will take time to achieve the goal of reducing inflation the key point seems to be one and only one governments should take full responsibility for curbing inflation if they do not do this it will be like handing out a bomb to be defused by those who have neither the tools nor the responsibility to do so even worse it will be if they shift the responsibility of curing inflation to external international factors as today to factors that lead the energy prices because then they will take on even greater risk since the external factors that will be called upon to neutralize the inflation bomb with their interests in mind are very likely not to defuse but to detonate it
dear editor recently i toured several nebraska towns with the nebraska community foundation and its people attraction committee the goal of this committee is to share how our communities can be more attractive places for people to live it was interesting to see all the progress and investments our fellow rural communities are making across nebraska several of the biggest people attraction issues discussed in people attraction committee include housing daycare youth engagement and recreation opportunities housing seems like a counterintuitive problem if the population is shrinking you would think that there would be a lot of houses to buy or rent but that is simply not playing out in housing availability with the most recent housing study showing mccook is 200 housing units short of demand according to the census data for red willow county the number of occupied housing units shrank from 4 663 in 2010 to 4 532 in 2020 with the number of vacant housing units increasing to a total of 625 in the 2020 census several of the communities we toured including hebron and superior discussed how they have been dealing with similar issues of high vacancy yet low availability although plenty of these vacant properties need rehabilitation many are in livable condition if they were put on the market our city medc and others have been working on the housing shortage for some time but there are no easy ways to address the challenges for new construction and improving occupancy rates of our existing housing stock to meet our economic vitality needs we also saw how communities are leveraging their recreation and cultural activities to make their communities more attractive from a new fitness center in hebron to the willa cather center in red cloud these can be the selling points that helps attract or retain people to our communities mccook has an excellent arts scene three great lakes only a short drive from here the ever busy kiplinger arena great high school and college athletic programs to follow and much more this fall voters will get to decide on a recreation bond funded by sales tax for a new swimming pool and ball fields it is access to these cultural and recreational opportunities that help us offset the fact we are so geographically distant from an urban center as other recent opinion letters have pointed out sales taxes have an economic impact but there also is a real but often hidden economic impact of failing to attract and retain residents too while the demographic realities we face are rather grim our community has many assets to show current and prospective residents why our community is an excellent choice for them to live swimming pools and ball fields alone won t change our demographic future but we must continue to make investments like these in our community if we want to effectively compete to be the place people choose to call home please vote yes for mccook s recreational bond this fall sean wolfe cfo community hospital

another tumultuous week of trading in asset markets is raising hopes for a peak in the u s dollar and a bottom in precious metals the federal reserve note spiked again versus the euro and other troubled foreign currencies on monday before pulling back sharply mid week metals markets moved predictably in the opposite direction gold and silver continue to be rattled by hawkish fed pronouncements that defy deteriorating economic data the story central bankers have been telling with aggressive rate hikes is that the u s economy especially the jobs market is running hot but the latest gdp report released thursday confirms that the economy is shrinking the final revision to gross domestic product for the second quarter shows it declined by 0 6 that s two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth and in the third quarter trillions of dollars in wealth have been erased from stock and bond markets amid relentlessly rising rates the extent of the damage that will be inflicted on the housing market remains to be seen but mortgage rates recently spiking to as high as 7 translates into a massive drop in affordability which will translate into a massive plunge in buying until prices correct most experts predict a double digit drop in average home prices what have jerome powell and company gotten themselves into longtime fed watchers are perplexed at the fed s manic efforts to cool an economy that is careening toward a deep recession obviously central bankers are trying desperately to restore their inflation fighting credibility they became a laughingstock after so wrongly and stubbornly insisting inflation was transitory and leaving ultra loose monetary policy in place for way too long the markets wised up the reality that the fed doesn t take its mandate to promote price stability the least bit seriously now the fed is using monetary blunt force to try to command the respect of investors but by hiking rates faster than market were prepared to bear the fed is demonstrating that it simply lacks any ability to competently set interest rates instead of smoothing out the business cycle like economic textbooks state central banks are supposed to do fed policymakers are amplifying the boom bust cycle they inflate asset bubbles with artificial stimulus then prick them when they capriciously decide to take away stimulus and sometimes with disastrous results on both ends of the deal of course one of the main arguments for replacing the classical gold standard with a fiat standard controlled by central bankers is that gold causes boom bust cycles central planners overseeing the economy would tame the animal spirits and foster stability or so we were told but under the discipline of a gold standard debt fueled excesses in markets and in government spending never reached the epic proportions they have under the centrally managed fiat currency regime at a time when the fed s failures have never been more obvious it is ironic that the federal reserve note version of the dollar appears to be stronger than ever at least when measured on foreign exchange markets the u s dollar s appreciation against the euro the yen and other fiat currencies has masked the extent to which it is falling in real terms mrctv recently put headline dollar strength into perspective mrctv since 2020 inflation has added 961 per month to the average household s preexisting expenses which equates to 11 532 a year or nearly 19 more for the same standard of living one must remember this is for u s price increases so far now it s possible that the green agenda meets ukraine fandom economic self destruction of many eurozone nations and the concomitant devaluation of the euro and european national sub currencies could actually promote the u s federal reserve note also known as the dollar wink wink into a relatively safer position making it look like a safe haven but the u s government mandates taxation and reckless favoritism have crushed american productivity so the old playbook for the u s economy looking brighter than others might not be in the cards the fed made millions of americans poorer through inflation and is now in the process of potentially making millions jobless as the economy craters under the weight of higher rates of course at some point central bankers will reverse course and flood markets and the economy with stimulus again fed apologists will herald them for coming to the rescue in reality they will just be stimulating the next wave of inflation the fed s current tightening campaign has decimated many investors portfolios and left precious metals bulls frustrated but gold has in fact held up better than stocks and bonds and silver in recent weeks has begun to show signs of relative strength when markets get wind of the fed s impending dovish turn the u s dollar index will likely break sharply to the downside and amid a bad economy precious metals could supplant equities as the premier asset class to own among investors who don t want to fight the fed

the mosquito fire in foresthill california is the state s largest wildfire of the year photo by eric thayer getty images what i m about is about growing the economy and growing the economy benefits everybody liz truss the new uk prime minister has said a book published this month suggests however that growth for growth s sake is responsible for the environmental economic and social inequality problems the uk and other countries are facing without a change of tack and greater wealth distribution these problems will only get worse it warns fifty years ago the club of rome a network of thought leaders published the seminal limits to growth report it was based on findings by researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology who used computer models for the first time to demonstrate that the earth s resources were finite and contained a stark warning about humanity s direction of travel earth for all the latest publication from the club of rome is a roadmap for getting out of the mess we are in a survival guide for humanity authored by a team of climate experts economists and scientists from around the world it sets out how we can in the writers view choose either to move forward and create a cleaner better more equal world for all or opt to continue to destabilise people and the planet with business as usual policies published in english in september earth for all seems particularly pertinent in the uk despite heatwaves record breaking temperatures and drought the conservative party under the leadership of truss seems more focused than ever on turbocharging economic growth at any cost the uk government s response to the energy crisis has not focused on marrying the energy and the climate crises by trying to reduce electricity demand and emissions as ways to bring down prices and reliance on imported gas instead it has opted to bring back fracking and to push for more north sea exploration such a response is not only misguided in terms of the climate crisis but will fail to benefit everyone in particular those most in need suggests earth for all the uk government s response to the energy crisis appears to fit the book s too little too late scenario where societies keep boasting and bumbling about sustainability while muddling through the alternative scenario is the great leap which relies on five extraordinary turnarounds to substantially reduce the interrelated risks facing the world these turnarounds mean a conscious active essential reboot of civilisation s guiding rules to end poverty address inequality empower women make food systems healthy for people and ecosystems and to transition to clean energy for the book s authors inequality and poverty are at the heart of the world s problems unless they are tackled it will be impossible to solve other environmental or social issues within the auspices of a democratic society says author jorgen randers professor emeritus of climate strategy at the bi norwegian business school his colleague jayati ghosh professor of economics at the centre for economic studies and planning school of social sciences at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi acknowledges that growth will be necessary to level up incomes but it doesn t mean growth for growth s sake but growth that is directed to bettering the conditions of particularly the bottom half of the population earth for all recommends a shift to well being economies with a general acceptance that the richest 10 per cent take less than 40 per cent of national incomes subscribe to morning call

the problem on its head forget about thinking how everything else can serve the economy and instead think how the economy can serve our social needs and goals and allow us to live in harmony with nature and the planet such change can only happen with much greater regulation of the financial markets which have frankly gone haywire and the taxation of the extremely wealthy and of large corporations says ghosh governments need to intervene more in the public interest and provide the required finances for the transformation to a well being economy the alternative is really too hard to contemplate says ghosh we won t see a gentle decline in future living standards but major catastrophes and disasters sandrine dixson declève co president of the club of rome suggests leaders around the world know things are not as they should be as they face social disruption or climate impacts such as droughts floods or conflict on their soil the key question though is whether we can tap into that consciousness and demonstrate that ultimately everyone will suffer from continuing on a business as usual trajectory the wealthiest in our society can try to hunker down in bunkers comments dixson declève but they can t outrun reality the most vulnerable are the worst hit but at the end of the day the covid pandemic hit everyone the state took control and focused on what is most crucial and essential in our economies which is the well being economy in a nutshell making sure people have access to food energy and healthcare that our children could still be educated the books authors are clear that their conclusions are also backed by large swathes of the public among g20 countries 74 per cent of people would support their country s economic priorities moving beyond profit and increasing wealth and focusing more on human well being and ecological protection shows a survey carried by ipsos mori for earth for all the mess we are in can be sorted out insists ghosh it was created by human minds and can be undone by human minds listen to a special episode of the new statesman s world review podcast will the world end its addiction to growth

smallest to largest market capitalisations as of 30 september 2022 why our foolish writers love these asx shares objective corporation limited what it does objective corp may not be a household name but the company is well established with customers across local government the public sector regulators and other significant institutions it offers a suite of software solutions including enterprise content management information governance file collaboration and regulation management by mitchell lawler i previously wrote about objective corp last month where i compared the software company to its larger peer technology one ltd asx tne both companies are similar in what they offer however objective corp is roughly one third the size in terms of market capitalisation and revenue at first glance this minnow of the asx tech sector appears to be richly valued the company currently trades on a price to earnings p e ratio of approximately 64 times yet i believe the premium is warranted given the profitability growth potential and impeccable balance sheet on offer the objective share price is down nearly 35 in 2022 this pullback in valuation means this asx share is now on my radar motley fool contributor mitchell lawler does not own shares of objective corporation limited johns lyng group ltd what it does johns lyng group is an aussie building services company with a focus on insurance and restoration work as well as commercial building and construction by brooke cooper johns lyng group has been on a roll it was added to the s p asx 200 index asx xjo just weeks after it

group ltd paladin energy ltd what it does paladin energy is a uranium miner and exploration company with operations in australia and africa by matthew farley i believe that we re in the very early stages of witnessing a revival of nuclear energy and that the potential of these shares hasn t yet been priced in by the market the energy crisis in europe and the rising urgency to reduce emissions have catalysed change along with the development of miniaturised nuclear reactors countries such as japan china france india and the united states all have ambitions to harness more nuclear energy in the future paladin also grew its revenues substantially last financial year and reduced its statutory net loss after tax by 39 the demand for uranium is set to increase exponentially too with a mean price of the commodity expected to reach us 65 lbs in 2023 up from us 51 04 lbs at the time of writing according to trading economics motley fool contributor matthew farley does not own shares in paladin energy ltd new hope corporation limited what it does new hope is a diversified company that generates the lion s share of its income from thermal coal exploration and production most of that production is sold into the seaborne thermal coal export markets by bernd struben new hope shares have benefited from rocketing energy prices in early january thermal coal was trading for us 160 per tonne prices reached record highs of us 460 per tonne earlier in september and are currently around us 438 per tonne this helped new hope deliver 2 6 billion in revenue in fy22 up 144 year on year npat rocketed 1 139 from fy21 to 983 million and shareholders were rewarded with a 700 increase in the final dividend payout while that s water under the bridge i believe the world is nowhere near the end of the energy crisis as witnessed by the recent explosions on the nord stream gas pipeline with europe weaning itself off russian oil and gas demand for thermal coal is likely to keep prices high in the months ahead motley fool contributor bernd struben does not own shares in new hope corporation limited wesfarmers ltd what it does wesfarmers is a major retail conglomerate with businesses across a number of different sectors these include national brand names bunnings kmart officeworks target catch and priceline as well as operations in chemicals energy and fertilisers wescef by tristan harrison in this volatile environment plenty of asx shares have been sold down including wesfarmers shares in the company were swapping hands for 42 72 at friday s close that s down almost 28 in 2022 i think this lower price for wesfarmers is attractive it s now valued at around 20x fy23 s estimated earnings according to cmc markets bunnings continues to earn a high return on capital for wesfarmers which i like a lot the company s new health division also has a compelling long term future and the wescef division is doing really well in the current economic climate i appreciate the dividends wesfarmers pays its shareholders and i like that it can add diversification by investing in other sectors like lithium motley fool contributor tristan harrison does not own shares of

i know i know fall just started if you re the type who longs for the days of pumpkin spice everything breaking out the sweatshirts and sitting around the fire pit on a cool autumn night after sweating it out during the hot and humid summer days we suffer through every year in indiana kentucky and illinois i imagine you just want to enjoy these days now that they re finally here and not put any thought into what may come once they re over i totally get that and you should however i m the type who thinks it s good to know what s coming so we can try and prepare accordingly and if what the national weather service is forecasting this winter for our region plays out as they think it could we need to be prepared with our snow shovels in hand national weather service 2022 winter forecast for indiana kentucky and illinois philip rozenski the climate prediction center recently released its three month outlook for the u s and based on the information they have they believe indiana kentucky illinois along with our friends to the east in ohio and those to the north in michigan will have a good chance at getting above average precipitation this winter get our free mobile app get our free mobile app while they re forecasting that to be the case throughout the entire winter when they break down into three month increments the greatest chance for more than normal precipitation hovers over almost the entirety of indiana and ohio during the months of december january and february as noted by the darker green circle on the map below climate prediction center national weather service that dark green circle gets larger and covers all of indiana most of illinois and ohio as well as all of western kentucky for the months of january february and march climate prediction center national weather service what may cause the winter forecast to come true according to opensnow com a website and mobile app that tracks a proprietary blend of global and high resolution model data to forecast skiing conditions across the country the above average precipitation forecast is based on a term you may have heard before la niña in this case a triple dip la niña meaning it s happened for three straight years it s not necessarily a rare event but it doesn t happen often the last one took place between 1998 2001 which was the first since 1973 976 what does a la niña do according to the world meteorological organization la niña refers to the large scale cooling of the ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial pacific ocean coupled with changes in the tropical atmospheric circulation namely winds pressure and rainfall in simpler terms westerly winds near and south of the equator push the warmer waters of the pacific ocean west allowing cooler water to rise to the surface this pushes the jet stream further north into southern alaska and western canada as the stream begins to flow into the northern u s and right across the state of indiana it brings with it the colder temperatures and moisture it picked up in canada and in theory dumps it on us as it moves south into warmer areas this graphic from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa shows how it works national ocean service via the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the slightly silver lining it s important to note the climate prediction center does not specifically say our area will see more snow its data just suggests we could be in store for more precipitation than normal which could be snow but it could also be rain if the temperatures aren t below freezing with that said back in august the farmer s almanac released its winter forecast for the country and for the most part it falls in line with what the national weather service believes may happen the only difference is the national weather service is forecasting an equal chance of above or below average temperatures for us during the winter months whereas the farmer s almanac is forecasting that we re in for an unseasonably cold season they also include the word snowy farmer s almanac an important thing to keep in mind before you rush out and stock up on snow shovels and de icer this is in no way shape or form set in stone could it happen yes could it also not happen the answer to that is also yes it s the weather it is extremely hard to accurately predict what s going to happen three to five days out much less three to five months out i guess we ll just have to wait and see how it plays out keep reading get answers to 51 of the most frequently asked weather questions

wall street closed out a miserable september on friday with the standard poor s 500 posting its worst monthly skid since march 2020 when the covid 19 pandemic crashed global markets the benchmark index ended the month with a 9 3 loss and posted its third straight losing quarter it s now at its lowest level since november 2020 and is down by more than a quarter since the start of the year advertisement the main reason financial markets continue to struggle is fear about a possible recession as interest rates soar in hopes of beating down the high inflation that s swept the world quite frankly if it s a deep recession you re going to have to see more of a sell off said quincy krosby chief equity strategist for lpl financial this is what the market is trying to navigate now the federal reserve has been at the forefront of the global campaign to slow economic growth and hamper job markets just enough to undercut inflation but not so much that it causes a recession more data arrived friday to suggest the fed will keep its foot firmly on the brakes on the economy raising the risk of its going too far and causing a downturn advertisement the fed s preferred measure of inflation showed it was worse last month than economists expected that should keep the fed on track to keep raising rates and hold them at high levels a while as it has loudly and repeatedly promised to do vice chair lael brainard was the latest fed official on friday to reiterate the central bank won t pull back on rates prematurely that helped to restrain hopes on wall street for a pivot toward easier rates as the economy slows at this point it s not a matter of if we ll have a recession but what type of recession it will be said sean sun portfolio manager at thornburg investment management advertisement the s p 500 fell 54 85 points or 1 5 to 3 585 62 on friday after flipping between small losses and gains through much of the day it has now posted a weekly loss in six of the last seven weeks the dow jones industrial average dropped 500 10 points or 1 7 to 28 725 51 and the nasdaq composite slid 161 89 points or 1 5 to 10 575 62 higher interest rates knock down one of the main levers that set prices for stocks the other lever also looks to be threatened as the slowing economy high interest rates and other factors weigh on corporate profits advertisement cruise ship operator carnival dropped 23 3 for the biggest decline among s p 500 stocks after it reported a bigger loss for its latest quarter than analysts expected and revenue that fell short of expectations rivals norwegian cruise line and royal caribbean group slid 18 and 13 2 respectively nike slumped 12 8 its worst day in more than 20 years after it said its profitability weakened during the summer because of discounts needed to clear suddenly overstuffed warehouses the amount of shoes and gear in nike s inventories swelled by 44 from a year earlier this year s powerful surge for the u s dollar against other currencies also hurt nike its worldwide revenue rose only 4 instead of the 10 it would have if currency values had remained the same advertisement nike isn t the only company to see its inventories balloon so have several big name retailers and such bad news for businesses could actually mean some relief for shoppers if it leads to more discounts it echoed some glimmers of encouragement buried within friday s report on the fed s preferred gauge of inflation that showed some slowing of inflation for goods even as price gains kept accelerating for services another report on friday also offered a bit of hope a measure of consumer sentiment showed u s expectations for future inflation declined in september that s crucial for the fed because tightly held expectations for higher inflation can create a debilitating self reinforcing cycle that makes it worse advertisement treasury yields initially eased a bit on friday relieving some of the pressure that has built on markets but then turned higher by late afternoon the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 3 81 from 3 79 late thursday the two year yield which more closely tracks expectations for fed action rose to 4 23 from 4 19 still a long list of other worries continues to hang over global markets including increasing tensions between much of europe and russia after the invasion of ukraine a controversial plan to cut taxes by the british government also sent bond markets spinning recently on fears it could make inflation even worse bond markets calmed a bit only after the bank of england pledged midweek to buy however many british government bonds are needed to bring yields back down advertisement the stunning and swift rise of the u s dollar against other currencies meanwhile raises the risk of creating so much stress that something cracks somewhere in global markets stocks around the world were mixed after a report showed that inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro surged to a record and data from china said that factory activity weakened there

by sam pizzigati the people who may know america s super rich as well as anyone their tax attorneys and financial advisors are noticing a new angst within their client ranks our most fortunate are fretting about their family tree s financial future more than ever says vince annable the ceo of vfo advisory wealth management we re seeing a growing number of ultra wealthy families thinking further down their generational line in working with very wealthy families adds cliff oberlin the chief exec at oberlin wealth partners the topic of expanding their fortunes to benefit their great great grandchildren regularly comes up and how can today s wealthy best go about guaranteeing fortunes to their future family generations deep pockets points out private wealth magazine s russ alan prince have two complementary paths to dynastic wealth they need to both ratchet up the return on their investments and mitigate the taxes they pay on those returns over recent years our richest haven t had too much difficulty on either score wall street has regularly come up with new investment vehicles that promise and deliver healthy returns most typically by squeezing workers and fleecing consumers a two step that outfits like the private equity industry have so lucratively perfected taxes on grand incomes and fortunes meanwhile have shrunk to levels not seen since the go go years right before the great depression thanks to a combination of historically low tax rates and tax code loopholes that bring the taxes the wealthy actually pay down to shockingly low levels between 2010 and 2018 a biden administration analysis last year concluded america s 400 wealthiest families paid on average a mere 8 2 percent annual tax on their income from earnings and investments don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free but happy tax times for the rich don t come carved in stone tax laws can and do change public anger can increase the tax auditing pressure on grand private fortunes political landscapes can become minefields where the wealthiest among us have to watch their every step all these horrors will fill the futures of our most financially fortunate the reclusive billionaire barre seid has apparently come to believe unless today s deepest pockets take aggressive political steps to future proof their fortunes seid has moved to do just that the chicagoan seid last year dropped a whopping 1 6 billion what may be the largest single contribution ever to a politically focused nonprofit on a right wing advocacy fund run by the long time conservative activist leonard leo political analysts generally see leo as the mastermind behind the long term effort that s handed the political right its current 6 3 supermajority on the u s supreme court his new 1 6 billion windfall notes the new york times will likely cement leo s kingmaker status and give conservatives an advantage in a type of difficult to trace spending that shapes elections and political fights that sort of spending usually goes by the tag of dark money political nonprofits like the marble freedom trust the recipient of seid s 1 6 billion don t have to reveal where they get their money or how they re spending it to influence the outcomes of political races but ace reporting has stripped the secrecy off seid s mammoth political outlay to leonard leo and revealed that seid and leo carefully structured that outlay to generate as much as 400 million in tax savings for seid their tax time maneuvering began with seid transferring all the shares in his privately held tripp lite the computer company at the core of his wealth to the marble freedom trust the trust then sold the shares to an irish conglomerate for the over 1 6 billion if seid had sold the shares first and then donated the proceeds to marble freedom he would faced a massive federal tax on his capital gain by handing the stock off to marble freedom seid has totally sidestepped that levy how epic an achievement has leonard leo pulled off with his new 1 6 billion haul seid s largesse notes a propublica analysis has handed leo nearly quadruple the multiple millions leo had raised over the entire previous 16 years leo even before seid s windfall had won renown as a fundraiser extraordinaire last december for instance the watchdog open secrets marveled at how his wizardry a year earlier had raised a record 50 million for a shape shifting network of secretly funded conservative nonprofits seid s generous 1 6 billion gesture of right wing solidarity can now bestow upon leonard leo year after year some 100 million for his pet right wing causes assuming a modest annual investment return on the original 1 6 billion billionaires and the corporations they run journalist david sirota reminds us aren t expecting much of a pushback to this or any other torrential flow of dark money they re counting on the political fatalism that courses through the american electorate the notion that the rich always win no matter what the rest of us may do but the rest of us sirota notes can limit the oligarchic threat we face for starters we can push to overhaul the federal rules on political contributions so that americans can at least know who is trying to influence their votes their representatives and their court system that work would get a big boost with the passage of the disclose act the legislation sheldon whitehouse a senator from from rhode island has been introducing every year since the 2010 supreme court ruling in citizens united unleashed an enduring flood of dark money into politics the disclose act sirota and his colleague joel warner go on to explain would force dark money groups to disclose any of their donors who give more than 10 000 require shell companies spending money on elections to disclose their owners and mandate that election ads list their sponsors major contributors don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad

people visit a makeshift memorial honoring the victims of the oct 1 2017 mass shooting in las vegas the month after the tragedy five years have passed since a gunman killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more at a country music festival in las vegas it s been five years since carnage and death sent his family running into the night leaving them separated and terrified as a gunman rained bullets into an outdoor country music festival crowd on the las vegas strip the memories don t fade they sharpen william bill henning said as he prepared for ceremonies in las vegas marking the oct 1 2017 massacre advertisement chaotic and unreal he recalled a human stampede people were bleeding and screaming and running we all got separated we didn t know who was alive that was the most difficult he s now part of a survivor community thousands strong one that s helped him sort through the horror of what happened during the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history fifty eight people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22 000 in the years since the grim drumbeat of mass shootings has continued schools in uvalde texas and parkland fla grocery stores in buffalo n y and boulder colo bars in dayton ohio and thousand oaks a city building in virginia beach va a walmart in el paso meanwhile the debate over gun laws in the u s rages on including a renewed challenge to the federal regulation sparked by the las vegas shooting advertisement the massacre is part of a horrifying uptick in shootings with especially high numbers of people killed said james alan fox a professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university in boston five of the nine mass shootings in modern u s history with more than 20 people killed have taken place since 2016 starting with the pulse nightclub in orlando fla and continuing through the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas the severity of public mass shootings has increased in the past few years that s clear fox said and worrisome fox oversees a database maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university that tracks mass killings involving four or more people slain not including the perpetrator the information is drawn from media reports fbi data arrest records medical examiners reports prison records and other court documents advertisement watching the steady stream of shootings in the u s is tough for survivors said tennille pereira director of a clark county recovery and support program called the vegas strong resiliency center i know when it keeps happening people often express feelings of hopelessness pereira said i think the big thing for las vegas is to be able to share with those other communities that healing does occur and that there is hope for people like henning part of that hope has been the bond formed with other survivors the retired computer technician was celebrating his 71st birthday at the route 91 harvest festival with friends his wife daughter and three teenage grandchildren when the gunfire began while fleeing he suffered a knee injury that required surgery but his group made it out without being struck by gunfire advertisement at first the first few years it s not really sinking in he said the more we organize ourselves the more that we see each other it actually brings us back to how serious this situation

minutes we don t want to give him any more power credibility infamy pereira said in this survivor population words matter we don t use the word anniversary we use remembrance we try not to use the word victims we try to use the word survivor advertisement police and the fbi spent months investigating and concluded that gunman stephen paddock acted alone meticulously planned the attack and intentionally concealed his actions he amassed an arsenal of 23 assault style rifles in his hotel room including 14 fitted with bump stock devices that help the weapons fire rapidly caches of weapons also were found at the shooter s homes in reno and mesquite nev he killed himself before police reached him in his hotel room and officials said they never identified a clear motive for the attack shortly after the shooting the trump administration banned bump stocks under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns gun rights advocates sued saying the weapons didn t qualify as machine guns and it would take an act of congress to ban them advertisement the ban has survived several court challenges but a federal appeals court in new orleans revived a case there in june the same day the u s supreme court handed down a ruling expanding gun rights that case marked the high court s first major gun decision in more than a decade and has sparked a wave of court challenges to gun laws around the country meanwhile in las vegas survivors are working toward a permanent memorial on a corner of the former las vegas strip festival ground a sunrise remembrance ceremony is set saturday at the clark county government center and the names of those killed will be read at 10 05 p m the time the shooting started at the downtown las vegas community healing garden advertisement survivor sue

wheat futures prices received a bullish bump after the release of the united states department of agriculture s small grains 2022 summary report advertisement read also coming canola crush capacity delayed saskatoon canada s canola crush buildout is not going as smoothly as planned according to the u s department of agriculture the usda is forecasting 1 65 billion bushels of total wheat production down from its august estimate of 1 783 billion bu todd hultman lead market analyst with dtn believes the lower production number is due to the usda slashing its harvested acreage estimate by two million acres i d have to assume that s related to the drought conditions this year and it could also have been related to some of the early planting problems he said hultman was most taken aback by the new spring wheat production forecast of 482 million bu which was well below the average trade estimate of 514 million bu we ve been hearing from guys in the northern states that they really liked the looks of their spring wheat this year he said a lot of them were very happy with the yields he acknowledged that he hasn t spoken to many growers in montana where it was drier than it was in north dakota and minnesota advertisement hultman said pasta producers will not be pleased with the new durum forecast of 64 million bu which was below the trade estimate of 74 million bu wheat futures prices shot up anywhere between 16 and 25 cents per bu in the chicago kansas city and minneapolis exchanges i ve been waiting quite a while for a rebound in wheat said hultman i ve been bullish on wheat ever since we had the 5 drop and i just felt like the market has been unfairly sold he said wheat prices have been depressed mainly due to reports calling for 100 million tonnes of production in russia but it is unclear if those estimates include parts of ukraine hultman also noted that russian president vladimir putin is starting to make threats about ending the agreement that opened a grain shipping corridor for ukraine if that happens there would likely be a backlash against russian exports from foreign banks insurance companies and shipping lines advertisement arlan suderman chief commodities economist with stonex said he is worried about a shortage of feed grains in the u s today s usda report tightens wheat stocks that are going to be needed to be fed in the plains feedlot belt he said during a webinar he estimated there is already a 700 million bu deficit of corn and sorghum in some of these big feedlot states we re also tight on wheat supplies said suderman for instance kansas has 306 million bu of wheat stocks as of september 2022 which is 100 million bu below last year s levels suderman said the usda s new hard red winter wheat forecast is 531 million bu again well below the trade estimate of 573 million bu it s the smallest since i believe 1957 he said advertisement that s a small crop and the new winter wheat crop is off to an inauspicious start maps show there is still significant drought west of the mississippi river where much of the hard red winter wheat crop is grown drought is improving in texas but getting worse in kansas and oklahoma when suderman plugs the new usda estimates into his 2022 23 supply and demand balance sheet it generates an ending stocks number of 467 million bu well below last year s 660 million bu suderman also noted that two thirds of argentina s wheat crop is parched and crop ratings are well below normal in that country contact sean pratt producer com
in the usa where i am visiting the past week has been banned books week an exercise to raise awareness of how many books are taken out of schools universities and public libraries after they have been challenged by parents and community opponents the american library association has catalogued more than 1700 such challenges in the past year and this is only those that have come to light publicly the ala estimates that as many as 10 000 different titles are removed from the shelves of public school and local libraries each year there is a country where the classic novels to kill a mockingbird 1984 huckleberry finn and the handmaid s tale are frequently banned from public and school libraries kids favourites such as where the wild things are and the captain underpants series even the holy bible and harry potter are on the most banned list the sharp end of book bans is those that contain themes that are considered lgbtqia friendly this year half of the top 10 most targeted books including the top three were considered to have sexually explicit pro gay content frankness about sex and racism is being challenged at a skyrocketing rate in his book free speech for me but not for thee us author nat hentoff writes that the lust to suppress can come from any direction and the war on books is not exclusively being waged by social conservatives harper lee s to kill a mockingbird and john steinbeck s of mice and men the cream of 20th century american literature are among the most banned books each year for their supposed racial stereotyping the bible is often challenged by radical atheists and withdrawn from library shelves the kite runner by afghan author khaled hosseini a global bestseller for its depictions of life under taliban rule has been banned for promoting islam and leading to terrorism the librarians oppose bans from every political direction and have to devote increasing amounts of their time to the fight to restore books to their stocks after they have been challenged captain underpants author dav pilkey credit ap it would surprise nobody that america s cultural wars are more advanced than in australia donald trump exploited and became a totem of culture war flash points but to blame this war on the trump presidency would be superficial and inaccurate even as a second trump candidature in 2024 remains a real prospect it is clear that the growing social divisions in this country have bubbled along for many years and will continue to do so whether trump gets anywhere near the white house again or not the number of book bans had been rising before trump became president in 2016 and the curve has steepened during the biden presidency the book bans depict a cultural phenomenon for which trump is only a symbol not a driving force australia does not have the same local mechanisms for book bans other than in private schools concerned citizens can t band together and make noise to get books censored as they can in the us but this does not mean the strong arm of book censorship does not exist in australia it can as easily come from the progressive as the conservative side the most recent firm book banning later reversed in australia was when conservative sydney anglican minister michael jensen s you an introduction was censored by the nsw education department in 2015 some members of the diocese to which rev jensen belongs are so concerned about being oppressed by progressives that they have launched a new evangelical outreach movement the church of the southern cross to counter what they see as the active censorship of their views it is arguable that compared with the us where the religious right has amassed decades worth of organisation in local politics the perceived fear of censorship is far greater among conservatives than it is among progressives
by david haggith the dow plunged 686 points midday on thursday and closed down 458 wiping out a large relief rally from the day before and it went down for the key reason i laid out for understanding why the fed will over tighten and drive the economy into an extremely deep recession a batch of economic data that reinforced expectations the federal reserve will continue with its aggressive pace of rate hikes set the tone analysts said while a sharp selloff across tech related shares amplified the damage the latest update to second quarter gdp figures confirmed that the u s economy shrank at an annualized clip of 0 6 in the second quarter however a weekly report on u s jobless benefit claims revealed that the number of americans initially applying for unemployment benefits fell by 16 000 to 193 000 in the week ended sept 24 the lowest level since april the jobless claims data helped to weigh on stocks by emboldening a view that the fed will stick with its plans to continue raising interest rates morningstar so the economy is solidly confirmed as receding for two consecutive quarters the normal definition of a recession but the fed and everyone who follows the fed does not believe the economy is already in a recession because the jobs market appears so tight that it has them convinced it is a very healthy labor market as i wrote last week nothing could be further from the truth see everyone sings the strong labor market tune in unison as the band plays on and they re all dead wrong it is actually a broken labor market that cannot deliver labor to meet even substandard production levels thus dooming the economy to lower production for a long time to come exemplifying this enormously and dangerously misguide belief one expert concluded yesterday i think we ll see rates continue to increase here in the us since we re not yet in restrictive territory and that rate cuts won t come as easily or as soon as the market expects michael wang ceo and founder of prometheus alternative investments told marketwatch he s dead right that rate cuts will not come easily or soon because the fed and everyone who follows the fed believes the fed is not yet in restrictive territory just as this guy exemplifies because they think the labor market is tight due to a strong economy that patron post that i released to everyone last week is the most important thing you can understand for realizing why the fed is going to drive us deeper into a recession that is already more than half a year long this will be one of the biggest blunders the fed has ever made the fed is pounding the stock market s head and all markets into the ground at a time when the economy is extremely damaged but the fed mistakenly believes the economy is strong due its critical misunderstanding of what is happening in the labor market and thursday s market moves and commentary perfectly demonstrate that playing out if you read nothing else on this site read that article the fed believes it needs to take some wind out of the labor market to cool it off when the labor market is literally dying how bad was it the plunge in the dow was bad enough to finally deliver the dow into a bear market it has fallen 20 since its last high taking us to where all the major indices are finally in agreement that we are in a bear market there is not hint of room left for saying we are not we are very close in both the dow and s p to taking out the entire market gain since the coronacrash tech stocks long the market leaders took the hardest pounding with apple leading the way down almost 5 when it was downgraded from buy to neutral by bank of america megacap tech stocks got hit hard after apple was delivered an extraordinarily rare downgrade by bank of america the downgrade emphasized the risk of weaker services and product demand given the current macro environment said edward moya senior market analyst at oanda in a note facebook meta also plunged almost 4 for similar reasons as well as their own bad ideas meta s outlook is in shambles as they are looking at a terrible macro backdrop that will lead to falling ad rev and a metaverse bet that does not seem like it will pan out moya said due to fantasies about a fed pivot which the fed eventually put solidly to rest the stock market had a promising start to the quarter soaring in july but fears about inflation rate hikes rising bond yields and recession returned with a vengeance in august and september cnn so we are back to lower point than where we started the quarter making the this the third quarter in a row this year to end further down just as has been the case with gdp the market is ultimately being force to dealing with the economy the real economy as measured in terms of inflation adjusted production not the baloney economy that is being perceived from very misleading jobs numbers bonds are also crashing into a bear market it s not just stocks that have tumbled it s the bear market for just about everything there have been few places for investors to run and hide this year bond yields have surged which means that prices are down that weighs on returns bonds are supposed to be safe havens during times of market and economic volatility but two popular widely held bond funds the vanguard total bond market index fund etf and ishares core u s aggregate bond etf are both down nearly 16 in 2022 cnn bond fund investors may have known that 2022 wasn t going to be pretty but the losses they are facing this year are still striking the declines across fixed income funds were extended in recent weeks after the august consumer price index report came in hotter than expected and the federal reserve followed up with an unprecedented third straight 0 75 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate this has added up to big losses for investors for example the largest u s bond fund strategy the 514 5 billion vanguard total bond market index vbmfx is down 12 12 through sept 13 putting it on track for its worst year since its inception in 1986 in fact 2022 may be on its way to the record books for more than just the size of the losses this could be the first time on record that all types of bond funds have declined together in the same year every one of morningstar s 20 taxable bond categories is in negative territory for the year through sept 13 the last time losses were so widespread was in 2008 it s been the most volatile bond market going back to the 90s says morningstar senior manager research analyst peter marchese morningstar and of course all of this is happening due to the fed raising interest rates and rolling off the bonds it owns so they have to find refinancing elsewhere quantitative tightening qt this month steps up to the fastest pace or bond rolloff the fed has ever attempted i assure you it won t be pretty it already isn t but the fed is staying its course because of its misreading of the jobs market with the labor market tight and inflation stubbornly high the fed has signaled that it s inclined to keep raising rates into next year in fact all markets are crashing even as the fed begins tightening harder as move into its full velocity qt regime we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us think gold is a good place to ride out the storm the price of the yellow metal is down 10 this year and forget about cryptocurrencies bitcoin prices have fallen off a cliff plummeting nearly 60 in 2022 cnn nothing is holding up and don t even think gold is helping anyone against inflation after you sell it for a 10 loss this year the dollars you get back are also worth 8 less due to inflation so you lose on the value of the gold and on the cost of inflation as with other assets you re getting back 10 fewer dollars that are also worth 8 less that is the insidious evil of inflation it erodes your investments from the underside and those foolish enough to get optimistic keep getting their heads clubbed harder vanguard total bond market index fund gained in june when some investors speculated inflation had peaked and the fed wouldn t need to push rates higher this optimism led investors to move into riskier assets at the start of the third quarter stocks and high yield bonds rallied but another dismal inflation report sent bond prices down in august morningstar it s better to be a realist which is what this site and the daily doom are all about recognize what is happening to you and don t get clubbed on the head all markets are caving in and they re going to keep falling because the fed is going to keep tightening because it has to beat interest and because as that patron post explained it believes labor statistics are showing it the labor market is remaining strong it couldn t be more wrong but you don t have to be if you keep reading here where all of this has been pointed out consistently months in advance and the big equities plunge is just now set up to happen the extreme stress showing in credit and currency markets has yet to be fully reflected in equities though this moment may not be far away the selloff in stock markets has so far been an orderly one volatility is nowhere near where it was in the early part of the year while the stoxx 600 is still well above pandemic lows contrast that with the blowout in credit markets where the markit itraxx europe index of investment grade credit default swaps has surged to its highest level in 10 years exceeding covid highs zero hedge stocks in other words have some catching down to do in order to get even with what the bond market usually regarded as the wiser of the two markets is already realizing for barclays strategists led by emmanuel cau capitulation in equities may have a final leg amid the twin shock of a recession and monetary tightening they expect more equity selling if earnings fundamentals deteriorate and central banks don t come to the rescue the difference in how orderly disorderly the two markets are behaving can be seen in this graph stock volatility is still subdued but don t expect that to last because earnings fundamentals are deteriorating and the fed as central bank is not coming to the rescue because it believes the labor market is still stable and resilient and must be taken down more to quell inflation signs are emerging that panic selling in many asset classes may soon spill over into stocks the stoxx 600 just hit its lowest level since november 2020 before bouncing yesterday and is in oversold territory all of that on heavy volume among the wall of headwinds for equities right now is that they have almost lost their edge to bonds corporate investment grades are close to yielding more than stocks with the difference between them at its lowest level since august 2011 meanwhile european markets are falling into bear territory one after the other i ll be back with more on this but i want to leave you with that at the start of the day so we can see how the day goes and the quarter closes from here but i suspect we are on the cusp of that volatility explosion the one saving grace will be if flight of capital out of europe continues to spill over into the us which is what gave us markets their brief bounce earlier this week when the us suddenly looked like the least stinky pond at the sewage treatment plant gdp tanking again meanwhile look at where the atlanta fed has now moved its gdpnow forecast and think about what declining gdp means for those earnings that the stock market has been misguided on even lower than the last time i reported it dropping from a 0 5 growth estimate to 0 3 while the consensus survey of economists is for the entire quarter running below the atlanta fed s estimate and is negative when it was running above it during the previous quarters of the year and i ll remind you that in each of the previous quarters the atlanta fed came to this same near zero level and then dived negative just a day or two before the actual negative gdp report came out after the quarter was over by the time the third quarter ends today and then gdp is calculated and released on oct 27 expect this number to have been whittled down further as happened in each of the previous quarters this year just as i said it would we will find we have been through three quarters of recession with the fed tightening all the way and marveling at how strong the labor market is given the anomalous gdp reports that don t match up with what labor is telling them you if you read that last patron post will know exactly why the numbers don t square and why labor is really telling us that production will remain substandard for many quarters to come because the labor market is actually quite sick so we re going down down down in a burning ring of fire as the flames of inflation go higher and higher and the fed keeps pounding pounding pounding us down in the worst policy blunder in fed history

canadian and us evaluations peak value ip llc valuation of company s intellectual property ip petroteq s technology is considered a clean technology and is an environmentally safe and sustainable technology while the technology is applicable to both water wet canada and hydrocarbon wet utah oils sands sediments deposits and materials the technology does not utilize water in its processing operations and thus there is no requirement to build and manage large tailings ponds wastewater treatment disposal systems and facilities the proprietary solvents utilized in the operations of the technology are generally fully recovered and recycled thus substantially mitigating environmental impact peak value ip s valuation study of petroteq s cort indicated a fair market value fmv ranging from 229 million to 326 million the analysis of investment value iv ranging from 598 million to 850 million the analysis has also considered a proposed production facility to be operated in utah that will produce 5 000 bpd the valuation also encompasses the value of the separated sand as salable to third parties providing additional value to the ip beyond the market of oil the deployment of the ip into multiple oil sand fields is a critical milestone in achieving petroteq s goals for ip adoption economic evaluation of sands by product from oil extraction the completion of a third party economic evaluation report dated february 10 2022 the report in relation to sands anticipated to be produced as by products of petroleum products from oil sands at the asphalt ridge nw leases in uintah county utah the report was prepared by broadlands minerals advisory services ltd broadlands a u s based independent mineral advisory company with input from q4 impact group llc q4 impact under engagement to broadlands on markets and prices for the sand products the report is premised on the completion by petroteq of an extraction plant capable of producing 5 000 barrels of high grade oil per day bpd on what is referred to in the report as the indago lease which consists of approximately 3 458 acres of oil sands leases that the company recently acquired from valkor llc in exchange for the company s temple mountain leases the cash flow analysis was run on a pre income tax basis at discount rates of 0 0 7 5 and 15 percent the results show potential economic benefit in the base case of a net present value npv of 1 285 602 and 341 million respectively the base case cash flow used a selling price of 40 per ton for the unprocessed dry clean by product sand q4 impact provided market sale price analysis to arrive at a reasonable selling price for the cash flow forecast broadlands notes the economic model and base case numbers may not be realized due to market factors kahuna ventures llc independent third party engineering report kahuna ventures llc kahuna has reviewed operating data process simulation data and the front end engineering and design feed study for the purposes of a third party technical evaluation this feed encompasses a production train capable of processing 5 000 bpd from mined oil sands ore the company anticipates that this feed can become the starting basis for future 5 000 bpd train designs for use in utah by petroteq and potentially by additional licensees in utah the us and other locations worldwide this standard design may need some customization for local site conditions and ore characteristics but differences are expected to be insignificant the feed study describes the design data design requirements detailed major equipment requirements and general operating philosophies for the development of the 5 000 bpd production train including a class 3 25 cost estimate of approximately us 110 million for construction of the plant on an undeveloped site this provides for a capital cost of 22 000 per day barrel of production the proposed plant covered by the feed study will consist of an initial 5 000 bpd production train but provides for the possible future expansion to 10 000 bpd through the addition of a second parallel 5 000 bpd train valkor llc completed design of 5 000 barrel per day oil sands extraction plant valkor signed a technology license agreement with petroteq on july 1 2019 and has been operating at the plant in vernal utah under a service master agreement signed on november 1 2018 valkor is fully cognizant of the engineering and technical aspects needed for the process to have this update done to incorporate all additional data into the original feed valkor llc valkor has updated and completed the design for the planned 5 000 bpd extraction plant following the feed valkor conducted various additional design studies to prepare the final engineering plans a primary part of this was a design study with m i swaco a schlumberger company for the backend processes for sand separation and drying the system is a conventional sand dryer modified for service with petrochemical solvents in a closed loop a combined unit has been proposed as a turnkey system to handle as much as 8 000 tons of sand per day with a target of epa tier 1 quality for the resulting sand design performance budget and schedule have been determined m i swaco did a full 3d model of the design completion of quadrise testing program quadrise fuels international plc quadrise completed testing of an oil sample supplied by tomco s 100 owned subsidiary greenfield energy llc greenfield taken from the petroteq oil sands plant posp and produced from oil sands ore using petroteq s clean oil recovery technology cort quadrise reported that an extensive program of testing on the greenfield oil sample was completed at the quadrise research facility qrf in essex uk the testing program at the qrf confirmed the ability to produce commercial msar and biomsar fuels from the sample of heavy sweet oil provided by greenfield and a report of the testing results has been issued to tomco simulations of storage and handling of both msar and biomsar produced were also completed during the program which indicated that commercial production of msar and biomsar fuels would be possible in utah for potential power and marine end user applications domestically and internationally eliminating debt to strengthen the balance sheet in furtherance of bridging the capital gap success in any one of our operational areas of focus can materially impact the company s valuation achieving success however will require the infusion of additional capital investment over the next several years up to 13 million for full commercial state of the art 500 bpd extraction plant in asphalt ridge nw utah projected budget of almost 100 million for the tie in and development of 5 000 bpd plant with this aggressive capital program in mind the significant size of this investment will require the deal s attractive terms combined with a strong vote of confidence in our assets enormous potential bridging the remaining funding gap is something we hope to accomplish by receiving licensing and royalty production fees the issuance of further equity with terms minimizing dilution for our existing shareholders more significantly any of our internal assets could be monetized with proceeds reinvested in our current and future projects this approach makes a lot of sense for our company and our shareholders and the development of our core assets will reach a point at which we believe can achieve attractive valuations and maximize shareholder value as part of our corporate finance strategy we felt it was imperative to strengthen the balance sheet by eliminating debt wherever possible on terms devoid of any discount to market or involving the issuance of warrants i am pleased to announce that we have successfully reached agreements with six of our creditors collectively the creditors all of whom are at arm s length to the company and each other to convert outstanding debts owed by the company to the creditors the debt conversion these creditors will now join our thousands of supportive shareholders who believe in the future of petroteq s technology and robust commercial prospects in aggregate the debt conversion is expected to relieve the balance sheet of 5 042 842 cad in liabilities based on a board approved deemed issue price of five cents per share as a result of these debt conversions the creditors are expected to become shareholders of the company and will receive an aggregate of 98 333 181 of common shares of the company each a common share the debt conversion is subject to the approval of the tsx

canadian and us evaluations peak value ip llc valuation of company s intellectual property ip petroteq s technology is considered a clean technology and is an environmentally safe and sustainable technology while the technology is applicable to both water wet canada and hydrocarbon wet utah oils sands sediments deposits and materials the technology does not utilize water in its processing operations and thus there is no requirement to build and manage large tailings ponds wastewater treatment disposal systems and facilities the proprietary solvents utilized in the operations of the technology are generally fully recovered and recycled thus substantially mitigating environmental impact peak value ip s valuation study of petroteq s cort indicated a fair market value fmv ranging from 229 million to 326 million the analysis of investment value iv ranging from 598 million to 850 million the analysis has also considered a proposed production facility to be operated in utah that will produce 5 000 bpd the valuation also encompasses the value of the separated sand as salable to third parties providing additional value to the ip beyond the market of oil the deployment of the ip into multiple oil sand fields is a critical milestone in achieving petroteq s goals for ip adoption economic evaluation of sands by product from oil extraction the completion of a third party economic evaluation report dated february 10 2022 the report in relation to sands anticipated to be produced as by products of petroleum products from oil sands at the asphalt ridge nw leases in uintah county utah the report was prepared by broadlands minerals advisory services ltd broadlands a u s based independent mineral advisory company with input from q4 impact group llc q4 impact under engagement to broadlands on markets and prices for the sand products the report is premised on the completion by petroteq of an extraction plant capable of producing 5 000 barrels of high grade oil per day bpd on what is referred to in the report as the indago lease which consists of approximately 3 458 acres of oil sands leases that the company recently acquired from valkor llc in exchange for the company s temple mountain leases the cash flow analysis was run on a pre income tax basis at discount rates of 0 0 7 5 and 15 percent the results show potential economic benefit in the base case of a net present value npv of 1 285 602 and 341 million respectively the base case cash flow used a selling price of 40 per ton for the unprocessed dry clean by product sand q4 impact provided market sale price analysis to arrive at a reasonable selling price for the cash flow forecast broadlands notes the economic model and base case numbers may not be realized due to market factors kahuna ventures llc independent third party engineering report kahuna ventures llc kahuna has reviewed operating data process simulation data and the front end engineering and design feed study for the purposes of a third party technical evaluation this feed encompasses a production train capable of processing 5 000 bpd from mined oil sands ore the company anticipates that this feed can become the starting basis for future 5 000 bpd train designs for use in utah by petroteq and potentially by additional licensees in utah the us and other locations worldwide this standard design may need some customization for local site conditions and ore characteristics but differences are expected to be insignificant the feed study describes the design data design requirements detailed major equipment requirements and general operating philosophies for the development of the 5 000 bpd production train including a class 3 25 cost estimate of approximately us 110 million for construction of the plant on an undeveloped site this provides for a capital cost of 22 000 per day barrel of production the proposed plant covered by the feed study will consist of an initial 5 000 bpd production train but provides for the possible future expansion to 10 000 bpd through the addition of a second parallel 5 000 bpd train valkor llc completed design of 5 000 barrel per day oil sands extraction plant valkor signed a technology license agreement with petroteq on july 1 2019 and has been operating at the plant in vernal utah under a service master agreement signed on november 1 2018 valkor is fully cognizant of the engineering and technical aspects needed for the process to have this update done to incorporate all additional data into the original feed valkor llc valkor has updated and completed the design for the planned 5 000 bpd extraction plant following the feed valkor conducted various additional design studies to prepare the final engineering plans a primary part of this was a design study with m i swaco a schlumberger company for the backend processes for sand separation and drying the system is a conventional sand dryer modified for service with petrochemical solvents in a closed loop a combined unit has been proposed as a turnkey system to handle as much as 8 000 tons of sand per day with a target of epa tier 1 quality for the resulting sand design performance budget and schedule have been determined m i swaco did a full 3d model of the design completion of quadrise testing program quadrise fuels international plc quadrise completed testing of an oil sample supplied by tomco s 100 owned subsidiary greenfield energy llc greenfield taken from the petroteq oil sands plant posp and produced from oil sands ore using petroteq s clean oil recovery technology cort quadrise reported that an extensive program of testing on the greenfield oil sample was completed at the quadrise research facility qrf in essex uk the testing program at the qrf confirmed the ability to produce commercial msar and biomsar fuels from the sample of heavy sweet oil provided by greenfield and a report of the testing results has been issued to tomco simulations of storage and handling of both msar and biomsar produced were also completed during the program which indicated that commercial production of msar and biomsar fuels would be possible in utah for potential power and marine end user applications domestically and internationally eliminating debt to strengthen the balance sheet in furtherance of bridging the capital gap success in any one of our operational areas of focus can materially impact the company s valuation achieving success however will require the infusion of additional capital investment over the next several years up to 13 million for full commercial state of the art 500 bpd extraction plant in asphalt ridge nw utah projected budget of almost 100 million for the tie in and development of 5 000 bpd plant with this aggressive capital program in mind the significant size of this investment will require the deal s attractive terms combined with a strong vote of confidence in our assets enormous potential bridging the remaining funding gap is something we hope to accomplish by receiving licensing and royalty production fees the issuance of further equity with terms minimizing dilution for our existing shareholders more significantly any of our internal assets could be monetized with proceeds reinvested in our current and future projects this approach makes a lot of sense for our company and our shareholders and the development of our core assets will reach a point at which we believe can achieve attractive valuations and maximize shareholder value as part of our corporate finance strategy we felt it was imperative to strengthen the balance sheet by eliminating debt wherever possible on terms devoid of any discount to market or involving the issuance of warrants i am pleased to announce that we have successfully reached agreements with six of our creditors collectively the creditors all of whom are at arm s length to the company and each other to convert outstanding debts owed by the company to the creditors the debt conversion these creditors will now join our thousands of supportive shareholders who believe in the future of petroteq s technology and robust commercial prospects in aggregate the debt conversion is expected to relieve the balance sheet of 5 042 842 cad in liabilities based on a board approved deemed issue price of five cents per share as a result of these debt conversions the creditors are expected to become shareholders of the company and will receive an aggregate of 98 333 181 of common shares of the company each a common share the debt conversion is subject to the approval of the tsx

everyone from political pundits to people on the street have issued forth on the new uk government s tax cut laden growth plan recently but it was a rare public rebuke from the international monetary fund imf that really impacted financial markets days after the government made its mini budget announcement the imf warned that large and untargeted fiscal packages could work at cross purposes to monetary policy referring to current efforts by central banks around the world to fight rampant inflation it also suggested the government should reevaluate its tax measures and provide more targeted energy crisis support at its next budget currently scheduled for november 23 investors responded by beating an even hastier exit from government bond markets and sending the pound plummeting within hours of the imf statement the bank of england had announced a plan to try to calm the markets the imf s decision to comment on uk tax policy was significant and clearly had an impact on traders and investors and while the uninitiated may be blissfully unaware of the imf s existence it has played a key role in supporting economies in trouble since the middle of the last century upholding global financial stability the imf was established in 1944 at the bretton woods conference which sought to stabilise global finances after the second world war based in washington d c it is an international organisation with 190 member states from afghanistan to the uk and us right through to zimbabwe its mandate is to uphold international financial stability which it tries to do by monitoring global macroeconomic developments and providing governments with advice and training on economic policy management most importantly perhaps the imf frequently acts as a lender of last resort for its members this means it provides countries in dire financial straits with much needed money in the form of loans in return these countries must agree to certain austerity measures depending on the situation this can include tax hikes and drastic spending cuts alongside other substantial economic reforms in the last few years governments in ecuador and pakistan among others have hiked interest rates cut back on public spending programmes and reduced subsidies on household essentials such as fuel and food to meet the imf s performance criteria as a result the imf has become one of the world s most controversial organisations since the performance criteria it uses are based on the imf s worldview the question of whether its advice is adequate proportionate and effective is often subject to debate for imf advocates the sometimes draconian measures it mandates are necessary to restore investor confidence boost economic growth and help countries become more competitive in the long run as such the imf can work like a seal of approval for a country s policy plans helping governments to shore up international confidence in their economies to its critics the imf has used its policy leverage to advance reforms that have increased poverty and inequality leaving countries with deep social and political scars for years after accepting its help for example during the ebola crisis in 2014 15 the imf was criticised for contributing to underfunded health systems that prevented effective government responses to the epidemic moving markets regardless as the recent case of the uk shows an imf verdict on government policy proposals can significantly affect financial markets for countries with immediate financing needs typically developing economies restoring investor confidence with an imf intervention can be critical to the successful resolution of financial crises but the imf has also used its magic shield to rescue uk governments from global financial woes in the past in fact since the fund s creation the uk has called upon the imf 11 times its last imf rescue happened in 1976 when stagflation and political stalemate forced the uk government to ask for a loan to halt speculative pressures on the british pound the imf provided not only financial relief but also stability to a newly elected british administration by helping to calm market nerves about the uk economy this time the imf offered up its thoughts on the current economic situation in britain rather than being invited to intervene but instead of curbing speculation about the uk s financial viability the statement had the opposite effect markets panicked mortgage lenders continued to pull their offerings and investors kept unloading government bonds forcing up yields and the cost of government borrowing add the plummeting british pound in the mix and the current situation is in danger of becoming a textbook financial crisis but the imf s assessment is in line with international experts and ratings agencies in doubting that tax cuts will help reignite uk economic growth instead it argues that the cuts will further expand the budget deficit without a sound fiscal plan this will increase the need for new government debt at a time of rampant inflation deteriorating global economic conditions and rising interest rates which affect the cost of financing for the government such debts may become unsustainable for the uk taking into account the reaction of market participants to the imf s statement and that the bank of england felt the need to intervene in the bond market afterwards the imf assessment seems to have carried weight certainly the uk in debt distress is the last thing the world needs many governments in developing and emerging markets are struggling to keep their own economies afloat right now while awaiting financial relief from western banks and the imf but the uk s central position in global financial markets means any panic in the city of london can spread quickly to global financial markets from this perspective the imf s recent comments about the uk can be seen an attempt to prevent the world from slipping further into a winter of despair authors
