on the surface it appears to be smooth sailing for the seafood sector with fresh and frozen product revenues up strongly over the last year yet potentially rough waters await merchandisers that are unable to keep pacing with the growing shopper demand for a wider array of seafood options indeed greater awareness of seafood s health benefits and changing consumer lifestyles including a pandemic spurred reduction in dining out are helping to spur seafood sales activity reports portland ore based allied market research which forecasts a 2 5 compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2027 the greater interest by shoppers in preparing seafood at home in reaction to the covid 19 pandemic also is putting pressure on supplies said chuck anderson vice president and partner with certified quality foods a dallas based analyzer of seafood quality and the former vice president of seafood procurement for ahold usa and the former category manager for seafood at h e b many americans have more discretionary dollars to spend on food because they are spending less money on travel concerts movies and eating out he said adding that consumers also are splurging on themselves with higher value seafood meals such as crab lobster and scallops as they become more confident preparing such options what is amazing is how well the seafood supply chain is holding up under tremendous demand labor shortages and changing supply markets anderson said noting that seafood buyers have always had to be flexible and learn to buy from new sources of supply with little or no notice due to weather and other factors that other retail buyers have not had to do nevertheless supply chain restraints such as declining quotas for some wild caught seafood species are causing out of stocks and increasing the demand for products that are in short supply which is helping to drive inflation he said that includes most shellfish products which because of fishing restrictions were facing lower harvests in 2021 and lower quotas in 2022 north american production of snow crab king crab scallops lobster as well as halibut are all down 10 or more since 2019 he noted global cod production also is down due to lower quotas for north sea cod indeed imported pasteurized crabmeat was one of the most difficult products to source in 2021 anderson said with many retailers experiencing out of stocks for all crabmeat varieties for a month or longer during the fourth quarter which included the all important holiday season supply chain logistical issues including a scarcity of truck drivers are also causing product shortages and contributing to higher prices the inflation rate for seafood products has skyrocketed anderson said noting for instance that the cost of 6 ounce frozen tuna steaks rose 51 during 2021 merchandising flexibility such supply matters are necessitating the need for merchandising flexibility by supermarkets according to anderson with fast changing supply issues and quickly rising prices having excellent two way communications with suppliers is more critical than ever he said seafood is always highly dependent on timely logistics and good communications but more so in today s retail environment that flexibility includes being able to efficiently revise store planograms in accordance with seafood availability anderson said along with a focus on ensuring there is always a supply of the higher volume and critical products which precludes ordering specific seafood varieties on a just in time basis the benefits from saving money by not tying up capital on inventories is wiped out if you are out of stock on essential items and losing sales he said this is critical to understand and act upon if a retailer is out of essential products for customers they not only lose the immediate sale but they may also lose that customer and their whole basket that is particularly important as customers who eat seafood at least once a month spend an average of 190 a week on groceries and frequent seafood shoppers who eat seafood two or more times a week spend 225 weekly versus 137 a week for non seafood consumers according to fmi s power of seafood 2021 report in addition the average household income among seafood shoppers is 84 000 versus 58 000 for non seafood consumers fmi noted anderson added that it also is a competitive advantage for retailers to always have the most sought after seafood items available customers can and do change stores to get the products they want he said this is more than not losing customers it is an opportunity to gain market share from retailers that have not adjusted their buying practices as well

washington ap senate majority leader chuck schumer said in an interview thursday that democrats made progress toward changing the senate s filibuster rules to advance sweeping voting legislation despite the dramatic collapse of the package that his party says is central to protecting democracy from his office overlooking the national mall with portraits of the roosevelts above his desk franklin d on one side theodore on the other schumer took stock of what was widely seen as a striking setback for president joe biden on his first anniversary in office as the democrats signature voting bill unraveled if the choice was to go forward or not go forward we re much better off having gone forward schumer told the associated press the legislation has been one of the party s top priorities in congress since democrats gained control of both houses and the white house bringing unified party power to washington the freedom to vote john r lewis act is seen by party leaders and civil rights advocates as essential to protecting the right to vote as republican led states nationwide put in place laws that will make it more difficult for black americans and others to cast ballots states are curbing early voting and mail in ballots both popular during the covid 19 pandemic and requiring various types of voter identification among other changes schumer a democrat from new york in his first term as majority leader has been under enormous pressure to deliver the voting package as it languished in congress an uphill struggle in the evenly split senate that by many accounts appeared doomed to fail he didn t have the votes to overcome a republican filibuster as all 50 gop senators lined up against the package criticizing it as federal overreach into state run elections then the bill was dealt a devastating blow when two democratic senators kyrsten sinema of arizona and joe manchin of west virginia refused to change the party s rules in this one case to overcome the filibuster s 60 vote threshold and allow passage with a simple majority but schumer who has been reading a biography of former president ulysses s grant defended his decision to pursue this week s vote framing it as part of the long arc of the nation s civil rights struggles that continue to this day he showed me how you know the right to vote is essential schumer said schumer pointed to the late rep john lewis d ga who was left beaten and bloody as a young man marching for voting rights across the edmund pettus bridge in alabama and the persistence of black americans and others to keep pressing to secure equal access to the ballot look at the civil rights movement he said it took several sessions of congress before civil rights and voting rights legislation would ultimately be signed into law by president lyndon b johnson i mean you got to pursue things and you got to put people on the record schumer said our job is to vote after the legislation collapsed late wednesday biden said he was profoundly disappointed by the outcome but the president also said he was not deterred and would explore all options to protect the vote not long ago a number of democratic senators many still in office signed onto a 2017 letter opposing filibuster changes during the senate debate several of them rose to explain why they were willing to change course for this bill in the end all but manchin and sinema were ready to adjust the rules to pass the voting bill we made progress schumer said it s amazing to me that our caucus 48 people said change the rules copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

west palm beach fla the centers for disease control and prevention has a new recommendation for an old tool the more contagious omicron variant is prompting a call to use more protective masks but it has also caused prices to soar for some of them the cdc said that cloth masks are no longer as effective at preventing the spread of covid 19 now recommending everyone to wear a n95 or kn95 mask related which face mask is best for protection against omicron the cdc said that multi layer cloth masks do not provide enough protection against omicron normally scientific facts come out after scrupulous data analysis 10 times 20 times back and forth said infectious disease specialist dr ramprasad gopalan we don t have time for that because this thing is coming at us wptv dr ramprasad gopalan explains the difference between n95 and kn95 masks gopalan said since there is a federal stockpile of n95 masks and high transmission of omicron the cdc is strongly encouraging people to use n95s or kn95s instead of cloth the size of the particle it filters in an n95 is obviously way superior to a cloth mask gopalan said related how to know your mask is meeting cdc standards but since that recommendation prices for the masks have soared online on amazon medicpro n95 masks are going for 120 for a pack of 50 a pack of 10 or 20 from other manufacturers can cost 30 and up amazon a 50 pack of medicpro n95 masks on amazon com cost 120 related white house to give away 400 million n95 masks beginning next week some pharmacy websites don t even have the n95 or kn95 in stock jean tiwari said her son was able to find them online i just got it yesterday so i m going to start wearing it tiwari said starting next week the federal government plans to send 400 million n95s from a stockpile reserve to local pharmacies and community health centers for free distribution wptv jean tiwari says her family was recently able to procure some n95 masks we have to think about the other people around us if that is more effective then why can t we do that tiwari asked the cdc said cloth masks can still provide some protection as long as they are fitted the goal is to make sure you cover both your nose your mouth and there are no leaks and it fits against your side of the cheek perfectly well gopalan said the doctor said you can wear the n95 masks more than once as long as it s not soiled and you do not fold or crumble it he said it s not a good idea to hang the mask from a rearview mirror instead he advised putting it away in a paper bag for re use
as the world works to bring climate change under control there is a growing awareness of the negative ramifications of many forms of food production as a result some foodstuffs with smaller carbon footprints are gaining traction creating opportunities for emerging markets the production and consumption of food accounts for over 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions and more than 90 of freshwater consumption highlighting the importance of fostering food production systems that consume fewer resources and are more resilient to climate change appetite for change even before the covid 19 pandemic highlighted how fragile the world s supply chains are many leading global bodies had been calling for a major change in how food is grown processed and consumed several of the un sustainable development goals sdgs are related to food security most notably sdg 2 or zero hunger argues for a profound change of the global food and agriculture system through increasing agricultural productivity and sustainable food production more recently the cop26 un climate change conference in november saw the release of a joint statement underlining that socio economic and food security dimensions are critical when dealing with climate change in agriculture and food systems this reflects the growing realisation that consumers in both emerging and mature economies will need to make radical changes to their diets key to this will be the local production of crops and foodstuffs that have a limited carbon footprint but high nutritional value a range of alternative food products are garnering attention with three categories in particular standing out plant based meats edible insects and seaweed plant based meats as obg explored at the end of 2020 the pandemic significantly accelerated the growth of the global plant based meat industry this growth continued apace in 2021 by the end of that year statista estimated that the global market revenue of plant based meat was 7 7bn up from 6 7bn in 2020 and more than double the figure from 2016 by 2026 the industry is projected to generate 16 7bn in revenue while credit suisse forecasts that the broader market for alternative meat and dairy could reach 1 4trn by 2050 emerging markets are in some cases at the forefront of this growth in china for instance the government announced in 2016 that it aimed to halve domestic meat consumption by 2030 an initiative that is opening doors for alternative products meanwhile in thailand nr instant produce listed on the country s stock exchange in 2020 following success with its jackfruit derived faux pork product another region that is tipped to see a boom in plant based meat is latin america chile s notco the most prominent of a batch of homegrown latin american start ups among them brazil s fazenda futuron has become one of the leading food tech companies in the world bringing in 235m in series d financing in july while innovation in plant based meat has been well documented two other low carbon foodstuffs are also beginning to attract attention edible insects insects have long been used as a source of protein around the world in parts of mexico for example chapulines or grasshoppers are a popular snack while in israel locusts are eaten deep fried it is estimated that nearly 2m people regularly eat insects and that around 1trn individual insects are farmed annually for food and feed these numbers are growing the value of the global insect farming industry is expected to top 1 18bn by 2023 as with plant based meat the industry is characterised by considerable technological innovation in february last year canada s aspire food group began work on a 72m cricket farm the farm will be the world s largest fully automated edible cricket production plant deploying technologies such as robotics the internet of things and deep learning many of the crickets produced at the farm will find their way into a high protein powder to be used in energy bars marketed by their consumer brand exo insect farming also has significant potential in developing markets producing 1 kg of insect protein requires 10 of the water energy and space used to produce the equivalent quantity of beef while generating as little as 1 of the greenhouse gas it also allows for local production according to circular agricultural principles removing the need for the import of expensive feed components or complex technological equipment insect cultivation could also pay social dividends for example by empowering smallholder farmers in kenya the cultivation of the black soldier fly bsf for use as livestock feed in place of fishmeal resulted in robust livestock performance as well as higher return on investment due to lower production costs it also benefitted food security by reducing the need for imports similarly in thailand more than 20 000 family farms cultivate insects for food and feed this gives them a solid position in the country s agricultural value chain enhancing their collective bargaining power in colombia it has been suggested that subsidising bsf production could cut down on the illegal cultivation of coca leaves for cocaine production while also offering a route for former militants to reintegrate into society contributing to un sdg 16 peace justice and strong institutions seaweed another low carbon foodstuff that is emerging as an attractive agricultural solution to climate change is seaweed a term that covers a variety of sea vegetables ranging from algae to marine plants like insects seaweed has a long history of human consumption most notably in asia contains many nutrients and has a low environmental impact it is also relatively easy to produce as it does not require complex technology the industry is already well established with some 30m tonnes produced globally per year this is more than double the total recorded in 2005 according to the un food and agriculture organisation in an indication of the industry s growing prominence production is still overwhelmingly concentrated in asia however a number of businesses outside the region are exploring the potential of algae based food at the end of last year akua a us start up that produces kelp based products including kelp jerky and kelp burgers announced a 3 2m seed funding round bringing the company s total fundraising to date to 5 4m elsewhere canada s cascadia seaweed which operates offshore farms and a seed nursery is launching consumer food products a number of international bodies are also exploring how seaweed can be grown and processed in developing countries the seaweed solution project from the world wildlife fund wwf announced in mid 2020 explores how seaweed farming has the potential to revolutionise how we think about ocean health climate mitigation and food security the wwf believes that the global seaweed aquaculture industry could grow by 12 per year the fund has highlighted its potential for adoption among coastal communities particularly where fisheries have been exhausted or species have begun to migrate due to warming waters an example of this principle in action is kelp blue a dutch start up which aims to plant sweeping forests of kelp off the coast of namibia operations got under way in mid 2021 with kelp blue estimating that it will generate an additional 400 direct and 2000 indirect jobs as well as capture 200m 500m tonnes of co2 per year by 2050 meanwhile india s sea6 energy is focused on scaling up and mechanising tropical seaweed farming using its seacombine a fully mechanised harvesting and seeding catamaran as these and other projects suggest the vast potential of seaweed like that of edible insects has only begun to be tapped oxford business group copy 10

takeaways german technology and mid cap growth companies may find a combination with a u s spac appealing but must prepare to meet public capital market requirements arranging adequate pipe funding is crucial to the success of a de spac combination and german targets may be able to tap local institutions for support pipe shares and shares issued to the target shareholders at the time of the de spac combination cannot be traded until a new sec registration takes effect which can take several weeks though combining with a spac is often portrayed as a simpler alternative to an ipo for a public ready target cross border transactions are at least as expensive and time consuming the enormous sums raised in spac ipos in the u s and the competition to invest that capital during the spac s limited life are contributing to record m a activity in europe including germany although german equity capital markets are at all time highs institutional investors favor large cap companies for their liquidity and small and medium sized technology and growth companies are valued more cautiously in germany than in the u s increasingly they have been looking to access the u s capital markets and are therefore also open to offers from u s spacs which have been approaching multiple european ipo targets typically the buyers aim for valuations between 500 million and 1 billion for a discussion of the u s spac market see choppy market for spacs and pipes competition for targets spurs deal innovations a spac combination a so called de spac transaction is frequently viewed as a less risky and more efficient approach to access capital markets than an ipo however that is often not true especially when the target is european because implementing such combinations requires the european company to become u s capital markets ready pipe private investment in public equity financing must be arranged and complex holding company structures may need to be created below are legal and practical lessons learned from transactions involving german targets in 2021 establish a structured process to identify a suitable spac partner currently more than 450 u s spacs are pursuing an acquisition target before the end of 2022 or early 2023 not all combinations are suitable and potential german targets should define criteria and implement a structured selection process companies should consider buyers geographic or sector focuses as well as a spac s size pipe strategy and adviser team other important issues are the willingness of spac founders to invest in the pipe the availability and size of earnout warrant or share structures for the target s current shareholders as well as the quality of the spac s shareholder base as an indicator of potential redemption levels select an appropriate structure combining a u s spac with a german company poses challenging corporate law and governance issues because corporate law in germany imposes more technical requirements and is less flexible than in the u s or other european jurisdictions one solution is the so called double dummy structure where both the u s spac and the german operating company become subsidiaries of a newly established parent most often formed under dutch or luxembourg law which is closer to u s law nonetheless each de spac involving a german target is still bespoke and involves several restructuring steps mergers and capital increases in a number of jurisdictions in addition since american and german shareholders are subject to very different tax regimes a successful transaction requires careful tax planning from an early stage ideally the spac and the german target should share a common understanding of the fundamental deal structure before they enter into the letter of intent and agree to exclusivity prepare for a comprehensive and lengthy pipe process the additional capital from institutional investors provided by a pipe financing in connection with the combination is crucial to a successful de spac raising capital from third parties validates the valuation of the target and ensures that even if there is a high level of redemptions by the spac s shareholders there is adequate cash available to the target following the combination german targets can often draw on their local investor bases for the pipe even as international institutional investors have been scrutinizing pipes more carefully marketing efforts for the pipe take place prior to the signing of the merger agreement and remain confidential which is a key advantage versus an ipo but the target investor base for pipes is substantially the same as that for an ipo investors who would not participate in an ipo of the german target will most likely be equally hesitant to invest in the pipe for a de spac merger when de spac transactions involving german targets fail it is typically due to an unsuccessful pipe fundraising it is therefore vital for the spac and the target to develop a mutual understanding as early as possible ideally by the letter of intent stage regarding the best way to attract pipe investors focus on the capital market readiness of the german target ensuring that the private target is ready for the public equity markets is essential it must be able to comply with the auditing accounting and internal control standards for foreign private issuers including preparing financial statements in compliance with standards set by the u s public company accounting oversight board pcaob it must also implement and follow market standard internal control and compliance processes and establish risk management and governance structures in practice this means that it is necessary to perform thorough due diligence and prepare disclosure documents comparable to those required for a conventional ipo before the transaction is marketed to pipe investors and the american registration process commences if weaknesses in the company s processes and structures are first identified by pipe investors or regulators that could significantly delay the de spac transaction or result in its termination using the de spac to finance an acquisition is challenging at least one de spac transaction involving a german target has been used to finance a large cross border acquisition of another business when structuring such a transaction the parties need to prepare for the possibility that redemptions by initial spac shareholders could leave the company formed by the de spac with insufficient funds to pay the cash portion of the purchase price and meet the minimum cash condition for the combined entity if there is a risk of a cash shortfall it will be even more important to execute a successful pipe transaction as further protection the m a buyers should build in flexible consideration options so they can substitute additional equity for cash consideration depending on the available cash at the de spac closing the target and the spac may also seek irrevocable voting agreements from significant spac shareholders committing them to support the de spac transaction and not exercise their redemption rights shareholders of the target may also be called on to provide an additional pipe commitment in the event of high redemption levels properly structured these arrangements can backstop and de risk the transaction the combination of the completion of a de spac and a large acquisition raises complex financial history issues and may require pro forma financials further complicating the transaction close cooperation is needed among the auditors of the spac the german spac target and the m a target of the german spac target to take into account potentially different fiscal years applicable auditing standards and other complexities since the de spac requires registration with the securities and exchange commission sec any such m a documentation by the german spac target should provide for a flexible closing date and the m a parties should stay away from unrealistic long stop drop dead deadlines these transactions inevitably are costly and time consuming a combination between a u s spac and a german target is generally more complex structurally and more document intensive than the conventional u s ipo process in most cases it will require at least five or six months to implement depending on the time required for the german target to prepare pcaob level audited financials assuming it qualifies as an fpi and to ensure the german target s internal systems are ready for the u s public markets as well as the corporate restructuring merger and capital increases required to incorporate a typically utilized dutch or luxembourg holding company the de spac of a german target can also take nine or 12 months consequently the transaction costs for the german spac target will likely far exceed those for a traditional u s stock exchange listing if the de spac by the german target coincides with a simultaneously executed m a transaction by it the overall transaction costs will run even higher share trading remains restricted after completion of the de spac unlike in a typical non u s de spac merger or ipo the new shares issued in connection with the spac merger to existing shareholders of the german target and new pipe shareholders of the combined entity remain restricted by u s law at de spac closing because they are not included on the registration statement on form f 4 for the de spac merger in order for such shares to become publicly tradeable they must first be registered with the sec on a registration statement on form f 1 for an fpi which registration typically takes place within 30 days of the de spac closing and depending on the extent of sec review can take a few weeks to become effective the public trading restriction applies to all newly issued shares to german target shareholders and new pipe shareholders in addition the existing shareholders of the german target typically have a six month lockup with some limited exceptions german companies and investors may not be familiar with the required additional sec registration process and the delay in the ability to publicly trade so the legal constraints restrictive implications should be explained well in advance of the de spac closing

ganeshan wignaraja a non resident senior fellow at the institute of south asian studies isas of the national university of singapore and a senior research associate at the overseas development institute odi in london explains that sri lanka is now stuck in a debt trap however the debt trap is not wholly chinese to mark the 65th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations chinese foreign minister wang yi met with president gotabaya rajapaksa in sri lanka on 10 january 2022 the meeting occurred amidst the rapid global transmission of the omicron virus talk of sri lanka defaulting on its foreign debt repayments and an economic slowdown in china whether china will bail out debt ridden sri lanka or sri lanka should seek imf assistance are pressing policy questions sri lanka had visible macroeconomic imbalances before the covid 19 pandemic as indicated by slowing growth considerable fiscal and balance of payments deficits and high external debt the pandemic and strict containment measures caused an unprecedented economic contraction with negative growth of 3 6 in 2020 subsequently a half a million people in urban areas and the informal sector were added to the world s new poor despite the pandemic s toll an economic revival during the first nine months of 2021 suggests 3 4 growth for the year but growth in 2022 could be lower as the economy faces many downside risks like the spreading omicron virus worsening foreign debt rising inflation social tensions and waning business confidence a steeply rising fiscal deficit meant that the external debt problem deteriorated during the pandemic the government scrambled to implement measures to mitigate the contraction at the same time tax revenue fell to historic lows due to reduced activity in major commercial sectors job losses and previous income tax cuts as a result foreign debt levels totaled more than 35 billion in april 2021 moreover sri lanka s foreign exchange reserves which back the next five years of annual debt repayments of 4 5 billion are dangerously low furthermore sri lanka has lost access to international bond markets as rating agencies concerned about sir lanka s ability to service its debt have downgraded its sovereign ratings to historic lows the debt problem results from populist spending policies the costs of a thirty year civil conflict a transition from grant aid to foreign commercial borrowing and a notable currency depreciation china and sri lanka have enjoyed warm diplomatic ties since sri lanka first recognized china in 1950 supporting china s accession to the united nations and signing a rubber rice barter deal in 1952 more recently china s global ascent has moved its diplomatic relations with sri lanka in a more commercial direction the chinese debt trap remains controversial since the early 2000s china has become a leading provider of commercial loans to sri lanka for infrastructure projects including the hambantota port there are claims that by accepting such loans sri lanka is now stuck in a debt trap however the debt trap is not wholly chinese about half of sri lanka s foreign debt was owed to capital markets while china accounted for about 10 percent in april 2021 in january during the high level talks sri lanka reportedly requested that china restructure its debt repayments and award it a 1 billion concessionary credit facility for imports sri lanka s request has created a dilemma for china china does not want to lose sri lanka s friendship or the commercial opportunities accompanying it however china worries that unilaterally granting sri lanka moratoria or debt restructuring would create a new precedent in its lending practices it does not want to end up in similar negotiations with other distressed developing countries that have received large amounts of chinese loans moreover an economic powerhouse like china may not want to be associated with a floundering economy thus it is unclear whether china will agree to sri lanka s request the united states has also tried to assist sri lanka with mixed success in april 2019 a sizeable outright grant of 480 million over five years was offered to the government by the millennium challenge corporation mcc compact for infrastructure development however indecision and delays by the government partly led the mcc board to withdraw the offer in december 2020 since the start of the pandemic the united states has provided medical and humanitarian aid on a grant basis most notably 3 4 million doses of the effective pfizer vaccines for booster shots which are welcome in sri lanka the government has ruled out going to the imf for assistance due to worries that the austerity policies the imf demands a floating exchange rate higher taxes public expenditure cuts and the removal of subsidies for food or fuel would be politically unpopular but the advantages of imf assistance such as a low interest loan to bail out sri lanka the ability to borrow from international capital markets once again and the benefit of imf financial advice seem to have been underplayed instead the government has opted for a raft of home grown remedies including an expansionary monetary policy import restrictions exchange controls leasing of state land to investors and a tourism and export push unfortunately the limits of these policies are showing up in shortages of consumer goods and raw materials rising inflation a dollar shortage capital flight strikes and falling business confidence no one imagined that economic management was easy but it is harder than usual during a pandemic induced crisis sri lanka must undertake three urgent actions to address its economic woes first a national conference involving major political parties should be convened to forge a political consensus on the scale of the economic crisis and its policy implications second a team of domestic experts should be tasked with developing a comprehensive structural reform program to stabilize deregulate and green the economy reforms should also strive to mitigate the hardship of the crisis on the citizens to this end drawing on existing work by think tanks can be helpful can be helpful third sri lanka should start talks with the imf on a program of debt restructuring and financial assistance there is a mounting risk that time is running out to deal with these challenges in an orderly manner a disorderly default on foreign debt payments could hurt the economy for many years rather than entertaining a bilateral approach to rescuing sri lanka china can usefully add its powerful voice to calls for sri lanka to seek imf assistance and channel technical assistance funds through the world bank to support work on a structural reform program the united states should continue medical and humanitarian aid to sri lanka which directly benefits the population and expand support for private sector development and exports

get more realistic about the way the world is going to look going forward he said the labor department gave wall street a disappointing update on the labor market with its weekly unemployment report the number of americans applying for unemployment benefits rose to the highest level in three months as the fast spreading omicron variant continued to disrupt the job market the job market has had a rocky recovery from the virus pandemic the unemployment rate fell last month to a pandemic low 3 9 employment data was also closely watched by investors trying to gauge how it would effect the federal reserve s decision to ease up on support for the markets and economy the central bank made it clear early in the pandemic that it was basing much of its support on how quickly employment recovers the fed is now expected to raise interest rates earlier and more often in order to fight rising inflation that threatens to derail a further economic recovery supply chain problems and higher raw materials costs have prompted businesses to raise prices on finished goods and economists are concerned that consumers will eventually grow tired of paying higher prices and cut their spending companies are reminding investors that supply chain problems are still weighing on operations recent inflation reports have been worrisome while economic data on retail sales has also disappointed these are all the things that are justifying some of the sloppiness we re starting the year with hackett said the latest round of corporate earnings is also giving investors a clearer picture of where

the conservative leaning us supreme court dealt another blow today to opponents of a texas law that bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy the court in a 6 3 decision rejected a request by abortion providers to have the case sent to a district judge who had previously moved to block the texas law instead the case will remain with the conservative 5th circuit court of appeals the majority did not provide any comment on their decision but the three liberal justices on the nation s highest court penned a scathing dissent today for the fourth time this court declines to protect pregnant texans from egregious violations of their constitutional rights justice sonia sotomayor said this case is a disaster for the rule of law and a grave disservice to women in texas who have a right to control their own bodies sotomayor said i will not stand by silently as a state continues to nullify this constitutional guarantee the texas law which went into force on 1 september bans abortion after six weeks when a heartbeat in the womb can be detected but before many women even know they are pregnant it is the most restrictive abortion law passed in the united states since the procedure was guaranteed as a constitutional right nearly five decades ago advertisement laws severely restricting abortion have been passed in multiple republican led states but have been struck down by the courts for violating roe v wade which guaranteed a woman s right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb typically around 22 to 24 weeks texas senate bill 8 sb8 differs from other efforts in that it attempts to insulate the state from claims of rights violations by giving members of the public the ability to sue doctors who perform abortions or anyone who helps facilitate them once a heartbeat in the womb is detected they can be rewarded with 10 000 for initiating civil suits that land in court prompting criticism that the state is encouraging people to take the law into their own hands many clinics in texas fearful of potentially ruinous lawsuits have closed their doors mississippi case the supreme court has declined to rule on the constitutionality of the texas law but indicated in another abortion case that it may be inclined to overturn roe v wade the supreme court heard oral arguments on 1 december about a mississippi law that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks and the court s conservative wing which includes three justices nominated by donald trump appeared ready to uphold the law and perhaps even go further and overturn roe the court is to render a decision in the mississippi case by june public opinion polls have found most americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases but a segment of the population particularly on the religious right has never accepted the roe v wade ruling and has campaigned to have it overturned afp 2022

the year 2021 was again wrought with challenges and uncertainties but our teams were able to navigate the difficult environment to support our clients contribute to our communities and deliver for our shareholders i want to thank our team for their hard work dedication and commitment as you ll hear today we accomplished a lot even as the pandemic continued to impact the operations of our clients and of our company our team is capable and understands the assignment when it comes to meeting the challenge from the unexpected and anticipating opportunities with and for our clients our strong fourth quarter and year end report is an absolute testament to your talents and passions for the inspired and purpose driven work we do that enables people to achieve their full potential what you ll see today is a story of execution and follow through of doing what we said we could and would do and in many areas doing even more as we began 2021 we focused on five core business objectives number one to regain growth momentum two to enhance the client experience by making it even easier to do business with synovus number three to provide seamless delivery of our solutions across all of our lines of business leading to a deeper wallet share and client relationships four to better leverage analytics in order to provide more informed and proactive advice and five the development and attraction of talent to support our growth initiatives we have made significant progress in all five core areas and our success in 2021 was largely driven by our execution of these business objectives moving to slide 3 let s review the year our lines of business succeeded in delivering core performance via a solid loan deposit and fee income growth while client loan demand was muted in the first half of 2021 in the second half we saw double digit broad based commercial loan growth driven primarily by our wholesale bank with all 10 wholesale sub lines of business posting growth for the year 2021 funded commercial loan production increased 50 versus 2020 and was up 40 versus 2019 with significant productivity gains across our community and wholesale teams we expect this momentum to continue into 2022 given the pipelines and activities of our bankers as well as the incremental growth that will be provided by our key 2021 investments and talent in the middle market restaurant services and corporate and investment banking teams deposit growth was driven by continued balance augmentation as well as an ongoing sales focus on core operating accounts as a result core transaction balances have increased 57 in the past two years we have strategically allowed higher cost lower value deposits to attrite with an overarching goal of remixing our funding profile to optimize lower cost deposit composition during this period of excess liquidity at year end 77 of total deposits were core transaction deposits versus 70 at year end 2020 ex security gains non interest revenues grew 5 led by increases in core banking fees and income from various wealth businesses this was the seventh consecutive quarter of increases in wealth fees drivers of this growth include a strong equity market as well as net new assets under management from client growth including the onboarding of 12 new family office clients during the year in 2021 we continue to make significant progress with synovus forward initiatives as of year end we have achieved 110 million in pre tax run rate benefit ahead of our original projections evidence of success includes reducing real estate expenses lowering headcount and a reduction of third party spending all of which resulted in adjusted 2021 expenses being flat versus 2020 the synovus forward savings allowed us to make strategic and impactful investments in every area while managing overall expenses this year we will transition our synovus forward efforts into our overall strategic plan but remain committed and on pace to achieve the 175 million synovus forward target as part of our focus on innovation we launched several new digital solutions and services including enhanced deposit online account origination accelerate ar our integrated receivables suite and gateway our commercial banking digital platform these investments have enhanced capabilities and functionality and are leading to a better overall client experience we also implemented the smart commercial analytics tool that is giving our bankers better insights into solutions our client s needs early warning on client attrition and proactive risk monitoring in 2021 we also invested in people in particular those who have experience and expertise to expand our advisory services and to build strong relationship value we grew our treasury and payments team which had another record breaking year growing sales by almost 40 and adding to specialty banking our middle market talent and our high growth central and west florida regions we also continued to emphasize the development of our existing team members through the launch of two new leadership development tracks for emerging and senior leaders despite the challenges associated with the pandemic our recent voice of the team member survey indicated that 84 of our team members were actively engaged which is top quartile relative to the financial services benchmark and we have designated a great place to work by the great place to work institute we also have made measured progress in our diversity equity and inclusion efforts by meeting our short term ethnicity and gender based goals and the leadership ranks in 2021 so overall a productive and rewarding year and one that carries a tremendous amount of momentum into 2022 now let me shift the highlights from the fourth quarter let s start on slide 4 with loan growth which increased 1 4 billion or an annualized 14 excluding p3 the growth this quarter resulted from our second consecutive quarter of record funded commercial loan production at 3 2 billion this represented a 30 increase from the third quarter the quality of growth as measured by risk ratings and underwriting metrics is consistent with the existing portfolio which continues to perform well and is supported by the reversal of credit losses of 55 million this quarter it s a similar story on the other side of the balance sheet with core transaction deposit growth of 1 3 billion or 4 versus the third quarter approximately 30 of this quarter s increase came from non interest bearing deposits the combination of balance augmentation and new account origination continues to be the drivers of growth net interest income growth was also strong this quarter as we delivered 1 7 billion in earning asset growth net interest income increased by 16 million from the third quarter or 4 excluding the reduction in p 3 fees the net interest margin declined five basis points in the quarter largely due to lower p3 income but the nim before ppp fees actually increased one basis point as earning asset yields were fairly stable and we continue to lower deposit rates during the quarter from a fee income perspective we continue to be pleased with overall performance as the fourth quarter totaled 117 million core banking fees have returned and exceeded pre pandemic levels in the fourth quarter as card and cash management income have more than offset reductions and nsf income and our core strategic segments such as wealth management continue to generate growth through aum expansion diluted earnings per share were 1 31 or 1 35 on an adjusted basis and increased from 0 96 or 1 08 adjusted per share from the same period in 2020 during the fourth quarter we successfully completed our capital plan with 33 million of share repurchases for the full year we balanced core client loan growth a common dividend and 200 million in share repurchases to achieve our target cet1 ratio of 9 5 at year end which represents the middle of our operating range target for the upcoming year jamie will now share greater detail on the key initiatives and financial results for the quarter jamie gregory chief financial officer thank you kevin i ll begin on slide 5 we ended the year with total assets of 57 3 billion and loans of 39 3 billion in the fourth quarter total loans excluding ppp balances were up 1 4 billion or 4 from the prior quarter bolstered by strong commercial loan growth the commercial growth was broad based across businesses asset classes and markets and included robust production in several of our key business lines such as structured finance senior housing national accounts and commercial banking the positive momentum was also evident in cre driven by healthy industry fundamentals in our footprint we achieved this growth while adhering to our prudent underwriting standards and disciplined approach to portfolio management benefits from strategic growth initiatives are being realized and we re excited about the potential of the corporate and investment banking team being led by tom deardorf an industry veteran who joined the team in november growth momentum in q4 was also supported by reduced pay offs and increased c i line utilization which increased approximately 340 basis points to 43 this is the first quarter where we have seen clear evidence of inflection toward increased utilization we also saw continued growth in commitments up 4 4 or 512 million which positions us well for economic expansion particularly in the southeast where growth is expected to exceed national averages a continued normalization of c i line utilization on today s balance sheet would result in over 350 million in funding balances which should occur over time as liquidity subsides within our core consumer portfolio the trend remains somewhat mixed with growth in card and other consumer products is more than offset by continued declines in the mortgage in aggregate core consumer balances declined by 20 million in the quarter looking outside of our core lending activities we did see a modest decline in our third party portfolio in q4 as purchases were more than offset by elevated pay down activity additionally our securities portfolio ended the quarter at 11 billion up 400 million from the prior quarter though that growth generally dragged out of the overall balance sheet and remained at 19 of total assets these portfolios will remain central to our overall balance sheet management efforts and we ll continue to leverage both as a means to manage our capital and our liquidity positions slide 6 highlights the deposit trends for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2021 as you can see it was another very strong year for growth led by core transaction account balances which were up 1 3 billion or 4 in the fourth quarter and up 5 1 billion or 16 for the full year notably the majority of the growth for the year was in non interest bearing deposits while we ve seen continued strategic declines in time deposits for q4 our total cost of deposits continued to decline to 12 basis points which was down one basis point from the third quarter the fourth quarter also experienced seasonal inflows related to public funds while broker deposits were relatively stable both of these portfolios experienced declines versus one year ago and we expect further declines in the first quarter as seasonal balances normalize and as we further reduce broker balances in the first quarter we expect broker deposits to decline by approximately 1 billion to 1 5 billion as we efficiently manage our significant liquidity position slide 7 shows a total net interest income of 392 million in the fourth quarter or 380 million excluding the impact of the paycheck protection program nii growth largely resulted from strong earning asset growth which began late in the third quarter and continued through the fourth quarter the net interest margin for the fourth quarter ended at 2 96 a decline of five basis points from the prior quarter as expected the wind down of the paycheck protection program is serving as a notable nii headwind excluding the impact of ppp the margin was stable in the quarter our portfolio remains asset sensitive and stands to benefit from increases in rates across the yield curve to that end i would note that much of the loan production we saw in the second half of 2021 was variable rates the portion of our portfolio that is floating rate now stands at 58 which helps to support our nii sensitivity estimated at an increase of 6 5 for a 1 immediate increase in rates adjusted noninterest revenue of 116 million is highlighted on slide 8 up 2 million from the prior quarter this includes a one time 8 million increase of boli income that offsets a 4 million reduction in mortgage income wealth management continues to see an increase in fee revenue and assets under management recording its seventh consecutive quarter of growth this growth is driven by continued strong client acquisition and asset inflows from a capital markets perspective we recorded another strong quarter despite overcoming headwinds from a large one time arranger fee in the third quarter that was not expected to repeat as our commercial segments continue their robust growth we should expect to see continued strength from arranger fees and swap income that will drive this line item on a full year basis nir excluding security gains increased 5 despite headwinds driven by the normalization of mortgage revenues drivers of this growth included wealth management and core banking fees which increased 24 and 20 year over year respectively within core banking fees commercial cash management revenue increased 10 million or 34 year over year this growth represents the momentum within our commercial segment including the deep depository relationships we have with our core customers slide 9 highlights a total adjusted non interest expense of 286 million up 19 million from the prior quarter this change included both recurring expense increases and other notable expenses that we do not believe will repeat in future quarters recurring expense increases totaled 9 million and were driven by several factors including growth initiatives related to synovus forward investments in tech and risk infrastructure additional fdic expenses and expenses related to normalized travel and entertainment spending other notable expense increases total 10 million and consisted of 4 million of incremental performance based management bonuses a 4 million seed gift into a newly established donor advised fund and a 2 million increase in health insurance expense driven by seasonal and pandemic related factors in spite of an elevated quarter of expenses we were able to manage the flat year over year adjusted expenses resulting in positive operating leverage in 2021 benefits from the successful implementation of other foreign initiatives can be seen in comparison to key areas from 2020 to 2021 particularly in base salaries third party spending and real estate spending these reductions have helped lay the groundwork for future strategic growth initiatives the credit metrics on slide 10 show continuing improvement in all key categories the net charge off ratio fell 11 basis points to 0 11 while criticizing classified loans declined 16 the npa ratio declined five basis points to 0 4 and the npl ratio declined eight basis points to 0 33 past dues dropped one basis point to 0 14 excluding the increase from paycheck protection program loans there was a reversal of provision for credit losses a 55 million in the fourth quarter as further improvement in the economic outlook was partially offset by significant loan growth the acl ratio excluding ppp loans declined 21 basis points to 1 21 on slide 11 is a recap of our capital management efforts through 2021 in the fourth quarter we executed the remaining 33 million of our 2021 authorization and in doing so we ended the quarter with our cet1 ratio at 9 5 for the year we retired 4 4 million shares or approximately 3 of the common shares outstanding from the end of the prior year our ongoing capital management efforts have helped maintain strong and stable capital ratios which along with core ppnr positions us well for continued balance sheet growth in 2022 for 2022 our capital plan continues the prioritization of capital for client growth while returning an appropriate amount to our shareholders in the form of a dividend that includes an increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend by 0 1 to 0 34 which would first be payable in april while our two 2022 plan also includes an authorization for up to 300 million in share repurchases are capital priorities our focus is on supporting core client growth and managing our cet1 ratio around the target level of 9 5 as we look ahead we believe this focus on maintaining a strong capital position and prioritizing core growth is not only in the best interest of our shareholders but also our clients our communities and our broader set of stakeholders i ll turn it back to kevin for greater detail that includes our 2022 outlook kevin blair president and chief executive officer thanks jamie excluding the impact of 400 million in remaining p3 balances we expect loan growth of 4 to 7 in 2022 this growth assumes continued strong production in commercial lending some curtailment of prepayment activity particularly in the cre portfolio and relatively stable line utilization the adjusted revenue outlook of 4 to 7 largely aligns with the current rate expectations assuming three fomc rate hikes and excludes the impact of p3 related revenue overall fee income growth will be muted due to the industrywide reduction in secondary mortgage revenue however we expect continued growth in strategic fee categories including core banking fees and wealth management our adjusted expense outlook of 2 to 5 incorporates increases in compensation a return to pre pandemic travel and business development levels and includes our strategic investments in talent and technology xp3 we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage in 2022 while building out the bank of the future benefits from synovus forward initiatives will continue to offset increased inflationary pressures and will remain disciplined and agile in terms of managing expense growth throughout the year one significant efficiency initiative that is underway is the closing of an additional 15 of our branch locations with an estimated run rate savings of approximately 12 million by year end moving to capital as jamie shared earlier we extended the upper range of our targeted cet1 ratio by 25 basis points providing a new range of 9 25 to 9 75 this range will continue to support our strategic growth objectives while maintaining more than adequate protection against significant adverse conditions if they were to arise and in the terms of capital core relationship growth remains our top priority for capital deployment while whole bank m a is not a priority we believe these expectations for 2022 support our continued progress toward becoming a sustained top quartile performer we have a tremendous amount of momentum in our core businesses and the team is performing at a very high level given the heightened levels of inflation it appears the interest rate environment will serve as a tailwind in 2022 as we continue to position the balance sheet for asset sensitivity we also believe that our strategic investments will begin to drive top line growth during the year we are making good progress on the build out of our banking as a service product called mast and are seeing strong talent pipelines for the corporate and investment banking build out for all of these reasons my confidence in delivering on our 2022 business and financial objectives is very high and i know our team is poised and ready to win operator we re now ready to begin q a questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from steven alexopoulos from j p morgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst hi good morning everyone kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning steve steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst wanted to start so on slide 5 the 30 increase in production is almost off the charts when you look at a chart could you give me more color on the increase was a tie to existing customers getting more active or were these share gains coming through in the quarter kevin blair president and chief executive officer yes steven it s a little bit of both and when you look at the 30 you can look at it both a significant increase in cre and when you look at the asset classes that we were able to increase production it led to growth in eight sub asset classes so we saw growth in warehouses we saw growth in the hospitality shopping senior housing and so it was really across the board now in terms of new clients versus the existing book came from both so we continue to take share from other competitors at the same time we have seen our existing clients become a little more active from a demand standpoint similar story on the c i side with strong growth there as well and if you look at it from a macs code perspective you would see that five of the macs codes that we cover grew greater than 100 million so very broad based again new clients as well as existing customers line utilization actually increased about 230 million during the quarter in c i so it was about two percentage points and obviously that would have largely come from existing clients steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst ok that s helpful color and then to follow up so if we look at the outlook for 47 loan growth in 2022 without ppp i see you re calling for line utilization to hold about flat but prepayment activity to normalize so help me understand if the improved outlook for 2022 is tied to increased expectations for new clients or onboarding or is this because you think prepayment levels are going to decline quite a bit in 2022 kevin blair president and chief executive officer more the former so as we look out into our forecast and our pipelines we think production levels will remain elevated as we onboard some of our new team members that will add additional incremental production to what we re already doing so it s much more of a production story i think when you start breaking down the balance sheet next year just look at the commercial side we think we can grow mid to high single digit commercial loan growth next year we re keeping the third party consumer portfolio flat and the core consumer portfolio may shrink a little bit just based on some of the churns that are happening there so we mentioned the pay off activity because the last two quarters we ve seen about 2 billion of pay off activity we generally have averaged over the last nine quarters about 1 5 billion so it was elevated by about 0 5 billion we think over the year that will continue to decline we saw a lot of activity especially on the cre front given lower cap rates so we think that will subside but the bigger driver around loan growth in the mid to high single digit commercial loan growth is around production steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst it s production ok that s really helpful maybe kevin if i could squeeze one more in so you covered a lot in terms of what the company accomplished this year and i know investor day actually 2021 but investor day is around the corner from a revenue perspective maybe give us a bit of a teaser on investor day like what initiatives are you most excited about for 2022 on the revenue side thanks kevin blair president and chief executive officer well look i think obviously the asset sensitivity that we re putting ourselves in a position to be able to drive nii but from a revenue standpoint the initiatives i ll start with mast we ve talked a lot about how the industry is changing especially around small businesses i think that mast is going to give us a platform to provide the software providers a very flexible configurable brandeable embedded finance platform and as we ve talked with those software vendors they haven t had an offering that combines both banking as a service platform with payments as a service platform so when we look at the uniqueness of what we re providing in the timing to be able to roll out our pilot in the second quarter i think it has a tremendous opportunity to start to drive revenue next year now jamie mentioned in his comments that we are planning to invest in 2022 and that s about 25 million worth of expense we think even those initiatives will be able to record revenues that cover almost 20 million of revenue during the year so we re not looking for large paybacks but the benefit of those new initiatives will continue to build through 2022 into 2023 the second i would mention is just our corporate and investment bank we ve made great progress in just the short 50 days that tom deardorf has been with us he is building pipelines and already starting to line up talent we expect to onboard as many as 15 team members in the second quarter of this year and those individuals will hit the ground running and also start to provide revenue steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst ok terrific thanks for taking my questions kevin blair president and chief executive officer thank you steven operator our next question comes from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead michael rose raymond james analyst hey good morning guys how are you kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning well michael rose raymond james analyst good so obviously the outlook includes some rate hikes here just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about further build in the securities portfolio assuming we do get those rates and just remind us again where the comfort level is with the size of that portfolio thanks jamie gregory chief financial officer yeah michael that s a great question as we look forward to 2022 we do expect to build or grow the securities portfolio on the margin we re at 19 of assets today and we could see getting up to 20 but we re going to be very prudent in that and really it s a reaction to all the other movements on the balance sheet as kevin mentioned we re forecasting strong client loan growth we expect that to continue we expect deposit growth to allow us to continue to look at the mix of deposits but all of those considerations play together but in our base case forecast we do expect some marginal growth in the portfolio michael rose raymond james analyst ok that s helpful and then just back to loans so the range is somewhat wide which is understandable can you just help us appreciate what factors would drive you toward the upper end versus the lower end i assume it s a combination of pay offs and pay downs and utilization assumptions and things like that but if you can put a finer point on it i d appreciate it thanks kevin blair president and chief executive officer yeah michael i think you nailed it i think we feel very confident in the production levels and we re going into 2022 assuming it s going to be a very constructive economic environment obviously there are challenges still in front of us as it relates to the supply chain and potentially we don t know the impact of any other pandemic influences and so we kept the range a little wider i think we were being conservative knowing that there are some things there that continue to present some challenges and more importantly i would tell you that we kept the third parties at zero and that this year represented significant growth and if we see the same liquidity positioning that we have we had in 2021 we also know that can flex up and we haven t assumed that in the forecast but it s more so just some of the unknown variables that we kept the range that wide but we re very confident as i mentioned and the commercial lending side we saw tremendous momentum in the fourth quarter and we think that s going to carry over into the first quarter throughout this year michael rose raymond james analyst very helpful and if i could just squeeze one last thing you mentioned the 300 authorization but don t get the sense that you guys are going to be really active with the buyback this year obviously given some of the investments that you re making is that the right way to think about it thanks jamie gregory chief financial officer that is the right way to think about it i think the fourth quarter is a really good example of how we plan to deploy capital if the environment remains as we expect in 2022 if you look at our capital generation ppnr capital generation of 46 basis points and then you net out the dividend you have an accretion in the mid 30s and that s exactly what we deployed to risk weighted assets to core client loan growth in the fourth quarter now that s a pretty high growth rate but that s the context of how we will look to manage it is to deploy the capital we generate through earnings to our clients on the balance sheet and then we will use share repurchases as a toggle on the back end to manage our capital cet1 ratios to the target michael rose raymond james analyst very helpful thanks for taking my questions thanks jamie gregory chief financial officer thank you michael operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning jamie gregory chief financial officer good morning ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst i guess just on loan growth maybe it s just me but in a world where like nominal gdp is going to be maybe 7 8 in 2022 things are reopening shouldn t loan growth be much stronger given all the investments you made given the franchise exposure to atlanta florida just talk to us in terms of upside risks and also if you could remind us what normalization and line utilization imply for loan balances i know it s not baked into your forecast but it will be a good number to have in terms of what loan balances could look like if things actually normalize kevin blair president and chief executive officer ebrahim i ll start with that with the slight increase that we saw in the fourth quarter if things normalize back into that mid 40 range we re talking about another 500 million plus in outstandings and we re not including that in our forecast so back to your point in terms of if we saw 7 gdp growth i think you would see line utilization increase and again not included in our assumptions we went into our forecasting for next year assuming gdp in the 3 to 4 range and we think that if the economy is stronger than that obviously to your point there could be an upside i just mentioned that there s an upside if we decide to deploy additional capital and liquidity into the third party partnership loans and our bankers have continued to produce at a higher level than we thought so the real driver there is the productivity level of our bankers and you re right we have markets that are performing very well atlanta continues to perform very well and we re bringing on new talent in florida in our corporate and investment banking world and so the faster that those individuals on board additional talent and we built a budget for that the faster the loan growth will come and so there are a lot of variables we wanted to see and forecast what we see in front of us based on the economic forecast that we have and based on the team members and the expectations for those folks but obviously there s an opportunity to outperform if we hit on all those cylinders ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst so that s helpful kevin thank you and just on a separate question i see your adjusted revenue guidance but if we can just unpack on the fee revenue outlook obviously building out the corporate investment bank give us a sense of the puts and takes on fee revenue or is that going to outperform underperform that adjusted revenue guidance and what the puts and takes are jamie gregory chief financial officer yeah ibrahim as we look forward into 2022 on the on fee revenue we do expect fee revenue to be down year over year and the reason for that is there are headwinds in the mortgage as you look at the normalization of the mortgage and you still have those strong quarters in early 2021 so we expect mortgage revenue to be down higher interest rates will impact production there but then we also had benefits in fee revenue in both boli income as well as equity gains in 2021 that we re not expecting to recur in 2022 so those are more environmental headwinds but i wouldn t i don t want that to take away from the broad based growth that we expect to see in really every other line item outside of nsf as we look forward into 2022 i mean our core banking fees the deposit service charge card fees we re expecting broad based growth across the board outside of those both unique to 2021 headwinds and the mortgage normalization ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and if i can just sneak in one follow up on the investment bank buildout i m assuming you have some of the safe for investor day but just give us a sense of the ramp up in terms of hiring that you re doing right now and are there any certain verticals that you re particularly focused on as you build that out jamie gregory chief financial officer yeah ibrahim so we are focusing on three initial verticals tech and media communications healthcare and financial institutions group and one of the things that we ve asked tom to do is to time this such that as the time of the year we re not recruiting people to come in today we re waiting for them to finish out their year and receive their bonus payments from their previous institution and so you would expect to see probably as i said 15 folks join us in the second quarter maybe even early third quarter from a timing standpoint and so we re looking for teams of individuals to fit those specific industry verticals and to your point on fee income i think what you re going to see in the beginning is a lot of coverage banking so you re going to see the traditional lending capabilities with our syndicated finance opportunity to offload some of those outstanding and you re going to see the depository and treasury business first now over time we ll continue to build out some of the capital market solutions that those size clients need and so it would be an increased debt capital markets capability it may be things like securitizations but originally these guys are going to focus on just the coverage banking side so you ll see it more on the nii side than you ll see on the fee income side to begin with got it and i assume that some of this hiring is baked into your expense guide for the year that you provided it all is and so as i mentioned earlier we have included about 25 million for all of our investments in the 2022 expense guidance and that includes things like cib it includes mast but it also includes building out our middle market teams in florida so the guidance that we provided would be inclusive of all of those investments as i mentioned earlier we think that 25 million could generate as much as 20 million of revenue next year so you can see it s a fairly quick payback period when we make those investments ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you operator the next question comes from brad milsaps from piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps piper sandler analyst hey good morning kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning brad brad milsaps piper sandler analyst thanks for taking my questions jamie i was just curious if you could offer maybe a little more color around just how asset sensitive you are i know you give the interest rate table in the deck but i was curious if you could maybe define just maybe in basis points kind of what you feel like each rate increase would have in terms of impacting the nim and how much are rates apart i know you have three in there but maybe on a percentage basis what percentage is that of your revenue guidance in 2022 that would be related to rates jamie gregory chief financial officer yeah so first off as you can look at our core balance sheet and you look at the ratio of floating rate loans to total loans you can see that increasing over time so our native asset sensitivity is increasing and we re pleased with that gives our outlook for interest rates further the exposure relative exposure to the front in the curve will increase as long term rates increase and premium amortization declines so you ll see that happening as we have these increases and longer term interest rates that we re seeing but as of the year end that s what our metrics are in the earnings deck our relative exposure between the short and the long in the curve was relatively balanced when you assume 35 beta and that s ours through the cycle estimate that s embedded in our nii sensitivity tables but we believe it s likely depending on the velocity and the magnitude of rate moves that the deposit data is lower in the initial stages of a fed tightening cycle and so if you were to isolate that sensitivity to the front end of the curve and hold the back end of the curve constant and use a 20 beta for example and that s what s consistent with our revenue guidance we would expect the margin to expand approximately three basis points in the first rate move and four basis points thereafter and to your question around the total impact as far as our guidance of 4 to 7 revenue growth our expectations for rate moves are april august december so obviously december does not have much of an impact for this year but you can think about the partial year impact of april and august which is less than 1 of that total revenue brad milsaps piper sandler analyst great thank you and then just as my follow up just on the credit side of the equation you guys were around 21 basis points of charge offs for the year i think that s pretty well in line with your 20 to 25 any change in the way you re thinking about that in 2022 and i mean it looks like you ve kind of exhausted most of your ability to take down the reserve but just any comments around that would be helpful as well jamie gregory chief financial officer no changes in our outlook medium term outlook for charge offs you re right the low 20s area is a good baseline as we look forward to 2022 with regards to the allowance and our life of loan estimates in our cecl calculations if the economic outlook continues to improve and uncertainty declines in the outlook then we do still expect to see the acl to loan ratio to decline to approximately the day one levels for us that was 1 06 obviously the loan makes it a little bit different today than it was back a couple of years ago but we do believe that day one levels are an appropriate outlook for the medium term brad milsaps piper sandler analyst great thank you jamie gregory chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from jennifer demba from truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba truist securities analyst thanks good morning back to the topic kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning jennifer demba truist securities analyst back to the topic of cib kevin how much loan and fee income growth do you think this can represent or synovus over the next few years can you kind of size the opportunity for us kevin blair president and chief executive officer yeah yeah jennifer i think what we ve said is that we think in the first three years this can contribute upwards of 3 billion of loans from a commitment standpoint but all of that is predicated on the fact that we recruit the teams that we re targeting and we bring them in within the timeframes that we ve established but this can be a meaningful impact on our overall balance sheet but based on the size of our balance sheet you can see that it s obviously going to be less than 10 of total loans but from a fee income standpoint as i mentioned earlier it s going to start off as being relatively more of an nii story just based on the coverage nature of these bankers but over time we ll continue to add capabilities and just the size of their business from a treasury standpoint there will be fee income that s generated there but we haven t shared at this point because it s such a tough number to be able to provide without knowing the timing and the size of the teams that will be able to onboard jennifer demba truist securities analyst how are you finding the recruiting environment for this effort of investing in today s landscape given where we re seeing so much wage inflation right now kevin blair president and chief executive officer just in cib jennifer jennifer demba truist securities analyst yes and otherwise if you want to cover that kevin blair president and chief executive officer yeah yeah well look i think the way in which you recruit environments like this number one is you have to offer plat you have to offer up a platform for which bankers want to come and work at and one of the reasons that tom deardorf came here and he s going to be at our investor day so you ll get a chance to meet him was the attraction of being able to come to a bank that is of our size that has the capabilities and functionality that we have but provides an environment that allows those bankers to really serve their clients and so our platform is very attractive to those bankers especially from a corporate and investment banking side two salary is obviously important and you ll hear that from us as we look at our expense guidance we recognize the changing landscape around salary inflation but i don t think that s the most important thing we have to provide an incentive plan that is that allows individuals to be paid for their success and we were building that as we speak and that will attract folks here and then lastly i would tell you that the people like tom who are well respected leaders in the industry they attract people because they know that these individuals have that tom has a great track record of success and that they want to come work for folks like him so you have the right leaders you have the right comp packages and you give them the right platform you can attract top talent from around the industry jennifer demba truist securities analyst thanks so much operator the next question comes from brody preston from stephens inc please go ahead brody preston stephens inc analyst hey good morning everyone kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning brody brody preston stephens inc analyst and so i wanted to follow up on the fee income comment jamie you said you expect it to be down this year and i know that includes some securities gains and some onetime boli but i guess if we strip all of that out i have you guys like 109 million in core fee income this quarter and so just because given the pipeline on mast given all the investments you ve made investments you ve made on the fee income side of the house maybe setting cib aside because i know that s a long tail on that revenue source but i guess i m struggling to see why the revenue guide would be down from here because it would kind of imply that 109 million is what you re expecting for the run rate for next year at least on a core basis and so maybe just some some greater clarity there setting aside kind of the onetime items would be helpful jamie gregory chief financial officer yeah yeah good question and to dive into that a little bit i mean we still if you look at the growth in wealth management fees i mean it s a sustained growth rate if you look at our core banking fees we feel really good about the sustained growth rate of those businesses and even core banking fees that had a really strong 2021 we re expecting those to continue increasing in the high single digits in 2022 and so we do expect to see this broad based growth continue and the headwinds though are fairly significant i mean you have approximately a 10 million year over year change in boli income you have a little less than 10 million on gains on equity investments and then you have normalization of the mortgage and in percentage terms these are large headwinds and they have nothing to do with our core business performance of what we re doing but they are headwinds when you have when you re comparing year over year and so we believe that those initiatives like mast we believe that initiatives like cib when you think about the fee revenue in that business we believe those will all be tailwinds to nir growth but as kevin just mentioned that s likely to be a little delayed than just coming in and having the full year 2022 benefit and so we will speak more to the financial statement impact longer term in a couple of weeks when we have investor day but that s we believe that we have a platform that s actually proven to have sustainable strong fee revenue growth and we re going to augment that with these strategic initiatives unfortunately in 2022 we have this headwind of mortgage normalization and then these other one offs in equity investments and boli so that s that s kind of a little deeper dive into the full story brody preston stephens inc analyst ok got it and then maybe it s on the expense front so if i strip out if i strip out all the one time items including the donation that you all set up core expenses running about 282 million or so and so looking at the guidance side and looking at fourth quarter results it kind of implies that you would expect expenses to be flattish from this fourth quarter level on average throughout the rest of the year just taking the midpoint of the guidance is that an accurate assessment and i guess is there anything beyond the branch closures in an earlier kevin that is driving that jamie gregory chief financial officer yeah that s a fair assumption and another way to look at that is if you roll forward from the third quarter and add what we define as recurring expenses the 9 million in our presentation you get to the mid 270s and what you should expect to see in the first quarter is the normal seasonal employment expenses approximately 7 million and you add that on and so to your point that gets you into the low 280s and we believe that beyond the first quarter that s when you ll start to see the normal inflationary pressures that come from employment expense merit increases etc but also i would just include in that guidance as kevin mentioned is approximately 25 million to spend on these growth initiatives so what you see in there is growth initiatives beyond normal personnel expense increases rolling forward from the end of this year kevin blair president and chief executive officer and i would just add to you from a synovus forward standpoint we have in the appendix slide there that you can see we have another 15 million to 20 million of savings that will come in throughout the year we referenced the 12 million on a branch we have other savings as it relates to third party spending and smaller items that add up to that number but to be very clear as jamie mentioned we re going to be monitoring the expenses throughout the year i think we ve proven this year by being able to go through a year and have our expenses flat and so when you take our guidance for next year and this year over a two year period that s seen some of the highest inflation that i ve seen in my time in banking we ll be able to keep our total expense growth over that two years into that 2 to 5 growth range so we ll continue to pull the levers we have to pull we ve been very i think forthright in some of the initiatives that we ve already executed that s delivered 55 million in expense reductions or headcount down 5 year over year and so we know that we have to look at the environment and every dollar that we can generate a new efficiency initiative from it allows us to either drop into the bottom line or invest more in some of these strategic initiatives that we that we ve established brody preston stephens inc analyst got it thank you for that and if i could sneak just a quick one can you remind me what the effect of duration on a securities portfolio is and then do you happen to know what percent of the securities portfolio is floating rate jamie gregory chief financial officer the duration of the series portfolios is just under four years approximately three point seven years i don t have the percent that floating rate top of the hand below we will get that to you brody preston stephens inc analyst all right thank you very much operator our next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst hey good morning kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst just following up on the growth targets how do you expect what s your view for funding on that in terms of the expectation for deposit growth as well as cash deployment into those loan categories and looking at some of those more optional areas you talked about like the third party originators is that really more going to be dependent upon liquidity than anything else jamie gregory chief financial officer yeah as we look at funding the loan growth we re in a very strong liquidity position and so we do expect there to be a deposit growth tailwind that continues in 2022 but we believe that even with this growth outlook and how we re thinking about asset growth in 2022 including the securities growth that we will still have the opportunity to improve our deposit mix and so what you should expect to see from us is core transaction deposit growth being net with a continued reduction in broker deposits continued reduction in time deposits as we manage that mix and so we believe that we have plenty of flexibility to do that and that s our outlook for funding the loan growth with regards to the third party portfolio we do view that as a surrogate for the investment portfolio and we will look to deploy assets into third party loans as appropriate you can see in the third i mean in the fourth quarter that that portfolio was down quarter on quarter but that s largely due to the fact that we didn t feel compelled to invest and chase assets in that portfolio when we had such strong client loan growth which is our priority jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst ok thanks and then just on the expense savings coming from the branch optimization should we expect that that s equally spread throughout the year or is that really more back end loaded jamie gregory chief financial officer that s right we evenly spread throughout the year jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst great thank you operator the next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons from d a davidson please go ahead kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst hey good morning everyone kevin blair president and chief executive officer good morning kevin kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst most of my questions have been asked but one thing that s i m just curious about when thinking about the franchise kevin looking i know this year the focus is really on finalizing or getting the finished savings from synovus forward and these investments in cib and in other areas but when you and i appreciate your comment about m a that that s really not a focus for you all but when you think about the prospect of bolting on certain markets say in north carolina maybe that s not an opportunity for this year maybe it s more next year if you don t go about it or if you want to avoid m a is it on the radar at all to look to do lift outs of teams in certain metro markets and north carolina into those seemed like they would be very attractive markets for you to add from a banking perspective but maybe the investments are really or the opportunity for investing is spoken for in 22 maybe this is more of a 23 or beyond item but just wondering how you think of that long term that prospect thanks kevin blair president and chief executive officer yeah kevin it s a great question because i think that as we transform back into this growth orientation there are a lot of opportunities to expand our talent we actually do have a small loan production office in charlotte today but it s not a meaningful portfolio my belief is that i would rather go out and build industry expertise through some of our specialty verticals and have those individuals not be limited by geography so that technically they can be national in their portfolio versus constraining a new lpo in a north carolina market because i think that it s very difficult i believe to go in with a generalist banker in a marketplace where you don t have a strong brand and generate the type of value that i think we are generating with some of these specialty industry vertical hires that we ve been able to make so although i would never say never it would be low on my priorities i think we have a tremendous opportunity first and foremost to continue to invest in the five state footprint that we serve we continue to be able to pick up great talent from other institutions that are creating growth in our existing markets we ve announced recently two great hires in the middle market space in florida so we re going to focus inside our footprint we re going to continue to add some specialty skillset around the industry verticals and then down the road never say never but it s just not a top priority kevin fitzsimmons d a davidson analyst got it great thanks very much guys kevin blair president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst the information this morning kevin i just want to ask about the pipeline in the wealth management station mentioned the family office growth in 21 just curious kind of what the pipeline looks like for the next several quarters kevin blair president and chief executive officer yeah i mean phenomenal growth there chris so when you look at the 12 folks of our synovus s family offices has an asset under management portfolio of about 10 billion so i think that the execution that they had this past year is indicative of the type of skillset we have in that team but it also is a function of the way in which they go to market they re not just asset managers these are our offerings there is a business that goes out into these generational families and provides full service and i think it is a unique value proposition and we ve won a lot of awards for being recognized for being unique so i think you ll continue to see that business grow our leader there kathryn dunlevy set out a plan several years ago to double the size of her business and she s well on track in being able to deliver on that so we are confident that she will continue to grow that business and it ll be something that will continue to provide not only growth on the fee side but also on the assets under the management side christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst great kevin and my quick follow up just has to do with the new receivable business i guess i m curious is that something that s digitizing what already exists as synovus or is it a brand new product offering kevin blair president and chief executive officer i missed the first part chris christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst for the new receivable business i know we re going to get into detail in a couple of weeks but just curious if that s digitizing something that already exists or is it brand new kevin blair president and chief executive officer that s right no it s brand new so what we re providing is a suite of products for our clients to better manage their receivable process so imagine today you have a clerk who s matching invoices with payments and the product that we provide provides artificial intelligence that allows that process to happen behind the scenes so it makes our clients much more efficient and does not need clerks to do that and it makes it obviously a quicker process in general so we built a really strong pipeline with that product and we re out selling it to our clients today the really exciting part is we ll have a similar product for the accounts payable side that will roll out in the latter half of 2022 that will provide similar functionality for commercial payments platforms christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst great so over time that s going to lead to an additional loan to a business application additional fees as this gets executed right kevin blair president and chief executive officer absolutely i think we said last quarter our pipeline with the accelerate ar was right around 6 million in product revenue and so over time those will continue to grow and that s what s going to fuel a lot of our treasury growth going forward to this point katherine weislogel and her team have done a great job of deepening the wallet share within treasury we now are starting to expand with these new businesses where she s getting a new sandbox to play in but she s also adding new solutions that will also add to that revenue line so it s really the three legged stool cross sell into the existing book expand through new segments and industries and three bring on new solutions and products christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst great thanks for the background kevin appreciate it kevin blair president and chief executive officer great operator this concludes our question and answers session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks thank you kevin blair president and chief executive officer well thank you and i really thank everyone for your questions and your continued interest in synovus i also want to thank all of our team members who are on the call today it s an extremely exciting time to be part of this company and it s an honor to lead this passionate and high performing team i recently shared our 4 strategic pillars of transformation that will build out our bank of the future i think this road map is well balanced between continuing to drive productivity and market share gains in our core businesses while folding in and extending new businesses and solutions to generate new sources of revenue as we reposition our businesses for advantage simplify and streamline leverage a high tech high touch approach to banking we will also continue to invest in our team and new talent execution in these areas will continue to enhance our client experience and it s going to generate outsized growth we ve also received some good media coverage over the past few weeks as we ve continued to onboard some expert talent our new head of analytics joined us but we ve also taken meaningful steps forward in the crypto space where we joined the us df consortium and we announced an investment along with other banks in the jamintop fintech fund we hope as jamie mentioned earlier you ll join us for our 2022 investor day on february 8 to hear more about the work that we re doing and how this work will fuel sustainable growth and allow us to deliver on our purpose you will also have an opportunity to hear from many of our executive leadership team on how we have coordinated this effort and how we are collectively executing our strategies and we ll also share some of our long term financial targets at that event so as we close again thank you for joining

like a macy s window in december it s two days after christmas and he s telling me how the meat industrial complex has us all fooled into blindly accepting certain holiday food traditions we think we ve got to leave milk and cookies out for santa have an abnormally large chicken in the center of the table he says it s forced down our throats so what did you leave out for santa i ask him gesturing to the festive wreath above his fridge he laughs scotch click for more hummons is a latin caribbean chef with an entirely vegan agenda since his meat centric caribbean barbecue restaurant shut down a little over three years ago he s been serving up delicious vegan recipes for everyone with taste buds vegan or not i was a little heartbroken about losing my restaurant i was in limbo he says i ve seen how meat is done i ve seen big old chicken breasts that just aren t normal they re not normal since then he s pivoted to an entirely plant based menu and lifestyle his philosophy if you can t join em beat em when other chefs made fun of his alternative diet he knew there was only one way to shut them up make food so undeniably good they d want a piece of it too when farmers markets and pop up festivals didn t have space for him he decided to make his own that s where vegan wonderland comes in a monthly festival of vegan food and products set to a soundtrack of live local musicians monthly for now hummons tells me i want this thing to run weekly the vision s big at its heart vegan wonderland is about supporting a community of local businesses not small hummons reminds me there s nothing small about running your own business seeing the pandemic s devastating impact on local businesses hummons wanted to create a space where it wasn t just the vegan giants like the impossible burger and beyond meat getting attention but the little guys too many of the vendors at vegan wonderland are family owned black owned or hispanic owned showcasing just how diverse vegas vegan community is the tacos out there in town are fabulous hummons says there s some bad bad people out there doing some good tacos one such vendor includes chef ivon valenzuela from yaqui zen a vegan mexican pop up that has been running the vegas vegan circuit for the past three years my mom s a cook too valenzuela tells me i go to her for advice whenever i m working on a recipe she entered a tamale contest last year and won best tamales in san diego so i ve got big shoes to fill valenzuela has been prepping a bunch of new and old recipes alike for the next festival including her personal favorite a vegan bahn mi burrito that fuses the nostalgic flavors of her childhood into vietnamese mexican comfort street food vegan wonderland aims to celebrate not only vegan food but an entire community of artists and creators that spirit of community engagement resonated with artisanal foods owners jinelle batista and chef jon batista they donated meals to local families during the height of the pandemic and currently deliver 50 gourmet meals a week to nurses working in covid wards jon batista also appreciates hummons passion for promoting veganism and supporting local businesses we re really hoping that we can grow our vegan selection and stock a lot more local businesses batista says veganism isn t fringe anymore it s a lifestyle and counter to the stereotypes veganism is not a bland lifestyle of dreary self denial rather than wondering what happens to a dish once you take the meat away vegan chefs nowadays are creating mouth watering dishes that just happen to be vegan when i ask what he thinks non vegans will find at vegan wonderland hummons simply says good food and maybe a side of enlightenment we re coming out of the age of capricorn which we ve been in for some 200 years now and into the age of aquarius he says capricorn was all me me me it was opportunistic people are done with that now we re in the age of aquarius which is more about truth and spirituality gone are the days of forcing beliefs down someone else s throat hummons says people don t want to hear that you have to have a turkey at thanksgiving anymore and they don t want to hear that you can t either that means delivering vegan food that is authentic vibrant diverse vegan food that people want to eat vegan wonderland takes place 11a m 6p m january 29 at artisanal foods 4860 s eastern ave

just peeking over the mountains near bunkerville nevada it s summertime about 85 degrees and the warm light spreads over an open expanse of the mojave desert this area is protected as a national monument called gold butte which means it s mostly public lands anyone can come here and go hiking or camping but for patrick donnelly the great basin director for the center for biological diversity this place effectively belongs to local rancher and extremist cliven bundy and his family who militantly oppose federal control of these lands these are not safe spaces he says these public lands are not safe public lands click for more it s easy to understand why donnelly might be nervous in 2014 bundy and hundreds of militia members and protesters held a tense hour long armed standoff with federal agents and local law enforcement the confrontation was an effort to stop the bureau of land management from rounding up bundy s cattle which have illegally grazed on these public lands for nearly three decades the feds eventually backed down fearing bloodshed intimidation and even sporadic reports of violence have continued ever since there have been contractors for blm run off with shots fired donnelly says blm rangers were forbidden from coming out here for years this is not a safe place cliven bundy and his family were some of the first prominent anti government agitators of the 21st century and donnelly and other public lands activists believe their actions paved the way for other far right uprisings in the u s including the january 6th takeover of the u s capitol while the biden administration has moved to crack down on extremism over the past year it hasn t touched the bundys who continue to illegally graze their cattle on public lands it s an outrage that armed thugs could violently force their way into continuing to break the law donnelly says the bundys ongoing cold war with the federal government began in 1993 when cliven bundy stopped paying fees to the federal government to graze his cattle on public lands adjacent to his ranch he and his two sons ryan and ammon who led the occupation of the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon in 2016 and the latter of whom is now running a long shot campaign for idaho governor don t recognize the american taxpayer as having ownership over the federal land that makes up roughly 47 of the west after grazing was eventually banned in most of southern nevada in 1998 to protect the imperiled desert tortoise the family continued to keep its cows out here even after the armed standoff the bundys have turned natural springs into watering holes and installed irrigation in recent years all without the permission of the federal government still the land doesn t support cattle well especially in the midst of a severe and prolonged drought water is sparse and forage in the mojave desert isn t great it s full of small hardy plants like greasewood and cacti it s a fragile ecosystem where cattle are an invasive species donnelly spots two of the bundys cows walking along a dirt road they don t look healthy these cows are skinny he says they look in very poor condition but the bundys remain steadfast in continuing to flout the law last january the patriarch of the family cliven issued a stark warning to the incoming biden administration if it attempted to seize his family s cattle the bundy family has violated federal laws and developed a watering hole along with an irrigation pipe for trespassing cattle on public lands in southern nevada if we have to walk forward towards guns which we did at the bundy ranch we have to do that he said on a far right internet radio show ryan bundy who helps manage the family s cattle operation and played a prominent role in the 2014 armed standoff reiterates his father s remarks and says they ll do whatever it takes you can t draw any lines in the sand he says you ve got to say i m going to stand regardless of what happens come hell or high water it s not always clear what exactly the bundys are standing against their anti government grievances are vague but their resistance to federal control of public lands is rooted in a fundamentalist interpretation of mormon theology a blm spokesperson did not respond to repeated calls and requests for comment about the bundys on the anniversary of the jan 6th capitol siege the left leaning watchdog organization accountable us published a report highlighting the overlap between the anti public lands movement and the insurrectionists the bundy family praised the mob and wished it would have escalated it should have been something more ryan bundy says i think trump failed when he told the people to back down i think trump should have said let s take this capitol let s keep it they should have never left they should have held that capitol and corrected the problem more than 700 people have been charged with crimes after the insurrection at the u s capitol last june the president created the country s first ever national strategy for combating domestic terrorism this week the u s department of justice announced a new unit to counter domestic violent extremists but the administration hasn t touched the bundys yet donnelly thinks he knows why it s politically nuclear he says the nation is a tinderbox right now there are a growing number of militias political extremism is on the rise and donnelly believes the biden administration isn t willing to spill blood over some trespassing cows on obscure nevada rangeland few could find on a map i don t think the political momentum exists at the moment to force the issue he says it s hard to imagine it being done of the administration s own volition that s a tough pill for richard spotts to swallow the retired blm employee who lives in st george utah worked for 15 years on public lands in the southwest and his field office dealt with ranchers like the bundys who broke the law it s kind of like dealing with a bully in the schoolyard he says if they always get away with it it empowers them the bundys also got away with the malheur occupation after a stunning acquittal in federal district court in october 2016 spotts says there are ways for the biden administration to take action quietly for instance cliven bundy owes roughly 1 million in fees and fines to the federal government spotts says a court could issue a lien on his property and seize his cattle when they go to auction or federal agents could use a bench warrant to arrest bundy quickly and quietly in the parking lot of a costco or walmart you could be creative about finding ways that he s not going to be able to alert the militia and have 300 people there with bulletproof vests and assault rifles spotts says but bottom line he believes something has to be done by the biden administration because letting the bundys walk has set a dangerous precedent especially in light of the insurrection spotts says it s almost like there s

ended september 30 2021 and 2 303 079 or 0 67 per share for the prior year quarter ended december 31 2020 although net income improved over the prior year comparative quarter the impact of lower interest income in q4 2021 combined with the net effect of two non recurring items in the third quarter resulted in a decline in net income compared to the linked quarter pre tax pre provision operating income for the current quarter is 3 554 464 compared to 4 075 010 for the linked quarter and 2 508 474 for the comparative prior year quarter pre tax pre provision operating income excludes

comparative twelve month periods was 13 689 189 and 10 443 300 respectively bruce w elder president ceo commented despite a second year of covid 19 and a slow moving recovery from the 2020 hurricane season the company showed improved earnings and solid net non ppp loan growth in 2021 net income of 11 0 million for 2021 reflects a 52 9 increase over that of 2020 as economic conditions have improved loan demand from businesses and consumers has increased and we enjoyed the best core net loan growth since 2015 we still have a tremendous volume of liquidity on our balance sheet and will continue to look for opportunities to transition lower yielding assets to higher yielding assets elder continued by saying during the month of december we were able to issue 30 0 million in new subordinated debt at a rate of 3 75 a portion of the money was used on january 15 2022 to redeem 17 5 million of previously issued subordinated debt carrying an interest rate of 6 75 the remaining proceeds will be used to support our future growth and for other general corporate purposes paycheck protection program lending ppp the company made 1 422 ppp loans totaling 110 4 million between april 2020 and may 2021 of the 74 0 million of ppp loans made in 2020 60 7 million in loans remained outstanding at the end of 2020 an additional 36 4 million ppp loans were originated in 2021 as of december 31 2021 16 2 million in loans remain outstanding and 94 2 million have been repaid through sba forgiveness and customer payments of the 94 2 million in total ppp loan repayments 80 9 million in repayments occurred in 2021 of the original 74 0 million in 2020 vintage loans 72 3 million have been repaid and 5 loans totaling 1 7 million remain outstanding of the original 36 4 million of ppp loans made in 2021 21 9 million have been repaid and 240 loans totaling 14 5 million remain outstanding the 2021 vintage borrowers have until the middle of 2022 to apply for forgiveness and therefore some portion of these loans may remain outstanding well into 2022 the company received origination fees from the sba for participating in the program at origination we recognized as interest income that portion of the fee estimated to be our internal cost of origination the remainder is amortized over the contractual life of the loan if the loan is forgiven or repaid early the remaining unamortized portion is recognized as interest income in the month of repayment amounts recognized as interest income for the quarters ended december 31 2021 september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 are 498 000 799 000 and 555 000 respectively origination fees recognized for the two twelve month periods ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are 2 683 000 and 1 442 000 respectively as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 619 000 in deferred ppp origination fees to be recognized in future periods asset quality loans past due of 30 to 89 days at december 31 2021 are 1 3 million or 0 21 of the total loans outstanding compared to 1 1 million or 0 18 of the total loan portfolio at september 30 2021 and 1 3 million or 0 21 of total loans reported at december 31 2020 total nonperforming assets including loans on non accrual status other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets are 5 2 million at december 31 2021 compared to 9 1 million at december 31 2020 loans on non accrual status at december 31 2021 decreased to 4 1 million from 8 8 million at december 31 2020 oreo increased to 1 1 million from 291 000 and there are currently no repossessed assets compared to 33 000 a year ago management performs a quarterly evaluation of oreo properties and repossessions and believes the adjusted carrying values are representative of their fair market values although there is no assurance that the ultimate sales will be equal or greater than the carrying values the company did not record a provision for credit losses in either the current or linked quarters compared to 190 000 for the prior year quarter the allowance for loan losses alll is 8 2 million at december 31 2021 or 1 32 of total loans compared to 8 6 million at december 31 2020 or 1 36 of total loans net charge offs are 723 000 for 2021 compared to 755 000 for the prior year comparative period we believe the current level of our alll is adequate but there is no assurance that regulators increased risks in the loan portfolio or changes in economic conditions will not require future adjustments to the alll net interest income net interest income for the current quarter is 9 0 million a decrease of 484 000 compared to the 9 4 million for the linked quarter and is 522 000 higher than the 8 4 million reported for the prior year quarter the decline in net interest income between the september and december 2021 quarters is due to a reduction in average outstanding loan balances during the respective periods as well as a decrease in ppp origination fee recognition average loans outstanding for the current period were down 8 0 million compared to that of the linked quarter additionally origination fees recognized as interest income due to ppp forgiveness was 301 000 more in q3 than q4 the increase in current quarter net interest over the prior year comparative quarter is primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher volumes of investment securities partially offset by lower interest income on loans net interest income for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 1 7 million or 4 9 to 35 7 million compared to 34 0 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase is primarily attributable to higher interest income on securities and lower interest expense offset by a decrease in interest income on loans due an overall increase in average volume of investment securities of 245 5 million interest income from securities is 2 6 million more than the prior year interest expense declined by 346 000 despite an increase in average interest bearing deposits of 193 0 million interest income on loans declined by 1 2 million during the year as a net result of lower average loan volume partially offset by higher ppp origination fees the net interest margin for the current quarter was 2 90 and declined by 12 basis points from 3 02 for the linked quarter and 29 basis points compared to 3 19 for the prior year quarter the yield on earning assets for

year quarter net interest margin for the current year period is 2 91 compared to 3 76 for the prior year the yield on earning assets and cost of funds for the two comparative year end periods were 3 27 and 4 28 respectively and 0 36 and 0 52 respectively margins for the three and twelve month 2021 periods were adversely impacted by the volume of liquid assets on the company s balance sheet invested in a low interest rate environment the federal open market committee the committee of the federal reserve bank has signaled a tapering of their asset purchases to remove some of the accommodations of monetary policy during the first quarter of 2022 additionally committee members believe that a number of future short term rate hikes may be appropriate over the coming year the company s balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment which will have a positive impact on net income additionally with the majority of our ppp loan originations having been repaid and no longer being a significant headwind to net new loan growth average loan volumes should improve during 2022 non interest income total non interest income is 3 3 million for the current three month period compared to 3 8 million for the linked quarter and 3 0 million for the prior year quarter service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts are 2 3 million for q4 2021 and increased by 30 000 and 431 000 compared to the linked and prior year quarters respectively interchange revenue from debit card usage continues to be an important component of non interest income contributing 1 3 million for both the current and linked quarters and 1 1 million for the prior year quarter while mortgage rates through the end of 2021 remained at attractive levels the volume of mortgage activity in the fourth quarter tends to lag other quarters of the year due to the holidays gains on the sale of originated mortgages is 342 000 for the current quarter compared to 430 000 for the september 30 2021 quarter and 249 000 for the prior year comparative quarter although interest rates on conventional mortgages may begin to increase in 2022 we anticipate rates to remain at attractive levels and demand for housing in our footprint continues to be robust as the region recovers from the hurricanes of 2020 other non interest income is 691 000 for the current quarter compared to 1 1 million for the linked quarter and 895 000 for the prior year quarter revenue from our trust and investment divisions are typically the largest components of other non

reflecting a 1 8 million increase compared to 33 5 million for the prior year increases in occupancy data processing fdic insurance premiums oreo expenses and fraud losses were partially offset by decreases in salary and employee benefits net losses on the sale of oreo for the current and prior twelve month periods are 384 000 and 114 000 respectively the company also paid a penalty on the pre

twelve months ended december 31 2021 is 2 1 million with an effective rate of 16 21 compared to 1 1 million and 13 82 for the prior year twelve month period the increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to a larger percentage of revenue being derived from taxable sources balance sheet total assets are 1 4 billion at december 31 2021 reflecting a 68 2 million or 5 3 increase over the 1 3 billion at december 31 2020 investment securities are up 144 9 million or 42 6 to 485 4 million from 340 5 million at the prior year end over the course of 2021 we transitioned 70 9 million of cash

or 69 0 non interest bearing demand deposits time deposits and interest bearing demand deposits declined by 29 2 million 10 1 million and 3 3 million respectively the volume of government stimulus

equity increased by 2 5 million to 101 2 million at december 31 2021 from 98 7 million at december 31 2020 the increase is primarily comprised of 2021 net income of 11 0 million less the decrease in

the highest level in three months as the fast spreading omicron variant continued to disrupt the job market the job market has had a rocky recovery from the virus pandemic the unemployment rate fell last month to a pandemic low 3 9 percent employment data was also closely watched by investors trying to gauge how it might affect the federal reserve s decision to reverse its support for the economy by raising interest rates the central bank made it clear early in the pandemic that it was basing much of its support on how quickly employment recovers the fed is now expected to raise rates earlier and more often than it had previously signaled in order to fight rising inflation that threatens to derail a further economic recovery supply chain problems and higher raw materials costs have prompted businesses to raise prices on finished goods and economists are concerned that consumers will eventually refuse to pay higher prices and cut their spending companies are reminding investors that supply chain problems are still weighing on operations recent inflation reports have been worrisome while data on retail sales has also disappointed these are all the things that are justifying

facility upgrades to existing buildings and the development of a long awaited electronic medical records system eleanor slater hospital takes care of some of our state s most vulnerable residents said mckee it s long past time to make meaningful investments that will provide higher quality care for the patients better conditions for the staff and tackle decades of deferred maintenance i look forward to working with the general assembly to get this done slater plan draws support from one gop leader senate minority whip jessica de la cruz r dist 23 burrillville glocester north smithfield said she supports the mckee plan for slater our first and most important responsibility is to help people who cannot help themselves de la cruz said it is such a relief that patients and their families will finally get the desperately needed repairs to this beloved facility under this proposal more than 108 million will be allocated to build a new facility on the burrillville campus by 2028 and millions more for necessary updates this is a huge win for the patients their families and the state of rhode island she said this isn t just a band aid fix the improvements we will be making will benefit generations of rhode islanders to come this is a great start in strengthening our infrastructure to support our most vulnerable people the significance of these investments cannot be overstated said richard charest director of the department of behavioral healthcare developmental disabilities and hospitals and ceo of eleanor slater hospital these projects will better position the hospital to carry out its mission to care for rhode islanders who require our services for long term medical and psychiatric conditions and they will help our staff as they perform this work we are grateful for the governor s support the largest single investment 108 2 million will fund a new medical facility on the zambarano campus with more than 100 beds tailored to meet the needs of the patients already served at the facility as well as for services with limited availability in the state and for specialized populations the new structure will succeed the beazley building as the medical facility on the zambarano campus in burrillville providing a modern and cost efficient facility at which the hospital will care for patients with long term medical needs says mckee the budget also invests 14 3 million at the burrillville campus for repairs and upgrades to buildings equipment and utilities this multi year project according to mckee will ensure the reliability of infrastructure on the campus including the water distribution wastewater treatment and sewer systems a further 3 2 million funds the installation of a ventilator unit at the beazley building to better treat patients with specialized needs at eleanor slater s cranston campus the governor s budget recommends 19 7 million from existing debt proceeds for life and safety improvements at the regan building critics want budget to include funding to address hunger while the slater proposal drew support hunger advocates criticized the budget stating the lack of funding fails to address most serious hunger issue since the great depression dr amy nunn executive director of the rhode island public health institute on behalf of the nourish rhode island coalition comprised of 40 plus community groups decried the lack of funding nunn said in a statement at a time when one in four rhode island families with children are going hungry we are disappointed that governor mckee s budget proposal does not include measures to specifically address the state s hunger crisis we recommended an allocation of federal funding secured through the american rescue plan act and earmarked to respond to immediate needs to pilot a statewide retail snap incentive program which would provide snap beneficiaries across the state with a 50 discount on fresh fruits and vegetables she added this is a ready to implement plan that would require no tax increases and make an immediate impact in rhode island it would help tens of thousands of families in need put healthy food on their tables and support the local economy by boosting sales at local grocery markets addressing the hunger crisis in rhode island cannot wait this is a problem that has been exacerbated by the covid 19 pandemic and it s one that is disproportionately impacting communities of color the elderly and children across the state she added cities and towns marijuana legalization also needs to be addressed in mckee s budget he includes the legalization of marijuana in rhode island which drew the concern of the rhode island league of cities and towns in his budget mckee recommends creating a strictly regulated legal market for adult use cannabis in the state this proposal would create a weight based excise tax on marijuana cultivation an additional retail excise tax of 10 percent and also apply sales tax to cannabis transactions the proposal allocates 25 percent of these revenues along with licensing fee revenue to the regulatory public health and public safety costs associated with adult use cannabis an additional 15 percent of these revenues are allocated to cities and towns this revenue proposal mirrors the governor s prior recommended budget adult use cannabis sales are expected to start in april 2023 according to the mckee administration who states even the limited sales revenue in fy 2023 the share of revenue devoted to state expenditures is temporarily increased to 89 percent in fy 2023 this is expected to yield 8 0 million in restricted receipt revenue in fy 2023 much of it to support regulatory oversight at the department of business regulation department of health and division of taxation this revenue also supports various public health and safety needs including a 1 1 million investment dedicated to equity zones 0 5 million in funding for local police and 0 3 million to help the state oversee prevention and treatment programs beyond the portion dedicated to state expenditures the proposal will result in 1 2 million in general revenue in fy 2023 general revenues increase to 16 9 million with a full year of sales in fy 2024 the budget proposal continues the league of cities and towns appreciates the governor s commitment to municipalities and the work we are doing locally particularly as we continue to address new challenges presented by the covid 19 pandemic said north providence mayor and league president charles lombardi on thursday while cities and towns have seen an influx of federal aid to support our economic recovery from covid 19 we are glad to see stable levels of local and education aid in this budget this will ensure that cities and towns can maintain core municipal operations while investing one time federal funds in necessary capital improvements said lombardi we look forward to reviewing the modifications which will smooth fluctuations in enrollment as a result of the pandemic as we look to strengthen our state and local economy we support reforms to the tangible property tax which burdens small businesses the governor also recognized the need for communities to define their own revenue streams he added while we recognize the revenue potential of marijuana there are many considerations for municipalities including local approvals and public safety that will need to be discussed further as legalization of marijuana will have long term impacts on cities and towns the league will continue to advocate that local communities have control no matter what decisions are reached regarding implementation lombardi also spoke to mckee s housing proposal the governor s housing proposal is a positive first step to tackling the existing crisis increasing the housing stock with investments in infrastructure to support this new development will open new opportunities for rhode island families said lombardi covid

carbondale s elected officials heard this week from a new group that s come forward in support of short term vacation rentals and wants to make sure new regulations aren t heavy handed in response to the community first carbondale cfc group that approached the town board of trustees last month calling for new taxation and limits on short term rentals a group calling itself carbondale forward provided its thoughts ahead of a jan 18 work session by the trustees it is our assessment that short term rentals are being used as a scapegoat for the larger and much more complex issue surrounding the nationwide housing shortage the group said in its written pitch to the trustees a restrictive short term rental regulation may seem politically expedient now however it is shortsighted imposing such restrictions could also have potentially disastrous economic impacts and even force some long term residents who rely on short term rentals for part of their income to consider moving the group said made up mostly of local property owners who rent their units on the short term market and managers of such units the group countered the proposal put forth by cfc that proposal which was the topic of discussion at a lengthy meeting dec 21 2021 would require licensing and impose permitting fees and extra taxes on short term rentals it would also restrict the types of units that could be rented for 30 days or less to accessory units or a portion of the property where the owner lives as their primary residence cfc which is made up mostly of local renters believes the proliferation of short term rentals takes away from the long term rental market for area workers and those who want to establish themselves in carbondale especially as the vacation rental market becomes more attractive to property owners it s just one of many such debates playing out in resort communities in colorado and elsewhere around the country including aspen snowmass village and unincorporated pitkin county carbondale trustees said after the december meeting that they would prefer the board write any regulations around short term rentals rather than have cfc put its proposal to town voters in a referendum as it had originally proposed speaking on behalf of carbondale forward this week were jon flacke and brittany hailey they said they re not against certain rules for short term rentals such as licensing and appropriate taxation we re just seeking a more balanced solution said hailey who manages several vacation rentals in the mid valley region and owns units in carbondale that she and her husband michael hailey rent out on a short term basis currently according to carbondale forward s analysis there are only about 35 or 40 active short term rentals in carbondale or about 1 6 of the town s 2 245 residential units another 382 recently approved units are now built or in the process of being built in town which should expand the town s worker housing stock by 17 the group also points out trustees during the december meeting indicated they would also consider putting rules in place to keep any rental units being built in the long term market this week s meeting spanned nearly 3 1 2 hours garnering comments on both sides of the contentious issue some spoke to the need to continue to allow short term rentals as a way for established residents to be able to remain in carbondale and for second home owners to make use of their residences while they are away for long stretches of time others said the presence of short term rentals in their housing complexes or neighborhoods is a nuisance and that they drain the pool of available long term housing trustee ben bohmfalk thanked the participants for a robust discussion and said he learned some new things along the way i feel like this is how policymaking is supposed to work where we have people coming in with different perspectives he said you re informing us we re listening and we re grappling with this bohmfalk added that he believes it s beyond time for a do nothing approach as the town has taken in the past without action he said it s likely cfc would be successful in putting its question on the ballot a measure bohmfalk said he believes would pass given the emotion behind it we have an opportunity here to be deliberative and work through the nuances he said adding that now is the time to have the discussion and put rules in place because the situation is not yet out of control i m more concerned about what could happen in the future he said trustees had initially talked about having an ordinance spelling out the new regulations for short term rentals by march the board agreed that schedule may be too aggressive and will more likely have something on the table by summer senior reporter managing editor john stroud can be reached at 970 384 9160 or jstroud postindependent com

on january 4 2022 the us department of the treasury treasury and the internal revenue service irs issued final regulations final regulations that deny a foreign tax credit ftc for certain foreign withholding taxes and other taxes that have been creditable for as long as section 901 has been in the internal revenue code code in particular the final regulations adopt a new attribution requirement attribution requirement that restricts the availability of ftcs to foreign taxes that the treasury and the irs consider to be similar to us taxes in depth although these rules were previewed in 2020 proposed regulations that were intended to limit the creditability of certain novel extraterritorial taxes like gross basis digital services taxes dsts many observers expected that the final regulations would pare back the scope of the proposed regulations so as not to deny ftcs for withholding taxes commonly imposed around the world on royalties and service fees to the surprise of many the treasury and the irs held to the aggressively broad scope of the proposed regulations in the final regulations as a result taxpayers are now faced with cataloging the various foreign taxes for which they have claimed an ftc and determining whether an ftc will be available under the final regulations beyond the new attribution requirement the final regulations include a wide range of other modifications to the rules governing whether a particular foreign tax is eligible for an ftc under section 901 or 903 changes to treas reg 1 901 2 generally limit the extent to which foreign taxes may employ deeming mechanisms and allowances to approximate a net income tax base abandoning the standard of prior case law and regulations that a foreign tax need merely have the predominant character of an income tax in the us sense the changes to treas reg 1 903 1 generally limit the circumstances in which a foreign tax that is not an income tax may be eligible for a credit under section 903 as a tax imposed in lieu of an income tax demanding taxpayers to establish a close connection between the exemption of certain receipts from the income tax base and the imposition of the non income tax on those receipts while these are significant changes to longstanding regulations this article focuses specifically on the attribution requirement the rules adopting the final regulations attribution requirement are generally applicable for taxable years beginning on or after december 28 2021 the attribution requirement for income taxes under prior treas reg 1 902 2 that finalized in 1983 prior regulations a foreign levy was considered an income tax if the predominant character of that tax is that of an income tax in the u s sense a foreign tax was considered to have the predominant character of an income tax in the us sense if it was likely to reach net gain in the ordinary circumstances in which it applies this meant a tax must satisfy three requirements it is imposed upon certain realization events or pre realization events realization requirement it is imposed on the basis of gross receipts or a measure of deemed gross receipts that is not likely to exceed actual gross receipts gross receipts requirement it allows the recovery of significant costs attributable to the gross receipts or a measure of significant costs that is likely to approximate actual costs net income requirement if a tax satisfied these conditions it was creditable under the prior regulations there was no other requirement that a foreign tax resemble a specific us tax the final regulations retain the realization gross receipts and net income requirements albeit in a more stringent form and add the new attribution requirement the attribution requirement takes a different form when applied to a tax on residents of the country imposing the tax as compared to a tax on nonresidents for a tax imposed on a resident of the country imposing the tax the attribution requirement requires that allocations of income among related parties to the taxpayer i e the country s transfer pricing rules must be determined under arm s length principles for the avoidance of doubt the final regulations specify that allocations of income under the foreign tax must not tak into account as a significant factor the location of customers users or any other destination based criteria for a tax on a nonresident of the country imposing the tax the attribution requirement generally provides that attribute gross receipts and costs must be attributed based on one of three principles activities source or the situs of property and must satisfy one of the following conditions attribution based on activities a foreign tax imposed on the basis of a nonresident s activities must be limited to the gross receipts and costs that are attributable under reasonable principles to the nonresident s activities within the foreign country imposing the tax attribution based on reasonable principles includes attribution based on the nonresident s functions assets and risks located in the country such as provided for under the section 864 c rules eci rules for determining income effectively connected with a us trade or business the final regulations specifically exclude foreign rules that consider the location of customers users or similar destination based criteria or the location of a supplier they also exclude foreign rules that deem a permanent establishment or attribute gross receipts or costs based on the activities of a person other than the nonresident besides an agent attribution based on source a foreign tax imposed on a nonresident based on a source rule must be limited to gross income arising from sources within the foreign country that imposes the tax the sourcing rules of the foreign tax law must also be reasonably similar to the sourcing rules of the code when evaluating whether a foreign law source rule is reasonably similar to the rules that apply under the code the character of an item of gross income generally is determined under foreign law for example if a payment would be characterized as a service under us principles but as a royalty under foreign law then to satisfy the attribution requirement the foreign law source rule for royalties must be similar to the us source rule for royalties perhaps in recognition that the sourcing of service fees and royalties is not always perfectly clear under the source rules of sections 861 to 865 the final regulations provide additional guidance on the conditions under which a source based tax on such payments can satisfy the attribution requirement for services the payment source must be determined based on where the services are performed as determined under reasonable principles the final regulations expressly state that reasonable principles do not include determining the place of performance based on the location of the service recipient for royalties the source of the payment must be determined based on the place of use of or the right to use the licensed intangible property attribution based on situs of property a foreign tax based on gains of nonresidents from the sale or disposition of property including stock or partnership interests generally must only apply in cases where us law would tax a nonresident s capital gains for a tax imposed on gains from the disposition of real property the foreign law generally must only apply in circumstances analogous to those in which the foreign investment in real property tax act firpta rules of section 897 apply for a tax imposed on gains from the disposition of property other than real property the base may only include gross receipts that are attributable to property forming part of the business property of a taxable presence in the foreign country under rules reasonably similar to the eci rules of section 864 c the final regulations provide that gross receipts from property sales must be included in the foreign tax base on the basis of the situs of the property or based on the nonresident s in country activities as described above rather than under a source rule additionally a transaction that is treated as a sale of copyrighted articles for us purposes can only satisfy the attribution requirement if the transaction is treated for foreign law purposes as a sale of tangible property and not as a license of intangible property ip this rule effectively overrides the general rule above that in the case of a source based tax foreign law controls the determination of character of gross income the attribution requirement for section 903 taxes including withholding taxes although the new attribution requirement is located in the section 901 regulations which apply for determining whether a foreign levy is an income tax the final regulations include important changes to treas reg 1 903 1 that incorporate aspects of the attribution requirement into the section 903 regulations for determining creditability of certain non income taxes regarding whether a foreign levy qualifies as a tax imposed in lieu of an income tax the final regulations provide that the general income tax which the foreign levy is imposed in substitution for must meet the attribution requirement this rule prevents a jurisdiction from actually or theoretically expanding the reach of its general income tax beyond the scope reflected in us rules and then imposing a non income tax purportedly in lieu of the broadly scoped income tax it appears to be aimed at an excise tax adopted by puerto rico in 2011 that applies in lieu of an expansion of the jurisdictional reach of the income tax that was adopted at the same time the final regulations contain special rules governing the circumstances under which a covered withholding tax is creditable under section 903 in addition to being imposed on a nonresident and not overlapping in scope with the general income tax the withholding tax must satisfy the conditions of the attribution requirement for a source based tax meaning the withholding tax must be imposed on the basis of a source rule rather than on the basis that it is an outbound payment i e from resident to nonresident the source rule must also be reasonably similar to the us source rule for a payment of the same character as such character is determined under foreign law relief for taxes covered by a us tax treaty but not cfc paid taxes fortunately the attribution requirement does not apply where a tax is directly paid by a us resident and is treated as an income tax under an applicable us income tax treaty to confirm that a particular foreign tax is creditable under a treaty it s important to determine whether that tax is a covered tax under the treaty which may be a question of if the tax is imposed based on a law adopted or modified after the treaty was signed generally a covered tax under a treaty is a tax that was in existence at the time the treaty was signed or a later adopted tax that is identical or substantially similar to such pre existing taxes in the case of a tax paid by a controlled foreign corporation and deemed paid by a us shareholder under section 960 no relief from the attribution requirement would be available under a treaty for purposes of determining whether the attribution requirement is satisfied with respect to such a tax however any modifications to the foreign tax pursuant to a treaty between the country imposing the tax and another foreign country would be considered based on the treasury s general policy of limiting creditable taxes under a treaty to those that are creditable under the code it may be expected that in future treaty negotiations the treasury will seek to limit the scope of covered taxes to those that would satisfy the attribution requirement foreign taxes for which ftcs could be denied under the final regulations as noted above although the treasury and the irs cited novel extraterritorial taxes and particularly dsts as the motivation for modifying the prior regulations the final regulations potentially apply to a significantly broader range of foreign taxes many common foreign withholding taxes the creditability of which had never previously been in doubt apparently would no longer be the basis for a claim of an ftc foreign taxes both novel and run of the mill potentially affected by the final regulations include the following royalty withholding taxes in order for a withholding tax on what foreign law regards as a royalty payment other than a payment for what us law regards as a sale of a copyrighted article to satisfy the attribution requirement withholding must be limited to royalties for the use of ip in that foreign country this requirement seems to exclude the wide variety of royalty withholding taxes that countries impose based on a residence principle on any outbound payment a pair of examples in the regulations reveal the treasury s intent for the attribution requirement to apply broadly in the case of royalty withholding taxes the examples conclude that a withholding tax on a royalty paid for the use of ip does not employ a source rule reasonably similar to us source rules and would not meet the attribution requirement in a case where the country requires withholding on all royalties paid by a resident to a nonresident because the final regulations only require that a foreign source rule be reasonably similar to us source rules and because the location of ip use is not always clear under us law particularly in the case of patents or manufacturing ip there should be some leeway for foreign law to employ different principles to determine the location where ip is used and still satisfy the reasonably similar requirement service payment withholding taxes like royalty withholding taxes withholding taxes imposed on service payments including commonly used withholding taxes on fees for technical services may not satisfy the attribution requirement if imposed on a source basis such withholding taxes would need to apply only to payments for services performed in country and not based on the location of the service recipient if any outbound service payment for services of a specific kind like technical services would be subject to withholding based on a residence principle the withholding tax may not satisfy the attribution requirement regardless of whether the nonresident performs services in country this treatment of service payment withholding taxes clearly reverses the result under the prior regulations which included an example now removed explicitly concluding that a residence based withholding tax on payments for technical services was creditable under section 903 capital gains taxes on share disposal taxes imposed by a country on a nonresident s disposal of shares in a company organized in that country or on the disposal of shares in an upper tier holding company directly or indirectly owning that company may not satisfy the attribution requirement to do so any such capital gains tax generally would need to be imposed only in situations firpta would tax a nonresident on disposal of shares of a real estate holding company taxes on sales of copyrighted articles a tax imposed by a country on the sale of a copyrighted article g software whether or not digitally delivered by a nonresident may not satisfy the attribution requirement if as is the case in certain jurisdictions the foreign country imposes the tax without regard to whether the nonresident has activities or a physical presence in the country digital services taxes depending on the specifics of foreign law a dst potentially may be analyzed as an income tax or an in lieu of tax the treasury considered both possibilities in the final regulations and included examples illustrating how various flavors of a dst would fail to satisfy the attribution requirement because the hypothetical tax does not satisfy the requirements for attributing gross income based on activities source or the situs or property as applicable diverted profits taxes diverted profits taxes dpts such as those adopted by the united kingdom and australia were explicit targets of the final regulations along with dsts and unsurprisingly may fail the attribution requirement dpts generally apply in different ways to residents and nonresidents of the levying country a dpt imposed on a resident of the country may fail the requirement that transactions with related parties are priced in a manner consistent with the arm s length principle a dpt imposed on a nonresident may fail the requirement that any activities based principle for attribution of gross receipts be based on the nonresident s activities within the foreign country oecd pillar 1 and 2 taxes measures for taxing amount a under a country s rules implementing pillar 1 of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd beps 2 0 project would employ a destination basis principle to reallocate to a country income that under the arm s length principle was properly allocated to another country such a tax would be problematic under the attribution requirement which requires taxes on a nonresident to be applied consistent with the arm s length principle under the pillar 2 undertaxed payment rule utpr a country would deny deductions or impose other adjustments to the income of a taxpayer that is a member of a multinational group with affiliates that have effective tax rates below 15 taxes paid under a utpr also may fail the attribution requirement assuming the utpr is treated as a separate levy although the preambles to the prior regulations and the final regulations indicate that the treasury and the irs may revisit the application of the final regulations in the event a new international consensus is reached through the oecd whether the united states will adopt pillar 1 or fully comply with pillar 2 remains to be seen leaving open the possibility that the final regulations would not be amended to accommodate foreign taxes agreed on as part of beps 2 0 conclusion the final regulations potentially disallow ftcs for foreign withholding taxes that have long been eligible for one as well as the novel extraterritorial taxes explicitly targeted by the treasury and the irs as such taxpayers may need to survey the foreign taxes they currently incur around the world and consider whether these taxes satisfy the attribution requirement in making this determination it may be necessary to seek the advice of foreign counsel in order to understand the basis under foreign law for the imposition of the tax if it is determined that a particular foreign tax is not eligible for an ftc under the final regulations taxpayers may wish to consider alternative structures that could alter the particular mix of foreign taxes that apply with respect to their commercial engagement in a country the net income requirement is redesignated as the cost recovery requirement treas reg 1 901 2 b 5 ii treas reg 1 901 2 b 5 i a treas reg 1 901 2 b 5 i b treas reg 1 901 2 b 5 i b 1 and 2 treas reg 1 901 2 b 5 i c

loans made in 2021 21 9 million have been repaid and 240 loans totaling 14 5 million remain outstanding the 2021 vintage borrowers have until the middle of 2022 to apply for forgiveness and therefore some portion of these loans may remain outstanding well into 2022 the company received origination fees from the sba for participating in the program at origination we recognized as interest income that portion of the fee estimated to be our internal cost of origination the remainder is amortized over the contractual life of the loan if the loan is forgiven or repaid early the remaining

compared to the 9 4 million for the linked quarter and is 522 000 higher than the 8 4 million reported for the prior year quarter the decline in net interest income between the september and december

current period were down 8 0 million compared to that of the linked quarter additionally origination fees recognized as interest income due to ppp forgiveness was 301 000 more in q3 than q4 the

accommodations of monetary policy during the first quarter of 2022 additionally committee members believe that a number of future short term rate hikes may be appropriate over the coming year the company s balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment which will have a positive impact on net income additionally with the majority of our ppp loan originations having been repaid and no longer being a significant headwind to net new loan growth average loan volumes should improve during 2022 non interest income total non interest income is 3 3

equity increased by 2 5 million to 101 2 million at december 31 2021 from 98 7 million at december 31 2020 the increase is primarily comprised of 2021 net income of 11 0 million less the decrease in

rocky recovery from the virus pandemic the unemployment rate fell last month to a pandemic low 3 9 employment data was also closely watched by investors trying to gauge how it would effect the federal reserve s decision to ease up on support for the markets and economy the central bank made it clear early in the pandemic that it was basing much of its support on how quickly employment recovers the fed is now expected to raise interest rates earlier and more often in order to fight rising inflation that threatens to derail a further economic recovery supply chain problems and higher raw materials costs have prompted businesses to raise prices on finished goods and economists are concerned that consumers will eventually grow tired of paying higher prices and cut their spending companies are reminding investors that supply chain problems are still weighing on operations recent inflation reports have been worrisome while economic data on retail sales has also disappointed these are all the things that are justifying some of the sloppiness we re starting the year with hackett said the latest round of corporate earnings is also giving investors a clearer picture of where americans are spending money and how inflation is impacting the economy american airlines fell 3 2 and united airlines slipped 3 4 after warning investors that the latest surge in covid 19 cases will
