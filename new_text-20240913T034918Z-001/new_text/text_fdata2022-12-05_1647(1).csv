the state of new york was relatively quick to ban so called ghost guns the idea of homemade unserialized firearms made them extremely nervous so they banned them heaven forbid people get a gun without asking for permission in the form of a nics check that was of course before they got really stupid with their gun control scheme advertisement of course we told them at the time that it wasn t going to stop bad people from making guns for bad purposes i guess they didn t believe us i also wonder if they re starting to now attorney general letitia james and the new york drug enforcement task force dismantled a ghost gun trafficking ring that operated in queens and suffolk counties a 438 count indictment was unsealed dec 1 before queens supreme court justice peter vallone charging two suffolk residents and a south carolina man from a gun trafficking operation that illegally sold 47 firearms including ghost guns that were shipped to new york and pennsylvania from various online retailers before being assembled the indictment charges fritz pierre louis 46 and devon smith martin 26 both from suffolk county as well as hakeem soloman 26 of sumter south carolina with trafficking numerous ghost guns weapons without serial numbers or other identifying markers including assault weapons machine guns and semiautomatic pistols the gun trafficking operation also sold rapid fire modification devices silencers high capacity magazines and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in total the investigation led to the recovery of 57 firearms 51 of which were ghost guns advertisement it should be noted that suppressors are tightly controlled class 3 devices that are in the same legal category as a machine gun i m not quite sure what they mean by rapid fire modification devices specifically it could be bump stocks binary triggers or a host of other things but if it s bump stocks well those are completely banned now with no grandfather clause for those who had them previously granted no bump stocks are shown in any of the photographs but it s still worth considering basically this arrest kind of shows just how little gun control actually does to criminals sure they ll make more out of the ghost guns because those are the scary things they want people to be afraid of but the fact that these guys were selling suppressors is particularly interesting you see one of the constant arguments revolving around arrests like this is that these things come from states where they re still legal that if other states would follow new york s lead this wouldn t happen however suppressors are controlled at the federal level there are reams of paperwork to fill out approval from law enforcement then approval for the atf all required prior to taking possession of a suppressor advertisement there is no buy it in another state and bring it to new york to it and yet here we are these alleged criminals reportedly had suppressors just the same so with that understanding why should we swoop in and enact ghost gun bans across the nation that likely wouldn t have stopped these guys since heavy restrictions on suppressors didn t in truth while the state and the media are presenting this as anti ghost gun arrests it kind of shows just how pointless a ban on homemade firearms would actually be

completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

in this article we will be taking a look at the 25 most powerful militaries in the world in 2022 to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see 10 most powerful militaries in the world in 2022 the surprises seen in the russia ukraine war theater forced military and defense experts to study modern warfighting and its changing dynamics with more depth the war has shown that even the most powerful militaries despite their huge numbers and technological advancements can fail to perform against significantly weaker opponents due to a variety of reasons having one of the most powerful militaries in the world russia invaded ukraine with ambitious goals but soon started to fail and this performance surprised even the most famous think tanks according to royal united services institute or rusi the ukraine war has underlined several major weaknesses of the russian army for example the offensive and its subsequent failures show that the russian military commanders continue to execute the last received instructions despite their failure until and unless the orders are countermanded the report also says the ukraine war has shown that the russian military is culturally vulnerable to deception the institute believes so for three reasons first it says the russian military develops a systemic confirmation bias because of its tendency to believe any information received as true unless there is contradictory information the second reason is the inability of the russian military commanders to openly report failures third the report says the russian systems are largely designed around single missions chinese military power however the united states military commanders have more to worry about china than russia the us can no longer ignore this ever evolving threat as the asian superpower has swiftly increased its air and naval power along with its technological might rand corporation did threat modeling by comparing different aspects of military power of us and china according to rand s report more than two decades ago china had obsolete russian sa 2 missiles with a range of roughly 35 km today its missile technology is equipped to punish the enemy severely with a range of 200 km the report also adds that the chinese integrated air defense system iads has become a formidable obstacle for the us military however the us now has an advantage with stealth aircraft and new sead suppression of enemy air defenses aircraft in terms of air superiority the rand report said that while the us still has an advantage over china thanks to its fifth generation aircraft including the f 22 and f 35 today if the chinese air force starts a campaign in the western pacific region the us would need several hundred percent more power to maintain its superiority than it needed in 1996 however for now the us remains the most powerful military in the world the russian war and china s increasingly aggressive posture in the pacific is increasing its anxiety and thus forcing it to boost its defense budget thereby helping major defense companies countries in europe have also started increasing their defense spending as they become more aware of the threat posed by russia all of this increased spending is incredibly beneficial to the biggest defense companies in the world some of the major companies expected to report soaring revenues amid this backdrop include northrop grumman corporation nyse noc the boeing company nyse ba general dynamics corporation nyse gd and lockheed martin corporation nyse lmt to rank the countries with the most powerful

the media blitz has puzzled many at a time when the circumstances of the collapse of ftx one of the largest crypto exchanges are still being scrutinised by at least 1mn creditors criminal investigators and civil litigation mr bankman fried told the ft he reasoned that keeping quiet could be seen as tacitly admitting the truth of a lot of theories that have proliferated online about his alleged wrongdoing to the extent that there s a tactical piece of it i think it s basically that things have gotten to the point where frankly there were a lot of conspiracy theories floating around that had no validity mr bankman fried said and to be clear at its core i f ed up i f ed up big and people got hurt and you didn t need a conspiracy theory to get there he faces accusations in a us lawsuit that his companies were a ponzi scheme executives running the company in bankruptcy have said in court filings that ftx appeared to have conceal the misuse of customer funds mr bankman fried has denied intentional wrongdoing blamed his own huge management failures and said he did not fully realise the perilous financial state of ftx until days before it was forced into chapter 11 bankruptcy in delaware in early november he admitted that alameda had been allowed to exceed normal borrowing limits on the ftx exchange since its early days advertisement core to bankman fried s account of how ftx ended up with a roughly us8 billion shortfall of client assets was excessive lending by the exchange to alameda which ploughed the money into venture capital investments and doomed bets on digital tokens mr bankman fried deflected the ft s questions about the excessive borrowing and soured investments that ultimately sank alameda blowing a hole in ftx s finances and would not be drawn on the legal consequences he may face he said he deliberately avoided getting involved in alameda s trading and risk management to avoid conflicts with his position as chief executive of ftx and neglected to monitor the risk they posed to the exchange however he said that in early summer he participated in conversations in which alameda s financial health and borrowing were discussed previously he had suggested he only fully realised its parlous position last month i do remember that there were some discussions around alameda s positions i don t remember numbers from those i don t remember numbers being said i m not sure they weren t i think alameda did some recounting then or some checking in on the health of its position he said he recalled at least one meeting in ftx s nassau office following the crypto market crash in may where staff said that alameda s access to third party loans was being cut back and it might need to borrow more from ftx he said he could not recall who participated my sense of it at the time was something like people taking stock post crash he said advertisement alameda had a number of margin positions open at various borrow lending desks generally net long positions he said and some fraction of these were transferred to ftx as other lenders withdrew credit increasing alameda s liabilities to ftx by around us6 billion asked how the large increase in alameda s borrowing from ftx was approved by the exchange he said i don t feel good about not knowing the answer he said the company did not have a chief risk officer monitoring its margin positions or rules about who needed to sign off on large changes in borrowing as a company we kind of lost track of positional risk in a pretty big and pretty destructive way he said bankman fried also said he was involved in two of alameda s largest uses of funds the 4bn it poured into venture capital and the 3bn he says it spent buying out rival binance s equity stake in ftx those two add up to a pretty big number he said adding that the two uses of cash were the least unsatisfying answer that i have been able to come to in answer to the question of how alameda disbursed billions in ftx s money he said he did not know at the time exactly what funds came from borrowing rather than alameda s trading profits but he said the venture capital investments were effectively some of them on margin advertisement i regret that i regret that quite a bit he added mr bankman fried s attempt to account for what went wrong was laced with caveats and references to his incomplete memory he cited lack of confidence in his answers at least a dozen times calling other responses idle speculation or shitty answers at one point he paused for half a minute with his head in his hands some observers have interpreted his very public mea culpas as an honest attempt to recall a situation that rapidly spiralled out of control others find his explanations implausible several former employees who spoke to the ft questioned his portrayal of ftx as a company that was led off a cliff by the well intentioned bungling of its mostly youthful leadership team ira sorkin the lawyer who defended fraudster bernard madoff told bloomberg that mr bankman fried s media campaign was a mistake you re not going to sway the public the only people that are going to listen to what you have to say are regulators and prosecutors he said but there are indications that it is having some effect hedge fund manager bill ackman last week tweeted call me crazy but i think is telling the truth advertisement maxine waters who will preside over hearings on ftx in the us house of representatives financial services committee later this month said in a tweet that she appreciates mr bankman fried s candour and willingness to talk to the public but despite his public explanations mr bankman fried said he does not expect to win people over i m not expecting positive sentiment at all he said like i don t think i deserve that financial times

disease that occurs more frequently with age the most common clinical type of psoriasis is psoriasis vulgaris plaque psoriasis the involvement of inflammatory cells e g t cells and myeloid dendritic cells and pro inflammatory cytokines e g tumor necrosis factor α interleukin il 12 and il 17 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been well documented there is currently no cure for psoriasis psoriasis vulgaris can be managed with local therapy phototherapy or systemic therapy or any combination of these it is estimated that around 80 of psoriasis patients have mild to moderate psoriasis for those patients topical therapy is used first line about one third of psoriasis patients experience moderate to severe disease systemic medications biologic or nonbiologic or phototherapy are preferred regimens for such patients however long term treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies e g tcs biologic therapies eg antibodies is often limited by safety and tolerability issues with decreasing efficacy over time thus resulting in poor patient adherence due to inconvenient routes of administration eg injections therefore there is an unmet need for safe effective and convenient long term oral therapy for patients with psoriasis atopic dermatitis ad is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by eczematous lesions and intense pruritus affecting up to 20 of children and up to 3 of adults inflammatory infiltrates in these skin lesions include t lymphocytes neutrophils eosinophils monocytes macrophages and mast cells high levels of pde4 activity have also been identified in leukocytes of these patients ad is usually treated with topical therapies primarily intermittent prophylactic use of topical corticosteroids and or topical calcineurin inhibitors along with daily emollients intermittent corticosteroid use poses minimal risk of corticosteroid related adverse effects such as skin atrophy striae formation in sensitive or thin skin areas and systemic effects however long term adherence to topical therapy was low off label use of other conventional systemic oral immunomodulators such as cyclosporine azathioprine and methotrexate may be effective in adult ad patients but patients discontinue treatment due to adverse events or lack of efficacy use of these agents has known safety limitations and requires regular laboratory monitoring therefore better systemic treatment options are needed particularly for ad patients who do not respond well to topical treatment dupilumab a subcutaneous biologic therapy targeting il 4 and il 13 receptors is approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of moderate to severe ad in adults the need for oral treatment options remains imperative in this disease state about orismilast ibi353 orismilast is a next generation pde4 inhibitor with high potency for the pde4 subtypes linked to inflammation currently under development as an oral treatment for psoriasis ad and hs pde4 is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp specific pde that is expressed by immune and inflammatory cells including t lymphocytes neutrophils eosinophils monocytes dendritic cells and macrophages in these cells pde4 is the predominant pde form and pde4 inhibitors increase camp levels high camp levels tend to reduce proliferation and cytokine production whereas low concentrations of camp have the opposite effects pde4 inhibition has previously been shown to downregulate production of a range of proinflammatory cytokines consistent with previously published work orismilast demonstrates a potent and broad anti inflammatory effect by inhibiting the secretion of th1 tnfα and ifng th17 il 22 and il 23 and th2 il 4 il 5 and il 13 effector cytokines in human pbmcs in addition potent inhibition of innate cytokines il 1α and il 1b was also observed these results support further development of orismilast as a potential best in class or first in class pde4 inhibitor for the treatment of chronic

in this article we take a look at 15 most capitalist companies in the world you can skip our detailed analysis of the excesses of capitalism and go directly to 5 most capitalist companies in the world the unbridled capitalism that has gone around in countries like the us has created unprecedented levels of harm on a planetary scale it has resulted in massive resource depletion ecological degradation global warming wealth inequality and labor exploitation the capitalist impact on the planet an mit study in 1972 used world3 a system dynamics simulation with variables like population growth food production industrial output pollution rate and resources to predict that our business as usual approach was grievously unsustainable the study further said that unsustainable capitalistic practices would likely result in collapse of global infrastructure somewhere in the mid 21st century unless measures were taken in time to transition to a more sustainable approach to growth a new study published in yale journal of industrial ecology tested the world3 model with the data of the previous 38 years and vindicated it concluding that we re headed towards a societal collapse if we don t change our practices wealth inequality and labor apart from environmental damage this form of capitalism has also resulted in income inequality for instance bloomberg showed that while the wealth of the top 1 increased by 27 in 2021 the american middle class saw its wealth decline by 26 6 in the same year additionally many companies are known for union busting to maximize shareholder value and prefer that wages are determined by supply and demand according to data from the us bureau of labor statistics union membership has declined from 20 1 in 1983 to 10 3 in 2021 this is reflected in another statistic from the economic policy institute which shows that productivity has gone up by 62 5 while wages in comparison have only grown by 16 from the period 1979 2021 as population and education levels rise more skill oriented people are available for particular jobs the competition becomes more intense and so productivity grows exponentially relative to the linear wage growth this is where esg investing comes in esg is an acronym for environmental social and governance it is a set of standards that determine how ethical a corporation is environmentally socially and in corporate governance it helps socially and environmentally conscious investors to find and invest in companies that share their values in practice esg and corporate finance stern school of business did a meta analysis of a 1000 studies published on esg and corporate financial performance between 2015 2020 and found a positive correlation between corporate esg measures and financial performance in metrics like return on assets and return on equity for 58 of the studies it also found that corporate investment in environmental sustainability not only had no negative effect on short term financial performance but actually had a positive effect in the long term another insight is that a good performance in esg provides downside protection in times of social and or economic crisis as well as improved risk management tech companies have some of the lowest esg risks for instance apple inc nasdaq aapl and microsoft corporation nasdaq msft have esg risk scores of only 16 7 and 15 2 respectively making them some of the most pro esg companies in the world our methodology for our list of the 15 most capitalist companies in the world we ve selected companies with high esg risk scores from the top 25 corporations with the biggest market share we ve gathered esg risk scores from sustainalytics a morningstar firm that rates corporate sustainability it defines esg risk as the risk to a company s economic value from the lack of or poor management of esg factors it calculates esg risk scores based on unmanaged risk to a company unmanaged risk is divided into unmanageable risk risks that can t be managed by the company and management gap risks that can be managed by the company for esg but aren t sustainalytics assign a quantitative esg risk score between 0 and 50 to each company and based on that score it groups them into any of the five risk categories negligible 0 10 low 10 20 medium 20 30 high 30 40 and severe 40 50 15 the geo group inc nyse geo esg risk score

monthly sales november sales data showed a continued sequential slowdown with september s 8 6 growth followed october s 6 7 and november s 5 3 however the wholesaler said sales improved throughout november leading lasser to believe the company could be a winner among late holiday shoppers he also said sales could stabilize in the first quarter as some headwinds recede lasser estimates the first quarter comparable sales figure will come out to a gain of 6 9 but he said cause for concern is not totally unwarranted lasser expects to membership grow by 4 3 to 987 million in the quarter which

continue outperforming according to jefferies and remains the firm s top pick among e commerce and mid cap interest stocks analyst john colantuoni said the online marketplace is still a buy with a 25

over the same period excluding foreign exchange headwinds which will help propel the company to a 13 compound annual growth rate the company will similarly see an upside to both top and bottom lines

services says fixed income assets particularly u s treasuries and investment grade municipal bonds should offer stability to portfolios and generate steady income in 2023 as investors navigate continued volatility the firm wrote in a note to clients monday the gap between bond yields and the earnings yield for stocks which is the inverse of the p e ratio has closed dramatically truist said this simply means that there is now more competition for stocks than there has been for more than a decade this has put downward pressure on equity valuations bonds the firm wrote are poised to compete with stocks which have struggled with less attractive valuations as yields rise heading into the new year truist says investors should remain defensively positioned given that it expects one of the worst years for global growth and a base case that accounts for a 2023 u s recession with a potentially deeper downturn occurring in europe the firm also expects the s p to trade between 3 400 and 4 300 over the next year making the near term risk reward less favorable given this backdrop truist suggests a barbell strategy to equity investing favoring cyclical sectors like energy and industrials and defensive areas like health care and consumer staples energy remains relatively cheap is helped by a refocus on corporate cash flow and is a good hedge should the global economy prove

economy are becoming increasingly less likely as the yield curve inversion deepens said michael darda mkm partners chief economist and market strategist i certainly hope for a soft landing he told cnbc s the exchange on monday i think we all do and no one wants the economy to go into a recession and people to be thrown out of work but i do think it s an increasingly narrow path or window as fed chair powell puts it to a soft landing scenario the broadening inversion of the treasury yield curve is perhaps one of the main reasons that a soft landing is becoming less likely he said the spread between the 10 year and 2 year treasury notes last stood at 77 basis points at this point darda said he would slow or potentially pause rate hikes and wait for more information focusing primarily on forward looking data like the treasury inflation protected securities or tips breakeven rate the fed s focused on coincident and lagging indicators here in terms of when to call it quits and i m afraid a hard landing scenario is more probable than not darda said samantha subin wall street strategists expect stocks to test lows in early 2023 wall street s strategists expect stocks to trade poorly in the first part of next year and some say the market is likely to test its lows in the first quarter strategists say there is still a chance for a yearend santa rally but the stock market is

closed friday lasser said the new price reflected a smaller multiple which he said was justified given the potential impacts to retail as a whole in the event of further consumer pullback still at

economy are becoming increasingly less likely as the yield curve inversion deepens said michael darda mkm partners chief economist and market strategist i certainly hope for a soft landing he told cnbc s the exchange on monday i think we all do and no one wants the economy to go into a recession and people to be thrown out of work but i do think it s an increasingly narrow path or window as fed chair powell puts it to a soft landing scenario the broadening inversion of the treasury yield curve is perhaps one of the main reasons that a soft landing is becoming less likely he said the spread between the 10 year and 2 year treasury notes last stood at 77 basis points at this point darda said he would slow or potentially pause rate hikes and wait for more information focusing primarily on forward looking data like the treasury inflation protected securities or tips breakeven rate the fed s focused on coincident and lagging indicators here in terms of when to call it quits and i m afraid a hard landing scenario is more probable than not darda said samantha subin wall street strategists expect stocks to test lows in early 2023 wall street s strategists expect stocks to trade

view is no different that this is just another bear market rally but trying to take advantage of that things are going pretty well yun li ubs sees high probability of a hard landing for the fed ubs economists doubt the federal reserve will be able to stick the soft landing due to a combination of a weakening labor market slower consumer spending and high interest rates the firm s experts see the

year and a 1 decline in 2024 amid a stalling labor market expansion and inflation near 2 in q4 of next year the full effects of monetary policy tightening remain to be seen plus we estimate fiscal policy is still a drag in 2023 too ubs added we think undoing the imbalances under the strain of higher interest rates should be sufficient to push the us into contraction in 2023 after the current

the florida lawmaker who sponsored the legislation yanking special tax privileges for the walt disney company in the state now says that with the return of former disney chief robert iger it may be possible to negotiate another tax deal similar to the reedy creek improvement district that exempted disney from numerous regulations and various taxes and fees for 50 years advertisement it s more likely we have a better partner to work with now state rep randy fine said mr fine thinks that iger won t get tangled up in state politics as much as his predecessor bob chapek whose emphasis on creating woke content as well as his stand against the parental rights in education law derisively referred to by the left as the don t say gay bill made him many enemies on the right iger s emphasis on creativity and profitability is music to the ears of disney stockholders who have endured 8 billion in losses for the disney streaming service and flops at the box office like the most recent strange world which had the second worst opening weekend in disney history related disney animated film featuring first openly gay main character bombs at box office it s an open question whether the state would have followed through on the legislation and yanked disney s special tax privileges it would have been very complicated and probably raised taxes on a sizable number of florida residents wall street journal disney as the primary landowner at reedy creek has provided most of the revenue from taxes and fees that the district has collected that money covers all the district s governing expenses and is used to service the long term bond debt that reedy creek has issued over the years dissolving the district could be a complicated process and trigger legal battles according to analysts jeff brandes a former senator from the tampa bay area who worked closely with both mr desantis s office and disney s florida government affairs staff until the recent conclusion of his term said that the dispute over reedy creek was kabuki theater from the very start he said republicans in the legislature have long expected disney and the governor s office to work out a deal to avoid raising taxes on residents of the counties surrounding walt disney world and avoid a default on the roughly 1 billion in outstanding bonds issued by reedy creek advertisement indeed governor ron desantis is already looking to make a new deal now that iger is back in charge i think mr iger has already said it probably was a misstep on the company s part and how they handled it fine said in an interview i don t think we d be in this situation if bob iger had been ceo fortune one goal would be to ensure that disney would be responsible for paying back the nearly 1 billion in municipal bonds issued by the special district desantis has said we will have an even playing field for businesses in florida and the state certainly owes no special favors to one company griffin said disney s debts will not fall on the taxpayers of florida a disney spokesperson declined comment in a recent hall meeting with disney employees iger said do i like the company being embroiled in controversy of course not it can be distracting and have a negative impact on the company to the extent i can quiet things down i m going to do that he said adding that he s still getting up to speed on the situation with reedy creek and that he doesn t have all the details about the ramifications of florida s decision so disney will get some of its tax breaks back and has been put on notice as other companies in florida have been that there s a limit to how far you can go against the mainstream
here are the highlights of events related to the war in ukraine over the past 24 hours us intelligence expects a slowdown of the war in ukraine us intelligence expects hostilities in ukraine to develop at a slower pace over the next few months us director of national intelligence avril haines said she saw no evidence of a break in ukraine s will to resist despite russian attacks on energy and other critical infrastructure amid the coming winter at the annual reagan national defense forum in simi valley california haines said we are already seeing a somewhat reduced tempo of the conflict most of the fighting is currently around bakhmut and the donetsk region and has slowed somewhat with russia s withdrawal from the kherson region east of the dnieper river we expect in the coming months that both armies will be in a situation where they will try to re equip re supply in a sense rebuild so that they are prepared for a counter offensive at this stage haines thinks ukraine is more likely to prepare better than russia during this period according to her russian president vladimir putin was surprised that his country s armed forces did not achieve more after their invasion of ukraine but despite this his political goals for the neighboring country have not changed as for the united states other major geopolitical rival china avril haines said president xi jinping does not want to accept western vaccines against covid 19 despite the challenges with the novel coronavirus disease the recent protests against the strict containment measures due to the infection are not a threat to the chinese communist party s power but may affect the situation of xi jinping himself haines said russia s wagner group denies sending bloody packages to ukrainian embassies russia s mercenary firm wagner group denied sending the bloody packages containing animal eyes and a spate of letter bombs to ukrainian embassies and several consulates across europe responding to the allegation of ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba russian foreign ministry spokesperson maria zakharova sent cnn a single word comment psycho and yevgeny prigozhin the russian oligarch and head of the wagner mercenary group said he had nothing to do with the packages and also said that wagner group would never engage in boorish stupid antics earlier kubela accused russia of being behind the more than a dozen letters containing explosives or animal parts that were sent to a series of ukrainian diplomats think about the madness when some hooligans send bomb letters or other offensive things what does this have to do with wagner pmc prigozhin said in a written response to cnn earlier in spain the bloody packages were found with a spate of letter bombs including one that injured a staffer at the ukrainian embassy in madrid this incident has raised suspicion about links to russia while prompting kyiv to ask for increased security at its overseas offices the washington post reported meanwhile the ukrainian foreign ministry called the bloody packages a well planned campaign of intimidation and terror a ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said packages were received at embassies in the netherlands poland croatia italy and austria as well as at consulates in naples and brno in the czech republic yevhenia voloshchenko a ukrainian official in rome said the parcel received at her embassy contained a fish eye czech police said the envelope in brno contained animal tissue adding that it had first been checked for explosives and prompted an evacuation of the immediate surroundings including a kindergarten police said a similar package also arrived at the ukrainian embassy in prague according to the washington post separately the ukrainian ambassador to the holy see said the entrance to his apartment residence in rome had been vandalized with the outside stairwell ceiling and front door smeared with a dirty substance an italian police spokesman said the substance was faecal matter it is unclear whether the letter bombs in spain have any connection to the other incidents across europe the letter bombs were received at a series of high profile locations including the office of prime minister pedro sanchez and the u s embassy in madrid where the letter was disabled in a controlled detonation meanwhile russia s embassy to spain came out in its defence and said that it has no role in the campaign denouncing any threat or terrorist act against a diplomatic mission as totally condemnable wsj oligarch kovalchuk convinced putin to invade ukraine the west was weak one of the most influential voices behind vladimir putin s decision to invade ukraine was that of 71 year old oligarch yury kovalchuk who argued that the war could prove russia s strength this is what the american wall street journal wsj wrote in an extensive article citing people close to the billionaire according to the publication kovalchuk has been a close friend of vladimir putin for decades and shares his vision of russia as a great military power and a cultural counterpoint to the united states the oligarch and the president often met after the start of the war in ukraine talking on the phone and by video link a family friend of kovalchuk and a former senior member of russian intelligence told the publication the us treasury called kovalchuk putin s personal banker when it sanctioned him in 2014 he is also one of the country s biggest media moguls owning an empire of tv channels newspapers and social media that often propagandize the kremlin s line writes the wall street journal thus kovalchuk keeps two of the most important things for the regime money and the media incl the russian social network vkontakte in which a large scale propaganda campaign in support of the war is carried out a physicist by education oligarch kovalchuk is motivated more by patriotic ideology than wealth people who know him say he does not hold an official position in the russian government however it has great influence over kremlin policy and personnel and has helped secure dachas and yachts for putin to use as well as lucrative jobs and stocks for the president s family and friends according to people familiar with the deals financial documents and anti corruption groups putin s partner in law alina kabaeva an olympic champion in rhythmic gymnastics for example is on the board of nmg national media group owned by yury kovalchuk he also controls the sanctioned bank russia россия the two friends sometimes spent hours together talking about the growing conflict with the west russian history and their shared interests the kovalchuk family friend and former russian intelligence official said according to the former intelligence official kovalchuk argued to the president that the west was weak and that the time had come for russia to demonstrate its military might and protect its sovereignty by intervening in ukraine putin and kovalchuk both from st petersburg have a long history in 1991 kovalchuk and his partners acquired bank russia after its owner the communist party of st petersburg was dissolved putin then one of the city s deputy mayors steered business to the bank according to the 2014 book putin s kleptocracy who owns russia of karen dawisha when kovalchuk traveled to moscow after putin became president in 2000 he stayed for several weeks at the presidential dacha according to a person close to the kremlin during that period according to another person close to the kremlin he had a strong influence on

cai meng china daily scholars and policymakers in china have not yet reached a consensus on whether stimulating consumption is the top priority for the chinese economy at the moment some economists argue more about the need to boost growth by expanding investment as they believe that stable investment will be the fastest way to encourage economic expansion my understanding is that competent policymaking departments and economists need to better realize and identify the importance of boosting consumption under china s 20 years of stabilizing investment through infrastructure construction it is necessary to completely change such concepts and realize the significance of encouraging consumption there is still a lot of work to be done on this front if this year s policy is still the same as last year s and the year before it will affect growth stabilization performance in 2023 what makes stimulating consumption for growth so important the main reason behind it is that china s economic structure has changed in normal situations consumption contributes about 65 percent of gdp growth in china therefore as the proportion of fiscal funds spent to stabilize growth conforms to the economic structure roughly 65 percent of fiscal funds are used to stabilize consumption and the remaining 35 percent are put toward stabilizing investment yet in practice most of the fiscal funds are used to stabilize investment this disrupts the overall growth structure with china s economy developing and upgrading rapidly consumption has now become the core factor in economic growth the country has moved beyond the stage of 20 years of rapid urbanization and rapid industrialization and infrastructure investment has been oversaturated therefore if the method of stabilizing investment is once again applied to stabilize growth it will seriously distort the driving force of china s economic growth however i think such understanding has not yet been widely recognized by economists and policymakers and therefore further study on this matter is needed china s previous strategy of stabilizing investment has caused distortions in the overall fiscal expenditure structure last year china s total gdp reached 114 trillion yuan 16 2 trillion the total amount of investment in fixed assets was 55 trillion yuan while fixed asset investment accounted for 48 percent of gdp in comparison in developed countries such as the united states australia japan and european nations the annual total investment in fixed assets accounts for only about 20 percent of the country s gdp long term distorted structure caused by china s large proportion of fixed asset investment in gdp is unsustainable i would argue that if the current economic structure is corrected and adjusted in the next 10 years investment in fixed assets will drop from 55 trillion yuan to 30 40 trillion yuan and then decline further its high growth will undoubtedly crowd out consumption in the economy and have a negative impact here are some ways to boost consumption first efforts should be made to promote consumption in terms of raising incomes instead of working from the production standpoint since 2020 in europe and the united states the key measure to stabilize consumption has been to issue consumption vouchers to residents and this has generated a notable effect in boosting the economy if people s disposable incomes decline consumption will definitely drop therefore efforts must be made to find a way to increase disposable income of chinese consumers however if we talk about increasing disposable incomes and only work on stabilizing employment it would not be sustainable over the long term it is a long term policy to stabilize employment as well as improve the social security system medical system and education system whatever the circumstances are the core of stabilizing consumption is to increase household incomes one way to bring this about is to increase current incomes that is issue consumption vouchers or money to residents it is the correct way to stabilize consumption from the income side another way of effecting this is to increase investment income such as making the stock market more prosperous so that everyone makes money thus leading to higher consumption second efforts should be made to increase the public s marginal propensity to consume by cutting interest rates the best way to increase the marginal propensity to consume in the short term is in fact by reducing interest rates which frees up credit the two methods for stabilizing consumption in europe and the us in 2020 were distribution of money and lowering of interest rates by raising incomes through distribution of money and lowering of interest rates it is possible to increase the general public s marginal propensity to consume people s incomes are divided into two parts one part is used for saving and the other part is used for consumption when savings increase consumption decreases savings are closely related and very responsive to interest rate changes when europe and the us faced economic downturn pressure in 2020 and wanted to stabilize consumption they once lowered interest rates to zero or even negative but china seems to be more conservative with regards to cutting interest rates there are many reasons for china to be shy about cutting interest rates these include the need to prevent real estate bubbles avoid a stock market sell off safeguard against rampant inflation and stabilize the rmb exchange rate the goal of monetary policy is complicated and has many facets it needs to work not only to maintain economic growth but also to stabilize prices support the capital market undergird the housing market and stabilize the exchange rate currently in terms of the stock market the chinese bourse has a flat performance during the past 10 years and share prices of many listed companies have fallen to historic lows a rise in the stock market can increase investment income and benefit consumption in terms of prices china s producer price index has entered negative growth since october currently we do not have serious inflation so from the perspective of prices cutting interest rates will also work in terms of the rmb exchange rate now that the appreciation of the us dollar has ended and interest rate hikes outside china have slowed the pressure of rmb appreciation is gradually picking up therefore to increase the public s marginal propensity to consume and to stabilize consumption we should cut interest rates in addition it is also very important to boost consumption by creating consumption scenarios with engaging consumption activities where consumers can truly interact with shops and products if consumers cannot have such interactions contact consumption in many scenarios will not be realized this involves the impact of covid 19 and how to contain the pandemic in a science based accurate way instead of a one size fits all approach to sum up only by realizing the importance of consumption and work on the income front cutting interest rates and creating more engaging scenarios for consumption can the chinese economy likely see a rebound in the first quarter of next year the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily the author is the director of the wanbo new economic research institute

by michael we continue to get more evidence that the u s economy is really slowing down as you will see below the amount of stuff that we are ordering from manufacturers in china is plunging dramatically i have never seen a dip of this magnitude before and i think that it is a really bad sign for 2023 based on all of the economic numbers that have been released in recent weeks i anticipate that economic conditions in 2023 and beyond will be worse than anything that we have experienced since the great recession so i would encourage you to enjoy the next few weeks while you still can because once 2023 arrives we will want to brace ourselves for an extremely harsh economic environment normally u s consumers have an insatiable appetite for cheap plastic goods from china but now something has changed according to cnbc manufacturing orders from china have fallen by a whopping 40 percent and as a result many chinese factories will be closing much earlier in january than usual u s manufacturing orders in china are down 40 percent according to the latest cnbc supply chain heat map data as a result of the decrease in orders worldwide logistics tells cnbc it is expecting chinese factories to shut down two weeks earlier than usual for the chinese lunar new year chinese new year s eve falls on jan 21 next year the seven days after the holiday are considered a national holiday many of the manufacturers will be closed in early january for the holiday which is much earlier than last year monaghan said as with so many other numbers that we have been getting lately there is no way to possibly spin this to make it look good what we are facing is truly a collapse in demand and as a result container freight rates are absolutely plummeting carriers have been executing on an active capacity management strategy by announcing more blank sailings and suspending services to balance supply with demand the unrelenting decline in container freight rates from asia caused by a collapse in demand is compelling ocean carriers to blank more sailings than ever before as vessel utilization hits new lows said joe monaghan ceo of worldwide logistics group the bottom line is that u s consumers are simply not buying as much stuff as retailers originally anticipated and survey after survey has shown that americans plan to spend less during the holiday season this year here is just one recent example inflation is weighing heavily on the holidays this year roughly half of shoppers will buy fewer things due to higher prices and more than one third said they will rely on coupons to cut down on the cost according to a recent survey of more than 1 000 adults by retailmenot of course consumers over in western europe are suffering right now as well in fact economic conditions are deteriorating even faster over there if you can believe it one recent survey found that approximately two thirds of all adults in the uk are worried that they will not be able to afford christmas dinner two thirds of adults are worried that they will not be able to afford christmas dinner according to a survey the survey commissioned by the salvation army calculated the cost of christmas dinner at 7 50 per head but as the price of food is continuing to rise the cost has increased since the survey was carried out on 22 october all over the western world we are facing an unprecedented cost of living crisis we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us inflation has been rising much faster than our paychecks have and that is causing a tremendous amount of financial pain meanwhile a lot of people have seen the value of their investments go down substantially over the past 12 months i really feel badly for those that were heavily invested in crypto there are many tokens that have lost more than 70 of their value and the collapse of ftx has raised questions about whether crypto has a future already reeling from the so called crypto winter investors were dealt a major blow with the high profile collapse of sam bankman fried s ftx exchange in early november which sent bitcoin tumbling to top it off blackrock chief executive larry fink said this week that he expects most crypto companies will fold after ftx s demise a schwab index tracking crypto linked stocks is coming off its worst month since june and is down 63 this year questions about whether crypto has a future have become prevalent after a year during which many tokens lost more than 70 of their value and the collapse of ftx has exacerbated a crisis of confidence that had started in the spring said mark palmer an analyst at btig llc at the same time home values have been falling and falling as i have covered in previous articles u s homeowners lost a record high 1 3 trillion dollars in home equity during the third quarter alone but at least the latest employment number that the government gave us was good right actually it wasn t so good it turns out that the household and establishment surveys are telling two completely different stories zero hedge has posted an absolutely outstanding article that breaks this down in great detail recall that back in august september and october we showed that a stark divergence had opened between the household and establishment surveys that comprise the monthly jobs report and since march the former has been stagnant while the latter has been rising every single month in addition to that full time jobs were plunging while part time jobs were surging and the number of multiple jobholders soared fast forward to today when the inconsistencies not only continue to grow but have become downright grotesque i would encourage you to read the entire article since march the gap between the household and establishment surveys has ballooned to nearly 2 7 million workers and some are suggesting that this is being done for political purposes what is even more perplexing is that despite the continued rise in nonfarm payrolls the household survey continues to telegraph growing weakness and as of nov 30 the gap that opened in march has since grown to a whopping 2 7 million workers which may or may not exist anywhere besides the spreadsheet model of some bls or is that blm political activist of course the truth is that the employment market is not in good shape according to challenger gray christmas the number of layoffs in november 2022 was 417 percent higher than it was in november 2021 a tsunami of layoffs has begun and i expect to see a whole lot more in the months ahead so it is quite likely that this will be a really gloomy month but i expect that 2023 will be even gloomier

by teng tai china daily updated 2022 12 05 09 17 cai meng china daily scholars and policymakers in china have not yet reached a consensus on whether stimulating consumption is the top priority for the chinese economy at the moment some economists argue more about the need to boost growth by expanding investment as they believe that stable investment will be the fastest way to encourage economic expansion my understanding is that competent policymaking departments and economists need to better realize and identify the importance of boosting consumption under china s 20 years of stabilizing investment through infrastructure construction it is necessary to completely change such concepts and realize the significance of encouraging consumption there is still a lot of work to be done on this front if this year s policy is still the same as last year s and the year before it will affect growth stabilization performance in 2023 what makes stimulating consumption for growth so important the main reason behind it is that china s economic structure has changed in normal situations consumption contributes about 65 percent of gdp growth in china therefore as the proportion of fiscal funds spent to stabilize growth conforms to the economic structure roughly 65 percent of fiscal funds are used to stabilize consumption and the remaining 35 percent are put toward stabilizing investment yet in practice most of the fiscal funds are used to stabilize investment this disrupts the overall growth structure with china s economy developing and upgrading rapidly consumption has now become the core factor in economic growth the country has moved beyond the stage of 20 years of rapid urbanization and rapid industrialization and infrastructure investment has been oversaturated therefore if the method of stabilizing investment is once again applied to stabilize growth it will seriously distort the driving force of china s economic growth however i think such understanding has not yet been widely recognized by economists and policymakers and therefore further study on this matter is needed china s previous strategy of stabilizing investment has caused distortions in the overall fiscal expenditure structure last year china s total gdp reached 114 trillion yuan 16 2 trillion the total amount of investment in fixed assets was 55 trillion yuan while fixed asset investment accounted for 48 percent of gdp in comparison in developed countries such as the united states australia japan and european nations the annual total investment in fixed assets accounts for only about 20 percent of the country s gdp long term distorted structure caused by china s large proportion of fixed asset investment in gdp is unsustainable i would argue that if the current economic structure is corrected and adjusted in the next 10 years investment in fixed assets will drop from 55 trillion yuan to 30 40 trillion yuan and then decline further its high growth will undoubtedly crowd out consumption in the economy and have a negative impact here are some ways to boost consumption first efforts should be made to promote consumption in terms of raising incomes instead of working from the production standpoint since 2020 in europe and the united states the key measure to stabilize consumption has been to issue consumption vouchers to residents and this has generated a notable effect in boosting the economy if people s disposable incomes decline consumption will definitely drop therefore efforts must be made to find a way to increase disposable income of chinese consumers however if we talk about increasing disposable incomes and only work on stabilizing employment it would not be sustainable over the long term it is a long term policy to stabilize employment as well as improve the social security system medical system and education system whatever the circumstances are the core of stabilizing consumption is to increase household incomes one way to bring this about is to increase current incomes that is issue consumption vouchers or money to residents it is the correct way to stabilize consumption from the income side another way of effecting this is to increase investment income such as making the stock market more prosperous so that everyone makes money thus leading to higher consumption second efforts should be made to increase the public s marginal propensity to consume by cutting interest rates the best way to increase the marginal propensity to consume in the short term is in fact by reducing interest rates which frees up credit the two methods for stabilizing consumption in europe and the us in 2020 were distribution of money and lowering of interest rates by raising incomes through distribution of money and lowering of interest rates it is possible to increase the general public s marginal propensity to consume people s incomes are divided into two parts one part is used for saving and the other part is used for consumption when savings increase consumption decreases savings are closely related and very responsive to interest rate changes when europe and the us faced economic downturn pressure in 2020 and wanted to stabilize consumption they once lowered interest rates to zero or even negative but china seems to be more conservative with regards to cutting interest rates there are many reasons for china to be shy about cutting interest rates these include the need to prevent real estate bubbles avoid a stock market sell off safeguard against rampant inflation and stabilize the rmb exchange rate the goal of monetary policy is complicated and has many facets it needs to work not only to maintain economic growth but also to stabilize prices support the capital market undergird the housing market and stabilize the exchange rate currently in terms of the stock market the chinese bourse has a flat performance during the past 10 years and share prices of many listed companies have fallen to historic lows a rise in the stock market can increase investment income and benefit consumption in terms of prices china s producer price index has entered negative growth since october currently we do not have serious inflation so from the perspective of prices cutting interest rates will also work in terms of the rmb exchange rate now that the appreciation of the us dollar has ended and interest rate hikes outside china have slowed the pressure of rmb appreciation is gradually picking up therefore to increase the public s marginal propensity to consume and to stabilize consumption we should cut interest rates in addition it is also very important to boost consumption by creating consumption scenarios with engaging consumption activities where consumers can truly interact with shops and products if consumers cannot have such interactions contact consumption in many scenarios will not be realized this involves the impact of covid 19 and how to contain the pandemic in a science based accurate way instead of a one size fits all approach to sum up only by realizing the importance of consumption and work on the income front cutting interest rates and creating more engaging scenarios for consumption can the chinese economy likely see a rebound in the first quarter of next year the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily the author is the director of the wanbo new

this year the united states became the world s biggest liquefied natural gas lng exporter as deliveries to energy starved buyers in europe and asia surged in the current year five developers have signed over 20 long term deals to supply more than 30 million metric tons year of lng to energy starved buyers in europe and asia as energy analysts rbn energy notes the first wave of lng export expansion has mostly gone smoothly thanks to fast rising natural gas supplies in the lower 48 and a slew of pipeline reversals and expansions that allowed low cost marcellus utica gas supplies to reach gulf coast markets but with lng demand already high and set to grow at a frenetic pace the big question becomes how quickly can the united states ramp up production to meet future demand there s been no shortage of long term offtake deals signed by multiple u s gas producers in june german utility enbw announced that it had signed a 20 year deal for a substantial supply of lng from u s based exporter venture global in the same month energy transfer lp nyse et signed an lng sale and purchase agreement spa with china gas holdings chevron inc nyse cvx signed a 4mtpa lng offtake deal with venture global and tellurian inc nyse tell signed an lng sales and purchase agreement spa with commodity trader vitol in july cheniere energy nyse lng signed an offtake deal with thailand s state owned energy company ptt finally in september australian energy giant woodside energy group ltd finalized offtake agreements for u s supply from commonwealth lng related power prices scream higher in europe as wind power slumps overall offtakers have committed to more than 31 mmtpa of u s lng supply with term lengths ranging from 15 to 25 years but a lot more than that is likely to be demanded over the next couple of years rbn estimates that there s another 100 mmtpa 14 3 bcf d or so of proposed lng export capacity with a medium to high chance of progressing in the next three years including at least three projects totaling almost 19 mmtpa 2 5 bcf d that we believe are highly likely to take fid within the next 12 months that s out of a universe of nearly 30 projects we track in the lng voyager quarterly representing over 280 mmtpa 38 3 bcf d of potential export capacity the bulk of it along the texas and louisiana coasts according to rbn availability of feedgas supply where and when it is needed is going to be one of the major factors that will influence the timing and commercialization of future lng projects where will all the gas come from rbn notes that the appalachia was by far the biggest contributor to u s natural gas growth over the last decade during the timeframe lower 48 dry gas production climbed nearly 30 bcf from an average 70 bcf d in 2014 to 99 6 bcf d currently during which appalachian output more than doubled and drove 18 5 bcf d of that overall growth the permian came in a distant second growing production by 11 2 bcf d while the eagle ford saw production decline by 1 bcf d meanwhile the haynesville was the third fastest growing region on an absolute volume basis up from 9 5 bcf d in 2014 to 15 3 bcf d currently finally the anadarko niobrara and bakken rose by a combined 4 6 bcf d over the timeframe however the energy experts have predicted that the second wave of u s lng growth will favor the southern basins rbn estimates that appalachia has the potential to ramp up production by almost 8 bcf d to 42 bcf d over the next 10 years if unconstrained by pipeline takeaway capacity however the analysts say that s unlikely to happen given strong headwinds for midstream development in the region the appalachian basin is the country s largest gas producing region churning out more than 35 bcf d unfortunately environmental groups have repeatedly stopped or slowed down pipeline projects and limited further growth in the northeast indeed eqt corp nyse eqt ceo toby rice recently acknowledged that appalachian pipeline capacity has hit a wall as a result rbn says production growth in the basin is likely to be closer to just 3 bcf d capping production at just under 38 bcf d on an annual average meanwhile growth in the anadarko niobrara and bakken is likely to remain modest altogether adding 3 3 bcf d to reach almost 15 5 bcf d by 2032 in other words the bulk of u s lng growth in this post shale boom era will come from the texas and louisiana basins rbn notes that both the permian and haynesville have been at the epicenter of midstream development in recent months while the eagle ford has been showing signs of a production recovery of late after a decline in recent years analysts at east daley capital inc have projected that u s lng exports will grow to 26 3 bcf d by 2030 from their current level of nearly 13 bcf d for this to happen the analysts say another 2 4 bcf d of takeaway capacity would need to come online between 2026 and 2030 in the haynesville alone advertisement this assumes significant gas growth from the permian and other associated gas plays any view where oil prices take enough of a dip to slow that activity in the permian and you re going to have even more of a call for gas from gassier basins the analysts have said either way it s going to be a real challenge for the united states to meet those targets because takeaway constraints including limited pipeline capacity are seen as the biggest hurdle to growth of the sector despite the country being home to the world s largest backlog of near shovel ready lng projects by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads from

rockville md and suzhou china dec 4 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases and union therapeutics a s union a privately held multi asset clinical stage pharmaceutical development company focused on immunology and infectious diseases today announced that the first chinese healthy volunteer has been successfully dosed in the phase i study of orismilast innovent r d code ibi353 a potential best in class pde4 inhibitor in global clinical phase ii stage this study ctr 20222393 is a multiple dose escalation phase i study in healthy volunteers aiming to evaluate the pharmacokinetic pk profile safety and tolerability of orismilast in healthy chinese subjects after multiple doses to support the subsequent clinical development of orismilast in multiple indications such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis ad orismilast is a next generation pde4 inhibitor with high potency for the pde4 subtypes linked to inflammation in 2021 innovent reached a strategic cooperation with union to obtain exclusive rights to the research development and commercialization of orismilast in china including mainland china hong kong macao and taiwan orismilast has generated positive proof of concept poc data in psoriasis administered orally and in ad administered topically and is being developed as a potential best or first in class oral treatment option in both diseases compared to other pde4 inhibitors the selectivity of orismilast for pde4 subtypes b and d and the novel modified release delivery is expected to generate a favorable therapeutic window potentially resulting in improved efficacy and tolerability dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated there is currently no cure for psoriasis and there is a great unmet clinical need in this field orismilast is a new target molecule innovent laid out in the field of autoimmunity by co development with union it is potentially one of the best candidates in the mid stage of clinical development at innovent the results of ex china clinical studies have demonstrated that orismilast has good safety profile and biological activity the ongoing phase i study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of orismilast in chinese healthy volunteers and provide the basis for further clinical development we will accelerate the clinical development of orismilast in chinese subjects with psoriasis or ad in order to obtain regulatory approval as soon as possible in china and to fulfill the needs of safe effective and convenient long term oral treatment for patients thus significantly reducing the disease burden of patients and their pain we will truly uphold our mission of to develop and commercialize high quality biopharmaceuticals that are affordable to ordinary people kim kjøller ceo of union therapeutics stated we are excited by the strong advancement of orismilast by innovent which is essential in our joint efforts to provide this novel treatment to patients with dermatological diseases globally we have seen good progress in our three late stage clinical trials with orismilast for treatment of psoriasis atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurative respectively this together with the now ongoing phase i study in china is important steps in the development of orismilast about psoriasis and atopic dermatitis ad psoriasis is a multisystem disease characterized by well defined erythematous scaly plaques that are often pruritic estimates of psoriasis prevalence range from 0 51 to 11 43 in adults and 0 to 1 37 in children psoriasis is a common disease that occurs more frequently with age the most common clinical type of psoriasis is psoriasis vulgaris plaque psoriasis the involvement of inflammatory cells e g t cells and myeloid dendritic cells and pro inflammatory cytokines e g tumor necrosis factor α interleukin il 12 and il 17 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been well documented there is currently no cure for psoriasis psoriasis vulgaris can be managed with local therapy phototherapy or systemic therapy or any combination of these it is estimated that around 80 of psoriasis patients have mild to moderate psoriasis for those patients topical therapy is used first line about one third of psoriasis patients experience moderate to severe disease systemic medications biologic or nonbiologic or phototherapy are preferred regimens for such patients however long term treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies e g tcs biologic therapies eg antibodies is often limited by safety and tolerability issues with decreasing efficacy over time thus resulting in poor patient adherence due to inconvenient routes of administration eg injections therefore there is an unmet need for safe effective and convenient long term oral therapy for patients with psoriasis atopic dermatitis ad is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by eczematous lesions and intense pruritus affecting up to 20 of children and up to 3 of adults inflammatory infiltrates in these skin lesions include t lymphocytes neutrophils eosinophils monocytes macrophages and mast cells high levels of pde4 activity have also been identified in leukocytes of these patients ad is usually treated with topical therapies primarily intermittent prophylactic use of topical corticosteroids and or topical calcineurin inhibitors along with daily emollients intermittent corticosteroid use poses minimal risk of corticosteroid related adverse effects such as skin atrophy striae formation in sensitive or thin skin areas and systemic effects however long term adherence to topical therapy was low off label use of other conventional systemic oral immunomodulators such as cyclosporine azathioprine and methotrexate may be effective in adult ad patients but patients discontinue treatment due to adverse events or lack of efficacy use of these agents has known safety limitations and requires regular laboratory monitoring therefore better systemic treatment options are needed particularly for ad patients who do not respond well to topical treatment dupilumab a subcutaneous biologic therapy targeting il 4 and il 13 receptors is approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of moderate to severe ad in adults the need for oral treatment options remains imperative in this disease state about orismilast ibi353 orismilast is a next generation pde4 inhibitor with high potency for the pde4 subtypes linked to inflammation currently under development as an oral treatment for psoriasis ad and hs pde4 is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp specific pde that is expressed by immune and inflammatory cells including t lymphocytes neutrophils eosinophils monocytes dendritic cells and macrophages in these cells pde4 is the predominant pde form and pde4 inhibitors increase camp levels high camp levels tend to reduce proliferation and cytokine production whereas low concentrations of camp have the opposite effects pde4 inhibition has previously been shown to downregulate production of a range of proinflammatory cytokines consistent with previously published work orismilast demonstrates a potent and broad anti inflammatory effect by inhibiting the secretion of th1 tnfα and ifng th17 il 22 and il 23 and th2 il 4 il 5 and il 13 effector cytokines in human pbmcs in addition potent inhibition of innate cytokines il 1α and il 1b was also observed these results support further development of orismilast as a potential best in class or first in class pde4 inhibitor for the treatment of chronic

the uk s big bang 2 0 is taking shape it is however more of a pop than a bang from some easing of the ring fencing of retail banking operations from investment banking to removing the cap on banker bonuses and reducing a surcharge on big bank profits the uk government is looking to ease some financial crisis era restrictions on uk banks london is losing its lustre as a global financial powethouse credit bloomberg the economic secretary to the uk treasury andrew griffith foreshadowed the changes to the ring fencing regime at a conference last week last month the uk chancellor of the exchequer jeremy hunt outlined the plan to cut the surcharge on big bank profits from 8 per cent to 3 per cent earlier in the year the government announced it would lift the cap on bonuses of 200 per cent of bankers salaries it s not quite the big bang that margaret thatcher presided over in the 1980s when wholesale deregulation of london s financial markets and banking opened up the markets to foreign institutions and led to a dramatic increase in activity and foreign participation
ghana plans to barter its gold for oil to reduce reliance on its us dollar reserves ghana is putting together a proposal to acquire oil products in exchange for its gold with the strategy being to reduce the expenditure of its us currency reserves vice president of the african nation dr mahamudu bawumia announced the proposal on 24 november via his facebook platform if it moves ahead the policy is set to be implemented sometime in the first quarter of next year which could also relieve some inflationary pressure on the ghanian cedi its national currency the cedi has lost over 50 of its value against the us dollar so far this year record inflation numbers and growing public debt have pressured ghanaian policymakers to prepare some unorthodox strategies to stabilise its currency will fundamentally change our balance of payments and significantly reduce the persistent depreciation of our currency dr bawumia said cost of living crisis he also noted that the policy would detether ghana s refined oil imports from currency risk as its citizens struggle with a cost of living crisis refined oil is ghana s top import and most of it is sourced from countries in the european union such as the netherlands due to rising interest rates the euro has appreciated in value significantly against the cedi leading to red hot fuel prices in the country bartering gold for oil to address the issue dr bawumia said the proposal involves bartering ghana s sustainably mined gold for the required refined oil a spokesperson for dr bawumia gideon boako said ghana would purchase gold domestically using its central bank and then use the precious metal to obtain refined oil products in the form of government to government transactions this is intended to eliminate the problems caused to the cedi by the foreign exchange market ghana s move to acquire its needed imports through its plentiful natural resources may set an example for other african nations to do the same as well as a larger decoupling from the us dollar in africa intra african trade the international monetary fund imf reported that the average of intra african imports and exports only stood at 15 from 2015 to 2017 this low amount of trade between african countries was said to be partially caused by monies needing to be wired to the united states or europe before it can be finally remitted to its intended destination within africa leading to billions of dollars in foreign exchange fees being charged to african consumers each year a possible bartering between african nations using natural resources could help stabilise their respective currencies during periods of high inflation and volatility as well as shield them from the hawkish policies of central banks like the federal reserve in the us
we continue to get more evidence that the u s economy is really slowing down as you will see below the amount of stuff that we are ordering from manufacturers in china is plunging dramatically i have never seen a dip of this magnitude before and i think that it is a really bad sign for 2023 based on all of the economic numbers that have been released in recent weeks i anticipate that economic conditions in 2023 and beyond will be worse than anything that we have experienced since the great recession so i would encourage you to enjoy the next few weeks while you still can because once 2023 arrives we will want to brace ourselves for an extremely harsh economic environment normally u s consumers have an insatiable appetite for cheap plastic goods from china but now something has changed according to cnbc manufacturing orders from china have fallen by a whopping 40 percent and as a result many chinese factories will be closing much earlier in january than usual u s manufacturing orders in china are down 40 percent according to the latest cnbc supply chain heat map data as a result of the decrease in orders worldwide logistics tells cnbc it is expecting chinese factories to shut down two weeks earlier than usual for the chinese lunar new year chinese new year s eve falls on jan 21 next year the seven days after the holiday are considered a national holiday many of the manufacturers will be closed in early january for the holiday which is much earlier than last year monaghan said as with so many other numbers that we have been getting lately there is no way to possibly spin this to make it look good what we are facing is truly a collapse in demand and as a result container freight rates are absolutely plummeting carriers have been executing on an active capacity management strategy by announcing more blank sailings and suspending services to balance supply with demand the unrelenting decline in container freight rates from asia caused by a collapse in demand is compelling ocean carriers to blank more sailings than ever before as vessel utilization hits new lows said joe monaghan ceo of worldwide logistics group the bottom line is that u s consumers are simply not buying as much stuff as retailers originally anticipated and survey after survey has shown that americans plan to spend less during the holiday season this year here is just one recent example inflation is weighing heavily on the holidays this year roughly half of shoppers will buy fewer things due to higher prices and more than one third said they will rely on coupons to cut down on the cost according to a recent survey of more than 1 000 adults by retailmenot of course consumers over in western europe are suffering right now as well in fact economic conditions are deteriorating even faster over there if you can believe it one recent survey found that approximately two thirds of all adults in the uk are worried that they will not be able to afford christmas dinner two thirds of adults are worried that they will not be able to afford christmas dinner according to a survey the survey commissioned by the salvation army calculated the cost of christmas dinner at 7 50 per head but as the price of food is continuing to rise the cost has increased since the survey was carried out on 22 october all over the western world we are facing an unprecedented cost of living crisis inflation has been rising much faster than our paychecks have and that is causing a tremendous amount of financial pain meanwhile a lot of people have seen the value of their investments go down substantially over the past 12 months i really feel badly for those that were heavily invested in crypto there are many tokens that have lost more than 70 of their value and the collapse of ftx has raised questions about whether crypto has a future already reeling from the so called crypto winter investors were dealt a major blow with the high profile collapse of sam bankman fried s ftx exchange in early november which sent bitcoin tumbling to top it off blackrock chief executive larry fink said this week that he expects most crypto companies will fold after ftx s demise a schwab index tracking crypto linked stocks is coming off its worst month since june and is down 63 this year questions about whether crypto has a future have become prevalent after a year during which many tokens lost more than 70 of their value and the collapse of ftx has exacerbated a crisis of confidence that had started in the spring said mark palmer an analyst at btig llc at the same time home values have been falling and falling as i have covered in previous articles u s homeowners lost a record high 1 3 trillion dollars in home equity during the third quarter alone but at least the latest employment number that the government gave us was good right actually it wasn t so good it turns out that the household and establishment surveys are telling two completely different stories zero hedge has posted an absolutely outstanding article that breaks this down in great detail recall that back in august september and october we showed that a stark divergence had opened between the household and establishment surveys that comprise the monthly jobs report and since march the former has been stagnant while the latter has been rising every single month in addition to that full time jobs were plunging while part time jobs were surging and the number of multiple jobholders soared fast forward to today when the inconsistencies not only continue to grow but have become downright grotesque i would encourage you to read the entire article since march the gap between the household and establishment surveys has ballooned to nearly 2 7 million workers and some are suggesting that this is being done for political purposes what is even more perplexing is that despite the continued rise in nonfarm payrolls the household survey continues to telegraph growing weakness and as of nov 30 the gap that opened in march has since grown to a whopping 2 7 million workers which may or may not exist anywhere besides the spreadsheet model of some bls or is that blm political activist of course the truth is that the employment market is not in good shape according to challenger gray christmas the number of layoffs in november 2022 was 417 percent higher than it was in november 2021 a tsunami of layoffs has begun and i expect to see a whole lot more in the months ahead so it is quite likely that this will be a really gloomy month but i expect that 2023 will be even gloomier it is finally here michael s new book entitled end times is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled end times is now available on amazon com in addition to my new book i have written six other books that are available on amazon com including 7 year apocalypse lost prophecies of the future of america

already done so i strongly urge you to invite jesus christ to be your lord and savior today
many of the companies promising net zero emissions to protect the climate are relying on vast swaths of forests and what are known as carbon offsets to meet that goal on paper carbon offsets appear to balance out a company s carbon emissions the company pays to protect trees which absorb carbon dioxide from the air the company can then claim the absorbed carbon dioxide as an offset that reduces its net impact on the climate however our new satellite analysis reveals what researchers have suspected for years forest offsets might not actually be doing much for the climate when we looked at satellite tracking of carbon levels and logging activity in california forests we found that carbon isn t increasing in the state s 37 offset project sites any more than in other areas and timber companies aren t logging less than they did before the findings send a pretty grim message about efforts to control climate change and they add to a growing list of concerns about forest offsets studies have already shown that projects are often overcredited at the beginning and might not last as long as expected in this case we re finding a bigger issue a lack of real climate benefit over the 10 years of the program so far but we also see ways to fix the problem how forest carbon offsets work forest carbon offsets work like this trees capture carbon dioxide from the air and use it to build mass effectively locking the carbon away in their wood for the life of the tree in california landowners can receive carbon credits for keeping carbon stocks above a minimum required baseline level third party verifiers help the landowners take inventory by manually measuring a sample of trees so far this process has only involved measuring carbon levels relative to baseline and has not leveraged the emerging satellite technologies that we explored forest owners can then sell the carbon credits to private companies with the idea that they have protected trees that would otherwise be cut down these include large oil and gas companies that use offsets to meet up to 8 percent of their state mandated reductions in emissions forest offsets and other natural climate solutions have received a great deal of attention from companies governments and nonprofits including during the un climate conference in november 2022 california has one of the world s largest carbon offset programs with tens of millions of dollars flowing through offset projects and is often a model for other countries that are planning new offset programs it s clear that offsets are playing a large and growing role in climate policy from the individual to the international level in our view they need to be backed by the best available science three potential problems our study used satellite data to track carbon levels tree harvesting rates and tree species in forest offset projects compared with other similar forests in california satellites offer a more complete record than on the ground reports collected at offset projects that allowed us to assess all of california since 1986 from this broad view we identified three problems indicating a lack of climate benefit carbon isn t being added to these projects faster than before the projects began or faster than in non offset areas many of the projects are owned and operated by large timber companies which manage to meet requirements for offset credits by keeping carbon above the minimum baseline level however these lands have been heavily harvested and continue to be harvested in some regions projects are being put on lands with lower value tree species that aren t at risk from logging for example at one large timber company in the redwood forests of northwestern california the offset project is only 4 percent redwood compared with 25 percent redwood on the rest of the company s property instead the offset project s area is overgrown with tanoak which is not marketable timber and doesn t need to be protected from logging how california can fix its offset program our research points to a set of recommendations for california to improve its offsets protocols one recommendation is to begin using satellite data to monitor forests and confirm that they are indeed being managed to protect or store more carbon for example it could help foresters create more realistic baselines to compare offsets against publicly available satellite data is improving and can help make carbon offsetting more transparent and reliable california can also avoid putting offset projects on lands that are already being conserved we found several projects owned by conservation groups on land that already had low harvest rates additionally california could improve its offset contract protocols to make sure landowners can t withdraw from an offset program in the future and cut down those trees currently there is a penalty for doing so but it might not be high enough landowners may be able to begin a project receive a huge profit from the initial credits cut down the trees in 20 to 30 years pay back their credits plus penalty and still come out ahead if inflation exceeds the liability ironically while intended to help mitigate climate change forest offsets are also vulnerable to it particularly in wildfire prone california research suggests that california is hugely underestimating the climate risks to forest offset projects in the state the state protocol requires only 2 percent or 4 percent of carbon credits be set aside in an insurance pool against wildfires even though multiple projects have been damaged by recent fires when wildfires occur the lost carbon can be accounted for by the insurance pool however the pool may soon be depleted as yearly burned area increases in a warming climate the insurance pool must be large enough to cover the worsening droughts wildfires and disease and beetle infestations considering our findings around the challenges of forest carbon offsets focusing on other options such as investing in solar and electrification projects in low income urban areas may provide more cost effective reliable and just outcomes without improvements to the current system we may be underestimating our net emissions contributing to the profits of large emitters and landowners and distracting from the real solutions of transitioning to a clean energy economy shane coffield

photo by bert bostelmann laif camerapress albert edwards likes patterns his shirts and the wallpaper in his house are decorated with bold repeating motifs he has been seeking them in markets and economic data for four decades during which time he was voted the top strategist in the annual extel survey of the investment industry for a record 15 years running what s made edwards so popular is not that he s always right but that he s always unafraid to speak his mind as global strategist at société générale the multinational french bank edwards offers the alternative view as a useful counterpoint to accepted thinking about economies and markets i ve never minded being right out on a limb on a lot of a lot of different issues he tells me his detailed predictions of a global recession in the summer of 2008 were an outlier during what many agreed was an economic boom three months later he was fêted as someone with a knack for spotting icebergs one of the problems edwards sees in the uk economy today is that a narrative has taken over that liz truss crashed the economy and rishi sunak and jeremy hunt have put it back in business and a dangerous economic model in which the central bank prints new money while the government keeps a fierce grip on its purse strings has been reimposed edwards calls this combination of loose monetary and tight fiscal policy the davos consensus it s the successor he says to the washington consensus the agreement among free market neoliberals that trade liberalisation deregulation lower headline tax rates and privatisation were the route to widespread economic growth after the 1997 asian currency crisis the washington consensus was told to get stuffed he says in the ruins of the 2008 crash a new agreement was struck a commitment to next to nothing interest rates quantitative easing qe and low government spending that produced 14 years in which asset prices and inequality boomed while real wages did nothing hosing qe into the economy wasn t in my view particularly effective edwards says except at inflating the prices of houses and financial assets some of which it was hoped would spill over into the real economy it s for this reason that while he was by no means a supporter of truss edwards was sympathetic to the central thrust of the short lived prime minister s economic position which was that the post 2008 consensus between central bankers and governments hadn t worked this has caused a lot of problems he says it s caused inequality it has caused intergenerational strife especially in terms of house

fuelled populism and a teetering edifice of illusory growth if free money was the route to economic prosperity argentina would be the richest country in the world by now he observes and it s not as a top strategist at one of the world s largest banks socgen is larger by assets than barclays deutsche bank or goldman sachs edwards is not someone you d expect to criticise financialisation but he says that while banks have been much more carefully regulated since 2008 qe encouraged the rest of the economy to load up on the kind of risk that had once been contained to wall street in the last cycle it was the banks that blew up but this time around the excess leverage will reveal itself elsewhere in the real economy or the financial sector as we ve seen with the liquidity crisis in uk pension funds the simple fact is when money is free borrowers and lenders do stupid things the pandemic he says made the impact of qe even more serious because where before it had mostly inflated financial asset prices stimulus packages meant the new money was injected into the veins of main street rather than wall street given the obvious supply constraints created by covid it didn t take a genius to work out this was going to cause an outbreak of inflation central bankers however have long got away with blaming other people for their mistakes edwards says after 2008 the bank of england s failure to recognise the risks developing in britain s financial sector was played down and commercial bankers such as the fred goodwin the chief executive of rbs became the villains of the crash this year as edwards sees it the bank was able to blame its failure to address the danger of an economy and a financial system hooked on quantitative easing and free money on the geopolitical situation and on a new government that was already unpopular they used the global financial crisis as an excuse to gut our public services there s plenty of evidence to support the view that truss and her chancellor kwasi kwarteng s mini budget in september didn t actually cause the disaster that followed it s true that the fiscal statement included a commitment to fund tax cuts through new borrowing which the government does by selling bonds known as gilts it s true that the truss government failed to communicate its plans well or to produce economic forecasts which edwards describes as one of those illusions like to grip onto but he points out that most of what the government was going to do was known weeks in advance and priced in by investors it s also true that the day before kwarteng delivered the statement the bank of england announced its own plan for quantitative tightening qt which also involves selling huge volumes of gilts onto the market from the 841bn pile of gilts that it holds in its asset purchase facility to try to restrain inflation as edwards puts it that meant shovelling about the same amount into the gilts market which the tax cuts were going to be doing if we were doing qe now and interest rates were close to zero probably that budget would have had absolutely no impact on gilts yet the narrative took hold as during the post 2008 austerity programme turmoil in financial markets caused partly by a failure of regulation and government oversight was used as an excuse for the imposition of a new political programme they used the global financial crisis as an excuse to gut our public services he says his chummy demeanour becoming exasperated as he describes a country in which even for someone in his position nothing works he waves his hands as he talks about the holes in the road hospitals the dvla the police nothing works but policymakers are now even more closely agreed that the government must avoid spooking the markets at all costs central bankers are having to beat their chests he says like some wwf wrestler trash talking before a bout because having failed to prepare for higher inflation what they perceive is that to restore their credibility it s better to overdo it on raising interest rates and qt in doing so they are hammering the economy with more expensive debt at the worst possible moment everyone else is paying the price for their incompetence central bankers are telling individuals in the labour market that they should sustain a massive real wage cut at a time when corporate profit margins have risen to a record high as a result of price gouging to drive the economy into recession essentially to restore their credibility as far as a lot of people are concerned they had zero credibility in the first place meanwhile the government is squeezing fiscal policy at a dangerous moment the biggest bubbles that qe has inflated the housing market technology stocks are imploding in value and still the government seeks to reduce its own economic activity even george osborne wouldn t have tightened going into a recession what sunak s doing is lunacy everyone else is paying the price for their incompetence where will this lunacy take us the uk and us and europe are all going into recession i don t think there s any doubt about that and i think it will be a deep recession he says policymakers will continue trying to normalise interest rates but they can never achieve it because the financial markets rudely interrupt them collapse and trigger a recession no one under 40 will have experienced this house price crash that s coming now edwards says people should have an open mind about how bad this can get when the crash comes the only response central bankers will have will be to drop interest rates again and to stop selling the trillions of dollars of government bonds that have accumulated on their balance sheets we are in the first steps to the abandonment of qt he predicts the uk s gilt crisis was the canary in the coal mine but something some other over leveraged part of the financial plumbing will blow up in the us economy and in europe the big surprise will be the collapse of headline inflation below zero next year at which point policymakers will have the excuse to reduce interest rates and resume qe but core inflation won t drop as far and it will return like frankenstein central banks will face a monster of their own making that will keep coming back again and again the end product he warns is a decade plus of terrible returns for financial assets including housing the only remedy he says is to learn from the mistakes of the past pushing up asset prices on the back of free money is a failed policy that s what central banks have been pursuing deliberately the davos consensus has encouraged that the imf s cosy consensus is still there it wants austerity we ve got to move away from that hammond osborne tight fiscal easy money you ve got to move away from that policy mix it s failed and it s been a disaster

after a week in october wall street staged a strong comeback in november and support is building around the mid october lows according to an investment strategist traders and investors shook off all the doom and gloom about the elevated inflation and the prospect of an impending recession and drove debt and equity markets higher all major u s equity indexes finished higher in november with the tech heavy nasdaq leading the gains as market volatility ebbed in addition the benchmark 10 year treasury bond prices posted solid gains driving yields lower lower oil and gasoline prices added fuel to the debt and equity rallies angelo kourkafas cfa investment strategist at edward jones thinks november will be remembered on wall street as the month of reversals they will be a stark reminder of the importance of staying invested rather than trying to time the market beyond providing portfolios with some relief november was a month that included some major reversals he told international business times in an email the vix was falling back to its historical average longer duration bonds outperforming shorter duration bonds chinese equities leading global markets higher on reopening hopes and the u s dollar having its worst month since 2010 also gasoline fell to its lowest price before russia invaded ukraine quo vadis president john zolidis attributes the reversal to the resilience of the american consumer who has yet to blink on the fed s interest rate hikes that s thanks to a strong labor market which provided steady paychecks to households the single most relevant factor in consumer spending is jobs he said in a briefing to his subscriber when u s consumers have incomes they spend saving is what happens for americans when the spending is done not the other way around more than 20 years of experience following the consumer sector has taught us not to bet against the u s consumer s propensity to spend strong consumer spending has helped reverse some of the negativity in discretionary consumer stocks which have gained more than 20 over the past two months kourkafas sees the november reversal as a sign that the market is sniffing out a gradual easing of the two most significant headwinds that have been weighing on portfolio performance this year high inflation and aggressive fed policy however kourkafas is skeptical about whether the reversal will continue at the same pace next year due to fed policy lags past rate hikes will likely weigh on the economy through 2023 raising the risk of a mild recession he said then there are the larger than average eps revisions wall street analysts revised eps estimates for s p 500 companies in the last two months downward for the fourth quarter by a more significant margin than average the q4 bottom up eps estimate which is an aggregation of the median eps estimates for q4 for all the companies in the index decreased by 5 6 to 54 58 from 57 79 from september 30 to november 30 john butters vice president of factset wrote in a blog post moreover the labor market is resilient as evidenced by recent data which complicates monetary policy still kourkafas believes that the investment backdrop is no less complicated now than in june when the s p 500 first slid to a bear market yet as investors and policymakers gradually gain some comfort that the tide of inflation is receding the worst case outcomes will narrow and support around the mid october lows will keep building he said
due to this startup ipos are no longer seen favourably by investors and investor confidence has been undermined the shares of the majority of the new age digital businesses have been under pressure and most of them are now selling at a large discount to their ipo price new age indian businesses have listed on indian stock exchanges in some of the largest initial public offerings ipos in the country s history there has been an ongoing debate within india recently owing to the pricing of new age technology companies listed on the indian stock exchanges falling disastrously from their peaks new age indian businesses have listed on indian stock exchanges in some of the largest initial public offerings ipos in the country s history these include startups such as paytm nykaa cartrade mapmyindia easemytrip delhivery fino payments bank indiamart nazara technologies policybazaar and zomato nevertheless with a few exceptions the shares of the majority of these new age digital businesses have been under pressure and most of them are now selling at a large discount to their ipo price consider paytm which has fallen by more than 75 from its listing price or zomato which is down 50 due to this startup ipos are no longer seen favourably by investors and investor confidence has been undermined this has also raised some voices against allowing these loss making companies to list via an ipo on the indian stock exchanges equity is the real gold for all ages not only data i would like to point out to the naysayers and the doomsday predictors ownership of companies is the most valuable commodity of today s times capital valuations run on multiples of action on the profit and loss side revenue ebitda net profit and hence provide superior returns as compared to returns made via profits alone also tech companies are very scalable and capture market share fast thereby giving a huge upside on capital invested in no time there is enough liquidity in the world to covet the stock of companies with a large market share even if they take longer to recover from losses following the 2008 financial crisis the united states alone printed 25 tn which is now sloshing around in the global ecosystem creating asset class bubbles this is in addition to the european union eu and japan both of which have printed massive amounts of money investors appear to prefer holding equity in companies with a large market share even if they are losing money for a long time consider makemytrip listed on the nasdaq in 2010 it enjoys a high share price while continuing to lose money owing to its 50 share of the indian online travel market across all verticals is it any surprise that makemytrip does not raise prices in response to the price sensitive indian customer instead focusing on market share is flipping a good option for indian tech companies not long ago some leading lights in the indian startup world bemoaned the fact that many indian startups were flipping they were transferring ownership to foreign structures or establishing holding companies in singapore the united states and the united kingdom all in search of better liquidity windows available in these overseas locations flipping india incorporated startups to the us was referred to as institutionalised wealth transfer and exploitation of indian intellectual property ip this is because ownership of the startup the ip and the data were all shifted overseas other operations however continued as before products were manufactured in india using indian labour and sold to customers in india as before sanjeev bikhchandani of infoedge even predicted a market cap loss of more than inr 17 lakh cr at the time saying these companies will operate in india and access the market however they will not be indian companies a domicile shift and transfer of ip and data to an overseas company is a permanent loss as a company grows so does this loss remember that hcl and infosys were startups in the early 80s imagine what would have happened if they had flipped overseas when they were young this is a matter of strategic significance for india flipping has meant that the benefit of capital appreciation and value unlocking through the balance sheet route has primarily gone to foreign investors based in singapore hong kong uae us and uk phonepe a unit of flipkart showed the way recently by reverse flipping from singapore to india with an eye on an indian listing sebi allowed loss making new age tech companies to list on indian stock exchanges subsequently the securities and exchange board of india sebi amended its rules the previous rules mandated that companies should have a track record of three years of profits to list on the indian stock exchanges this led to 11 new age technology startup ipos on the indian stock exchanges loss making companies such as zomato and paytm are now listed on the indian stock exchange they entice investors by promising a bright future which must typically be supported by rising top line growth and sustained profitability funding winter however it should come as no surprise that the reported closure of nearly 30 businesses sponsored by either venture capitalist vc firms or angel investors since the beginning of the year has sounded the alarm for entrepreneurship enthusiasts across the country investors are wary of startup ipos due to the challenges that the indian startup ecosystem has faced since the beginning of 2022 this includes unfavourable macroeconomic conditions high financial burn a funding winter unfavourable media coverage and a lack of understanding of the startup business model how the china us relationship can serve as the path ahead for india indian and chinese tech startup ecosystems have some fundamental differences the main one is that china forbids us faangs us tech behemoths facebook amazon apple netflix and google with only apple given some leeway in exchange for tough conditions from setting up shop in china instead it nurtured its own tech companies which now dominate their respective markets alibaba tencent meituan xiaomi and so on however india has allowed these us technology companies to establish monopolies in the indian market these chinese tech behemoths serve many purposes including keeping the chinese customer s tech business and the chinese market in chinese hands the data of chinese citizens stay outside the bounds of western countries and this provides huge succour to the communist party of china most importantly ownership of chinese businesses remains primarily in chinese hands as does the benefit of capital returns and the results are for everyone to see the chinese investors have made tremendous returns on shares of these companies with the total market capitalisation being in excess of 8 tn on the shanghai stock exchange alone what did the us do in the face of buoyant chinese shares for the us its casino system of nasdaq and nyse provides a window of cycling the huge dollar liquidity and services driven nature of its economy how could it be left behind in capturing the upside in the shares of the world s second largest economy china faced with difficulties such as the opaque nature of financial records of chinese companies and the hyper sensitivity of the communist party of china in allowing data information and ownership of chinese companies in foreign hands china denied access to the us s public company accounting oversight board pcaob citing state secret concerns among others the us created specific structures for chinese companies this allowed these companies to list on us exchanges without getting their accounts audited in the us this meant that in many cases there was no compliance with reporting standards and shady accounting was used to trade these stocks only recently after the luckin coffee debacle has this clause been overturned one other innovation was variable interest entity vie structures which are akin to saying we know the ownership resides within china s jurisdiction but we believe it is in the cayman islands this is similar to us investors investing in china by purchasing chinese real estate bonds the bond market s equivalent is the keepwell obligation which is nothing more than the borrower s word of promise this is a loose version of the corporate guarantee or the letter of comfort there are 264 public companies headquartered in mainland china or hong kong that trade on the new york stock exchange nyse american and nasdaq the three largest u s exchanges these actions by the us clearly show that ownership of tech companies demonstrating hyper growth is coveted handsomely by the us and developed economies market share is the reality on main street which wall street covets especially for large companies india is the new china it is predicted that the indian gdp will go from 3 5 tn to 8 10 tn within the next eight years let s not throw out the baby with the bathwater it is obvious that if india were to go back and prohibit new age tech companies from listing on indian stock exchanges the world would not wait for a second longer to provide sufficient incentives to create ownership of these businesses in their hands it would be a big loss for the indian investor does india want that how indian tech startups can get easy access to the indian stock exchanges indian tech startups should be listed on indian stock exchanges even if they are losing money however things can be done intelligently on the valuation side since many of these startups were in the hands of private investors valuations soared and were not subject to market scrutiny however when they trade below the listing price they cause the most harm to retail investors because institutional investors usually exit in a timely manner few measures come to correct the situation unit economics is the north star first determine the quality of the losses and make it compulsory to declare it in the rhp red herring prospectus if the startup s loss is due to it being in investment mode and is demonstrating meaningful monetisation of its market share then the startup s business model differs from that of an entity like wework whose business model is inherently loss making locate the costliest place in the city lease it for 10 15 years at high rentals and create costly 7 star infrastructure but the end consumer is the gig economy person who is in and out of jobs most of the time provide disclosures and compliances in the rhp for the valuation based on comparative multiples of the tech companies which recently listed on indian stock exchanges given that the price discovery of previously listed tech startups occurred over the course of a year due to the fact that they were a new phenomenon for indian stock exchanges this will provide valuable insight into how much valuation range is the investor sitting on the indian stock exchange willing to pay to avoid situations where these companies run out of cash provide regular disclosures of their cash burn and cash holding positions along with other financials for instance their net cash to cash burn ratio indian startups are the new gold standard and the indian investor should ride this journey to the maximum in the coming golden decade for india
these stocks are a bargain for patient investors the holiday season is here and while the stock market has been far more naughty than nice this year the good news is that there are plenty of bargains worth stuffing into an investment portfolio s stocking ford motor company f 1 15 devon energy dvn 0 95 and baker hughes bkr 1 08 stand out as three dirt cheap dividend stocks to buy now here s why ford blends value and income daniel foelber ford motor company ford stock is down nearly 44 from its all time high set near the start of 2022 as painful as the drawdown has been it is arguably justifiable automakers fall into the consumer discretionary category as the economy weakens and consumer spending falls car companies run into trouble and if the recession gets really bad consumers are more likely to default on their car payments than say their apartment home utility bills food and other essentials the macroeconomic outlook isn t good for ford and its peers rising interest rates throw yet another wrench in the investment thesis because they make financing new projects like multibillion dollar electric vehicle ev expansion all the more expensive supply chain challenges make it difficult for legacy automakers to produce vehicles reliably all told ford is currently in a tough spot and the worst could be yet to come putting ford on your watch list instead of buying now makes perfect sense given the level of uncertainty but there are a couple of reasons why a starter position in ford stock isn t the worst idea right now for starters the stock is dirt cheap trading at a price to earnings p e ratio of just 6 3 and a forward p e ratio of 7 1 to be fair automakers like ford tend to trade below market multiples but ford s ev prospects give the company a nice blend of value and growth throw in ford s 4 3 dividend yield and you have a steady stream of passive income that matches the risk free treasury bill rate oil the wheels of your passive income generation with devon energy scott levine devon energy while the chinese government s implementation of strict covid 19 lockdowns to stymie the spread of the virus is the latest catalyst energy prices have dipped lower on the fear of waning oil demand for a variety of reasons this in turn led investors to shy away from devon energy a leading upstream oil company that operates onshore in the united states investors seem to be speculating that energy prices will continue to dip leading devon energy to reduce its mouthwatering dividend which currently represents a forward yield of 8 1 since there s a strong correlation between the movements in energy prices and those of energy stocks like devon energy the stock s 11 2 decline over the past month a period during which west texas intermediate crude oil an oil benchmark fell more than 9 is not all that surprising while it may be disconcerting for investors to see shares of devon dip lower it s important for prospective investors to recognize that the stock s decline isn t related to something materially wrong with the company s business model or operations thus it shouldn t preclude prospective investors from picking up shares as of this writing investors can pick up shares of devon for a song the stock is now valued at about 7 times forward earnings a steep discount to its five year average forward earnings multiple of 19 6 prefer to assess the stock s valuation using a cash flow metric no problem the stock still looks attractive valued at 5 3 times operating cash flow no need to wait for the gift giving holidays income investors have the opportunity to energize their passive income today with shares of devon energy baker hughes stock has the potential to outperform its industry lee samaha baker hughes the price of oil and by implication demand for oil equipment and services is highly cyclical as such it may not make sense to invest in the sector ahead of an engineered economic slowdown however all cycles are different and throw up different investment opportunities each time in this case i think it s time to risk uttering the most famous last words in investing it s different this time the reality is that despite a widely anticipated slowdown the price of oil is still around 80 a barrel that s not a price traditionally associated with a recessionary period instead it s a price associated with ongoing investment in baker hughes solutions the strength in the price of oil is possibly due to some factors that don t look like they are going away anytime soon for example according to companies like baker hughes and caterpillar energy companies are exercising restraint in spending possibly in fear of the long term future of the carbon fuel industry in the face of the threat from renewable energy environmental regulation and windfall taxes moreover increasing geopolitical tensions are creating conditions where powerful opec member saudi arabia is increasingly aiming to cut production to keep prices high while capital spending restraints may appear to be a negative for baker hughes it is over the near term it sets up the industry for a long graduated increase in oil prices and capital spending and possible avoidance of the traditional boom and bust cycles baker hughes is exciting because it s restructuring its operations and cutting costs of course there s no guarantee baker hughes plans will work but it s usually a good idea to restructure when end markets are buoyant and for now that looks like the case for the energy sector

stock image photo by gorynvd istock getty images plus st george news feature current research shows 56 of americans plan to sharpen their pencils and slash their christmas budgets this holiday season inflation and a pending economic recession have wreaked havoc on wallets across america with the holidays coming up americans have to pull in their spending on gifts decorations and food but there is one area where they will not compromise the tree anything but the tree trees com surveyed 1 250 people who celebrate christmas in the u s to find out how inflation affects the purchase of christmas trees this year according to the survey there will be a 7 increase in the amount of americans who plan to buy a real tree versus those who bought one last year some 62 of respondents said that having a christmas tree is very important to them one respondent offered the following having a christmas tree is very important to our family but the tradition of choosing a tree together is just as important i have never not had a christmas tree but it would definitely negatively impact my ability to enjoy the holiday the lights provide a sense of peace and joy that other decorations do not the respondent continued it is the centerpiece of our christmas display in our living room we are willing and plan to pay an increased price for a christmas tree we also have a backup artificial tree that we store in our attic just in case we are unable to find a real tree survey results also revealed 53 of respondents said they would have an artificial tree and 8 didn t plan on having a tree at all no matter the cost with inflation and rising costs shoppers can expect to pay around 15 more for their christmas tree this year however americans have reported that they do not plan to reduce the amount they will spend on a christmas tree in some cases it s worth it to pay the increased prices for christmas trees said zack deangelis the founder of tree journey however it isn t always necessary for those looking to get a real christmas tree from a farm i recommend asking if there s any discount for cutting or wrapping the tree yourself the farm will most likely have certain trees that haven t grown well and are less desirable these can cost even less which can help you save more if you re in a pinch the average christmas tree cost in the last few years has been around 100 but 18 of respondents said they would spend up to 200 or more to ensure they have a real christmas tree this year trimming the tree and the budget despite shoppers willingness to shell out some cash for a christmas tree over half of respondents said they would cut down on overall holiday spending due to inflation one respondent admitted inflation has definitely affected my christmas plans i used to buy a lot of presents for my kids and grandkids but this year i am going to have to be more selective and purchase fewer gifts i m also going to have to be careful about how much i spend on food and decorations overall it s going to be a more frugal christmas than in years past asked how they would be reducing their spending this year a variety of cost cutting measures were mentioned 72 said they would be putting a budget on gifts 13 would only be giving people handmade gifts this year 9 would not be giving any gifts 23 said they would not be hosting a party this year 44 said they would not be spending as much on decorations of those asked 25 said they spent 200 or less on christmas last year and 34 said they would keep their spending under 200 this year the largest group of respondents said they bought gifts for 3 4 people last year but are only planning on buying gifts for 2 3 people this year plans for gift giving this year involve setting a limit for one respondent our family now buys presents based on a system that limits how much each of us can spend we used to go crazy with the presents we now have a four gift rule there are five of us who exchange gifts we purchase one gift for each member of our family limiting gifts can be an easy way to reduce the financial burden of the season but there are other ways to cut back financial expert colleen mccreary shared some savings tips with tennessee news station wbbj if people have a list and they know who they are shopping for what they can do is be on the lookout she said i always tell people to limit your spending and shopping time to a specific point in time during the day so you are not tempted all day long and overspending she also advocates cash back programs and coupon apps to help save money when shopping online spend money on what matters most if the survey revealed one thing it s that americans are consciously prioritizing spending on what brings the most joy during the holidays in many cases the pile of gifts is not actually what the holidays are all about mccreary said for many having a real christmas tree or hosting a party for family and friends takes precedence over gift giving as

was celebrated for some of the plants that were cultivated and in some cases created there it was also celebrated for the leading edge technology that warmed its hot houses as roderick floud explained in his recent history of the english garden gardens have been one of the most conspicuous forms of expenditure on luxury in england since the seventeenth century gardening created a whole industry of nurseries gardening suppliers and landscapers whose annual turnover has grown over the past few hundred years to exceed 11 billion the gardens at harringay were one the luxuries on which edward gray who lived at the house for the first half of its life spent his fortune i ve been writing about the gardens for almost twenty years now but in the course of writing this piece i ve dug deeper to get a much clearer idea of the gardens and its custodians i ve even secured a rare example of one of the plants first bred there to bring home harringay house fig 1 shire hall chelmsford was contemporary with harringay house and all but is front was made of the same material as harringay at 90 feet square it was almost twice the size of the main house at harringay harringay house grounds fig 2 harringay house estate this image aims to help identify the location of various parts of the harringay estate mentioned in this article when used in conjunction with the article it should also help the reader picture the estate as it was the image mixes the 1863 ordnance survey bright red lines and the 1893 ordnance survey map grey background map the layers correlate almost exactly the house outbuildings and grounds are from the 1881 british land title and the 1883 british land sale plan because those two documents show clearer details of the buildings than does the 1863 ordnance survey map the plan outlines correlate almost exactly with those on the maps but the correlation is not shown for reasons of overall map clarity the old course of the new river and the stonebridge brook as shown on the 1863 map have been coloured blue also using the details shown on both the 1863 map and the british land plans trees have been coloured green and roadways have been faintly coloured in brown the two houses shown on hewitt road to the south of harringay house are number 14 and 16 the buildings at the north end of the kitchen garden can be identified through a previous article on harringay online standing on the carriage circle in front of the house looking east you would have seen about half way down the hill towards green lanes part of the loop of the new river running across the hill below you then flowing on south east across the fields following the same course it does today the area within the river s loop comprised about 15 acres in addition to the house and pleasure grounds it included a kitchen garden and a series of outbuildings these were set back well behind the main building towards hornsey finally to the north of the house was a long building detached from the main house the supposed service wing standing at the gates and looking towards the house the visitor would have seen the carriage way curving up off to their right and then sweeping back across the hill with the house beyond mainly obscured by trees half way up the hill the carriage way crossed the new river on an ornamental metal bridge roughly where the road is today between about where 58 60 and 61 63 beresford road about twenty yards before the bridge the way entered a copse composed of oak elm beech and birch beyond the river it was lined with lime trees all the way up at the top in front of the house was the gravelled carriage circle views in all directions were through the fringe of limes which continued from the road around the circle the cultivated gardens or pleasure grounds were laid out on three sides of the house they covered roughly the top half of the land now occupied by the houses on both sides of seymour hewitt allison and beresford roads to the west of the house towards hornsey were ranged the outbuildings and to their south at the bottom of the knoll a kitchen garden connected to the southern end of the house a 70 foot east facing conservatory extended across where the houses and back gardens of 3 5 and 7 hewitt road are today in line but set back from with the house frontage set at a perpendicular to the end of the conservatory was a south facing 22 foot greenhouse this was diagonally across where the front gardens of numbers 3 and 5 hewitt road now are inside the conservatory in a large open area where it joined the greenhouse were large camellia trees acacias orange lemon and lime trees and eucalyptus and banksia from australia elsewhere were cactus sugarbushes protea tropical orchids and exotic giant spider lilies both buildings were heated by a leading edge steam driven heating system this was installed by a company best known at the time for for their curvilinear glasshouses so speculating somewhat it is possible that one or both of the harringay glasshouse buildings described as ornamental were built in a curvilinear shape fig 3 tulip tree illustration from traité des arbres et arbustes que l on cultive en france en pleine terre 1801 1819 pierre joseph redouté fig 4 the dovecote looking west with the railway embankment in the distance september 1888 artist unknown standing at the dovecote and looking south back towards the house you would have seen the detached service wing ranged at a slight diagonal to the house fig 5 looking south west at what i believe is the detached service wing of the house the dovecote is just behind the fence i believe the wavy lines in front of the fence represent the new river in the background is the embankment of the railway line

of vegetables with never a weed to be seen the walls covered with carefully trained fruit trees the gothic greenhouses were indeed beautiful and at the same time utilitarian but they were also as important means of displaying the wealth and taste of the owners as the statues temples cascades or artfully placed clumps of trees they like the pleasure gardens or the lakes with there to be seen to be viewed and to incite envy and emulation as part of the guests tour of the estate they were also like the paintings that adorned the walls of the stately homes that they served a sign of luxury clearly not justified by the monetary value of the fruit and vegetables they produced they were status symbols the embodiment of thorstein veblen s conspicuous consumption relying solely on produce from the kitchen gardens particularly of the great states was a wildly impractical solution to the feeding of a whole household harringay s kitchen garden was set on the west facing slope behind the house partly under where 143 to 183 wightman road now are and partly under the since much widened railway like most kitchen gardens of the period harringay s were half walled gray invested extensively in the latest steam driven boiler technology to heat a range of kitchen garden buildings amongst others these included two 40 foot 12m graperies two pineries for pineapples a peach house a mushroom house and a 40 foot strawberry pit 12 j c loudon and harringay house the man thought by many to have been the leading garden designer and theorist of the early nineteenth century scotsman john claudius loudon 1783 1843 was apparently a regular visitor to harringay house and may have been involved in the creation of its hothouses in the gardener s magazine in 1840 loudon wrote that he had known the garden at harringay house for twenty years he was also a contributor to the celebrity of harringay s gardens at a time when touring country houses was spreading beyond the gentry loudon s book gardening tours probably did as much as anything to spread the fame of the harringay house magnolias camellias and hot houses he referred to the beautifully situated villa of harringay noticed for some of the largest specimens of magnolia in the neighbourhood of london especially m macrophylla the second largest in england fig 7 loudon s design for horticultural society 1818 wikimedia original from an unidentified book in the victoria and albert museum london edward gray s gardener george press press was born in great yarmouth in 1790 he had arrived in london by the middle to the end of the first decade of the nineteenth century his marriage in southwark in 1809 suggests that this may have been where he settled initially this would certainly have been a good choice for a young man intent on following a career in gardening since it had since the restoration been one of the principal centres for london nurseries and market gardens fig 8 even as london s tentacles were making deep inroads into southwark towards the middle of the century nurseries and market gardens still survived there greenwood s map of london 1830 we have no direct evidence of george s journey from great yarmouth to harringay other than this but we can make some guesses about his story based on what is known of the history of gardening the eighteenth century had seen a transformation in the gardening sector and the garden industry was well established before the age of the industrial revolution by the early years of the nineteenth century gardening was increasingly coming to be regarded as a profession as well as gardeners both jobbing and employed there were nurserymen seedsmen and several other associated roles the business of gardening was also increasingly crossing national borders many gardeners were training abroad and imports of plants from britain s overseas colonies and trade connections were becoming more and more common plant imports from the americas had started in the early eighteenth century possibly even in the late seventeenth magnolia trees for which harringay became so well known were described in catalogues as early as 1739 the world into which george press had been born was then possessed of a large and well established gardening profession this trajectory suggests that press s move to london at around the age of 16 was probably in order to continue his learning and advance a career in gardening southwark would have been a good place for that i should point out that press is only ever referred to as gardener at harringay however by 1826 he was listed in pigot s directory as the gardener for harringay house his was one of only fifteen entries for tradesmen listed in hornsey that and the other references to him in journals from the early 1820s suggest that it is likely that he was the head gardener in all but name probably from the outset but almost certainly by the 1820s the plants of george press harringay camellia 1 camellia japonica gray s invincible syn pressii invincible imperialis pressii punctata and many others bred in 1824 this is perhaps george press s best known cultivar during the course of researching this subject i got in touch with the gardeners at chiswick house and one day in mid april travelled there to meet estate gardeners george and chris along with new head gardener rosie i was delighted to be able to see george press s harringay child thriving the examples i saw were of the palest most delicate clear pink with deeper pink flecking the camellia specialist at chiswick described it as the team s favourite i was thrilled to be given a two year old example to bring home to a site that used to be part of the harringay house gardens so now for the first time in probably 150 years harringay is once again home to a press s gray s invincible camellia fig 9 gray s invincible syn pressii invincible published in edwards s botanical register james ridgway london 1829 fig 10 gray s invincible at chiswick house april 2022 image hugh flouch harringay camellia 2 camellia japonica press s eclipse syn eclips c pressii and many others bred in 1827 this was apparently similar to and believed to have been bred from the same capsule seed pod as invincible but differs from it in that it has a white background fig 11 press s eclipse from collection de camellias baumann charles napoleon 1828 harringay

published in j c loudon s gardener s magazine in may 1827 said the following i understand that the best judges consider these flowers as the finest that have hitherto been raised in this country it is said the fellows of the horticultural society were quite ravished with them and i have no doubt they will be in greater request than any of the varieties now in the nurseries i hope justice will be done to the extraordinary merit and good fortune of mr press who is really an excellent gardener as his superb magnolias pines in fruit every month in the year grapes and peaches now nearly ripe and indeed all his other articles evidentially show a twenty year old twenty feet high twenty two foot span magnolia grandiflora fig 13 botanical study of a bull bay magnolia grandiflora by georg

joseph redouté harringay s garden also contained many other exotic plants that appear to have been less well known beyond gardening circles two trees of note in the conservatory were the banksias named in honour of sir joseph banks a botanist who was with captain cook during his first voyage 1768 1771 the banksia marginata was a species of tree or woody shrub from south eastern australia one of the first places it was grown outside australia was at harringay house the others were kew gardens cambridge botanic gardens and woburn abbey harringay also boasted a banksia latifolia which flowered for the first time in this country in the conservatory in 1817 fig 15 banksia latifolia from curtis s botanical magazine vol 38 1813 george press life after harringay fig 16 morning post 25th june 1840 press s retirement wasn t without its troubles however six years after he bought the property the great northern railway act was passed the new railway cut across the corner of press s new property and it eventually resulted in a court case between press and the great northern railway company fig 17 from the morning advertiser 28th november 1849 fig 18 prospect nursery shown on the 1863 and 1893 ordnance survey maps where the railway crosses the road in the bottom left hand corner of the map is where the bridge across turnpike lane is today the 1851 census described press s address as prospect place under railway bridge press continued to develop camellia cultivars after he had left harringay house a further four are recorded at the international camellia society as having been created by him in the 1840s all but one of them are now classed as believed extinct in 1851 press was in his sixties his oldest son thomas had moved out to a cottage in park road near to the centre of crouch end and was working as a gardener younger son george jnr was still at home three years later george snr died leaving the nursery and all his plant stock to george jnr who carried on the business until the early 1870s by 1881 george jnr s son yet another george was living in brook road hornsey and became the third george in succession to earn his living in the gardening business by 1875 the prospect nursery had been sold and it was changing hands again from nurseryman james whittaker to a joseph pollard from 1880 it was run by thomas gayton then in about 1895 it was taken on by former paddington florist s assistant alex macgregor who ran it as a nursery and florist until 1935 when prospect place was demolished to make way for the widening of turnpike lane today press is not completely forgotten he usually warrants a nod in descriptions that appear in specialist lists of what these days is most commonly referred to as gray s invincible he has also and earned a place in ray desmond s 2002 dictionary of british and irish botanists and horticulturalists including plant collectors flower painters and garden designers the other gardeners of harringay house it seems likely that edward gray made some arrangements for tending for the grounds from soon after he built harringay house in 1792 but there are no records until the arrival of press it may be simply because they have not survived or as i suggest in footnote 13 it might be that gray s passion for gardening didn t consume him until later in life and earlier in life perhaps he did little more that keep the grounds kempt after gray died harringay house was sold to ship owner merchant of leadenhall street director of the bank of england prolific investor in small railways and jp edward chapman from the well established and landed chapman family in whitby the new owner saw to it that the gardens were maintained although perhaps not to the same degree as they had been under gray s stewardship for thirty years from 1839 to 1869 they were under the tender care of gardener charles collins in 1824 he had been a gardener living in highbury by 1841 he was at harringay house we know that in 1851 he was living above stables we know from a plant sale after chapman s death that the camellias citrus trees and many other hot house plants had lived on and grown to significant sizes by 1869 the last record we have of the magnolias is from 1840 following chapman s demise harringay house was let and collins moved about half a mile away as the crow flies to hanbury road off tottenham lane a two minute walk from his front door he could have looked across the still verdant valley to the tree shrouded harringay house aged 70 and a widower he was still working as an occasional gardener living with his dressmaker daughter by 1881 aged 82 collins had moved to campsbourne road off hornsey high street fig 19 the gardeners chronicle volume 18 1882 harringay house was demolished in late 1884 or early 1885 and between april and september that year there was a series of sales of its building materials the outbuildings possibly including the service wing survived till 1887 in use by a company called foster and barry who were expanding the railway sidings for the great northern railway company an extensive fire in july of 1887 destroyed all remaining buildings with the exception of the coach house by the mid 1890 s all trace of the house and gardens had gone to be replaced by the rows of housing that stand there still today but in a small part of the site of harringay house gardens

diaspora remittances to nigeria others slowing down says world bank remittances to nigeria and other low and middle income countries lmics increased by an estimated five per cent this year to 626 billion according to the migration and development brief of the world bank remittances to nigeria and other sub saharan africa ssa countries had grown by 16 4 per cent in 2021 while nigeria recorded 21 billion remittances india had the highest with 100 billion mexico followed with 60 billion while china had 51 billion the philippines egypt pakistan and bangladesh had 38billion 32billion 29billion and 21billion respectively of remittances however the growth of remittance flows to nigeria and other developing countries is anticipated to narrow to single digit gains over 2022 23 the concerns of international market participants have increased substantially that inflation will become imbedded in consumer and corporate expectations that monetary authorities will be required to tighten policy to dampen such expectations and that uncertainty in financial markets will adversely affect financing flows for developing countries a large number of which are pressing the limits of debt sustainability the world ban brief noted however downside risks remain migration flows are rebounding from the pandemic induced decline of 2020 21 refugee flows have also increased especially due to the russia ukraine war the brief notes that climate change will increase migration mostly within countries the poorest are likely to be most affected national and regional development strategies need to be viewed through a climate migration lens considering the global nature and expected trajectory of migration the case for creating a global remittances came to represent an even larger source of external finance for lmics during 2022 relative to foreign direct investment fdi official development assistance oda and portfolio investment flows excluding china remittances stand as the premier source of external finance for lmics since 2015 exceeding fdi flows and oda according to the brief the top five recipient countries for remittances this year are expected to be india establishing a benchmark of 100 billion in the year followed by mexico with a tally of 60 billion which replaced china in second position during 2021 and china the philippines and the arab republic of egypt among economies where remittance inflows represent very large shares of gdp highlighting the importance of remittances for funding current account and fiscal shortfalls pacific islands tonga 50 percent of gdp and samoa 34 per cent stand in the top 10 given their exposure to the vagaries of tourism and vulnerability to disasters read also world bank urges fed govt on fiscal adjustments according to the global bank brief remittance flows to developing regions were shaped by several factors this year first and foremost a robust pace of growth in remittances is evidence of migrants determination to help their families back home second a gradual reopening of various sectors in host country economies following pandemic induced closures and travel disruptions improved migrant workers incomes and employment situations and thereby their ability to send money home third rising prices in general adversely affected migrants real incomes and their remittances fourth currency exchange rates affected remittance flows in the case of russia an unexpected and strong appreciation of the ruble translated into higher value in us dollar terms of outward remittances to central asia and the southern caucasus countries in the case of europe a weaker euro had the opposite effect of reducing the us dollar valuation of remittance flows to north africa and elsewhere fifth in many countries that experienced scarcity of foreign exchange and multiple exchange rates officially recorded remittance flows declined as flows shifted to alternative channels offering better exchange rates two other region specific factors are of note transit migration and therefore remittances received by migrants in transit continued to be strong in mexico and central america in europe and central asia rising oil prices in conjunction with the post pandemic rebound in russia s demand for migrant workers and payments to russian individuals and companies that relocated abroad following the onset of the war increased the flow of remittances to central asian and southern caucasus countries the 10 2 per cent growth of remittance flows in 2021 the highest since 2010 occurred against the backdrop of the global pandemic although the impact of covid 19 eased across the world during the year stimulus measures enacted to underpin faltering high income economies notably in the united states and europe helped to support employment levels and maintain or increase incomes of migrant workers facilitating their ability to send remittances these trends were apparent through the first half of 2021 despite emerging adverse developments in the global environment remittances continued to be robust uncertainties concerning global conditions emerged more forcefully during the second half of last year direct effects of stimulus measures among member countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd were beginning to wane difficulties in supply chains and logistics continued to hamper production and to boost costs to producers and consumers and inflation was amplified by substantial increases in oil and food prices in the case of oil rising demand and constrained output stood out as key factors

article 3 months old australia dec 05 2022 this story features rio tinto limited and other companies for more info share analysis rio 2022 has seen a sudden burst of listed hydrogen pure plays largely out of nowhere tim boreham investigates hydrogen can be harnessed in many ways sudden burst of listed stocks energy intensity the key by tim boreham whether in grey blue green and even turquoise form hydrogen this year emerged as a compelling investment theme and 2023 looks to be no different for the first element on the periodic table having been bereft of pure play asx listed hydrogen exposures investors are becoming spoilt for choice as more ventures seek to list to date the emphasis has been on green hydrogen which refers to producing the gas by splitting water atoms with electrolysis using renewable energy some hydrogen developers have turned to solving the knock on issues of renewables adoption including storage and transportation battery materials recycling and improved battery performance one missing element excuse the pun of the hydrogen debate is the prospect of tapping naturally produced hydrogen to obviate the need for any energy intensive extraction and separation your columnist professes to be worldly wise but had no idea that hydrogen occurred in natural form until he read about gold hydrogen s upcoming ipo plans chaired by former federal pollie alexander downer and no hot air jokes please gold hydrogen is mulling a 20 million raising and asx listing to support its quest to explore for naturally occurring hydrogen in south australia inspired by historical records showing incidence of the gas gold hydrogen has 7820 square kilometres of granted ground on the york peninsula and kangaroo island and has applied for another 67 512 sqkm the company has independently and conservatively assessed a potential 1 3 billion kilograms of the stuff so with an estimated production price of 1 a kilogram relative to a current global price of around 17 kg golden hydrogen could be cooking with er gas the company plans to list in mid january with an indicative market cap of 70 million the science of electrolysis might be proven but commercialisation challenges include transporting and storing the volatile gas there s a dearth of hydrogen pipelines while compressed hydrogen is hard to handle and has low energy density rio tinto s rio chief scientist nigel steward this week asserted that hydrogen remained prohibitively expensive and it didn t make much sense to ship it both cost and carbon emissions wise for ipo candidate electriq global the solution lies with a powderised form of hydrogen which like laundry powder can be stored in a box until required with an indefinite shelf life according to the israel based electriq hydrogen powder is inert there s no risk of an explosion and has an energy density more than two times that of liquid organic hydrogen and around five times that of compressed hydrogen hydrogen is well known in compressed or liquefied from however when migrating hydrogen into fuel there are new challenges says electriq executive chairman baruch halpert electriq s patented generation process involves bonding hydrogen with another material the hydrogen is produced in situ from a generator about the size of washing machine on usage half of the hydrogen drives from the powder and the other half from released water that means when you deliver one kilogram of our powder you actually get two kilograms baruch says it s literally a solution in a box electriq has released the world s first generator run on powdered hydrogen called joshua with an 80 kilowatt hour capacity the unit is powering cranes on a dutch construction site baruch envisages the powder as a replacement for diesel generators at remote sites such as mines with marine applications as well including submarines just as fossil fuels come in different forms hydrogen will be the same he says the rush to develop upstream hydrogen facilities has also overshadowed the need to ship the material safely and economically renamed from global energy ventures the asx listed provaris energy pv1 initially pursued natural gas shipping but is now eyeing the development of two bespoke hydrogen gas vessels called gh2 carriers with a capacity of 26 000 and 120 000 cubic metres the ships have been approved by the american bureau of shipping with construction slated for mid 2023 provaris s patented method involves integrating two 130 metre long tanks into the vessels built with high carbon steel to avoid the risk of the highly compressed gas leaking provaris managing director martin carolan notes the common shipping method is by way of ammonia or liquefaction similar to lng but the gas needs to be cooled to ultra low temperatures and then reconverted to gas on arrival there s a lot of energy and capital being spent to convert the product into a much higher density liquid purely to get the shipping costs down carolan says the proposed fleet is part of a broader joint venture project based on the tiwi islands which would integrate a 2 8 gigawatt solar farm and with a 30 kilometre transmission line to an existing port where an electrolyser would be built a prefeasibility design and concept study has costed the venture at us4 5 5 2bn based on 100 000 tonnes per annum of green hydrogen exports carolan notes that only two per cent of the gas would be lost in the compression storage and export stages compared with up to 35 per cent if the hydrogen is transported in the form of ammonia under current methods it s a simply way of delivering a pure gaseous product and in the molecule the customers typically want he says carolan says the ships initially could be used for other third party hydrogen ventures ahead of the tiwi islands project while a more efficient shipping method would help producing green hydrogen still requires intense energy input to ameliorate this age old problem the adelaide based asx listed sparc technologies spn is furthering a novel technology to produce hydrogen from an electricity free process called photocatalytic water splitting pws the work is by way of the sparc hydrogen joint venture with sparc technologies in partnership with the university of adelaide and andrew forrest s fortescue future industries known about for five decades but eluding commercialisation pws uses the sun s radiation and a highly engineered photocatalyst material to split water into hydrogen and oxygen because it obviates the need for electrolysers an expensive component of conventional green hydrogen production the output is expected to be very competitively priced the tech is based on a solar reactor developed by the university of adelaide and flinders university the bourse s original hydrogen pure play hazer hzr is beavering away on its plans to produce clean hydrogen and graphitic carbon from methane normally methane derived hydrogen is expensive to produce with high carbon emissions that s why it s known as grey methane hazer s turquoise iteration methane pyrolysis adds iron ore as a catalyst to produce the high value graphitic carbon rather than carbon in its feared planet warming gaseous form hazer has two pilot projects on the go in sydney and perth s kwinana and plans to start a 100 tonnes per annum biogas powered commercial demo plant in perth in 2023 beyond that hazer has a memorandum of understanding mou with canadian energy giants suncor energy and fortis inc to build a 2500 tpa plant in canada s british colombia province hazer also inked a vague but promising mou

of cars approaching 200 mph on long straights up from this past year s nearly 180 mph top end speed the series is maturing nicely jaguar tcs racing drivers mitch evans sam bird and jaguar tcs racing team principal james barclay show off the 2023 jaguar i type 6 in london it s still a very young championship but it s growing at an incredible rate james barclay managing director jaguar land rover motorsport and team principal of the jaguar tcs racing formula e team told autoweek in london the interest we re seeing from partners from sponsors from media is really ramping up at the heart of it is the electric powertrain technology which is going to be more relevant to all of us now and even more so in the future barclay along with the team s veteran formula e drivers sam bird and mitch evans were center stage for the reveal of the jaguar tcs racing s i type 6 car on london s westside on nov 30 while jaguar wasn t involved in formula e from the beginning of gen 1 barclay has had his eyes on the series since its formation in 2014 i went to the original launch of the series and we were just scoping out potential future racing categories for jaguar to return to motorsport barclay said at the heart of it was a very interesting set of ingredients you look at something like the paris climate change convention in september 2015 it was the first time we had a book on certain countries where you wouldn t be able to sell internal combustion engine cars the future was now clear our view was that the formula e the pinnacle electric world championship was moving into the bullseye it s safe to say that since that point in 2015 to now we ve just seen the championship continue to go parallel with a massively changed industry mike pryson the jaguar i type 6 features a stock chassis that is provided to all teams in the formula e series and that means a massively changed racing series since the one started by alejandro agag and signed off on by then fia president jean todt nearly a decade ago jaguar jumped into the series in 2016 what was interesting at that time the range limitations weren t actually a limitation on technology it was actually just the limitation of originally the series was designed for 20 minute races barclay said then we found we needed to be closer to an hour for a race to be really exciting so we actually needed two cars the first generation was to prove you could race electric cars generation 2 was about saying let s make the cars faster let s make cars that will do the full race and race faster with greater efficiency greater range and make better sport we saw a world championship with some of the best manufacturers best teams best drivers and great racing and great cities iconic cities like hong kong paris new york and now gen 3 is about saying let s go faster again let s be more powerful more efficient and really challenge efficiency targets this coming season the series will be bringing its message to new racing destinations including sao paulo cape town south africa and hyderabad india tokyo plans to host a race in 2024 new york is not on the provisional 2023 schedule but series organizers are still hopeful of a race in the u s in 23 two dates on that schedule are still listed as tbc to be confirmed manufacturers along for the ride next season in addition to jaguar include porsche nissan nio from china maserati mahindra and ds automobiles from france maserati is new to the series tire supplier hankook is also new to formula e for next season we ve got lots of new toys to play with in the the new car said phil charles jaguar tcs racing s technical manager first and foremost is power gen 2 we had 250 kilowatt maximum power on the rear axle when we go to gen 3 we ve got 350 kilowatt maximum that s massive the next thing is there are drive shafts on the front of the car so for the first time we ve got a motor a power train on the front axle this motor doesn t drive the car but it is used in braking charles says the braking system just adds to an already efficient car in gen 2 we were squeezing pads on disks and burning energy he said now we ve got the capability to do a bit of that but also we can recharge that energy back into the battery that s a big step for the championship we re recovering more energy every time we hit the brake the chassis for all the teams is stock fia determines the bodywork and aerodynamics williams engineering supplies the batteries to all teams what the teams do have control over is the powertrain all of our efforts go into developing the energy the motor generator unit mgu the inverter the gearbox the driveshafts the suspension and the carbon maintenance charles said the question begs is formula e ready for prime time ready to show off its product to a larger audience instead of say the current summer weekend on a makeshift road course in brooklyn before maybe 20 000 people how about joining up with formula 1 and becoming a support series on an f1 saturday before say 110 000 at circuit of the americas in austin or how about showing off formula e to the world s f1 fans at las vegas or miami charles says that the series has never been more ready on the technology side anyway on the other hand team principal barclay is happy with the lane the series is currently driving in so we ll never be a saturday show i don t believe so that s my view so we ll never be a saturday show i don t believe so barclay said that s my view why am i saying that it s because we re just different formula 1 is the pinnacle of ice hybrid racing formula e is the pinnacle of electric racing and i think the two have merit to have their own show that doesn t mean we can t work cleverly in synergies in other areas and absolutely i think that could be really an area of interest potentially in the future liberty media owns formula 1 and has a majority stake in formula e as well so from that point of view i think there are future synergies barclay pointed out the formula e actually has some built in advantages over formula 1 when it comes to racing in many places on the world s stage one thing is we can go racing in really unique locations because of the benefit of zero emissions and reduced noise barclay said i think we as a championship will continue to find our ideal format the idea of racing in city centers still stands but i think what we do have is a sport which will continue to evolve continue to get faster continue to showcase amazing racing

the price of gasoline is dropping like a rock chicken wings are suddenly a bargain and retailers drowning in excess inventory are looking to make a deal after more than a year of high inflation many consumers are finally starting to catch a break even apartment rents and car prices two items that hammered millions of household budgets this year are no longer spiraling out of control global supply chains are finally operating normally as more consumers spend more on in person services like restaurant meals and less on goods like furniture and computers that come from an ocean away the cost of sending a standard 40 foot container from china to the u s west coast is 1 935 down more than 90 from its september 2021 peak of 20 586 according to the online freight marketplace freightos the moderation in inflation is just beginning to appear in government statistics in october the federal reserve s preferred price gauge the personal consumption expenditures index posted its smallest monthly increase since september of last year and is up 6 over the past 12 months the better known consumer price index is rising at an annual rate of 7 7 down from 9 1 in june the worst of the inflation is behind us said steven blitz chief u s economist for ts lombard in new york the question is where does inflation settle the fed has been raising interest rates sharply since march in a bid to get inflation back to its 2 t price stability target fed chair jerome h powell on wednesday noted signs of progress but said it was far too early to claim victory friday s stronger than expected jobs report which showed wages rising too quickly for policymakers tastes only underscored the point the central bank does not expect to reach its inflation goal until 2025 it will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining by any standard inflation remains much too high powell told an audience at the brookings institution still there are clear signs of improvement in merchandise prices as consumers resume their pre pandemic spending patterns excluding volatile food and energy prices goods prices rose in october by 5 1 down from a 12 3 annual rate in february but as goods prices begin cooling pressure is building on services rising demand and limited supply think short staffed restaurants has services inflation running at an annual 6 7 rate more than twice the year ago figure the expectation is that goods prices will continue to disinflate but services inflation will more gradually slow and will be much stickier said kathy bostjancic chief economist at nationwide most of what is happening now with prices reflects developments in specific markets or consumers return to pre pandemic routines the plunge in ocean shipping costs by itself has stripped roughly 0 7 percentage points from the inflation rate according to zvi schreiber ceo of freightos by making credit more expensive the fed has put a major dent in the housing industry with mortgage rates briefly topping 7 recently pending home sales in october were 37 lower than one year earlier according to the national association of realtors but the full effect on the economy of higher interest rates will take many months to materialize either way consumers are unimpressed less than 1 of those responding to a recent census bureau survey said they had noticed prices for goods and services declining over the past two months and 15 7 of households said they find it very difficult to pay their routine household expenses a figure that is virtually unchanged from the 15 9 who reported affordability woes in june to be sure in a 26 trillion economy prices on some products are always falling even as many others rise in june when inflation reached its highest point in more than 40 years prices nonetheless dropped that month for bacon window coverings and men s sweaters according to the bureau of labor statistics so it s important not to exaggerate the recent improvement that said the global economic backdrop has shifted with europe and the united kingdom in recession and china hobbled by its restrictive zero covid policy global demand for oil has sagged a barrel of brent crude now goes for about 85 one third less than in early march following russia s invasion of ukraine as a result the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is 3 47 down almost 8 percent from one month ago according to aaa many retailers find themselves with unusually high inventories the result of two years of herky jerky supply chains but as shipping and raw material costs declined companies such as ikea recently began reducing selected prices tolga oncu retail operations manager for ingka group ikea s corporate parent told reuters this week he was quite optimistic about being able to lower additional prices in the months ahead the company did not reply to a request for comment walmart also said last month that it will be looking for opportunities to cut prices sam s club the company s warehouse membership store recently cut the price of its in house hot dog and soda combo to 1 38 from 1 50 undercutting rival costco living with high prices through this year has a cumulative impact on our customers especially for those that are most budget conscious and so we re focused on bringing our costs and prices down as quickly as possible by item and category doug mcmillon walmart ceo told investors in november chicken cars and rents provide clues as to why forecasters expect inflation to ease in coming months even if it takes years to return to the fed s 2 target chicken prices spiked near an all time high earlier this year covid restrictions on poultry plants coupled with an unexpected decline in the number of chicks hatching successfully led to a drop in supplies as demand was soaring it just created a ton of price pressure said matt busardo a market reporter for urner barry a food industry information provider the situation reversed this fall when production rebounded just in time for the typical seasonal decline in demand the amount of chicken in cold storage jumped nearly 20 since may according to the u s department of agriculture that s created some bargains at least for restaurants wholesale prices for boneless chicken breasts have dropped dramatically over the past six months busardo said at wingstop a fast food chain based in dallas executives said the cost of bone in chicken wings fell by nearly 43 in the quarter ending sept 24 we have a favorable commodity outlook not only for bone in wings but also for breast meat which we believe will continue into early 2023 alex kaleida chief financial officer told investors oct 26 the company hasn t lowered any retail prices but said it s offering a new chicken sandwich for 5 29 and a combo meal of 20 wings and a large order of fries for 16 99 to share the savings after soaring in 2021 wholesale used car prices are down 15 from january according to manheim an atlanta based automobile auction company and those declines are starting to show up in prices paid by consumers said jonathan smoke chief economist for cox automotive new car prices will be slower to react dealers at the end of october had 1 56 million vehicles in stock the highest figure since may 2021 that was enough to cover 49 days of sales up substantially from one year ago but still well below the pre pandemic figure of 86 according to cox more ample supplies mean fewer customers are paying above the manufacturers suggested retail price a common occurrence during the pandemic the average new car sold in october for 46 991 which was 230 above the msrp according to edmund s a car shopping website in may the average buyer paid 721 above list price improving conditions in the new car market also are drawing buyers away from the used car market which contributes to lower demand and falling prices on those lots the used market has benefited from abnormal demand throughout the pandemic as a result of consumers being forced to buy used could have or would have preferred to buy new smoke said via email apartment rents meanwhile after moving steadily higher all year are finally cooling the national average rent for a two bedroom apartment is up 8 1 from one year ago down from april s 14 6 rate according to zumper an online rental marketplace the change has been especially striking in cities such as boise phoenix and austin which benefited as employees moved to take advantage of the work from home era rental prices are cooling off and cooling off faster than anyone ever expected said anthemos georgiades zumper s ceo 23 is going to be a far more affordable year for renters real time rental data takes months to show up in government statistics powell said in his brookings speech but it will start contributing to lower inflation readings next year which explains why most forecasters expect a steady decline in inflation the fed expects its preferred inflation gauge the pce index to hit 2 8 by the end of next year down from 6 today

sometimes it just hurts to watch the constant yammering about the economy particularly on those dry as dust cable networks like cnbc and bloomberg with anchors and analysts conversing in wall street jargon and wringing their hands over inflation and every stumble and leap in the markets it takes a toll the economy specifically inflation was the top concern of 31 of those who voted in the midterm elections last month just ahead of abortion at 27 according to national exit polling faith in the economy tanked from march through may of 2020 with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and it was warranted the deadly new virus to which humans had no acquired immunity and for which we lacked vaccines set off a wave of panic with an apocalyptic feel hospitals were overrun unemployment hit levels unseen since the great depression supply chains disintegrated businesses large and small failed in many cases wiping out families livelihoods and savings governments imposed moratoria on foreclosures and evictions during the depth of the crisis in hopes of forestalling if not preventing massive homelessness many of those hit hardest people on the margins financially have yet to recover federal infusions of cash into the economy provided a safety net of sorts but those are over and legal protections against evictions are expiring but as a whole the economy hasn t done badly at least as it is reflected in the taxes people pay to virginia s treasury i became a state budget nerd more than two decades ago when i started tracking monthly revenue summaries by keying them into a spreadsheet to augment my reporting on virginia s finances in the early years of the 21st century i never intended it to go on and on and on but it did and i ve cataloged that data for every major category of general fund tax collections every month since over time 276 months counting october s results those numbers tell some interesting and important stories about virginia s booms busts and everything in between first a little background for people who lead interesting lives virginia s whole fiscal kit and caboodle for budgeting purposes consists of two primary buckets of revenue the general fund and the non general fund the non general fund is the larger of the two but that money is largely a pass through derived from specific sources such as fees federal grants fuel taxes tuition at state supported colleges business licenses and profits from the state monopoly on liquor sales to name just a few non general fund money is already spoken for earmarked by law for specific uses the general fund underwrites state government operations which include law enforcement state employee salaries state support for local public schools and mental health services more than two thirds of it comes from state income taxes since the money is discretionary that is its specific use isn t prescribed by law it causes the general assembly s most protracted disputes this year s standoff lasted until june 1 just four weeks before the previous budget expired at the stroke of midnight on june 30 a record surplus notwithstanding because it s overwhelmingly drawn from personal income the general fund is an excellent statistical reflection of the commonwealth s economic health the past two fiscal years which start each july 1 and end the next june 30 have been off the charts after a tepid fiscal 2020 in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 total general fund revenues climbed year over year by 14 and 16 respectively after a mere 2 increase for fiscal 2020 the only comparable fiscal year since 2000 was a 15 spike in fiscal 2005 the apex of a white hot economy fueled by a lusty run up in the real estate market that collapsed three years later hurtling the nation into the great recession hard dollar numbers however tell a more convincing story than percentages through fiscal 2020 year over year general revenue had increased by 1 billion or more just six times this century the largest being just under 1 8 billion in fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2021 however revenue was 3 1 billion greater than the year before and in the fiscal year that ended this june it exceeded fiscal 2021 s total by 4 billion in both of those years actual collections obliterated official revenue estimates on which budgeted spending was based the first quarter of the current fiscal year picked up where fiscal 2022 left off general tax collections from july through september totaled about 5 6 billion down slightly from 5 9 billion in the same period the previous year but eclipsing 5 billion for the same quarter three years in a row so what does this wonky number soup mean terry rephann a regional economist with the university of virginia s weldon cooper center for public service suggests that it s the result of wage inflation he points to data presented to the legislature s budget writing committees at their annual retreat last month to back him up wages grew by 9 3 in virginia in the fiscal year that ended june 30 as businesses large and small struggled to rehire staff lost during the pandemic the presentation said wage growth the previous two fiscal years was 3 and 4 7 respectively those collections are known as withholding revenues and wage earners recognize them from their pay stubs as the bite already sent off to state and federal governments the wild card is the so called non withholding income taxes paid on capital gains and by the self employed on their estimated earnings a stratospheric stock market drove freakish year over year non withholding increases of 31 for each of the past two fiscal years over the previous 21 fiscal years year over year average growth was 6 the trajectory of the past two years non withholding collections is unsustainable a presentation by the house appropriations committee staff warned so while virginians make and tax collectors take more than ever how come we feel poorer the price of meat fish and poultry is up 8 over the past 12 months according to forbes advisor electricity is up 14 natural gas is up 20 rent is up 7 5 and fruits and veggies are up 9 3 and if you just want to get away gasoline is 50 cents a gallon higher than it was in mid 2021 though down from this summer s high around 5 a gallon airline tickets cost 43 more it wears people down and it can make an electorate surly you can earn enough political science degrees to paper a wall and never hear truer more actionable wisdom than this people vote their pocketbooks you don t need exit polls to know that either

a lot of time and money has been spent in our country coming up with increased security and contingency plans for the possibility of a terrorist or cyber attack on our electrical grid with winter weather here even losing power for a few hours poses risks when we rely so much on the grid to keep us warm thankfully we live in part of the country not texas where we have experienced crews and a grid system designed to handle cold weather and the occasional outages but the real threat comes not from terrorists but from the sciuridae family yes it s the wide eyed and bushy tailed members of the homegrown squirrel family that is public enemy no 1 of the grid i don t think paralysis of the electrical grid is more likely by cyberattack than by natural disaster said john inglis former deputy director of the national security agency and frankly the no 1 threat experienced to date by the u s electrical grid is squirrels recently we were the victims of such an attack it was mid morning on a mild day with no storms when the electrons on my screen went blank usually in conjunction with my mind along with the power to our house outages happen in the country and sometimes they are only for a few seconds before the lights come back on that did not happen so after a few minutes i called our utility company to report the outage about 45 minutes later the utility truck came up our road and i greeted them in the yard been shooting squirrels lately the lineman asked there s plenty of them around i replied somewhat perplexed by the question looks like there may be one up there he said with a smile pointing to the top of the transformer on our electrical pole sure enough there was some sort of furry carcass splayed out on the transformer that was confirmed when the deceased tree rat was pulled down by the lineman s fiberglass pole the victim and perpetrator was a red pine squirrel that had a black scorch mark across its chest the electrocution had caused the connecting wire to the utility line to burn out less than a minute later a new connecting wire was installed and we were back on the grid utility companies confirm that squirrels are the top power grid attackers entergy a new orleans based energy company operating in the southern u s reported 15 000 of the 22 000 animal related power outages in its mississippi service area were due to squirrels that i have to do it is nuts unitil a utility company serving over 107 000 in the northeast u s says squirrels cause an average of 8 5 of its outages each year unitil says since the animals use power lines for travel it s easy for them to cause electrical trouble and it s not just power to the homes squirrels can take down our financial markets too marketwatch com reported in 1987 and 1994 the nasdaq was shut down on two occasions when squirrels forced a halt to trading until the power grid could be restarted there s even a website that tracks confirmed power outage attacks caused by animals cybersquirrel1 com tracked confirmed reports from 1987 to 2019 and documented 1 252 power outages caused by squirrels including a map of the attacks frankly i m surprised we haven t had a power outage before caused by a squirrel as we live in the country and have trees in the yard when we first moved into my great grandparents house and before we remodeled pine squirrels had chewed an entrance into the attic which sounded like a bowling alley my late father thinned the herd by picking them off with a 22 at his bird feeder i believe the final count was close to 30 a few days after our squirrel attack there was another outage this one lasted for several hours and was widespread across the area i haven t heard the cause it was a dark and stormy night and the sciuridae family is everywhere collection good

economic data that shows that inflation may be peaking october s core inflation growth of 5 2 year over year was lower than september s growth of 5 year over year the cboe volatility index vix has also declined to below 20 recently with the vix lower it seems investors are not expecting as much volatility in the s p 500 as they did before nevertheless there is still debate over what might happen next although the federal reserve has indicated that it won t increase interest rates as fast as it did in the past several months many economists still think the u s central bank has a ways to go before it finishes raising rates if rates rise too much demand for many companies might weaken and the u s economy might slow if that happens corporate earnings might not be as strong as expected and stocks could be significantly more volatile when the next earnings season begins there is also a chance of a recession next year even if the stock market has rallied recently billionaire founder of amazon jeff bezos recently said for consumers take some risk off the table just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference bezos meant consumers should try to save some money in case

the decline and fall of democracy worldwide united nations dec 5 2022 ips a head of state who presided over an authoritarian regime in southeast asia was once asked about rigged elections in his country i promised i will give you the right to vote he said but i didn t say anything about counting those votes that infamous quote perhaps uttered half jokingly was rightly described as an unholy combination of despotism and democracy in a report released last week the stockholm based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance international idea said half of the democratic governments around the world are in decline undermined by problems ranging from restrictions on freedom of expression to distrust in the legitimacy of elections the number of backsliding countries those with the most severe erosion of democracy is at its peak and includes the established democracy of the united states which still faces problems of political polarization institutional disfunction and threats to civil liberties globally the number of countries moving toward authoritarianism is more than double the number moving toward democracy this decline comes as elected leaders face unprecedented challenges from russia s war in ukraine cost of living crises a looming global recession and climate change these are some of the key findings in the report titled the global state of democracy report 2022 forging social contracts in a time of discontent published by international idea andreas bummel executive director democracy without borders told ips the new assessment is alarming as it confirms that democracy continues to stagnate or decline in most countries in addition non democratic regimes are becoming more repressive he added it is clear that stronger efforts are needed to counter these trends people all over the world actually want democracy and current protests in china and iran are a testament to this to name just two examples international idea refers to surveys that indicate a growing sentiment in favor of authoritarian leaders but there are other surveys too that show consistently high popular support for democracy as a principle of government he argued lack of confidence mainly relates to the actual performance of democratic governments most importantly they must do more to ensure that their policies benefit the majority of people in a tangible way they need to fight corruption and lobbyism in their own ranks and beyond he noted innovations are needed so people have more opportunities to be heard democracy without borders suggests that convening a transnational citizens assembly should be considered that looks into common root causes of democratic decline and how they can be addressed democracies need to collaborate better and step up internationally too they need to help strengthen democratic representation and participation of citizens at the un another proposal we are currently looking into is establishing the mandate of a un special rapporteur on democracy declared bummel meanwhile the 193 member united nations was no better where buying and selling votes were a common practice during un elections mostly in a bygone era when un member states compete for the presidency of the general assembly or membership in the security council or in various un bodies the voting was largely tainted by bribery cheque book diplomacy and offers of luxury cruises in europe while promises of increased aid to the world s poorer nations came mostly with heavy strings attached back in the 1940s and 50s voting was by a show of hands particularly in committee rooms but in later years a more sophisticated electronic board high up in the general assembly hall tallied the votes or in the case of elections to the security council or the international court of justice the voting was by secret ballot in one of the hard fought elections many moons ago there were rumors that an oil soaked middle eastern country was doling out high end swiss made wrist watches and also stocks in the former arabian american oil company aramco one of the world s largest oil companies to un diplomats as a trade off for their votes so when hands went up at voting time in the committee room the largest number of hands raised in favor of the oil blessed candidate sported swiss watches as anecdotes go it symbolized the corruption that prevails in voting in inter governmental organizations including the united nations perhaps much like most national elections the world over just ahead of an election for membership in the security council one western european country offered free mediterranean luxury cruises in return for votes while another country dished out openly in the general assembly hall boxes of gift wrapped expensive

by aziz el yaakoubi riyadh reuters crown prince mohammed bin salman hosts china s leader this week at a delicate moment in u s saudi ties signalling riyadh s resolve to navigate a polarised global order regardless of the wishes of its western allies analysts said the ruler of the oil giant has made a comeback on the world stage following the 2018 murder of jamal khashoggi which cast a pall over saudi u s ties and has been defiant in the face of u s ire over the kingdom s energy policy and pressure from washington to help isolate russia in a show of strength as an aspiring leader of the arab world prince mohammed will also gather rulers from across the middle east and north africa for a chinese arab summit during the visit by president xi jinping expected to start on tuesday riyadh is working according to strategic calculations that it must accommodate beijing as it is now an indispensable economic partner said ayham kamel head of middle east and north africa at eurasia group though the united states remains partner of choice for gulf states reliant on it for their security riyadh is charting a foreign policy that serves its national economic transformation as the world pivots away from hydrocarbons saudi s lifeblood the analysts said there is certainly a risk that expanding relations with china backfires and lead to a further split in the u s saudi relationship but mbs is certainly not pursuing this out of spite kamel said xi s visit comes at a time when u s saudi ties are at a nadir uncertainty weighs on global energy markets with the west imposing a price cap on russian oil and as washington warily eyes china s growing influence in the middle east the saudi government did not respond to requests for comment on xi s visit and its agenda in a sign of irritation with u s criticism of riyadh s human rights record prince mohammed told the atlantic magazine in march that he did not care whether u s president joe biden misunderstood things about him saying biden should be focusing on america s interests he also suggested in remarks carried by saudi state news agency spa that same month that while riyadh aimed to boost its ties to washington it could also choose to reduce our interests saudi investments in the united states saudi arabia is deepening economies ties to china it is china s top oil supplier although fellow opec producer russia has increased its chinese market share with lower priced fuel beijing has also been lobbying for use of its yuan currency in trade instead of the u s dollar riyadh had previously threatened to ditch some dollar oil trades to confront possible u s legislation exposing opec members to antitrust lawsuits u s saudi ties under biden s administration already strained over human rights and the yemen war in which riyadh leads a military coalition have frayed further due to the ukraine war and opec oil policy fanfare and deals diplomats in the region said xi would have a lavish reception akin to the one shown then president donald trump when he visited the kingdom in 2017 and in contrast to biden s awkward visit in july that had aimed to mend ties with riyadh trump was met by king salman at the airport amid fanfare while clinching over 100 billion in contracts for u s military industry biden who once vowed to make riyadh a pariah over the khashoggi killing had downplayed his meetings with prince mohammed to whom he gave a fist bump rather than a handshake the chinese delegation is expected to sign dozens of agreements with saudi arabia and other arab states covering energy security and investments diplomats have told reuters prince mohammed is focused on delivering his vision 2030 diversification plan to wean the economy off oil by creating new industries including cars and arms manufacturing as well as logistics though foreign direct investment has been slow the kingdom is investing heavily in new infrastructure and megaprojects in tourism and initiatives like the 500 billion neom zone a boon for chinese construction firms saudi arabia and its gulf allies have said they would continue to diversify partnerships to serve economic and security interests despite u s reservations about their ties with both russia and china prince mohammed wants to demonstrate to his own constituency that the kingdom is important to many global powers said jonathan fulton non resident senior fellow at atlantic council perhaps he s signalling to the u s as well but he s more concerned about what people within the kingdom think complex relationship biden pledged consequences for riyadh after the opec output move but washington has since reiterated its support for the kingdom s security with u s officials stressing the u s comparative advantage in building integrated defence structures in the gulf white house national security spokesman john kirby nyse told reporters on wednesday that washington wants to make sure that its strategic relationship with riyadh was working in our best interests u s officials have declined to comment when asked about saudi china bilateral relations ahead of xi s visit washington has voiced concern over gulf arab use of chinese 5g technology and chinese investments in sensitive infrastructure like ports including in the united arab emirates which halted a chinese port project due to u s concern riyadh and abu dhabi are buying chinese military equipment and a saudi firm signed a deal with a chinese company to manufacture armed drones in the kingdom saudi analyst abdulaziz sager chairman of riyadh based gulf research center told saudi tv asharq news that arab states wanted to tell western allies that they have alternatives and their relations are primarily based on economic interests though saudi ties with china appear to be growing much more quickly than with the united states the actual relationships are not comparable said jon alterman director of the middle east programme at washington s center for strategic and international studies the relationships with china pale versus those with the united states in terms of both complexity and intimacy he said

in a year of rampant inflation not seen since the early 1980s costco cost was a warm hug to millions of loyal members by keeping prices for everything from food to gasoline as low as possible just as rivals were aggressively jacking up prices it also provided a warm hug to its fans on wall street producing stellar results from sizable same store sales increases to its stock price which got the best of the s p 500 gspc index not to mention its sales of 222 7 billion in the fiscal year ended october up a whopping 16 percent for that and more including costco s continued status as one of the nation s best employers we named the issaquah washington based warehouse behemoth our 2022 company of the year if there were one company that could say rising prices weren t a negative it was costco the great inflationary outbreak of 2022 placed costco s 842 worldwide stores squarely under the spotlight offering up yet another opportunity for the 39 year old retailer to showcase to investors and members its low price leadership chops consider cephas sund from los angeles california the costco cardholder who loves organic products says he shopped at conventional grocery stores prior to 2022 but skyrocketing prices put a hard stop on many of those excursions when organic produce at the grocery stores is almost double what it cost at costco you can see where the savings quickly added up sund said sund and other customers we talked to said pretty much the same thing costco is a trusted retailer who had their backs throughout a challenging economic year that ought to tell you something how as the cost of items like toothpaste and eggs soared costco in most cases was the last to raise prices at its cavernous 146 000 square foot stores explained jefferies retail analyst corey tarlowe the company is very strict on price and i think that is evident through its steadfast commitment to its 1 50 hot dog and soda combo competitive gas prices and 4 99 rotisserie chickens tarlowe explained case in point as gas prices spiked to more than 5 00 a gallon in the summer costco saw lines at its hundreds of u s gas stations stretch out onto highways why the company stayed true to its dna as a wholesaler and kept gas prices at the lowest levels in town tarlowe says costco s gas prices have typically been 0 25 1 00 a gallon cheaper than the next closest competitor gasbuddy a fuel station app said costco was the cheapest fuel station nationwide for the fifth year in a row elizabeth dragomir had to stand in a line of vehicles waiting for gas at costco after a cyberattack crippled the biggest fuel pipeline in the country run by colonial pipeline dragomir s car ran out of gas in the parking lot in norfolk virginia u s may 11 2021 reuters jay paul jay paul reuters costco held the line in other ways too as walmart owned sam s club jacked up membership prices by 5 10 in september costco held firm execs said it wasn t the right time to tax consumers dealing with runaway inflation sam s did undercut costco s hot dog drink combo by 12 cents you can t win them all all of those warm embraces of customers was just costco being costco long time ceo craig jelinek told yahoo finance in an exclusive interview inside a new club opening in lake stevens washington i think first of all we ve been very fortunate we ve got great employees and every company is only as good as everybody around them said jelinek who has been with the company since nearly the time of its founding in 1984 by jeffrey brotman and jim sinegal we ve persevered and we re very pleased that we ve been able to get merchandise and continue to create value for our members and grow our membership base and drive sales this isn t a surprise to the retailer s long time followers on wall street goldman sachs kate mcshane for instance has covered costco for years the company s focus on low prices and stellar operational execution is etched in the fabric of the retailer and has served the company well for years in good times and bad she explained the get it done mindset harkens back to the company s co founders jim sinegal and jeffrey brotman who created a no frills atmosphere that put the member at the center they re definitely one of the best run best in class retailers mcshane said we ve not necessarily been that surprised costco has been gaining market share as a result of some of the macroeconomic dynamics experts like mcshane believe costco has gained market share notably in food throughout the pandemic primarily from selling high quality private label products under its popular kirkland signature brand here are some company of the year worthy and wall street pleasing highlights from the past year costco s same store sales have out performed conventional competitors costco s u s same store sales for the nine weeks ended october 30 increased by 10 by comparison third quarter same store sales for discounters walmart wmt u s and target tgt rose by a far slower 8 2 and 2 7 respectively stacked up against its pure play warehouse rivals costco s recent sales growth trends are more in line east coast warehouse club rival bj s wholesale bj saw third quarter same store sales increase by 9 7 same store sales at walmart s sam s club increased 10 in the third quarter but given that costco is much bigger than the likes of sam s which has sales of about 59 billion those same store sales figures are impressive costco had a bang up year within its key operating metrics for the fiscal year ended aug 28 costco posted a 14 4 overall same store sales increase a 93 renewal rate for u s members the addition of 7 3 million members and a slight increase in net profit margins a win in the hyper inflationary environment meanwhile total cash clocked in at 11 1 billion representing a hearty 34 of current assets despite 12 months of rock solid financial performance the stock is down 13 this year as of dec 2 but that still beats the s p 500 by a couple percentage points not bad in a year where bear markets reigned supreme we re really the extreme value proposition costco s 30 plus year cfo richard galanti told yahoo finance of the warehouse chain s financial success in a year of of eye popping inflation but like any other retailer there are always uncertainties lurking analysts contend costco s often relatively expensive price to earnings multiple reflective of its years of steady and strong financials requires the company to be perfect operationally at every turn the valuation on costco i can i can tell you does give some people some angst because they are at such a big premium to the market they re at such a big premium to walmart and other big box retailers that some people don t totally understand why or they can t really bridge the gap between them goldman s mcshane said costco didn t have a perfect november as same store sales growth cooled versus october the company reported on nov 30 investors promptly punished the often teflon stock on the view 2023 would bring further sales slowdowns another wild card for 2023 is membership fees costco could raise them after years of holding the line much to the disappointment of wall street that would of course increase revenues and profits but could also turn off some loyal still inflation weary customers costco s last membership fee increase kicked in on june 1 2017 the warehouse club took its gold star membership the entry level costco membership fee up 5 to 60 and executive membership offers 2 rewards on qualified purchases and other perks fees increased by 10 to 120 you re likely to hear something about this in the next earnings call in maybe six to 12 months i think and it ll probably be pretty likely that we ll hear something about it at least upcoming on the next earnings call said jefferies analyst tarlowe he estimates that a membership fee increase could boost costco s earnings growth by a mid single digit percentage rate a costco bull he doesn t believe such a hike is priced into the retailer s already relatively expensive stock costco s cfo galanti said the retailer isn t ready to raise the cost of its membership but it will be something it clearly outlines to wall street when and if the time comes growth will also be driven by opening 20 to 25 new warehouses a year and the existing business drivers galanti added in the meantime jelinek is paying careful attention to consumer spending this holiday season amid the mixed economic backdrop jelinek says he is pleased with the trends in the business to kick off the holiday shopping season but does see a few warning flags that amount to uncertainties headed into 2023 you know a little bit a little bit jelinek replied when asked if he sees a recession forming in the u s our jewelry business has slowed down if you look at the really high end television sets they ve slowed down i think right now people are very very value conscious they re always value conscious but i think more so now than ever obsessed with the 1 50 hot dog soda combo at costco like brian sozzi left you can thank costco ceo craig jelinek right for not raising the price of the combo despite sky high inflation kevin burke what the 70 year old jelinek may see forming however is a well deserved retirement sometime within the next couple of years in february costco promoted ron vachris to president and coo he also joined jelinek and galanti on costco s board of directors vachris 56 has similar merchant dna to jelinek and costco s founders he began his retail career at the age of 16 at price club which merged with costco in 1993 yahoo finance briefly chatted with vachris inside the washington store opening he was in true merchant form walking aisles and chatting with members jelinek played any potential retirement announcement close to the vest let s put it this way he s president and we ll let it go at that jelinek said when asked about succession adding he plans to be ceo for a while
