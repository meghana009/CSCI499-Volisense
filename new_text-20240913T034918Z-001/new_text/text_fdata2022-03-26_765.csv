investors should consider an updated inflation hedging exchange traded fund strategy that could help better cope with the current inflationary pressures in the recent webcast inflation strategies how to survive extraordinary times james davolos portfolio manager research analyst horizon kinetics outlined the shifts in fundamentals that has contributed to the elevated inflationary headwinds that we face today specifically davolos noted that the u s money supply is up about 40 since the end of 2019 the federal debt the increase of which is linked to the money printing is now the highest proportion of gdp that it s ever been about 13 of all the dollars ever created in the history of the united states of america were created in the past 12 months if the economy cannot expand sufficiently to allow the debt gdp ratio to gradually subside to a sustainable level the government s only politically realistic option a timeworn solution is to actually continue printing more money davolos said davolos also added that the benign inflation environment of the past decades has partly been a function of significantly reduced commodity prices which is very unlikely to persist it is becoming increasingly difficult to produce the raw materials necessary to support global growth at a high standard of living additionally fiscal spending is likely to further pressure key commodity markets investors are also faced with challenges when picking the right assets to invest in during these conditions cash and bonds are extraordinarily overvalued at near zero yields that are exceeded by the current inflation rate stocks by some measures are overvalued beyond historical precedent davolos said robert sechan ceo managing partner co founder newedge wealth highlighted some of the shortcomings of traditional inflation hedging investments for example treasury inflation protected securities or tips have been a go to option for fixed income investors however he explained that inflation expectations and long term interest rates are highly correlated so outsized movements in interest rates relative to inflation can hamper returns on tips bonds the tips price will only increase in value in the interim should inflation expectations rise relative to the 10 year yield growth stocks which have enjoyed a multi year bull run are also under pressure in this rising interest rate environment ahead the strategists warned that growth stocks have almost infinite duration or very high p e levels so they typically have a negative correlation with interest rates alternatively davolos highlighted the benefits of the horizon kinetics inflation beneficiaries etf infl an actively managed etf seeking long term capital growth in real inflation adjusted terms it aims to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies that are expected to benefit either directly or indirectly from rising prices of real assets i e assets for which value is mainly derived from physical properties such as commodities such as those whose revenues are expected to increase with inflation without corresponding increases in expenses we consider companies that exhibit scalable economically resilient business models davolos said many provide exposure to hard assets via capital light business models potential investors should note that infl is not a binary bet on inflation the fund focuses on businesses with the potential to earn high cash flows under moderate inflation scenarios but are markedly higher under certain rising inflationary conditions this portfolio is intended to benefit from inflation i e appreciate not just maintain value in an inflationary environment infl s strategy focuses on hard assets with a capital light approach the capital light business model requires less working capital and debt while earning higher returns on capital this facilitates higher compounding of capital over full business cycles these capital light business models include areas like transaction facilitators royalty streaming companies data research companies timber agriculture real estate and infrastructure managers we believe they improve the business quality of a portfolio and reduce the cyclicality it s not a bet on inflation davolos said financial advisors who are interested in learning more about inflation hedging strategies can watch the webcast here on demand

commentary while serving as a state senator i can still remember working at my district office on a state holiday one where governmental offices are closed but the private sector does not observe it and continues to stay open and do business the phone rang and i decided to answer it i just drove from arizona to california gas is one dollar less per gallon across our border what is the senator going to do about it i didn t tell him who i was but indicated that we shared his frustration i explained that we were hoping to put a module on our senate website to explain the components of the cost of gasoline in california he called back a few hours later i ve been calling all my elected officials and your office was the only one to answer the phone it took me awhile to figure out that today is a government holiday thanks for working and answering the phone the senator needs to give you a raise setting the humor aside it turns out that the super majority in the state legislature does not want you to know the components of the price of a gallon of gas so i authored sb 1074 the transparency in fuel taxes bill in 2018 federal tax excise tax state tax local sales tax cap and trade program compliance costs low carbon fuel standard program compliance costs renewable fuels standard program compliance costs refinery winter and summer reformatting costs the bill was killed by the senate business professions and economic development committee where it fell two votes shy of passing due to the committee s democrat majority i worked with ronald stein founder and ambassador for energy and infrastructure at pts advance headquartered in irvine here are some of the costs we wanted to point out to consumers while they were acquiring gasoline explaining the one dollar additional cost at the pump for every gallon purchased the bill was killed by the senate business professions and economic development committee where it fell two votes shy of passing due to the committee s democrat majority now the governor and the super majority in sacramento have two embarrassing problems the first is gas prices are rising too high the second is that with rising stock market and real estate prices the capitol is floating in higher personal income tax revenues generated by capital gains from the sales of these appreciated holdings since gov newsom has been the governor he has been told by the senator from bakersfield shannon grove that it is wiser to drill oil in this state than to have it shipped from the middle east i guess gavin believes importation by massive fossil fuel operated oil tankers generate less greenhouse gases wake up governor it s time for an intervention as newsom needs another let s be real moment something has to be done about the rising cost of gasoline as it impacts not only the poor but those who drive until they qualify for cheaper housing and have lengthy commutes including many with toll road costs what is awkward about having too much in revenues let me acquaint you with what is known as the gann limitation instituted with proposition 4 in 1979 california municipal spending cannot rise more than the cost of living combined with population growth the golden state has hit this threshold for the upcoming fiscal year of 2022 2023 the excess amount is 2 6 billion what to do instead of lowering gasoline taxes which the super majority has already refused to do a proposed 400 rebate for car owners makes more sense don t think that gov newsom is being santa claus because he is magnanimous he s doing it because he has the option to refund excess revenues back to the taxpayers which is a remedy when this ceiling is hit he knows this is a much better technique for calming the masses and looking like a benevolent candidate who wants to be reelected in november besides he s learned from a critical mistake made by former gov gray davis when gov davis had a similar stata appropriations limit issue he reduced the vehicle license fee for all car owners when tax revenues declined shortly thereafter he raised the annual dmv renewal fee back to prior levels what happened enough registered voters signed recall petitions that resulted in davis being the second governor in united states history to be recalled how to kill two birds with one stone the governor s press release title of march 23rd says it all governor newsom proposes relief package for californians facing higher gas prices brilliant newsom didn t blame the state s taxes making gasoline the most expensive here in california than any other state he didn t mention president biden s mismanagement of the economy and the attack by russia on ukraine he found a perfect but unjustified scapegoat as oil and gas companies continue to rake in record profits newsom unveiled his proposal to deliver relief to californians facing record high gas prices why does it feel like a thief is returning your wallet but with most of the money removed from it the super majority is not reducing your gas tax you may receive a one time payment to salve your anger newsom will be reelected and the nonsense of high taxes will continue for the next four or more years enjoy the sugar high but be prepared for the sad and expensive reality your future holds views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times
this means that we almost surely aren t experiencing the kind of self perpetuating inflation that was so hard to end in the 1980s a lot of recent inflation will subside when oil and food prices stop rising when the prices of used cars which rose 41 over the past year during the shortage of new cars come down and so on the big surge in rents also appears to be largely behind us although the slowdown won t show up in official numbers for a while so it probably won t be necessary to put the economy through an 80s style wringer to get inflation down

it s too early for investors in these companies to throw in the towel the past few months have been rough for many investors as marketwide issues sent equities tumbling down growth stocks have been hit particularly hard due to impending interest rate hikes in the u s amid all this turmoil it is essential not to succumb to panic selling long term investors should offload shares of companies they own only if they think the investment theses of these companies have changed that s precisely why i am not yet parting ways with two of my holdings that have lagged the market recently teladoc tdoc 4 64 and shopify shop 2 04 both companies prospects remain intact i believe despite recent struggles in the stock market here s the rundown 1 teladoc telehealth provides convenient ways of receiving some medical care such as basic consultations and referrals from the comfort of one s home thanks to the perks it offers which include cost savings for patients telehealth is likely here to stay and as a leader in this industry teladoc is worth considering the company benefits from a first mover advantage and a strong brand awareness especially following the events of the past couple of years telehealth services became invaluable to consumers during the pandemic s peak leading to a boom for teladoc s business the company continues to record strong financial results too in 2021 teladoc s revenue grew by 86 compared to a very busy 2020 and came in at roughly 2 billion the company s total visits for 2021 jumped by 38 year over year to 15 4 million one worry for teladoc is the bottom line the company continues to bleed red in 2021 its net loss came in at 428 8 million slightly better than the loss of 485 1 million reported in the previous fiscal year narrowing losses are a good sign for the company teladoc does expect its revenue growth rates to decrease as well in 2022 the company projects that its top line will come in between 2 55 billion and 2 65 billion representing year over year growth between 25 and 30 teladoc see its top line growth continuing in this range through 2024 while growing its membership between 1 and 5 per year it s within its current membership base that the company sees a market opportunity of 75 billion that s because many of the services it provides are underpenetrated teladoc offers its clients many specialties including mental healthcare and chronic healthcare with growth in these offerings teladoc expects its revenue per member to continue increasing in the fourth quarter average revenue per member in the u s came in at 2 49 52 higher than the year ago period it s also worth noting that teladoc has left some of its peers in the dust one of the company s biggest competitors is american well in 2021 amwell generated 252 8 million in revenue a mere 3 higher than the year ago period amwell s total visits for the year came in at 5 8 million compared to 5 9 million for the previous year teladoc is the more impressive of the two given the company s opportunity with its current membership base not to mention the future the telehealth industry holds i have no plans to sell my shares of this healthcare stock anytime soon 2 shopify shopify s business also experienced a significant boom during the worst of the pandemic however the company s shares dropped earlier this year after it reported its fourth quarter and full year financial results during which it announced an end to its coronavirus tailwind shopify could continue to see dark days for much of the year as investors adjust to slower top line growth rates but the company remains firmly on my good side over the past few years shopify s revenue has grown at a dizzying pace the company s growth rates were bound to slow eventually but they remain impressive in 2021 shopify s top line came in at 4 6 billion representing a 57 year over year increase analysts expect the tech giant s revenue to grow by about 38 per year on average over the next five years for investors with an even longer timeframe myself included shopify is a great bet because it should continue to ride the e commerce wave the industry is on an upward trajectory and according to some estimates it will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 14 7 through 2027 shopify offers its clients tools to become and stay relevant in this competitive environment the tech juggernaut has done its best to become a one stop shop for all the needs of merchants looking to open online storefronts which is practically a necessity for businesses of all types in today s world that s why shopify has continued to attract customers the company ended 2021 with 2 063 000 merchants on its platform by comparison shopify had 609 000 merchants as of dec 31 2017 in other words its customer base has more than tripled in the past four years it won t stop there and an expanding userbase will work wonders for shopify s top and bottom lines for many years to come even with near term headwinds shopify s overall prospects still look attractive at least in my view that s why i intend to hold on through these volatile times
investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips painfully the ongoing russia ukraine conflict has too many unfortunate victims investors who couldn t get out of beaten up russian stocks before international exchanges abruptly suspended trading in russian shares may still hope to get out someday once trading resumes however the tough painful and crippling global sanctions imposed on russian entities its oligarchs and key industries could dent any prospects of near term recoveries from capital losses as many affected stocks may never rise back to pre war highs as of now there is no way for investors to trade in any russian stocks as moscow shut down the local stock market it blocked sales by foreigners world exchanges where russian stocks traded all suspended trading in the country s stocks and financial assets and index providers removed the assets from key indices it s still possible that some russian companies may still find alternative export markets after losing access to north american and european territories that s to be expected however financing channels will be tougher to navigate a coming recession will still hurt their local sales and companies may have to offer price incentives to gain new business and friendships with a few potential sympathizers that said a few names like steelmaker mechel pao nyse mtl had little exposure to the enraged markets mechel generated just 15 3 of its annual sales from europe and turkey perhaps it could find alternative markets after an eu ban on russian steel the same can t be said of many russian stocks caught up directly or indirectly in the sanctions net i will touch on three such companies whose shares may never fully recover as long as sanctions stand sberbank otcmkts sbrcy otcmkts gazprom pjsc otcmkts ogzpy otcmkts phosagro otcmkts phojy russian stocks sberbank sbrcy source vladimir wrangel shutterstock com sberbank is a banking giant that is majority owned by the bank of russia it is the country s largest bank by asset base and had a significant international presence until a bank run triggered by international sanctions changed that everything changed in february when international sanctions included an unprecedented exclusion from the swift payments network for several russian banks including sberbank pandemonium followed and the bank experienced a run on its deposits as customers rushed to withdraw funds and the exit of visa nyse v and mastercard nyse ma services from russia hurt its business sberbank stock last traded 95 lower year to date as the russian banking giant announced its withdrawal from the european market on march 2 2022 the group s subsidiaries faced an exceptional outflow of funds and a number of safety concerns regarding its employees and offices the bank could no longer provide liquidity to its european subsidiary banks and bankruptcy proceedings will follow as assets go into liquidation that said the bank retained ownership of its switzerland subsidiary which it claimed continued to work as normal and had sufficient capital to continue operations sberbank will report on the full impact of losing its european business later in its first quarter results and it claims that sberbank europe represented just 1 3 of the group s net assets it has been spared for now but a potential removal from the swift payments systems will harm the bank s ability to continue serving international customers and damage its ability to operate globally the bank had just sold its branches in bosnia and herzegovina croatia hungary serbia and slovenia in november 2021 as it reduced exposure to central and eastern europe and now it has totally lost its european division altogether gazprom pjsc ogzpy source shutterstock gazprom pjsc is russia s largest listed firm by annual revenue the integrated oil and gas company is majority owned by the russian government gazprom is a major gas supplier to eu countries and has substantial gas pipelines throughout western russia going into europe although europeans have been slow to ban the company s supplies due to a current reliance on its gas however germany dealt the company a blow when it decided not to approve a recently completed nord stream 2 pipeline that had gobbled billions to construct gazprom had a majority stake in the new pipeline and due to german sanctions there were rumors in the market that nord stream 2 is considering filing for bankruptcy key pipeline partners including shell are no longer involved with the project and its fate looks bleak the bottom line is that after years of investment gazprom and partners won t be able to profit from gas sales through the 767 mile pipeline united states authorities also sanctioned nord stream 2 ag the company in charge of building the pipeline nord stream 2 is now a distressed and stranded asset moreover europe is most likely on the market looking for alternative supplies of its oil and gas needs at the time of writing the russian oil and gas giant might find itself losing long term customer contracts in 2022 and beyond perhaps the chinese market could open up to gazprom s products however recent sanctions have done some lasting damage to gazprom s financing lines credit ratings and probably its international pricing power russian stocks phosagro phojy source max_555 shutterstock com london

international exports exports sales for 2021 represented 73 7 of total annual revenue exports to europe and north america comprised 48 of total exports for 2021 or more than 35 of total group annual sales to remain cost competitive the company owns its logistics operations through ownership of cargo ships ports and railroad cars global sanctions are hurting its operations to buy a lifeline phosagro announced on march 18 the reduction of its stake in a cyprus incorporated subsidiary phosint limited to 5 before this material change phosagro owned a 100 stake in phosint negrinio limited a cyprus registered company scooped a 95 stake in phosint and no further details were provided it s not clear how much the acquirer paid for phosint but the company could have lost a significant subsidiary due to international sanctions earnings results should exclude this former subsidiary s operations going forward the company has shrunk phosagro is also undergoing a leadership crisis after losing its ceo andrey a guryev and three other members of its board of directors through resignations this month a credit rating downgrade to speculative grade which followed a low country rating will also raise the cost of doing business and eat into margins going forward even if the sale of an international sales focused subsidiary could alleviate some pain valuation multiples on phosagro stock

fiscal outlook november 17 2021 california s fiscal outlook executive summary what is the anticipated surplus despite the ongoing global pandemic and its disparate health and economic impacts on californians revenues are growing at historic rates and we estimate the state will have a 31 billion surplus resources in excess of current law commitments to allocate in 2022 23 how does the state appropriations limit sal affect budget choices our office historically has focused on budget balance and reserves as key budget structure issues given trends in revenues and spending we see the sal as the key issue this year specifically using our estimates of revenues and spending under current law and policy the state would need to allocate roughly 14 billion to meet the constitutional requirements under sal across 2020 21 and 2021 22 to meet those requirements the legislature could reduce taxes spend more on excluded purposes like infrastructure or issue tax rebates and make additional payments to schools and community colleges in addition while there is significant uncertainty in these figures we estimate the state could have 12 billion in additional sal requirements in 2022 23 is there capacity for new ongoing commitments we also examine the budget s condition through 2025 26 and assess its capacity for new commitments such as spending increases or tax reductions this report finds the budget has such capacity specifically we find the operating surpluses range from 3 billion to 8 billion over the multiyear period lao comments will recent revenue gains be sustained revenue collections have grown rapidly in recent months coming in over 10 billion ahead of budget act expectations so far this year underlying this growth is a meteoric rise in several measures of economic activity can these trends really remain so far above the long run trend for an extended period of time historically strong economic and revenue growth more often than not is followed by more growth moreover much of the revenue gains have been in historically more stable revenue streams such as sales tax and income tax withholding in a period of such unprecedented growth however these historical observations might be less relevant than usual ultimately knowing for certain whether recent gains are sustainable is impossible recognizing this our main revenue forecast takes a middle ground of possibilities assuming neither that the gains are entirely sustainable nor that they are entirely unsustainable under our revenue estimates actions to meet the sal requirements would be prudent in early 2022 if current revenue collection conditions persist in december and january the legislature may want to seriously consider early in the year how it plans to meet the sal requirements for 2020 21 and 2021 22 by identifying how to meet current and prior year sal requirements early the legislature largely would avoid needing to make this decision in may when myriad other budget issues are being deliberated more reserves warranted under our revenue estimates for 2022 23 the balance of the state s constitutional reserve would reach about 10 percent of revenues and transfers by the end of that fiscal year in order to bring the balance of the state s total reserves to their pre pandemic level of 13 percent of revenues and transfers the legislature would need to make additional discretionary deposits into one of its reserves although it would involve trade offs given the historic growth in revenues in recent years and sizeable anticipated surplus we suggest the legislature consider increasing total reserves by more than the constitutionally required level introduction each year our office publishes the fiscal outlook in anticipation of the upcoming state budget process this year s report addresses three key questions for lawmakers what is the budget s condition for 2022 23 despite the ongoing global pandemic and its disparate health and economic impacts on californians revenues are growing at historic rates and the state likely will have another significant surplus resources in excess of current law commitments despite the ongoing global pandemic and its disparate health and economic impacts on californians revenues are growing at historic rates and the state likely will have another significant surplus resources in excess of current law commitments how does the state appropriations limit sal affect budget choices our office historically has focused on budget balance and reserves as key budget structure issues given trends in revenues and spending we see the sal as the key issue this year specifically the sal will constrain how the legislature can allocate the estimated surplus this year our office historically has focused on budget balance and reserves as key budget structure issues given trends in revenues and spending we see the sal as the key issue this year specifically the sal will constrain how the legislature can allocate the estimated surplus this year is there capacity for new ongoing commitments we also examine the budget s condition over the longer term through 2025 26 and assess its capacity for new commitments such as spending increases or tax reductions this report finds the budget has such capacity our answers to these questions rely on specific assumptions about the future of the state economy its revenues and its expenditures consequently our answers are not definitive but rather reflect our best guidance to the legislature based on our professional assessments at this time in addition while we were putting together the estimates in this report congress passed the infrastructure investment and jobs act and updated inflation information became available the ultimate budgetary impacts of these changes are not yet known regardless because of the timing any possible effects of these changes are not included in this analysis what is the budget s condition for 2022 23 anticipated surplus of 31 billion figure 1 shows that under our revenue estimates the state would have a surplus of 31 billion to allocate in the upcoming budget process the term surplus means the difference between projected revenues and spending under current law and policy consequently the surplus reflects our assessment of the budget s capacity to pay for existing and potentially new commitments on a technical basis the surplus is shown as the balance of the special fund for economic uncertainties sfeu in 2022 23 figure 1 general fund condition under fiscal outlook

three trends in the prior year 2020 21 and current year 2021 22 as well an operating surplus in the budget year 2022 23 and the 4 billion sfeu balance from the enacted 2021 22 budget specifically it is the result of higher revenues of 28 billion as can be seen in figure 2 revenue collections have grown rapidly in recent months coming in over 10 billion ahead of budget act expectations so far this year underlying this growth is a meteoric rise in several measures of economic activity retail sales have posted double digit growth during 2021 stock prices have doubled from their pandemic low last spring several major firms have posted historically high earnings consistent with this recent trend under our main forecast we estimate tax revenues and transfers are higher by nearly 28 billion

forecast see 2022 23 fiscal outlook revenue estimates higher spending on schools and community colleges by 11 billion general fund spending on schools and community colleges is determined by a set of constitutional formulas under proposition 98 1988 under our outlook the state allocates about 40 percent of general fund revenue to k 14 education each year of the budget window as such consistent with general fund tax revenue increases our estimate of required general fund spending on schools and community colleges for 2020 21 and 2021 22 increases by almost 11 billion we discuss more information about the overall minimum funding level for k 14 education below general fund spending on schools and community colleges is determined by a set of constitutional formulas under proposition 98 1988 under our outlook the state allocates about 40 percent of general fund revenue to k 14 education each year of the budget window as such consistent with general fund tax revenue increases our estimate of required general fund spending on schools and community colleges for 2020 21 and 2021 22 increases by almost 11 billion we discuss more information about the overall minimum funding level for k 14 education below other spending lower by 5 billion across the rest of the budget our estimate of costs in 2020 21 and 2021 22 are lower than budget act estimates by about 5 billion there are many factors contributing to these savings but two major ones first we score all of the savings associated with the enhanced federal share for certain medicaid programs in 2021 22 we describe this in more detail in the box nearby along with other federal pandemic related actions that have notable implications for this year s budget condition second we account for a reversion of 3 3 billion in spending on transportation which was contingent on legislation that did not pass across the rest of the budget our estimate of costs in 2020 21 and 2021 22 are lower than budget act estimates by about 5 billion there are many factors contributing to these savings but two major ones first we score all of the savings associated with the enhanced federal share for certain medicaid programs in 2021 22 we describe this in more detail in the box nearby along with other federal pandemic related actions that have notable implications for this year s budget condition second we account for a reversion of 3 3 billion in spending on transportation which was contingent on legislation that did not pass operating surplus of 5 billion in 2022 23 in addition to the factors described above which are revisions to the 2021 22 budget act our outlook anticipates the state will have an additional 5 2 billion operating surplus in 2022 23 this is the amount that revenues are expected to exceed spending under current law and policy in that year federal coronavirus disease 2019 related actions with continued impact on the state budget throughout 2020 and 2021 the federal government took actions and passed legislation that had a significant effect on california s budget this box describes some of the federal actions that continue to have major implications for the state s fiscal condition in 2022 23 as noted earlier this report does not reflect recent federal action on infrastructure spending as the infrastructure investment and jobs act was passed as we were completing our assessment american rescue plan arp act fiscal relief funds the arp included 350 billion in flexible funding to state and local governments for fiscal recovery in coronavirus state and local fiscal recovery funds of this total california s state government received about 27 billion the 2021 22 budget allocated the entirety of these funds to a variety of purposes including about 9 2 billion to offset existing general fund costs after the budget was passed however the newsom administration adjusted this amount downward by about 300 million to account for a new estimate of revenue losses under the arp s provisions this means general fund costs will increase by this amount but the legislature also will have these arp funds to allocate to one of the federally allowable purposes in 2022 23 for more information see the 2021 22 spending plan major new control sections in the spending plan enhanced federal match for medicaid medicaid is an entitlement program whose costs generally are shared between the federal government and states in 2020 congress approved a temporary 6 2 percentage point increase in the federal government s share of cost for state medicaid programs until the end of the national public health emergency declaration we assume the declaration expires in january 2022 with a corresponding expiration of the enhanced federal match at the end of march as a result we assume an increase in general fund costs of state medicaid programs beginning in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year 2021 22 enhanced federal match for home and community based services hcbs the arp also included a temporary enhanced federal match rate for hcbs funded through the medicaid program which reduces the state s share of base program costs for these services by 3 billion however the federal government requires states to reinvest these freed up state funds on expanded enhanced or strengthened hcbs services the budget act did not fully account for the base hcbs program savings or expenditure of these savings relative to the budget act we score an additional 1 billion in net general fund savings between 2020 21 and 2021 22 associated with the enhanced medicaid hcbs match however these funds are not ultimately part of the surplus they have already been committed to specific hcbs enhancements that were adopted after the passage of the budget act through the state s hcbs spending plan for more information see our post home and community based services spending plan the result of these factors taken together is a discretionary surplus of 31 billion which is available for the legislature to allocate in the 2022 23 budget process resources available to allocate to discretionary spending likely will be somewhat less than 31 billion our estimate of a 31 billion surplus for 2022 23 includes 1 the enacted sfeu balance from 2021 22 4 billion and 2 the 3 3 billion planned for transportation but which reverted to the general fund consequently our estimate of the surplus could be interpreted to implicitly reflect an sfeu balance that is essentially 0 the legislature can choose to set the sfeu balance at any level above zero recent budgets have enacted sfeu balances around 2 billion to 4 billion which the state has sometimes used to cover costs for unanticipated expenditures given this in practice the actual amount of the state s resources available for new discretionary spending will be somewhat less than 31 billion actual surplus will be different the state has a 31 billion surplus under our main forecast however revenues easily could end up tens of billions of dollars above or below our main forecast if revenues in 2021 22 and 2022 23 are at the lower end of our most likely alternative outcomes the surplus could be as low as 10 billion if revenues are at the higher end the surplus could be closer to 60 billion reserves excluding the sfeu reserves would reach 22 billion in 2022 23 as shown in figure 3 the balance of the state s constitutional reserve the budget stabilization account bsa would grow to about 10 percent of general fund revenues and transfers 21 billion under our revenue estimates in particular under the constitutional rules of proposition 2 2014 the state would be required to deposit about 4 billion in the bsa in 2022 23 and make net true up deposits of 1 billion although this represents an increase relative to the 2021 22 enacted level the balance of the bsa would remain below the pre pandemic level of 11 percent of revenues figure 3 does not display an estimate for total reserves in 2022 23 because this level largely will be determined by discretionary choices made by the legislature total reserves include the safety net reserve and the enacted balance of the sfeu funding for schools and community colleges significantly higher estimates of the proposition 98 guarantee in current and prior year the state funds the guarantee through a combination of general fund and local property tax revenue compared with the estimates included in the june 2021 budget plan the estimates of the guarantee under our main outlook are up 1 8 billion 2 percent in 2020 21 and 8 9 billion 9 5 percent in 2021 22 the increase in the 2021 22 guarantee is one of the largest upward revisions since the passage of proposition 98 in 1988 in both years the increases are due to our higher general fund revenue estimates additional growth in the guarantee in budget year for 2022 23 we estimate the guarantee is 105 3 billion an increase of 2 6 billion 2 6 percent relative to the revised 2021 22 level growth in general fund revenue and local property tax revenue both contribute to the higher guarantee an additional contributing factor is the expansion of transitional kindergarten a program that is currently open to four year old children born between september 2 and december 2 the june 2021 budget plan sets forth a schedule to expand this program to all four year olds over a four year period beginning in 2022 23 the legislature and governor also agreed to adjust the guarantee to cover the associated costs this adjustment accounts for 421 million of the increase in the guarantee in 2022 23 nearly 20 billion available for allocation in upcoming budget cycle after accounting for a 5 35 percent statutory cost of living adjustment cola deposits into the proposition 98 reserve and various other adjustments we estimate the legislature has 9 5 billion in ongoing funds available for allocation in 2022 23 in addition after accounting for the upward revisions in 2020 21 and 2021 22 and various smaller adjustments we estimate that 10 2 billion in one time funds are available across the three year period the legislature has 19 7 billion to allocate for its school and community college priorities in the upcoming budget cycle this estimate of available funding exceeds the amount in any previous outlook our office has produced how does the sal affect budget choices our office historically has focused on budget balance and reserves as key budget structure issues given trends in revenues and spending we see the sal as the key issue this year the sal limits how the legislature can use revenues that exceed a specific threshold given this constraint under our revenue estimates the legislature would not have full discretion over the anticipated 31 billion surplus specifically before allocating the surplus to any discretionary purpose the legislature first would need to determine how much of the state s revenues must be allocated to sal related purposes how the formula works proposition 4 1979 established an appropriations limit on the state and most types of local governments under these constitutional requirements each year the state must compare the appropriations limit to appropriations subject to the limit as shown in step 1 of figure 4 this year s limit is calculated by adjusting last year s limit for a growth factor that includes economic and population growth as shown in step 2 appropriations subject to the limit are determined by taking all proceeds of taxes and subtracting excluded spending in step 3 the state compares appropriations subject to the limit to the limit itself if appropriations subject to the limit are less than the limit there is room if appropriations subject to the limit exceed the limit on net over any two year period there are excess revenues how does the legislature meet the constitutional requirements under the sal the legislature can meet its sal requirements in any of three ways 1 lower tax revenues 2 split the excess revenues between additional school and community college district spending and taxpayer rebates or 3 appropriate more money for purposes excluded from the sal these exclusions include subventions to local governments capital outlay projects debt service federal and court mandates and certain kinds of emergency spending current year sal requirements under our estimates of revenues and spending under current law and policy the state would need to allocate roughly 14 billion to meet the constitutional requirements under sal across 2020 21 and 2021 22 this is shown in figure 5 as the net amount by which appropriations subject to the limit exceed the limit across those two years there are a couple of key reasons that this is the case even though the 2021 22 budget act anticipated the state would have about 17 billion in room across these two years first our estimate of general fund proceeds of taxes in these years is 28 billion higher than budget act estimates second as a result of late session actions we estimate spending on qualified capital outlay is about 4 billion lower than the budget act anticipated this is somewhat offset by our differing estimates of subventions to schools and community colleges budget year sal requirements using our estimates of general fund tax revenues and spending under current law and policy we also project the state s sal position for 2022 23 while there is significant uncertainty in these figures we estimate the state could have around 12 billion in additional sal requirements to meet in 2022 23 in considering the state s 2022 23 sal estimates we anticipate the state s sal position in 2023 24 to be a major consideration in the budget process and enactment our estimates for the state s sal position across the budget window are also shown in the insert in figure 6 is there capacity for new ongoing commitments operating surpluses of 3 billion to 8 billion figure 6 displays our estimates of the budget s condition over the outlook period as the figure shows although we estimate the budget has an available surplus of 31 billion to allocate in 2022 23 the amount available on an ongoing basis the operating surplus is lower this estimate is subject to a number of important caveats however most importantly the amount of revenues the state collects will be higher or lower than the estimates here in general terms our revenue estimates represent the middle of possible outcomes meaning there is about a 50 percent chance that revenues will be higher or lower than our main forecast expenditures could be somewhat lower increasing the surplus across our outlook there are a number of expenditure areas where costs could be lower than what we have assumed for a variety of reasons including for example decisions by the state government federal government and pension boards if costs are lower than we have estimated the operating surpluses displayed in figure 6 would be higher some key areas where expenditures could be lower include medi cal for a number of years the state has imposed a tax on managed care organizations mcos medi cal and commercial lines of business we assume the state s mco tax expires midway through 2022 23 consistent with current law the mco tax leverages significant federal funding if the legislature extended the mco tax at similar levels it would result in lower general fund costs in the medi cal program by up to 2 billion annually beginning in 2023 24 for a number of years the state has imposed a tax on managed care organizations mcos medi cal and commercial lines of business we assume the state s mco tax expires midway through 2022 23 consistent with current law the mco tax leverages significant federal funding if the legislature extended the mco tax at similar levels it would result in lower general fund costs in the medi cal program by up to 2 billion annually beginning in 2023 24 medicaid programs as described in the box nearby our outlook assumes the federal public health emergency declaration expires in january 2022 resulting in an increase in general fund costs of state medicaid programs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 22 if the federal government extends the declaration costs would be lower for example if the public health declaration remained in place until the end of 2021 22 we estimate it would result in additional general fund savings of nearly 1 billion as described in the box nearby our outlook assumes the federal public health emergency declaration expires in january 2022 resulting in an increase in general fund costs of state medicaid programs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 22 if the federal government extends the declaration costs would be lower for example if the public health declaration remained in place until the end of 2021 22 we estimate it would result in additional general fund savings of nearly 1 billion pensions as a result of recent performance in asset markets both of the state s major pension systems have reported very high investment returns in the last year these returns were not reflected in the system s most recent actuarial valuations and so we have not included their impact on state costs in this analysis reflecting these return assumptions could result in substantially lower state costs particularly for the teachers pension system the box nearby has more details on possible future developments in the state s pension systems as a result of recent performance in asset markets both of the state s major pension systems have reported very high investment returns in the last year these returns were not reflected in the system s most recent actuarial valuations and so we have not included their impact on state costs in this analysis reflecting these return assumptions could result in substantially lower state costs particularly for the teachers pension system the box nearby has more details on possible future developments in the state s pension systems california work opportunity and responsibility to kids calworks recent budgets including the 2021 22 budget act have anticipated that caseload related costs for example in medi cal and calworks would increase substantially in the case of calworks these caseload increases have not yet materialized while our outlook anticipates caseload related costs are lower relative to budget act estimates in calworks we also project caseload to increase in the program over the next year if these increases do not materialize costs in this program would be lower than our estimates by the low hundreds of millions of dollars changes in state pension contributions on horizon state contributions to calstrs forecast assumes state contributions to calstrs continue to increase over next few years our forecast for state contributions to the california state teachers retirement system calstrs in the outyears uses the pension system s most recent actuarial valuation which reflects calstrs 3 9 percent investment returns in 2019 20 based on that valuation period actuaries projected the state s rate would need to continue increasing annually by the maximum allowed 0 5 percent of teacher payroll for the next few years accordingly our forecast assumes the state s required contribution rate to calstrs defined benefit program will continue increasing reaching nearly 10 percent of teacher payroll in 2024 25 and 2025 26 calstrs experienced 27 2 percent investment returns in 2020 21 calstrs next actuarial valuation reflecting 2020 21 investment returns payroll growth and other factors impacting calstrs unfunded liabilities and required contribution rates will not be available until the spring of 2022 and calstrs will set required contribution rates for 2022 23 at that time however calstrs announced after the close of the 2020 21 fiscal year that the system s assets returned 27 2 percent in that year this investment return experience is well above calstrs assumed annual rate of 7 percent state s contribution rate now projected to dramatically decrease resulting in annual general fund savings of billions of dollars based on current law calstrs 27 2 percent investment returns will have an outsized impact on the state s contribution rate specifically calstrs actuaries project that the 2020 21 investment return experience will fully eliminate the state s share of unfunded liabilities currently around 31 5 billion in a few years consequently actuaries now project that the state s contribution rate could phase down over the next few fiscal years reaching around 2 percent beginning in 2024 25 if this occurs the state s required contribution rate would be around 8 percentage points lower relative to our forecast by 2024 25 meaning the state would owe several billions of dollars less to calstrs over the forecast period state contributions to calpers actual contributions to calpers will be different than we assume our forecast of state employer contributions to the california public employees retirement system calpers uses the projected state employer contribution rates published with the meeting materials for the april 2021 calpers board meeting the actual state contributions during the forecasted period will be different from what we project because 1 the april 2021 projected contribution rates did not take into consideration the 21 3 percent investment return that calpers assets experienced during 2020 21 and 2 the calpers board will adopt new actuarial assumptions depending on what actuarial assumptions and implementation policies the board adopts the state s contributions to calpers by the end of the forecast period could be different from what we project on the other hand there are some areas in our outlook that may understate costs for example while we do not assume the state faces any major natural disasters such as a wildfire large enough to receive a state disaster declaration at least one such disaster will almost certainly occur over the next four years nonetheless on net we think expenditures are more likely to fall short of our estimates rather than exceed them proposition 98 general fund spending grows over the period under our main forecast general fund spending to meet the proposition 98 guarantee grows to 87 8 billion in 2025 26 an increase of 12 4 billion compared with the revised 2021 22 level the average annual increase is 3 1 billion 3 9 percent most of this increase is due to growth in general fund revenue which increases the proposition 98 spending requirement about 40 cents for each dollar of additional revenue a portion of the increase reaching 2 9 billion by 2025 26 reflects the agreement by the legislature and governor to increase the guarantee for the expansion of transitional kindergarten local property tax revenue also grows steadily over the period accounting for the growth in general fund spending and local property tax revenue the total increase in school and community college funding over the period would be 18 6 billion an average annual increase of 4 7 billion 4 3 percent the sal will continue to impact budget choices if revenues continue to grow faster than the limit from 2015 16 to our most recent estimates in 2022 23 sal revenues have grown an average of 7 4 percent annually over the same period the limit has grown 5 percent annually if these trends continue the legislature will need to spend increasing amounts on excluded purposes like capital outlay lower tax revenues on an ongoing basis or use additional and increasing resources to return funds to taxpayers and make additional payments to schools and community colleges put another way despite the operating surpluses we display in figure 6 the budget might not have much capacity for new ongoing spending that does not meet the sal requirements would the budget still break even if revenues are lower revenues could differ substantially from our main forecast either higher or lower if revenues fall relative to our outlook would the budget still break even as figure 7 shows revenues could fall by as much as 4 percent around 10 billion in most years of the outlook and the budget would still be balanced specifically the figure shows how the break even point the amount of revenues required to pay for the budget s current commitments compares to our main revenue forecast our main forecast is intended to fall in the middle of possible outcomes with a 50 50 chance of revenues coming in higher or lower than our estimate given this the fact that the breakeven point is close to but somewhat lower than our main forecast suggests there is a somewhat better than 50 50 chance of the budget staying balanced over the outlook period significantly lower breakeven point for school and community college budget we also can assess what the breakeven revenue point would mean for the school and community college budget under the breakeven scenario shown above the proposition 98 guarantee would decrease but would remain roughly 8 billion above the cost of existing school and community college programs over the period in fact we estimate that the proposition 98 guarantee would not drop below the cost of these programs unless the state experienced a recession in which revenues dropped by 25 billion or more relative to our main forecast two important factors account for the lower breakeven point for schools and community colleges first nearly 30 percent of all proposition 98 funding consists of local property tax revenue which tends to grow steadily even during economic downturns second school and community college programs are projected to grow more slowly than underlying program growth in the rest of the budget there are many reasons for this including the timing and amount of federal funds displacing non proposition 98 general fund spending and low growth in k 12 average daily attendance budget uncertainties will recent revenue gains be sustained even though our forecast assumes that the rapid pace of recent growth will slow in the coming months wondering whether the recent gains shown in figure 2 are unsustainable is reasonable can the economy and revenues really remain so far above the long run trend for an extended period of time historically strong economic and revenue growth more often than not is followed by more growth moreover much of the revenue gains have been in historically more stable revenue streams such as sales tax and income tax withholding in a period of such unprecedented growth however these historical observations might be less relevant than usual ultimately knowing for certain whether recent gains are sustainable is impossible recognizing this our main revenue forecast takes a middle ground of possibilities assuming neither that the gains are entirely sustainable nor that they are entirely unsustainable will higher inflation persist in recent months resurgent consumer demand met with continued frictions in production and transport of many goods has led to higher than normal growth in the prices of many goods and services annual price inflation has exceeded 5 percent since june compared to an average of about 2 percent over the last decade the consensus among economic forecasters based on the blue chip economic indicators survey is that this uptick in inflation will abate by next year our forecast of inflation in california shown in figure 8 follows this consensus this forecast however comes with significant uncertainty the shaded area on figure 8 shows how far inflation could be expected to differ from our forecast based on the historical accuracy of the economic consensus ultimately despite the consensus expectation the possibility that elevated inflation persists should not be ruled out underscoring this point very recent data released after the development of our forecast showed further acceleration of inflation in october what are potential budget impacts of higher inflation higher inflation presents a number of issues for the state budget on the revenue side it could lead to increases in collections for instance due to higher wages but increased inflation also could create instability in financial markets or the economy broadly which could depress revenues on the spending side higher inflation can result in higher costs for example for interest on the unemployment insurance loan from the federal government and bond debt service in other areas of the budget higher inflation creates pressure for the state to increase spending for example on cash assistance or employee compensation budget choices and oversight administration will have different sal estimates under our main revenue forecast the state would have to allocate 14 billion to meet its sal related requirements for example by spending more on capital outlay or making taxpayer rebates and school and community college payments across 2020 21 and 2021 22 additional sal related spending or revenue reductions also could be required for 2022 23 the governor s budget however likely will have different estimates of the state s sal position for a couple of reasons first the administration s revenue estimates will differ from ours second whereas our outlook does not allocate the surplus the governor s budget will propose allocations for any discretionary funds including how to meet the sal requirements under our revenue estimates actions to meet the sal requirements would be prudent in early 2022 if current revenue collection conditions persist in december and january the legislature may want to seriously consider early in the year how it plans to meet the sal requirements for 2020 21 and 2021 22 by identifying how to meet current and prior year sal requirements early the legislature largely would avoid needing to make this decision in may when myriad other budget issues are being deliberated given the potential magnitude of the requirement if the legislature wishes to meet it with lower tax revenues or spending on excluded purposes early action would be prudent if however the legislature preferred to meet the requirement with taxpayer rebates and school and community colleges payments the state would have two years to make these payments as allowed by the constitution and early action would not be necessary administrative capacity for new spending likely constrained the annual budget process provides the legislature with an opportunity not only to allocate new funding but also to assess the implementation of existing or recent spending given the magnitude of commitments in the 2021 22 budget and the time it takes to ramp up administrative capacity the legislature may want to consider whether additional commitments are feasible or if additional administrative capacity is needed for example several departments received one time augmentations well in excess of 100 percent of their base budgets in 2021 22 including all fund sources some examples include the scholarshare investment board which received 1 9 billion in 2021 22 compared to a 2020 21 budget of 28 million the department of community services and development which received 1 6 billion in 2021 22 340 million in 2020 21 and the arts council which received 140 million in 2021 22 42 million in 2020 21 for these departments and others capacity to carry out policy changes and new or expanded programs could be an ongoing issue particularly as it takes time for departments to hire and train staff and develop new program rules and guidelines this consideration could be important as the legislature determines its budget priorities for 2022 23 reserves more reserves warranted under our revenue estimates for 2022 23 the balance of the state s constitutional reserve would reach about 10 percent of revenues and transfers by the end of that fiscal year in order to bring the balance of the state s total reserves to their pre pandemic level of 13 percent of revenues and transfers the legislature would need to make additional discretionary deposits into one of its reserves given the historic growth in revenues in recent years and sizeable surplus available for 2022 23 we suggest the legislature consider increasing total reserves by more than the constitutionally required level in 2022 23 that said such a choice will require trade offs for example reserve deposits are not excludable from sal and under our revenue estimates the legislature s ability to use the surplus for non excludable purposes is constrained appendix appendix

these three canadian stocks are perfect to buy in this market environment offering long term growth potential while also being very safe often investors think they have to compromise growth potential for safety and vice versa and while this might be true in theory there are plenty of high quality canadian stocks to buy that are both safe and offer significant growth potential the key is to look for businesses and industries that are defensive first and then identify which businesses have the best operations and which stocks offer the most long term growth opportunities and as long as the opportunities that the stock in question has to grow don t impact its safety for example a tonne of leverage then it will likely be one of the best canadian stocks you can buy so if you re looking to buy safe growth stocks in this market environment here are three to consider now a highly safe utility stock to buy and hold for years anytime you want a safe investment finding companies in highly resilient and recession proof industries is ideal that s why a utility stock like algonquin power and utilities tsx aqn nyse aqn which also happens to have a significant green energy portfolio is one of the best stocks to buy if you re looking for something safe algonquin s utility operations are well diversified across several states in the united states furthermore these operations account for roughly 70 of algonquin s business meanwhile green energy is an industry that s also highly defensive but in addition it offers years of growth potential as we continue to rely more on cleaner energy plus on top of the safety and growth potential algonquin offers it also pays a growing dividend that yields upwards of 4 4 so in addition to being a safe stock that can grow your money it s one of the top long term growth stocks to buy too residential real estate is a safe investment in addition to utilities owning high quality real estate funds which give you instant diversification can be another highly robust investment residential real estate is highly recession proof making these stocks extremely safe but they also offer tonnes of growth potential as well which is why they are some of the best to buy canadian apartment properties reit tsx car un is a great example it owns over 60 000 residential units diversified all across canada and although the price of the stock can be a bit more volatile than a utility like algonquin its business operations and cash flow are still highly robust so it s one of the best stocks to buy if you plan to hold long term because you can mitigate any short term volatility making it extremely safe and a top stock to grow your capital right now capreit provides a yield of roughly 2 7 and has increased that distribution by roughly 15 over the last four years a top infrastructure stock to buy for the long haul lastly is brookfield infrastructure partners tsx bip un nyse bip brookfield is one of the best stocks to buy if you re looking for something safe because its entire portfolio of investments is made up of essentially recession proof assets infrastructure assets are often at the core of the economy and therefore have highly resilient operations but brookfield while owning highly defensive assets operates as a growth company constantly looking to grow value for investors in addition it s also consistently increasing the distribution every year with an annualized goal of 5 to 9 increases therefore not only can you bank on brookfield to continue earning strong cash flow through thick and thin while consistently growing the value of your investment over the long haul but it will constantly increase the passive income it provides you and today that distribution offers a yield of roughly 3 5 so if you re looking for a high quality growth stock that you can own for years brookfield and its high quality portfolio are incredibly safe

when one sits down to make a deal with the devil it is the devil who usually wins that s because he is crafty as the book of genesis describes him the united states and iran appear on the cusp of a deal that president biden and his diplomats claim will prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon in the short term in exchange for a deal that won t be worth the paper it is written on the u s appears ready to release huge amounts of cash to the ayatollah khamenei who still wants america and israel eliminated and remove iran s revolutionary guard from its list of international terrorists this is self delusion at its worst that russia remains a primary negotiator in light of war crimes it is committing against ukraine makes this potential deal even more incredible just one among many quotes from the ayatollah ought to be taken seriously today america poses a threat to peace and security in the world therefore the slogan death to america is no longer used only by our people today you see throughout the world people setting fire to the effigy of the american president and chanting the slogan death to america this is because of the american regime s exaggerated demands its arrogance its vanity and its desire to control and because it is a pawn in the hands of the zionists how can someone who has called america the great satan be trusted to honor any deal iran has consistently denied it is developing a bomb and claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes is there anyone who believes that former president donald trump didn t believe it and imposed severe sanctions on iran when we sit down with leaders of a nation who do not share american values and wish to destroy those values we will get up from the negotiating table with a deal that guarantees a further step down the road to instability at best and at worst our and israel s destruction former jerusalem post columnist caroline glick presents clear thinking in this post on her website the deal that biden is concluding with iran is itself a stunning testament to the radicalism of the biden team and its refusal to let reality interfere with its policies it will provide iran with 90 billion from sanctions relief that astronomical sum guarantees massive cash infusions into the coffers of iran s in house global terrorist organization the islamic revolutionary guards corps which biden is set to remove from the state department s list of foreign terrorist organizations and to iran s terror armies in lebanon yemen iraq syria and the gaza strip iran will have the funds to expand its missile and drone capabilities and thanks to the lax restrictions it will face on its nuclear operations it will become a nuclear threshold state by 2025 at the latest even some democrats oppose the deal the new york times reported on a speech by senate foreign relations committee chairman robert menendez d nj on february 1 i ask why we would try to simply go back to the j c p o a a deal that was not sufficient in the first place and still doesn t address some of the most serious national security concerns we have it s a good question and deserves an answer any deal should come before the senate for ratification but if the administration doesn t call it a treaty the senate will likely be bypassed which would be a big mistake on several levels the biden administration seems desperate for any victory in view of its disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan inflation that is the highest in 40 years a fluctuating stock market hurting retirees high gas and food prices and a continuing decline in the president s favorability ratings making a deal with the iranian devil will not reverse the public s view of the administration s failures it will only make them worse

for some reason the outside of my dumplings disintegrated leaving the soup thick with chickpea flour while the center of the dumplings were still not cooked it wasn t great though the flavors were fine confused about where i went wrong we are going to try to salvage the leftovers as more of a sauce over rice arg nm god i absolutely love this one have been making it on a very regular basis especially in cool weather since the recipe was released don t eat dairy so have opted to use cocojune yogurt in the dumplings or the nooch slurry plus extra oil as recommended in the comments often don t have any celery so don t usually add that in and sometimes will add kale love to top with more of the cocojune yogurt and some fermented rosemary onions beets or preserved lemon peel chopped and more olive oil i m always telling folks to make this because it s the most comforting soup ever ek vt the most special recipe i ve made in years a friend sent it to me with a similarly strong sentiment and now i share it with as many people as i can if you come across this recipe make it and then spread the good word mc nashville the dumplings did not work out at all the dough looked nice but didn t cook at all in boiling water or expand a little even after 15 minutes however the soup base was pretty good and i will make again just with double all the seasoning including celery anna foster i loved this recipe it s simple enough to make on a weeknight but still impressive i followed the other reviewers advice and chilled the dumpling dough for a bit and they held together perfectly even during reheating the leftovers i wouldn t skip the celery unless you really hate it soapnana chicago really and truly delicious i went vegan and used the nooch sediment in the dumplings instead of yogurt and also made the dumplings earlier to chill per advice below rough chopped some fennel with a reduced amount of celery because one of us hates celery me it is me and it s a perfectly crunchy sub everything turned out perfectly i plan to make this again and again cmd la ca discovered i was out of white miso and subbed with 1 5tbsp doenjang between that and the nootch this soup looked beautiful tasted pretty good but smelled really funky on day 1 so funky i decided not to share with neighbors like i d planned i thought i d made a big mistake however as the days passed the flavors melded together more and more and the funk dissipated it got more and more savory and balanced with each passing day also added an extra cup of water also chilled the dumplings before dropping them in those are good tips cutting the celery on a bias is a good call too those big bites of celery were so good anonymous chicago i enjoyed this a lot and will make again for sure like others i used the sediment in place of the yogurt to make it vegan and that seemed to work fine i omitted the celery and garnished with fresh cilantro and a little smoked paprika plus it needed more salt i think i will try garnishing with some trader joes mango chutney tomorrow when i heat up leftovers anonymous nc i have made this repeatedly and it continues to be a favorite i ran out of dill in the garden and used finely chopped green carrot tops instead which made a great twist i thinly chopped the carrots as well and threw those in along with the celery which worked well additional changes which tasted lovely were a fennel and celery combo and fennel fronds mixed in with the dill i made it vegan on occasion and used the yeast sludge for the dumplings instead of yoghurt it made a firmer dumpling but still very good i used cashew cream or a dash of almond cooking cream swirled on top for the yogurt finish ellen this turned out to be really delicious but thanks to the helpful comments i made some easy modifications first i reversed the order after reading how the dumplings couldn t maintain their shape i remembered that when making matzo balls make the dough cover it and then refrigerate for 30 mins then i began the soup following everything but for layered flavors i used stock instead of water i did add 1 cup of additional water per people s wise suggestions one tip have the grated garlic ready for when you add the miso btw i only had red miso and it was fine i was going for taste more than visual as you have to work fast in mashing it once the soup was simmering i took the dough out of the fridge and made them into balls i covered them again and set them in the freezer for 10 mins this really helped them to set and the i used a ladle and lay them in the soup and they did great puffed up nicely and i let them cook for almost 9 mins on a low simmer i too added frozen peas as well as the celery which provided a nice crunch will definitely make this again good luck jmeleemcd nyc this was great i substituted seared cauliflower florets for the celery because ugh celery omitted onion because we re not an onion household what can i say i had dried dill instead of fresh so took down the amount to deal w stronger dried herbs flavor i had mellow white miso paste instead of yellow it was delicious tbh the savory rich broth is so delish my partner was very animated over the broth craveable the cauli and chickpeas were delightful and i loved the flavor of the dumplings going forward i might make twenty small bite soze dumplings instead of 10 giant ones will definitely add this to the weekly rotation thanks for this recipe urbanite this recipe is so good and so fast i can t recommend it enough anonymous seattle wa my attempt at making this wasn t as succesful as i hoped it would be the dumplings kind of fell apart although some chunks were left i also found them to be surprisingly spicy i don t know what went wrong but i still liked the soup in the end the yogurt was a really nice addition anonymous this soup is wonderful after doubling the recipe we didn t have enough dill so we added lemon zest as suggested by another reviewer and dried tarragon which worked well anonymous california

retail there s a worker shortage in many of our communities and businesses are trying to attract people to their communities they re trying to find more workers said rep dave murphy r greenville who cosponsored many of the bills and many times it comes back to the fact that there s not enough moderately priced housing so we re trying to help increase the stock of homes that would fit into the budget of the average workforce the package of bills was approved by the state assembly in october and was sent to the senate which has not yet taken up the measures the senate will reconvene for its next session on jan 18 read the series unaffordable no place to call home read the series help wanted exploring wisconsin s worker shortage their sponsors say the bills look to encourage development of new workforce housing by lowering costs making it easier to build and reducing government red tape by creating a 42 million per year workforce housing income tax credit for multi family housing projects creating a certified workforce housing development site program that would pre qualify properties for residential development that have a clean title proper zoning adequate utilities and infrastructure and no wetlands and that the developer can attest to limited per unit development fees and that all required permits can be in place within 60 days of certification requiring larger municipalities to use a portion of their federal pandemic relief funds on one of the following workforce housing projects new infrastructure such as streets sewer water and sidewalks establishing a low interest or no interest loan program for rehabilitating older workforce housing establishing a low interest or no interest loan program for building new workforce housing redeveloping idle commercial property sites of at least 40 000 square feet to workforce housing creating a sales tax exemption for materials used to build workforce housing developments or to conduct workforce housing rehabilitation projects creating a low interest or no interest loan program for homeowners to pay for structural improvements or the removal of lead paint from homes built before 1980 allowing local governments to create housing investment fund programs that would use increased property tax revenue from new housing developments to help fund additional workforce housing the majority of the bills were passed by the assembly by unanimous consent although lawmakers split along party lines on one bill assembly bill 605 which requires municipalities to use a portion of their federal pandemic relief dollars to help fund housing development opponents objected to the lack of state matching dollars for the program in an emailed statement assembly minority leader gordon hintz d oshkosh said the bills do not adequately address the state s housing challenges and could in some instances make the problem worse governor evers original budget proposed 70 million to fight homelessness including 50 million for grants for municipalities to offer affordable housing and i was deeply disappointed when republicans voted to cut these funds hintz said in the statement however republican rep rob summerfield who spearheaded the package said the bills look at the housing issue from a holistic approach we knew from the get go you re not gonna be able to pass one bill to take care of this issue summerfield said you re not gonna have a silver bullet saying we do this one thing and all our problems are alleved this is where talking to the industry talking to community groups talking to everybody who s got a stake in this and taking their idea saying we can do a little here a little here a little there and after a while you start to get a bigger stack of bills that hopefully will make a difference in in this issue rep david armstrong r rice lake who authored several of the bills also works as the executive director of the barron county economic development corp he said he s seen first hand how businesses struggle to find employees which goes hand in hand with the housing shortage armstrong sees the bills as the state legislature s way of giving municipalities tools they need to help developers build in their communities he said what many of the bills aim to do is cut down on government regulations that drive up the cost of housing according to a 2021 study from the national association of homebuilders government regulations account for nearly 24 of the current average sales price 397 300 of a new single family home as a government we can t affect supply and demand we can t affect supply chain really but what we can affect is the cost of what government does and how it impacts the cost of housing said assembly majority leader jim steineke r kaukauna the wisconsin economic development association a statewide trade association for economic development professionals supports several of the bills included in the package i think they certainly can have a significant impact on making wisconsin a more desirable place to live said michael welsh weda s vice president of legislative affairs i think it s good public policy if the bills are passed into law the average wisconsinite likely won t notice any immediate impacts welsh said but over time these bills could help small businesses thrive through employee retention and attraction grow communities and increase municipalities tax bases this is part of an overall effort to address wisconsin s workforce shortage crisis welsh said and i think that no one can deny that we re experiencing that i don t think we re unique in wisconsin i think other states are also feeling that pinch but i think these bills represent an effort to address some of the underlying issues that that speak to our our workforce shortage hopefully in the new year there ll be some action in the senate and get these bills to the governor s desk the bills face an uphill battle in the senate as numerous republcan senators have concerns according to a weda news release related old standards don t work 4 things wisconsin communities can do to increase affordable housing development related the statewide labor shortage could last years here s how employers workers can still succeed contact natalie brophy at 715 216 5452 or nbrophy gannett com follow her on twitter brophy_natalie
strategically located between two peloponnese hills in southern greece the fortified site of mycenae has entered collective consciousness mainly due to its mention in homer s the illiad and the odyssey which describes mycenae as the kingdom of the mythical king agamemnon mycenae became a greek settlement between 1700 and 1200 bc during the late bronze age with its monumental architecture being constructed at the pinnacle of the mycenaean civilization from 1350 bc during this era archaeologists hold that it was the wealthiest palatial center in greece before being abandoned over 2 000 years ago an interpretation from the odyssey where odysseys taunts the cyclops polyphemus as he escapes the island of the cyclopes according to legend perseus brought the cyclopes to build the fortified walls at mycenae public domain mythology surrounding mycenae according to greek mythology mycenae s story goes back to the hero perseus the demigod son of zeus and danae who was said to have founded the city of mycenae many mythical features are assigned to perseus within the ancient greek legends like the famous winged shoes of hermes which allowed him to fly and the helmet of ares mars which could make him invisible perseus s accomplishments included killing the sea monster sent by the god poseidon to destroy aethiopia thus freeing andromeda and killing the mythical beast medusa whose head could turn anyone looking at it to stone is it possible that perseus did exist and if he did was he truly connected to gods illustration showing perseus delivering medusa s head public domain there are several stories about why the city was named mycenae one claims that the city was named by perseus after his sword s mykes a part of the handle of a sword fell at the site the name of the city was then given to the mycenaean civilization which has been remembered as one of the most important civilizations of greek prehistory greek mythology holds that the descendants of perseus reigned from mycenae for three generations the last in the lineage being eurystheus after which atreus rose to power mycenae later became home to the kingdom of agamemnon son of atreus and the legendary commander in chief of the greek contingent in the trojan war brother to menelaus the king of sparta king agamemnon was considered to be one of the greatest leaders of his era not to be confused with the distorted hollywood portrayal of him in the film troy the lion s gate main entrance to the ancient city of mycenae in greece haris andronos adobe stock the architecture and artifacts of mycenae the descriptions of mycenae in ancient greek mythology are accurate even today you can still see the walls and be amazed by the huge stones some weighing up to 120 tons that comprise them known as cyclopean walls legend has it that the walls around the city were so named because perseus brought the mythical beings cyclopes or one eyed giants from asia to construct the large fortified walls using stones no human could lift tiryns the other great city of the mycenae civilization has a similar story where king proetus another mythical king used the cyclopes to build its fortified walls in 1999 both mycenae and tiryns were together recognized as unesco world heritage sites located strategically to afford control of the argolid plain mycenae was built almost 280 meters 918 ft above sea level the city was strong military and financial power especially in the bronze age around 1400 to 1200 bce when the gate of lions was built and new buildings were added in the area the lion gate the primary entrance to mycenae is one of the earliest examples of relief sculpture in ancient greece and is a large triangular stone on the top of the entrance to the citadel that depicts two lions the golden death mask known as the mask of agamemnon which was found in tomb v in grave circle a at mycenae by heinrich schliemann in 1876 xuan che cc by 2 0 in mycenae you can also find the treasury of king atreus also known as the tomb of king agamemnon a large and glorious dome shaped tomb called a tholos in greek which is one of nine in the area at the time these were the tallest domes on earth until the romans constructed the great baths of baiae over a thousand years later the famous golden mask of agamemnon an artifact discovered by heinrich schliemann in 1876 was found in one of these tombs and is one of the most famous artifacts to have been found all over the world the purpose of the mask was to cover the face of the dead during burial though not all archaeologists agree that the mask belonged to agamemnon the archaeologists heinrich schliemann and wilhelm dörpfeld at the lion s gate main entrance to the ancient city of mycenae in greece public domain excavating the mythical city of mycenae having been abandoned for centuries the archaeological site of mycenae became part of the jurisdiction of the greek archaeological society in 1837 at this point the first ever excavations were conducted by the greek archaeologist kyriakos pittakis in 1841 who is known for having uncovered the famed lion gate in 1874 heinrich schliemann began his excavations at the mythical site during which he unearthed the graves in what has come to be known as grave circle a a funerary enclosure containing shaft graves used for mycenaean elite it is worth mentioning that schliemann also discovered troy and helped academia to realize that troy was not a myth schliemann even before his discoveries was convinced that all the stories and legends were not myths but had to be partially true over subsequent decades and up into the 2000s a plethora of archaeologists continued excavations and in the 1950s the greek archaeological society archaeologist george mylonas excavated grave circle b as well as other sites there are many elements still buried underground those interested in learning more can visit either the mycenae museum next to the mycenae citadel or the national archaeological museum of athens which is home to many of the artifacts that have been uncovered such as gold objects discovered within burials studies have concluded that the area was occupied as far back as the 7th century bc and was reoccupied by different settlements afterwards the monumental construction of the mycenaeans took place later some time between 1350 and 1200 bc with the city walls dating back to about 1350 bc the decline of the mycenaean civilization began around 1200 bc and the city itself was abandoned about 100 years later while there are many theories for its demise experts are still unclear as to what happened grave circle a at mycenae in greece andy montgomery cc by sa 2 0 visiting mycenae mycenae is one of the most important archaeological sites in

mclennan county residents may need to take a deep breath and count to 10 when they receive their property appraisal notices in a few weeks residential property values increased 30 countywide according to preliminary figures from the mclennan county appraisal district that compares with a 25 increase statewide and even larger jumps among several school districts in mclennan county crawford isd is poised to see a 47 jump while china spring isd and la vega isd will see 37 and 41 jumps respectively based on preliminary data property values impact tax bills the amount taxpayers pay the counties school districts cities and in this county mclennan community college the taxing entities that set tax rates alvin lankford president of the texas association of appraisal districts knew rising appraisals could produce scorn among property owners he sent a letter to chief appraisers including the mclennan county appraisal district s joe don bobbitt encouraging them to go public with preliminary appraisals in an effort to lessen the sticker shock they are likely to have and hopefully reduce the level of protests we see lankford wrote that it is important to discuss the 10 assessed value cap and the revenue caps placed on taxing units that will keep tax increases from being proportional to the value increases bobbitt is passing the word on to local taxing entities we expect this year to be one of the busiest the district has seen but still encourage your constituents who disagree with the value to file a protest at mclennancad org efile for faster service and to be able to review evidence specific to their property he wrote in a letter to taxing entities bobbitt said by phone he expects protesters to show up in droves he envisions the review board considering about 18 000 protests this year up from 15 000 last year appraisal notices will hit the mail early april next month and may 16 is the deadline to inform the appraisal district a protest will be forthcoming appraised values play a role in determining property owners tax burden but the process does not stop there residents with homestead exemptions enjoy a 10 cap on annual property value increases applied for tax purposes known as the assessed value even if the appraised value increases more quickly homeowners 65 and older qualify to have their school taxes frozen then there is the protest procedure bobbitt said the appraisal district primarily relies on comparable home sales to determine if values should increase or decrease he said about 3 000 homes were sold countywide between the district s two most recent appraisal processes and our values were about 30 less than what they sold for on average other counties are seeing something similar substantial changes year to year mclennan county judge scott felton said what is happening in the housing market is a classic example of the supply and demand model for sure a dearth of housing stock combined with robust demand especially in growing texas is causing home prices to skyrocket felton said obviously our goal is to go through the budget process try to be very frugal and set a tax rate just enough to cover services we provide the community felton said referencing the work of mclennan county commissioners these values look like an opportunity to lower the tax rate again which we ve done several years in a row we re not hesitant to do that felton said last year we came in under the effective tax rate which is now called the no new revenue tax rate we ll start the budget process with that number then add or subtract the county is only about 17 of the countywide tax burden but we re going to do our part to keep a reasonable tax rate city of waco finance director nicholas sarpy said preliminary appraisals look really good definitely higher than what we were projecting in our models but sarpy said commenting on their impact is premature he said the appraisal district will not certify tax rolls until july after the appeals process and commercial property values remain in play he said residential values increased 30 countywide on average but the waco norm was closer to 21 bobbitt said the state is applying pressure to get values up saying he would prefer slowly increasing appraisals maybe 5 per year but cutting taxpayers a break on appraisals is not an option the state comptroller s office will conduct a property value study later this year tracing the steps of local appraisers and if our values are not within 5 of theirs i could be audited he said appraisers are legally bound to determine market value based on preliminary numbers waco will see its residential property value increase 21 to 14 5 billion woodway will jump 15 to 1 6 billion while hewitt will increase 18 to 1 3 billion and robinson will jump 21 also to 1 3 billion bellmead will move up 18 to 639 million lacy lakeview will rise 24 to 547 million it appears the average market value of a home in waco will increase from 210 272 to 270 732 year over year countywide the jump is 218 225 to 284 924 in waco isd it is 168 858 to 219 416 and in woodway it is 320 922 to 404 136 bobbitt said his office employs nine appraisers who are spread thin considering mclennan county has about 100 000 residential properties his office relies on aerial photography and listings appearing on websites but he said tracking comparable sales remains the preferred approach even in neighborhoods that see no homes changing hands he said the market as a whole dictates value changes even at the neighborhood level he said it is difficult to quantify the impact to one s home a nearby eyesore or chronic code violation might have a neighbor with several junk cars parked on the premises may create a nuisance but it s hard to put a value on that reduction that s something to be brought up before the review board which is made up of regular citizens who might come up with a value in a press release lankford said property taxes are vital to keep government services adequately funded he said an increase in market value of a major asset could be considered a blessing though many people consider it to mean an equal increase in property taxes which is simply not the case preliminary increase in average home appraisals school district increase midway 23 mcgregor 25 axtell 26 bruceville eddy 28 valley mills 29 waco 29 bosqueville 30

time job you certainly won t need to spend every day working on it but it s a good idea to set a schedule that includes the following activities watering some places in the country receive so much rainfall that watering the lawn isn t necessary but most grass will require some irrigation particularly in the drier months it s recommended to water your lawn deeply but infrequently which usually means no more than one to two times per week and soaking the soil about six inches deep this will encourage grass roots to grow deeper in search of water which will ultimately make them more resistant to drought mowing how often you mow will depend on how quickly your grass grows during the growing season once a week is probably about right but every other week should be fine when the grass is dormant just make sure not to remove more than about one third of the length of the grass blades at a time cutting the grass too short or mowing with a dull blade can damage your lawn over time fertilizing applying fertilizer once or twice a year can make a real difference in the appearance and health of your lawn soil can start to run low on key nutrients and replenishing them with a slow release organic fertilizer improves soil health and grass growth remember to stay away from quick release fertilizers unless you have a pressing need for grass in a hurry they ll get your grass growing quickly but they can deplete the soil in the long run weeding if you enjoy being outdoors and want to take your frustrations out on some weeds you might be able to keep your yard weed free using only your hands and a trowel most people however will need some help controlling weed growth herbicides are available in both synthetic and natural varieties but keep in mind that these are non selective products they ll kill whatever plants they re applied to so make sure to apply them carefully overseeding most of the time you aren t starting from scratch when you re working on your lawn instead you may see that your grass thins out over time one way to spruce it up is by overseeding or spreading a blend of grass seeds on top of existing grass how often you need to overseed will depend on things like climate and the amount of foot traffic your lawn experiences but you probably won t need to do this more than every three to four years aerating over time weather and foot traffic can compact the soil making it too dense to properly hold the water and nutrients that plants need and preventing grass roots from growing the way to fix this is by aeration or introducing air into the soil you can accomplish this with various spiked instruments but whenever possible you ll want to use the plug or core aeration method which digs up plugs of dirt and lets them recombine naturally into the ground this requires a special lawn aerator but you ll only need it once or twice a year pruning trees and shrubs fruit trees in particular require regular pruning to remove dead weight and make sure the leaves get as much sunlight as possible shaded trees and shrubs don t require quite as much work but they should be checked from time to time for damaged branches or signs of disease tree removal and replacement are expensive so it pays to monitor the health of any trees or large shrubs on your property eliminating pests some pests like white grubs can actively damage your lawn and even invite larger predators to come around looking for a snack other pests like mosquitoes and ticks don t harm plants but prevent you from fully enjoying your outdoor space whether you opt for organic pest control or synthetic products curbing unwanted visitors often becomes an important part of maintaining a lawn here are some basic guidelines for a lawn care maintenance schedule what to do how often to do it watering 1 2 times per week mowing every 1 2 weeks aerating 1 2 times per year fertilizing 1 2 times per year seeding every 3 4 years pruning trees and shrubs as needed weeding as needed pest control as needed photo credit adobe stock dean lawn maintenance products here are some key lawn products you ll want to keep on hand fertilizer use organic slow release

move lawn clippings away from undesirable areas core aerator to dig up plugs of soil for aeration making and keeping your grass thick and healthy a thick healthy lawn starts with good soil it s always a good idea to have your soil tested for ph acidity and nutrient content a professional lawn service can do this for you or you can purchase an at home testing kit the ideal soil ph for growing grass is a slightly acidic 6 5 most kits will also allow you to determine the amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in the soil knowing the ph and the nutrient content of the soil will tell you if you need to make any changes the addition of lime can help balance the ph and fertilizer can supply missing nutrients fertilizer strength is measured by its npk ratio or the amount of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k it contains if you find out that your soil already has plenty of phosphorus but lacks nitrogen and potassium for example you can look for a fertilizer that has a higher percentage of n and k the final stage of soil preparation is aeration which will loosen spots of compacted dirt then new seeds can be sown followed by thorough irrigation to help the seeds germinate be careful not to overwater at this stage or you might inadvertently wash away seedlings that are still trying to take root once the grass has grown a few inches in height it s time to start mowing we recommend a mulching mower which chops the grass clippings into small pieces and redistributes these clippings on the lawn instead of having you bag them up the clippings are chock full of nitrogen meaning that you ll fertilize your lawn every time you mow remember to keep your mower blades sharp as dull blades can damage grass take care of any weeds you see as soon as possible to keep them from spreading do the same for any signs of disease which can include brown white or yellow patches on an otherwise green lawn in many cases the cause of the disease is a lawn fungus and you can purchase fungicide from any home and garden store to keep it from spreading however if these products don t take care of the problem you may need to hire a professional lawn service to diagnose and treat the disease treating your lawn as the seasons change you ll need to prepare your lawn for the weather one important thing to keep in mind is the species of the grass you want to grow most of the country uses cool season grasses like kentucky bluegrass and bermuda grass but some southern areas use warm season grasses these require different annual fertilizing schedules fall if you have cool season grasses in your yard make sure you aerate and fertilize in autumn during the cool weather but before the first freeze cool season grasses actually grow the most over the winter so you ll be supplying the plants with the nutrients and soil they need to grow healthy in time for spring you can also plant shrubs this time of year giving them a few weeks to take root before going dormant in the cold keep the lawn clear of fallen leaves which can become wet and soggy and attract fungus try to get one final mow in before the first freeze hits once you re done with that take the time to winterize your lawnmower preparing it to remain in storage for a few months winter fortunately you won t need to do much lawn maintenance in the winter but make sure you don t leave any objects or equipment laying on the lawn a rake left atop delicate grass can leave a rake shaped dead spot that will last into spring similarly avoid walking or driving on the grass as much as possible to avoid damaging it and compacting soil winter is a good time to prune any trees or shrubs to prepare for new growth in the spring spring although spring is a time of impressive plant growth the weather can be unpredictable so refrain from doing too much heavy maintenance while the ground is still damp from melted snow and seasonal rain if you want to use pre emergent weed control methods to prevent unwanted plants from showing up now s the time don t fertilize cool season grasses during the spring any new growth might not survive a hot summer do fertilize warm season grasses like st augustine grass in late spring after the chance of another frost has passed with either type of grass start up a regular mowing schedule once it s obvious that the grass has started growing again summer as the name implies warm season grasses flourish during the summer however they can still struggle during the hottest weather so try to get any aeration and fertilization in before the temperature goes north of 80 degrees fahrenheit or so take care of any weeds by hand or with herbicide and watch for signs of fungal infection or grub infestation mow regularly and consider letting the grass grow a little taller for the season to help keep weeds away cool season grasses can go brown and completely dormant in the heat but that doesn t mean that they re dead if you ve got cool season grasses either water the lawn regularly or don t water it at all until the temperature starts to cool off don t be tempted to apply fertilizer though you ll merely waste it and possibly burn heat stressed plants here is a breakdown of how to handle different types of grasses cool season grasses warm season grasses common types kentucky bluegrass ryegrass fine fescue tall fescue st augustine grass bermuda grass centipede grass zoysia grass when to aerate and seed fall late spring or early summer when to fertilize fall early or late summer dormant period summer winter preferred provider for lawn maintenance

healthy plants you can purchase a test kit or hire a professional when should you start treating your lawn that depends on what you mean by treating if you re talking about basic maintenance tasks like mowing watering and raking it s never too soon to start if you re talking about a treatment like overseeding fertilization aeration or pre emergent weed control the best time of the year will depend on your climate and grass type cool season grasses should be planted and fertilized in the fall whereas warm season grasses should be planted and fertilized in late spring or early summer planting and fertilizing right before the grass growing season will ensure a healthy root system that will keep the grass in good shape during its later dormant period further reading
composite image with background stock photo and overlay of washington county sheriff s office patrol vehicle booking photo of felicia ramona buckley bowers taken in washington county utah feb 28 2021 photo courtesy of the washington county sheriff s office st george news st george a colorado woman was sentenced to serve time in federal prison after a traffic stop led to the seizure of more than 80 pounds of methamphetamine one of the largest seizures in utah on tuesday 39 year old felicia ramona buckley bowers of denver colorado appeared in u s district court in st george for sentencing on one felony count of possession of meth with intent to distribute a federal offense that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years to life in prison depending on the amount of drugs involved washington county sheriff s deputies arrested bowers on feb 28 2021 following a late night traffic stop on northbound interstate 15 near mile marker 7 in st george bowers was headed home to denver colorado after a trip to california according to charging documents filed with the court after responding to the scene a k 9 indicated the possible presence of drugs deputies conducted a search and inside of the trunk deputies located two cardboard boxes that contained a total of 27 packages of suspected meth that weighed 81 pounds combined also recovered were 24 grams of suspected heroin bowers was arrested and transported to purgatory correctional facility where she was booked on second degree felony possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance she was also charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance paraphernalia and open container washington county sheriff s lt dave crouse told st george news the purchase price in los angeles for a pound of meth at that time was roughly 2 500 per pound when the 81 pounds is broken down into grams for street level sales the value of the seizure would be as high as 2 9 million he said four days after bowers arrest the case was picked up by federal prosecutors and the defendant was indicted by a grand jury on one federal count of possession of meth with intent to distribute the state subsequently dismissed the charges filed in 5th district court bowers remained in jail while the federal case continued its way through district court during tuesday s hearing bowers defense attorney christopher j salcido addressed the court saying that over the last year his client has had significant events take place while she has been in custody including a death in the family as well as the birth of a grandbaby salcido said not being able to be present for those events or to be there to take care of her family has weighed heavily on buckley who has been left with a lot of regret salcido said amid the challenges the defense attorney said bowers has taken responsibility for her actions and has completed treatment a program his client did very well in the attorney continued by asking the court to be compassionate and merciful when rendering the sentence upon his client and also asked the judge to deviate from the sentencing guidelines in favor of a lighter sentence salcido asked that his client be able to serve out her sentence in a facility as close to denver as possible to facilitate family visitation assistant u s attorney stephen dent argued for a 57 month sentence based on the fact that bowers was caught transporting 81 pounds of meth which is staggering dent said adding that the sentence needs to reflect the seriousness of the crime dent went on to say such a large amount would have released a tsunami of drug use and crime in whatever areas where the drugs were heading to adding it was not the first time the defendant has been caught transporting narcotics during her criminal history dating back more than 15 years the prosecutor also mentioned the defendant s difficult childhood and her history of substance abuse adding she can receive treatment for those issues while she serves her sentence he said the recommended sentence would also serve as a deterrent to others who may consider hauling drugs through utah prior to handing down his sentence district judge ted stewart said the case involved a serious offense considering the amount of drugs recovered which could have caused extreme harm to many people in alignment with the government s position bowers was sentenced to serve 57 months in federal prison once released she will be placed on three years supervision with standard release conditions in addition to completing a substance abuse program he also ordered that bowers be given credit for time served the judge also said the court will submit a recommendation to the bureau of prisons asking that bowers be placed in a facility close to colorado he closed by reminding the defendant that by entering a guilty plea she had also waived her right to an appeal the judge then ordered that bowers be turned over to the custody of the u s marshals office at the time of the arrest the defendant was traveling with her husband 40 year old tyler bowers who was also arrested and later indicted in federal court in january tyler bowers was sentenced to serve 70 months in federal prison at the time of the couple s arrest the seizure of meth was one of the largest in utah less than two weeks ago officers in st george recovered 140 pounds of meth during a traffic stop that took place within 5 miles of the stop that sent the bowers to federal prison copyright st george news saintgeorgeutah com llc 2022 all rights reserved

photo courtesy of times of india i debated with myself whether sri lanka s present state was a crisis of incompetence or a crisis of arrogance and settled on incompetence you could have someone arrogant but competent it s not perfect but it ll do someone who is modest but incompetent would at least have the modesty to ask for help but someone who is arrogant and incompetent is objectively worse not only do they not know what to do but they also would not ask for help hence i will call it a crisis of incompetence how it started the tax cut proposed in the viyathmaga drafted vistas of prosperity and splendor were implemented in late 2019 the prevailing tax system has contributed to the collapse of the domestic economy it said i think i do not need to expand on the irony of this which by the way the vistas document is full of several taxes paye withholding tax economic service charge was scrapped vat was slashed and several tax holidays were granted the government s tax revenue fell by nearly 28 completely upsetting the path of fiscal consolidation undertaken by the previous government in 2016 sri lanka had entered into an extended fund facility eff with the international monetary fund imf equivalent to 1 5 billion the purpose of which was to deal with the balance of payments bop pressures yes they were not new problems to unlock other financing and to boost investor confidence in 2019 following its 6th and final review the imf decided not to disburse the final tranche of the lending facility due to sri lanka s u turn away from fiscal consolidation by september 2020 the sri lankan government decided it would terminate a 1 5 billion japanese funded light rail system saying that it was not cost effective one engineer even went so far as to claim the japanese lrt was useless as it could not carry cargo on top of the carriages the ground work for the project had been done by the previous government and the interest on the loan was a mere 0 1 with a 40 year payment period and a 12 year grace period anyone else would have thought we were ripping the japanese off not the other way around to make matters worse for us the japanese firm which had been signed on as consultants to the lrt project claimed damages worth rs 5 8 billion for violating the terms of the agreement by december 2020 the us millennium challenge corporation mcc decided to discontinue the proposed 480 million grant to sri lanka that would have upgraded our urban transport network land registration and built several rural road links to highways around the country without a cent in loans we can t really blame the us for the cold shoulder after all the fear mongering spearheaded by podujana party politicians and their allies biology tuition master tissa jananayaka even went so far as to conduct a lecture on how the us would take over a 200 km strip of land with an area of 1 2 million acres connecting colombo and trincomalee and called it the american corridor this same biology teacher also helped lend credence to the now debunked dr shafi hoax ah the purveyors of alternate facts in sri lanka in december 2019 the central bank had 7 642 million in its reserves reserve adequacy which is measured in months of imports was 4 6 basically sri lanka could fully service its import needs for 4 6 months if everything else was held constant by december 2020 9 months after sri lanka s first lockdown reserves were at 5 665 million enough for 4 2 months of imports now at this point it might have triggered some retrospect in someone arrogant but competent none of us knew how long the pandemic would really last it was a novel coronavirus after all in april may 2020 sri lanka s sovereign ratings were downgraded to b negative immediately locking sri lanka out of international financial markets so raising financing through international sovereign bonds was no longer an option either it was clear at this point that sri lanka would need imf support eventually but unfortunately sri lanka decided to bank itself on the self proclaimed godfather of russian tourists instead and pilot an ill fated tourism bubble with russian and ukrainian tourists the purpose of which was to increase forex inflows through tourism at this point covid vaccines had not been rolled out anywhere else in the world it started on january 2021 let alone in sri lanka perhaps the only competence displayed was in the distribution of covid vaccinations but even that was not without issue there were delays in the procurement of the 2nd dose of astra zeneca and of course plenty of flexing connections to get covid vaccines ahead of others how it went in july 2021 the central bank of sri lanka settled a 1 billion bond increasing the fragility of its external liquidity position reserves fell to 2 806 million by end july just 1 8 months of imports it was soon after in august 2021 that the delta variant started spreading in sri lanka and experts warned that things would get worse it would go onto become sri lanka s worst wave of covid in terms of hospitalizations and deaths we were teetering on the edge by october 2021 sri lanka s reserves had fallen to 2 269 million just 1 4 months of imports it was in this month that governor of the central bank announced his six month roadmap how it has been six months since this roadmap was launched and none of the inflows mentioned in the document ever materialized in november 2021 reserves fell to 1 588 million just one month of imports despite the impossible nature of sri lanka s economic crisis at this point the government of sri lanka still refused to explore imf support the presidential secretary p b jayasundera in november said the government will restructure its loans instead of seeking the assistance of the imf the hardline stance it had maintained throughout until this month soon after christmas the central bank decided to draw down on a 1 5 billion chinese yuan swap it has agreed to in march 2021 to boost sri lanka s reserve position at least on the books to 3 139 million reserve adequacy remained bleak just 1 8 months of imports who was the central bank trying to fool i do not know against all expert advice the government of sri lanka opted to settle a 500 million bond in end january 2022 quite literally by selling the family silver or rather the gold in this case in early january the central bank sold 3 6 tons of 6 69 tons of its gold reserves i do not know the rate at which the central bank sold its gold at but in january the market price of gold was 1 825 per ounce in early january goldman sachs had raised its 12 month gold price forecast to 2 150 per ounce expecting a slowdown in the us economy by march gold prices had hit a record 2 050 per ounce following ukraine russia tensions goldman sachs has now raised its 12 month gold price forecast to 2 350 perhaps if we had competence we would now not be here wondering what the market value of that 3 6 tons of gold we sold in january would be between january 2020 and december 2022 the central bank of sri lanka had expanded broad money supply defined as the sum of currency held by the public and demand deposits held by the public with commercial banks by rs 2 726 billion a 40 increase since the start of 2020 ajith nivard cabraal who was then a state minister and currently the governor of the central bank boldly claimed there is no relationship between money printing and rupee depreciation this is what the central bank of sri lanka says about broad money supply studies have shown that the most appropriate monetary variable to analyze the relationship between the money supply and the general price level is the broad money supply perhaps then it is not a surprise that inflation is rising so rapidly i suspect with the devaluation of the rupee that march inflation will likely exceed 30 at the same time the central bank decided to maintain an artificially low interest rate along with an artificially low managed float exchange rate the second lesson i learnt at my monetary economics course during my undergraduate days was that the central bank much choose what it wishes to control the interest rate the exchange rate or the inflation it cannot in any sense control all three at once because these are often conflicting but what we saw over the past two years was in fact an attempt to control all three to keep interest rates low it was necessary to supply more money but when you supply more money that causes the rupee to depreciate and inflation to increase hence the central bank had no choice but to employ moral suasion to maintain an exchange rate that fails to reflect reality but the market is no fool worker remittances one of top three sources of foreign exchange into the country fell by 22 from 2020 to 2021 that s 1 6 billion lost due to the central bank s exchange rate policy in end february reserves were 2 361 million that is about 1 4 months worth of imports the rupee devaluation hit like a ton of bricks the central bank floated the rupee earlier this month and today it is being quoted at rs 300 by some private banks that is a depreciation of one third it will likely stabilize at a lower rate eventually but will have a drastic impact on purchasing power and the cost of living the domestic banking sector is also now at risk in 2020 there was a shift in the foreign domestic composition of government debt instead of borrowing internationally the government borrowed domestically shifting the composition to a 40 60 ratio domestic commercial bank exposure to government debt increased from 28 of central government debt in 2019 to 43 in 2020 i do not have 2021 and 2022 figures how it s going the government has finally decided to seek imf support but it is too little too late the government if it was not besieged with incompetence would have gone to the imf one and a half years ago a debt restructuring program will likely take upwards of 11 months according to lee buccheit depending on how proactive the sovereign debtor is the current sri lankan government is many things but proactive is not a word one would use to describe it whatever reforms undertaken will be slow yielding and we have also piled on short term debts like swaps if we take away the 1 5 billion chinese yuan facility that definitely cannot be used to service debts our usable reserves are below 1 billion but we have a 1 billion bond maturing in end july 2022 how does the government plan to make this in the meantime besides financial aid the government has not sought humanitarian assistance for food and medicine for inevitable shortages that will occur it will probably not be proactive about this either and wait until our backs are against the wall the 1 billion credit line from india will help but despite import bans on non essentials our import bill in december 2021 was 2 2 billion due to global inflation and other factors beyond our control the war raging on in ukraine will affect global wheat prices shortly fuel prices are also higher than it was pre covid so even if we buy less we may still be paying the same total amount russia is selling oil on discount but sri lanka cannot even afford to buy that the disastrous organic agriculture policy has affected domestic food supply and domestic production rice yields fell by 20 in six months the drop in tea production is expected to cause a loss of 425 million without an adequate supply of food and fuel we can also kiss our projected tourism earnings goodbye on top of that russia which is one of our top tea markets will most likely not be able to buy our tea for the foreseeable future reforms will take time to bear fruit exports will not double in a year no matter what finance minister basil rajapaksa said at his budget speech some countries have issued travel advisories about shortages and power cuts so tourists will be skeptical worker remittances may take some time to bounce back from informal channels the only option the government has is to cut its expenses drastically and immediately this means stopping all infrastructure projects sending everyone except a skeletal staff home

firefighters battle a fire following a russian attack in kharkiv ukraine friday march 25 2022 ap photo felipe dana the associated press russian forces appear to be shifting their focus from ukraine s capital to the contested donbas region possibly signaling a new phase of the war the russians seem to be prioritizing what moscow calls the liberation of the donbas region over a ground offensive aimed at kyiv russian backed separatists have controlled part of the donbas region of eastern ukraine since 2014 meanwhile ukrainian officials say a strike on a theater last week in the besieged city of mariupol killed about 300 people in the deadliest single attack since the invasion started a month ago separately the associated press has independently documented at least 34 assaults on ukrainian medical facilities by russian forces during a nightly video address president volodymyr zelenskyy appealed again friday to russia to negotiate an end to the war but said ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace president joe biden was in poland on friday to pay tribute to a country that has taken in more than 2 million ukrainian refugees who were forced to flee their homes here are some key things to know about the russia ukraine conflict what happened in mariupol local authorities in mariupol said friday that last week s russian airstrike on a theater used as a bomb shelter killed about 300 people citing eyewitnesses it was not immediately clear whether emergency workers had finished excavating the site or how the eyewitnesses had arrived at the horrific death toll more than 1 300 people had been sheltering in the building ahead of the march 16 attack and the theater had a huge inscription reading œchildren ť posted outside intended to be visible from the skies tens of thousands have fled mariupol in the past week most of them driving out in private cars through dozens of russian checkpoints the city of zaporizhzhia the closest urban center has become a waystation of sorts before they continue further to safety œunfortunately nothing remains of mariupol ť said evgeniy sokyrko one of those who left œin the last week there have been explosions like i ve never heard before ť what else is happening on the battlefield the sheer scope of the bloodshed in ukraine has fueled allegations that moscow is committing war crimes by killing civilians whether deliberately or by indiscriminate fire with a nato official saying russian president vladimir putin s war is œunprovoked illogical and also barbarian ť russian forces have repeatedly attacked ukrainian medical facilities striking at hospitals ambulances medics patients and even newborns with at least 34 assaults independently documented by the associated press a local official in the northern city of chernihiv said russian troops are deliberately targeting sites where food is being stored it s estimated that more than 130 000 people remain in the city which had a pre war population of 285 000 chernihiv has been further cut off after a vital pedestrian bridge over the desna river was damaged by shelling the local governor said friday the tall and narrow concrete bridge had become a vital link to the outside world after the main road bridge over the desna was destroyed earlier this week by a russian airstrike that severely hampered efforts to get supplies in and civilians out on a highway leading south to the capital kyiv what are western leaders doing the united states and the european union on friday announced a move to further squeeze russia economically a partnership to reduce europe s reliance on russian energy and dry up the billions of dollars the kremlin gets from the sale of fuel germany s economy minister said his country has forged contracts with new suppliers that will allow it to significantly reduce its reliance on russian coal gas and oil in the coming weeks russian foreign minister sergey lavrov described western efforts to sanction russia internationally as œtotal war he said on friday that the goal was œto destroy break annihilate strangle the russian economy and russia on the whole ť meanwhile nato secretary general jens stoltenberg reiterated that any use of chemical or nuclear weapons œwill totally change the nature of the war in ukraine it will be absolutely unacceptable ť what is biden doing in poland biden saluted poland on friday for welcoming more than 2 million refugees who have fled russia s invasion then he met with humanitarian experts on the ground about what will be needed to mitigate the growing suffering his visit to poland is his final stop in europe this week to underscore america s commitment to protect a key nato member on ukraine s doorstep the president also visited with some of the thousands of u s troops who have been sent near poland s border to assist with the humanitarian emergency and to bolster the u s military presence on the eastern flank of nato more than 3 5 million ukrainians have fled the country since the feb 24 invasion including about 2 2 million to poland according to the united nations the exodus is europe s biggest refugee crisis since world war ii what is russia saying russian forces in ukraine appear to have shifted their focus from a ground offensive aimed at kyiv to instead prioritizing what moscow calls the liberation of the contested donbas region suggesting a new phase of the war it appears too early to know whether this means president vladimir putin has scaled back his ambitions in ukraine but russian military moves this week indicate a recognition of the surprisingly stout ukrainian resistance russian backed separatists have controlled part of the donbas region of eastern ukraine since 2014 putin s forces are under great strain in many parts of the country and the united states and other countries are accelerating their transfer of arms and supplies to ukraine in recent days u s officials have said they see evidence of ukrainian defenders going on the offensive in a limited way in some areas putting a positive face on it all the deputy chief of the russian general staff said his forces had largely achieved the œmain objectives ť of the first phase of what moscow calls a œspecial military operation ť in ukraine what is ukraine saying zelenskyy again called for peace on friday but warned that ukraine would not give up its land as part of negotiations œthe territorial integrity of ukraine should be guaranteed ť he said in his nighttime video address to the nation œthat is the conditions must be fair for the ukrainian people will not accept them otherwise ť zelenskyy appeared to be responding to col gen sergei rudskoi deputy chief of the russian general staff who said russian forces would now focus on œthe main goal the liberation of donbas ť russian backed separatists have controlled part of the donbas region of eastern ukraine since 2014 and russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from ukraine including the besieged city of mariupol rudskoi s statement also was a suggestion that russia may be backing away from trying to take kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled zelenskyy noted that russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven t been able to take kyiv or kharkiv the second largest city what has the ap directly witnessed

faang is so last year but bank of america just dropped a new acronym on us what happened nvidia nvda 2 48 stock was one of the strongest performers out of a group of many strong performing semiconductor stocks thursday and for good reason on thursday nvidia sketched out plans to attack what it called a trillion dollar opportunity to grow its annual sales many times in size foreseeing eventual addressable markets as big as 300 billion for sales of automotive chips 300 billion more from sales of other chips and systems 150 billion from selling artificial intelligence enterprise software 150 million from omniverse enterprise software 100 billion in annual revenue from video gaming services such as geforce now of course that still leaves the question why nvidia stock is down 2 8 as of noon et today so what so what changed today two things actually one good for nvidia and one not so good the good news today is that bank of america just released a note describing a new investing acronym for investors mango which appears to be short for the semiconductor stocks marvell technology advanced micro devices nvidia globalfoundries and on semiconductor if you want to stretch the acronym a bit you might also include broadcom which doesn t seem to fit alphabetically until you recall that its stock ticker is still avgo bank of america believes that the structural importance of semis to the rapidly digitizing global economy cannot be overstated reports thefly com today for this reason the analyst is highlighting these five or six semiconductor stocks as his favorites saying they re all levered to the right end markets with solid demand visibility and consistent execution now what as i said that s the good news now here s the bad all five indeed six of these semiconductor stocks had already risen strongly on thursday before bank of america shook the tree and dropped this new investing acronym on us as a result investors aren t reacting as strongly today to bofa s endorsement as they might have reacted had the stocks not already run higher yesterday instead investors appear to be taking profits today after yesterday s strong performance granted that s not necessarily bad news for the business prospects of any of these companies it s certainly not great news for their stock prices today however and it means investors may need to wait for a pullback if they want a ripe opportunity to pick some cheap nvidia shares again

when pakistan unleashed a coordinated military attack in dhaka and chittagong on march 25 26 1971 there were 20 000 west pakistani troops throughout east pakistan they were engaged to prevail over the unarmed but thoroughly hostile civilian population of the two main cities of the province dhaka and chittagong apart from remaining ready to fight back 5 000 east pakistani regulars and 13 000 east pakistani paramilitary troops whose loyalty was doubtful this was mentioned at a meeting of the washington special action group on march 26 1971 frus vol xi doc 11 pakistan had accumulated a sufficient stockpile of arms and ammunition during the cold war era after signing its first bilateral security treaty in 1953 with the us followed by becoming member of two us led military alliances the south east asia treaty organization seato and the baghdad pact later known as cento pakistan continued to be a major recipient of us military supplies and economic aid for more than a decade and strengthened its military capability to go for an ill conceived adventure to liberate the indian held kashmir in 1965 using us supplied weapons against india violating the norm of not using those against a non communist adversary the us promptly stopped the supply of arms to pakistan and restricted economic aid they also stopped weapons supply to india who had been receiving us arms since 1962 on a different consideration after the china india border clash broke out ayub s war stopped far short of his desired goal as peace was restored through the un backed tashkent agreement and the decline of ayub as pakistan s invincible ruler started taking shape after the 1965 war with suspension of the western aid and steady fall in public expenditures the economic condition in east pakistan became grim the demand for complete provincial autonomy as stated in the 21 point demand in 1954 by the united opposition of all political parties of east bengal called jukto front was again brought to the forefront that formulation of complete provincial autonomy proposed to restrict the authority of the central government within defence foreign affairs and currency while advocating that the rest of the state portfolio be kept under the jurisdiction of the province s it won overwhelmingly in the east pakistan provincial general election in 1954 in 1966 that demand for complete provincial autonomy by and large was brought to the forefront by sheikh mujib renaming it as the six point demand earlier during 1956 63 the issue of complete autonomy was sidelined by the al when hussain shaheed suhrawardi was its leader it was only after his death in 1963 that his successor and ardent follower sheikh mujib included complete autonomy in the al manifesto again as ayub after the debacle of the 1965 war faced a crisis in every sphere of national life most of the opposition parties of pakistan assembled over a round table conference rtc at lahore to demand an end to one man rule and return to parliamentary democracy sheikh mujib was a participant of the rtc and surprised others by presenting the six point program for the first time on behalf of the al parties representing vested interests of west pakistan were also participants at the rtc who disagreed with what sheikh mujib demanded as a result of opposition disunity the objective of removing ayub failed ayub took full advantage of the situation tried to misguide the public by charging that the six point was a conspiracy to break away from pakistan and to make east pakistan independent he arrested mujib and fabricated a case in january 1968 against him and 33 others charging them for conspiracy to bring arms from india to engineer an armed revolt and make east pakistan free the case was brought for public hearing in open court ayub allowed newspapers to publish daily court proceedings of the trial to expose mujib s heinous crimes but his rule by then had become so unpopular that his publicity to malign mujib made the latter the biggest political cult in the province by the end of january 1968 ayub suffered a massive heart attack the army chief general yahya khan took that opportunity to handle the top executive files of the state on ayub s behalf violating the constitutional provision of making the national assembly speaker officiate the event in the long absence of the president as ayub resumed his responsibilities a few months later the post war economic crisis had deepened in a number of areas in west pakistan and serious labour unrests erupted while most of the political parties united for restoration of democratic rule since usual police measures failed to tackle the spread of labour unrest ayub attempted to deploy the army but that could not be done without declaring a state of emergency for the country as a whole and handing over power to the army as pointed out by army chief yahya khan a separate plan to defuse the united move by the political parties was worked out somehow but labour unrest continued yahya kept opposing army deployment without martial law cover for the whole country and when that was promulgated on march 26 1969 yahya as the head of the army took over the state power without firing a shot two months before yahya took over in far away america in january 1969 richard nixon of the republican party became the new us president by defeating lyndon b johnson of the democratic party in the presidential poll of november 1968 johnson lost popular support mainly due to his involvement in the catastrophic war over vietnam during 1969 70 nixon did some advance planning for pulling out the us from the vietnam war before the next presidential election in 1972 he started to explore the possibility of improving the relationship with china by full diplomatic recognition which was long overdue since the revolutionary birth of new china in 1949 china being an important ally of north vietnam and a backer of the south vietnam communist party needed to be brought within the orbit of dialogue to find a negotiated exit from such an unpopular war in that context nixon took a view that since pakistan was occasionally used as a conduit for exchanging messages to and from china it would be helpful to spare pakistan from the continuing ban on supply of arms and spare parts for yahya it was most imperative to restore the supply of us weapons and spare parts in order to bring pakistan s military machine back on track again and also strengthen his personal leadership over pakistan s armed forces he began working on it immediately after taking over power on march 29 1969 only three days after taking power he sent his talented deputy chief martial law administrator rear admiral sm ahsan the commander in chief of the pakistani navy to america to attend the funeral of the wife of former us president eisenhower ahsan after reaching the us began lobbying for the resumption of arms supply with state department officials and eventually with president nixon the decision to resume the supply of spare parts from the us took a concrete shape after nixon met yahya in lahore in july 1969 during his fact finding tour to asia yahya also started probing to seek cooperation with political parties at home realising that the country could no longer be ruled relying solely on the support of the military force all the intelligence agencies of pakistan kept on filing assessments that al would be unable to get absolute majority in the national assembly to frame the constitution based on the six points in order to shift economic and financial powers from the centre to the provinces from the other side yahya was likely to be viewed differently from the usual punjabi army officer s mould since not only was he born and brought up in a pushto speaking family his sympathetic role in breaking up the punjab dominated one unit system had not gone unnoticed yahya before allowing free election campaigning had probably assumed that the appeal of six points being utterly provincial would alienate the vested interest of west pakistan and make them rely on the army to safeguard their interests yet he devised the ultimate safety catch against al s six points by the legal framework order lfo an ordinance issued in july 1970 by invoking the lfo the president could reject any constitutional proposal that would not conform to the regime s requirement for a strong centre and even the constituent assembly would be dissolved if an acceptable constitutional proposal was not produced within 120 days but the accumulated grievance of 23 years against west pakistan s exploitation and injustice proved more decisive than volumes of intelligence updates as dire threats were expressed through the ordinance the cyclone and tidal wave of november 12 13 1970 the most catastrophic in three centuries hammered the proverbial last nail on the coffin of united pakistan as the official and public representatives from west pakistan failed to turn up for the relief and rehabilitation work for the millions struggling to survive the post disaster situation the general election that began on december 7 made the tally of victorious al candidates 167 out of 313 total national assembly seats the election result also became a nightmare for yahya since he promised to protect the central government s authority over the country s defence expenditure and other administrative and development commitments soon after the disastrous election results yahya asked his corps commander in east pakistan lt general shahebzada yakub khan to prepare plans for possible contingencies that might help in the near future the plan was designed to meet the worst contingency arising out of any mass upsurge and open defiance of martial law yahya then came to dacca on january 12 and during the next five days he tried his best to persuade mujib to dilute some of the stiff conditions of six points but failed from there he went to larkana on january 17 to talk to z a bhutto the leader of the second biggest party pakistan people s party ppp who had won 81 seats in the national assembly bhutto as a minister in ayub s cabinet was an ardent supporter of the 1965 war against india and was sacked for disagreeing on the peace deal ayub had to sign at tashkent he started opposition politics on his own his rhetoric became immensely popular among the common people in sindh and punjab as well as within the army his success in the election created new followers amongst pakistan s senior army officers who were increasingly getting nervous since the result of the general election and particularly because yahya still showed the tendency to concede to sheikh mujib s demands yahya took with him his principal staff officer peerzada chief of army staff hamid chief of general staff gul hassan and chief of military intelligence umar to go to larkana in sindh and all of them by then were either virulently anti mujib or pro bhutto all of them were aware that yahya reached the dead end of the political road in dhaka it appeared that there was convergence of views between bhutto and army commanders on the danger of secession underlying the six points and on yahya s incapacity to solve it bhutto s articulation of the dangers arising from them to the country and the army itself must have created a deep impression on the generals karim brigadier m iskanderul karim thinks that in the larkana meeting bhutto made known to yahya in a very subtle way that the army leadership was with him on the east west issue apprehending a serious threat against his leadership spreading within the army yahya upon returning to islamabad thought over the action he should take he finally called the us ambassador joseph farland to his residence on january 27 yahya informed him about the underlying breakup pakistan was facing along the regional line in the process of current negotiation for a constitution and asserted that he could not let it happen and would abrogate the constitution making process to preserve the territorial integrity of the country ambassador farland responded positively to yahya s decision and said it was the policy of the us to respect the unity and integrity of pakistan frus document 109 volume e 7 the implication of us policy to respect the unity and integrity of pakistan needs a little bit of clarification the us was not expected to participate in the acts of preventing militarily the break up of east and west pakistan but it was clear that pakistan would use every resource at his disposal including us supplied arsenal as 80 per cent of pakistan s stocks were sourced from the us as gary j bass the author of the blood telegram india s secret war in east pakistan mentioned the on going assault required a formidable amount of military resources including perhaps four pakistan army divisions equipped with armour as well as the pakistan air force in this pakistan was relying on lots of u s weaponry and equipment everything from ammunition and the spare parts that keep armed forces operating to major items like tanks and massive c 130 transport airplanes that shuttled soldiers from west pakistan to east pakistan as the crackdown began bengalis begged us diplomats not to allow american supplied weapons to be used for mass murder the nixon administration made no move against pakistan s use of us weaponry garry j bass pg 57 during the cold war era there was no restriction on the use of american weapons received under defence treaties against aggression from a communist country those could also be used in civil strife conditions to combat internal subversion by pro communist organisations possible use of us supplied weapons in east pakistan as viewed at the end of january 1971 was clearly none of those two muyeedul hasan was a special assistant to tajuddin ahmad the prime minister of the bangladesh government in exile he is also the author of muldhara 71 and upadhara 71 march april this is an abridged version of the first chapter of the upcoming book titled 1971 bangladesh with unbound accounts

or major equipment for more money than it cost you the profit from the sale is subject to tax check out what to do if you owe back taxes to the irs for assets held for more than a year the long term capital gains tax rate for tax year 2023 ranges from 0 to 28 depending on your filing status income and asset type and few people qualify for a rate higher than 15 for assets held for a year or less your capital gains are taxed at your regular income tax rate which is 10 to 37 depending on your income even if you re used to paying a high capital gains tax rate double check your figures when you file your tax return for tax year 2023 if you re in a lower tax bracket this year than you were in the previous tax year you may find yourself paying no tax at all on your capital gains when you file your return in april 2024 read on to learn more about what to expect if you have capital gains this year what are the capital gains tax rates for 2023 the capital gains tax rate brackets for tax year 2023 remain the same as 2022 but the irs updated the income ranges for each bracket still the long term capital gains tax does not exceed 15 for most people this 15 rate applies to the following groups single individuals who earn 44 626 to 492 300 married individuals filing separately who earn 44 626 to 276 900 married joint filers who earn 89 251 to 553 850 heads of household who earn 59 751 to 523 050 in some cases capital gains are taxed at a greater rate individuals and couples with an income that exceeds the limits of the 15 tax rate are subject to a 20 tax rate individuals and couples with an income below the minimum for the 15 capital gains tax pay 0 some capital assets have a higher capital gains tax rate of 25 or 28 regardless of how long you held them the taxable part of a gain resulting from the sale of a section 1202 qualified small business stock 28 net capital gains from the sale of collectibles like coins or art 28 any unrecaptured gain from the sale of section 1250 real property 25 if you have short term capital gains from an asset you held for less than one year the rate for those gains is the same as your ordinary income tax bracket which ranges from 10 to 37 depending on your income capital gains tax on real estate one exception to capital gains tax rules is the sale of your primary home up to 250 000 500 000 for married joint filers is excluded to qualify for this exception you must have both owned the home and lived in it as your primary home for at least two of the previous five years you can take the exclusion one time during a five year period here s how this works imagine you purchased a house in 2017 for 150 000 and lived in the home until you sold it in 2023 for 300 000 since you used it as your primary residence for six years and have a profit of 150 000 you can avoid paying capital gains tax if you sold the property for 500 000 and are a single filer you have a capital gain of 100 000 subtract 250 000 from the total profit of 350 000 this exclusion may apply to rental property as well let s say you moved out in 2020 and used the property for rental income until you sold it you still meet the criteria to exclude the capital gains from your income because you lived in it for three years do capital gains count as income the irs classifies income as money property or services you receive through earned wages salaries and tips or unearned sources interest payments dividends rents royalties and more capital gains fall under the unearned category which makes them income this is why capital gains can increase your adjusted gross income which can phase you out of itemized deductions tax credits roth ira eligibility and ira contribution deductions however they do not push you into a higher tax bracket because they are taxed before your ordinary income in practice say for example that you and your spouse file jointly and earned 150 000 in 2023 during this period you also sold a rental property and have a long term capital gain of 50 000 in this example the capital gain is taxed at a 15 rate then your income is taxed at a maximum rate of 22 because your combined income is less than the maximum for that bracket in this case 190 750 how to calculate your capital gains curious to see what you might owe on capital gains follow these steps to calculate your net capital gain or net capital loss steps to calculate capital gains gather the following information date you acquired the asset date you sold the asset the proceeds from the sale of the asset the asset s basis the total amount of money you paid to purchase the asset including sales tax and expenses sort the assets into two categories short term and long term subtract each asset s cost from the amount you sold it for if you made a profit you have a net gain and will pay taxes on that income if you sell the asset for less than what you purchased it for you have a net loss in some cases you can deduct the loss or save it to apply to a future tax return record your losses and gains on irs form 8949 sales and other dispositions of capital assets before transferring to schedule d these steps give you an idea of how to calculate your capital gains but each person s tax situation is different for this reason you should speak to a tax professional or financial advisor who can explain your options and help you determine the best solution for your personal needs what is a short term capital gains tax you experience a short term capital gain when you acquire a capital asset and sell it for a profit after you

women s participation in the labor market drives economic and business growth yet the global economy incurs significant costs by failing to take full advantage of women s skills experience and productivity global wealth could increase by as much as 160 trillion if women had a greater role in the economy working in paid jobs and earning wages equal to those earned by men in the europe and central asia region women represent a major source of talent and productivity yet women remain highly underrepresented in business the potential economic benefit of gender equality in the region s labor market is significant if female labor force participation were at the same level as men it could boost regional gdp by as much as 1 1 trillion or 23 of annual regional gdp according to the ilo the world bank s women business and the law 2022 report which measures laws and regulations in 190 economies and how they impact women s decision making at different stages of their lives finds that 17 of economies in europe and central asia have implemented at least one reform since october 2020 to improve legal equality for women however while the region does well overall compared to other regions there is still wide variation in gender equality among economies gender gaps persist in labor force participation and earnings in the region the labor force participation rate for men is 66 compared to 50 6 for women the major constraints facing women include lack of affordable and quality childcare the double burden of domestic and professional work access to safe transport and pressure to conform to gender roles legal constraints also exist on many types of jobs women are permitted to perform the pay gap between men and women is about 30 barriers to female leadership also persist preventing women from advancing into top business management positions such as boards and corporate leadership female entrepreneurship is low due to limited access to assets financial services as well as information and markets a very important obstacle faced by many women is not having a bank account financial inclusion is essential to achieving inclusive growth yet women in europe and central asia still face barriers in access to and use of financial services women are 15 less likely than men to have any savings and they are 28 less likely to have enough savings to start a business the covid 19 crisis has compounded challenges for women and girls exacerbating barriers to participation in the economy women have been especially affected in the labor market because they are disproportionately employed in some of the hardest hit sectors in the region s hospitality sector women led businesses experienced a drop in sales almost 10 greater than similar businesses led by men and women led businesses were 11 more likely to close the pandemic has also likely expanded gaps in pay access to finance and digital opportunities for women a major development priority for the world bank is helping countries in the region realize their full economic potential by empowering women including through support to female business leaders and entrepreneurs in tajikistan for example our rural economy development project is helping to narrow the gender gap by assisting female entrepreneurs in the agribusiness and tourism sectors especially those who lack financing and training opportunities the georgia national innovation ecosystem genie project is helping increase innovation by georgian firms and boosting their participation in the digital economy including by supporting women s training to date women account for about 54 percent of a total of 27 000 beneficiaries in serbia the accelerating innovation and growth entrepreneurship project contributes to growth and competitiveness by improving scientific research innovative entrepreneurship and access to finance of the grants awarded so far totaling 1 3 million 56 percent has been allocated to women in the kyrgyz republic our 100 million emergency support for msmes project co financed by the asian infrastructure investment bank is enabling business owners to meet their operational expenses including employee salaries payment to vendors rent and utilities the project is expected to support 28 000 female headed msmes the turkey rapid support for micro and small enterprises project provides reimbursable financing support to medium sized enterprises to help them avert pandemic induced closure and to maintain their employment levels with a special focus on women women led and majority women employee firms have an over 50 acceptance rate and receive a 10 bonus on the financing to help them hire new employees buy equipment and pay recurring expenses but we know there is much more to do to accelerate gender equality especially as countries look to achieve an inclusive resilient and sustainable recovery from the pandemic investing more in education and training for girls and women is an important first step in europe and central asia gender gaps in education are relatively narrow but specific problems persist poverty remains the most important factor for determining whether a girl will access an education studies consistently reinforce that girls who face multiple sources of disadvantage such as income level location disability and or ethno linguistic background are farthest behind overall more female students enroll in tertiary education than male students but enrollment rates for women are lower than men for science technology engineering and math stem related fields in all countries across the region men in stem professions have higher earnings than women in the same professions certain professions continue to be labeled across gender lines leading young women to rule themselves out of careers in which they might otherwise be successful across europe and central asia women s potential in business remains largely untapped the glass ceiling is still very much present women are generally found in lower and mid levels of management occupational segregation and balancing family life and professional career contribute to these trends women continue to spend significantly more time on family and child care as well on household chores at the world bank we are working hard to help countries across europe and central asia address critical gender gaps in education and health remove obstacles to jobs and break down barriers to women s ownership and control of land housing and bank accounts we must engage women as agents of change for peaceful green resilient and inclusive development now more than ever we need to support women entrepreneurs and business leaders and accelerate action towards gender equality world bank

good morning des moines and happy day after st paddy s that s dd not tt day to you i m elle the register s dining reporter and i almost got arrested once in ireland welcome to off hours a free weekly newsletter on all things entertainment from the des moines register this week i spoke with an irish expat here in des moines for a new perspective on one of my favorite holidays the deal here s the deal when i was living in cork ireland in 2015 st patrick s day fell on a brilliantly sunny tuesday walking from my flat in st luke s crossing down to the celebration on the aptly named st patrick s street i encountered gobs of parade goers wearing shamrocks and shades of green some with the irish flag painted across their faces or lime colored wigs cascading down their shoulders it was a sight that felt at once incredibly special this was st paddy s in ireland after all and oddly familiar i watched the parade or more accurately i watched the tops of heads float by from my viewing spot a good 10 people deep in the crowd and petted every dog in a green bandana i could find that night trad music and the sound of parties underway rang out from pubs all over the city empty kegs stacking up along alleyway walls irish american heritage runs deep and the holiday has me thinking about how we celebrate and how much it means both here in america and across the pond i got in touch with michael halloran an irish expat living in des moines with his american wife and their four year old daughter halloran s background is in history and anthropology and he teaches an evening course at dmacc on ancient irish history more want in on secret spots to have fun in des moines we ve got a newsletter for that his irish parents lived and worked in new jersey where he was born in the 80s his family moved back to dublin in 1991 when halloran was in grade school but later his path would weave back to america after meeting his wife an ames native on st patrick s day in an irish pub in south korea the pair moved to iowa in 2013 and halloran has been sharing irish culture with his community through courses and outreach since halloran is part of a shrinking population of irish americans with direct non ancestral ties to both places st paddy s day became a cross cultural celebration of irish heritage thanks to mass immigration of irish citizens to the united states in the late 1800s commemorating the day with a green outfit a trip to church and parade watching likely helped root irish americans as they grew accustomed to life so far from home the connection between ireland and america has kind of diminished a little because you don t have the same level of immigration that you have had in the past halloran said you don t have as many families having that transatlantic connection more off hours love beer we have some options for you including the newly reopened beerhouse but if you find yourself in any major u s city on st patrick s day you re likely to spot a parade maybe a green river the parades halloran told me actually began first in new york city in the late 18th century before becoming popularized across ireland in more recent history it s thanks in large part to this sharing of irish heritage and tradition at the hands of homesick irish americans that we all get to be fiercely irish for a day if your interest in irish culture spans beyond one day wearing green there are opportunities locally and around the midwest to explore the little island country through history and connections with irish americans the friendly sons of st patrick of central iowa are well informed on events happening around the state so halloran suggested keeping an eye on their facebook page his dmacc course is currently full but he plans to lead another in the future and before the pandemic halloran was teaching an irish language course which he also hopes to be able to continue soon more off hours 5 things i didn t know you can do for free in des moines with a library card as for today halloran told me he ll likely be wearing green maybe i ll bring my daughter to the parade he said he s hopeful that this is the year he can introduce her to his home country i m trying to get her interested in ireland we read irish books and stuff like that whatever your plans for today i wish you a grand time with loads of craic sla inte my top 3 ways to celebrate st paddy s day 1 eat as the irish do halloran told me that there aren t a lot of foods directly associated with st paddy s but since it s a holiday and day off from observing lent many families make a roast been there done that i ll be eating a full irish breakfast to kick off my day instead the full irish is a meaty feast of eggs irish bacon rashers and sausages bangers grilled tomatoes beans and black and white puddings not the kind you re thinking of both are sausages usually formed with oats and suet and black pudding is made black with pork or beef blood don t knock it til you ve tried it i found everything but the rashers at gateway market and i m sopping it all up with some fresh soda bread here is a good recipe since it s a holiday why not wash this fine
