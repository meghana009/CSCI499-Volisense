2021 was a mixed bag for the renewable energy industry but investors should stay focused on the companies in this space that have what it takes to be winners over the long haul it s been a rough few months for renewable energy stocks macroeconomic shifts have induced traders to sell off growth stocks in favor of value and the green energy space specifically was hit particularly hard hit as the build back better bill stalled in congress but the industry is still growing quickly and has always adapted to changing political conditions as 2022 approaches we asked three fool com contributors to offer their picks for top renewable energy stocks to buy for next year they found sunpower spwr 0 80 atlantica sustainable infrastructure ay 5 15 and chargepoint holdings chpt 2 42 to be a cut above the rest the residential solar play travis hoium sunpower in 2021 i think we saw a shift in how consumers see electricity markets and their own energy independence not only are residential solar installations in the u s at record highs an increasing percentage of customers are also adding energy storage and ev charging to their installations this plays to sunpower s strengths as an energy solutions company sunpower has shed its solar module manufacturing business its utility scale solar business and is in the process of finding strategic alternatives for its commercial solar business that leaves its focus squarely on residential solar and it shows its non gaap gross margin per watt for residential projects jumped from 0 46 to 0 69 over the past year at the same time its net recourse debt declined from 428 million to 154 million fewer subsidies may be bad news for solar energy companies but that won t halt the industry s growth nor will it eliminate people s desire to buy rooftop solar systems or ev chargers i think sunpower is well positioned to ride the coming wave of growth and that s why i think 2022 will be a great year for the stock growth at a reasonable price howard smith atlantica sustainable infrastructure nations and businesses around the world are increasingly investing in renewable energy infrastructure as that infrastructure grows so too do the power purchase agreements that companies are signing with owners of those assets to bolster sustainability initiatives the majority of atlantica sustainable s power generation comes from renewable energy but it also has efficient natural gas plants and owns electricity transmission lines and water desalination facilities most of its renewable energy comes from solar assets and all of those are generating revenues under long term contracts for investors that means the company s dividend which at current share prices yields around 4 8 should be reliable in fact over the first nine months of 2021 its cash available for distribution increased 12 9 year over year its revenues grew 8 4 in the same period excluding foreign currency impacts and a non recurring project renewables contributed 77 of atlantica s revenue through sept 30 in addition to north america the company has assets in south america europe the middle east and africa but the vast majority of its 2021 new investments have been in north america thanks to the recently enacted infrastructure bill and the potential passage of legislation routing additional funds to u s renewable energy development there should be no lack of assets with which to grow in coming years atlantica sustainable also looks like a good value compared to its peers right now the charts below show its dividend yield exceeds that of two other renewable energy asset owners and it trades at a more favorable valuation through 2025 the company expects 73 of its cash available for distribution to come from renewable assets and geographically almost half will come from north america given the company s assets and investments in a region that has committed to growing its renewable energy sources this is a good time to own atlantica sustainable infrastructure electrify your 2022 portfolio with this ev charging stock daniel foelber chargepoint holdings if you step back and think about the ongoing national transition from vehicles powered by internal combustion to those powered by electricity it quickly becomes clear the u s is going to need far more electric vehicle ev chargers that s why 7 5 billion of president biden s infrastructure investment and jobs act is earmarked for expanding the nation s ev charging capabilities like many industries dependent on hardware and high costs the risk for businesses in this space is that ev chargers will become commoditized and that businesses and consumers will simply choose the providers that offer the lowest cost solutions chargepoint can t bypass this risk but it has done a great job building a vertically integrated capital light business and it s now the u s leader in its niche in the case of chargepoint capital light means that it doesn t need to spend heavily to grow its revenue because it sells its hardware upfront over time its growing charging network should generate greater recurring revenue through software subscriptions but for now subscriptions account for less than 30 of total revenue chargepoint expects its business to grow in lockstep with u s ev sales despite their growth so far evs are only on course to account for 4 of u s car sales in 2021 compared to 9 in china and 14 in europe that leaves plenty of room for chargepoint s business to scale and reach profitability as chargepoint waits for ev adoption to accelerate it has built a larger and more sophisticated network of charging ports as of oct 31 it had 163 000 activated ports around the world roughly 7 of which are dc fast charging ports for comparison consider that the tesla supercharger network consists of just over 30 000 fast charging ports management has forecast that chargepoint will finish its fiscal 2022 which ends on jan 31 with annual revenues of between 235 million and 240 million up more than 60 from fiscal 2021 also impressive is the company s non gaap gross margin which was 27 in the fiscal third quarter compared to 20 in the prior year period chargepoint stands out as a fast growing business that will flex its industry leading position to pull away from the competition still a bright future ahead renewable energy stocks may not be ending 2021 on a high note but that doesn t mean the long term trends aren t heading in the right direction wind solar and evs are all growing and that should help these stocks outperform the market in the years to come

why do modern societies insist on maintaining systems that deliver neither sustainability nor harmony both at the local and global level understandably at the top of these nonsensical food chains sits the ruling elite of the prevailing world order that has immensely benefited from the unrelenting multitude of global discordances these dysfunctionalities operate in all spheres of social existence political economic cultural environmental etc ultimately the cumulative effect of all these will lead to a collapse of unmanageable proportions the current trend seems to be rather than trying to change societies misguided ways states are determined to double down on the very mistakes that are now threatening chaos and collapse for example the financial crisis that erupted ten years ago is still with us in one form or another no serious attempt to rectify the problems was initiated since 2008 instead of dealing with the main underlying problems states resorted to flimsy palliatives like extend and pretend kicking the can down quantitative easing plunge protection teams central banks bailing out stock markets ex japan switzerland etc etc the critical issue of thoroughly reformulating the global financial architecture is receding by the day inevitably there will be another financial crisis which most likely will be worse than that of 2008 the global economic doctrines that underpin all the various malice and tend to produce myriad symptoms financial or otherwise remain closed to enlightened debates discussions and deliberations here are some of the major problems associated with the existing system for instance the globalization that allows only the free movement of capital goods and services while truncating the other factor of production namely labor is bound to create a globalization that is inherently polarizing infinite growth on a finite planet and the fraudulent banking system of fractional reserve banking remain amongst the major problems of the global order the symptoms of migration inequality etc cannot be addressed without changing the flawed fundamental narratives of the modern world system the preeminent universal culture of the modern world system is unbridled consumption we are all forced directly or indirectly to worship greed and consumption useless consumption at that the main flaw of the consumerism doctrine is gluttonous material consumption can liberate both body and soul of course we have now enough data to show the fallacious nature of this supposition in the most industrialized country of the world system white middle class americans are dying from self inflicted causes so to speak alcoholism drugs has become the number one killer amongst white middle aged and once middle class americans this was a demography that used to be rather content and sufficiently immune from self pity and hopelessness that routinely afflict other members of the us society for a start the existing economic system that encourages the culture of increased consumption is at best blind if not worse in addition in our economic system consumption was not planned to be commensurate with the availability of resources we should be reminded time and again all life forms are critical to the maintenance of our ecosystem massive disruptions to our ecosystem which has been going on for at least two hundred years is bound to have consequences from which our flimsy species might not be able to escape intact instead of working to increase our chance of survival the prevailing economic order doubles down on its destructive programs it is not the tired ideology of growth but rather de growth humanity must be pursuing superficial discourses that overwhelm our so called institutions of higher learning are making things worse these once centers of enlightenments are massively producing unthinking drones that are programmed mainly to serve the existing economic order originality and inquisitiveness are frowned upon in these mills of institutions independent thinkers have to take leave of absence for good to engage in real world problems that require clear thinking additionally media and other organs of indoctrination pervade all aspects of social existence and hardly leave sufficient room for fresh reflections outside of establishment sanctioned narrative boxes new paradigms that are in accordance with the propagation of life and not the destruction of it in all its forms must soon be forged by all concerned citizens of our planet to think the establishment will introduce a holistic ideology that respects life life support systems is at best naïve if not suicidal see cook s article next column and others on page 48 49 the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum noam chomsky it should be a natural relief to step back inside natural limits limits have forms sounds and scents we can touch them taste them they should feel like home we ll be prodigals shuffling homeward from a wild fossil fuelled adventure to finally open the familiar garden gate patrick noble good day

the holiday season is upon us meaning it s time to reflect on another pandemic year and raise our glasses to celebrate the big and small joys that have kept us going drinking has been a big part of winter holiday celebrations for nearly thousands of years it s been around for a long time and since the beginning of time there have also been people who have not been able to use alcohol in moderation says dr anna lembke a psychiatrist at stanford university and the author of dopamine nation finding balance in the age of abundance lembke and other experts say most people who drink alcohol over the next few weeks with family at office parties on new year s eve will be just fine but they also point out that this can be a uniquely risky time of year for some alcohol consumers if you think alcohol is problematic for you or want to avoid drinking too much during the holidays or just aren t the biggest drinker here are some strategies for navigating end of year celebrations remember the holidays can be a slippery slope our experts generally agree that risky and potentially problematic drinking increases this time of year sometimes with long term health consequences around thanksgiving i always gave myself this excuse that it was the holidays and i d always say this is the time of year this is when everybody s drinking says kim kearns a stay at home mom in massachusetts who writes about her recovery from alcohol use disorder alcohol is tangled up in many holiday rituals we love but the shorter days the colder weather and overwhelming social calendars can also leave some of us feeling more vulnerable or if you re spending the end of year away from loved ones you may be tempted to stock up on alcohol holidays are a time of great expectations which can be when things don t go according to how we envision they should go says lembke and although we can love our families and friends getting together can be stressful so if you re feeling the holiday blues remind yourself that with the joy and warmth of the season comes an increased temptation to drink more as a way to cope with social anxieties keep track of how much you drink to keep from slipping into risky behavior experts say it s a good idea to keep an eye on your alcohol consumption not just on one given night or at a single party but over the course of each week according to lembke a safe and realistic drinking limit to keep in mind is three drinks in a day and seven drinks in a week for women for men it s more four drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week the centers for disease control and prevention recommends even less for a healthier lifestyle one drink or less in a day and seven drinks in a week for women and two drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week for men this all of course varies for every person quantity and frequency matter lembke says we measure a standard drink as either one 12 ounce one 5 ounce glass of wine or 1 to 1 ½ ounce of hard liquor and remember drinking even less alcohol or abstaining altogether is widely considered the healthiest option be ready to resist the pressure to drink another challenge experts say we should be prepared for are steady nudges from our loved ones to keep drinking past our healthy limits i felt a huge amount of fear in facing the social scene and all my friends says kim kearns who has given up alcohol altogether dr tyler oesterle who is the medical director at the mayo clinic s fountain center says this unaddressed pressure to drink can result in awkward conversations and even conflict among loved ones one strategy oesterle offers is having a scripted response in mind so when your favorite aunt offers you a glass of wine and you ve decided not to have wine that evening have something prepared your response can be as simples as no thank you i m not drinking tonight or i m good i ve been drinking too much lately or if you want to avoid the where s your drink question altogether you can also carry around a cup of a non alcoholic beverage like soda seltzer or even water you can always opt out it isn t easy to say no to loved ones and stay home during the holidays but experts say another important strategy for healthy drinking particularly for those who prefer abstinence is not going to that party at all keeping yourself in a safe place is the priority says david dorschu who heads recovery centers of america an addiction treatment program in new jersey you can instead make plans that don t involve alcohol like watching a movie or grabbing coffee with a friend if being social still sounds appealing kim kearns says she went into this year s holiday season with a plan that includes stepping away from gatherings when they become overwhelming i go for a walk i write i take breaks for myself to do the things that help me relax remember you don t owe anyone a drink and it s okay to turn down that invite and make time for yourself support those who want to drink less even if you don t struggle with alcohol you can support those that want to drink less or the non drinkers in your life this season when it comes to holiday parties make sure drinking feels like a choice and not an obligation try to make everyone feel welcome even if they re only drinking a little or abstaining altogether whether that be a company holiday party or a family function you have to have options for folks that are non alcoholic that s number one says dorschu number two you re creating an atmosphere where people feel comfortable to decline and say no thank you oesterle says it helps for hosts to let go of gestures of hospitality can i get you a drink want another beer that once seemed warm and inviting but can pressure guests to grab an unwanted drink there can even be a fun side to downsizing alcohol consumption during the holidays lembke says some hosts are offering fancy celebratory drinks that aren t alcoholic it s something to look forward to she says they want to find ways to reward themselves and celebrate without having an alcoholic drink a version of this story originally aired on npr s all things considered we d love to hear from you leave us a voicemail at 202

india s decisions to offer covid 19 vaccines to adolescents aged between 15 and 18 years and boosters to healthcare workers and people 60 years or older who have co morbidities are precautionary moves without adequate scientific evidence yet to back them some experts said on sunday prime minister narendra modi s announcement of the decisions to be implemented from january came a day after health officials said india was still assessing scientific evidence for children s immunisation and boosters advertisement the announcements have evoked widespread applause from sections of the medical community that had urged the government to introduce vaccines for children and boosters for vulnerable adults amid fears of omicron driven surges the indian medical association the country s largest body of doctors on sunday said the boosters would help protect healthcare workers ahead of an anticipated covid 19 wave and that the vaccines for children would add safety as schools open but three vaccine policy makers had told the telegraph in the past few days that india was not ready yet for decisions on boosters despite ample vaccine stocks this is because of inadequate data to assess the duration of vaccine effectiveness and therefore uncertainty about the possible public health gains from boosters a decision on boosters will be taken based on scientific evidence and our situation and circumstances said a senior expert guiding the government s vaccination policy for this there is a continuing review of studies and data related specifically to vaccines that have been administered in india at the union health ministry s briefing on friday 30 hours before modi s saturday night announcements top health officials had asserted that india was still assessing scientific evidence for lowering the age for vaccines and for boosters health secretary rajesh bhushan had said that india s decisions would be governed by science we re reviewing scientific data from across the world as well as from india balram bhargava director general of the indian council of medical research had said on friday he had added that the reviews would cover immune responses and duration of protection from the vaccines he had also outlined the decision making protocols the country s apex expert panel called the national technical advisory group on immunisation ntagi would make recommendations that would go to the national expert group on vaccine administration for covid 19 and then be accepted by the health ministry queries from this newspaper to health officials on whether saturday s announcements were made at a time technical experts were still assessing scientific evidence have not evoked replies two vaccine policy experts told this newspaper on sunday that the ntagi had until saturday recommended neither vaccines for those aged between 15 and 18 nor booster doses for the elderly this was primarily because of inadequate data from within the country to back either decision they said but a top public health expert said the lack of data or evidence need not hold back a no regrets policy if data are inadequate for a definitive assessment of risk the right thing would be to adopt a course that averts or reduces the risk through methods known to be safe and possibly beneficial said k srinath reddy president of the public health foundation of india new delhi reddy and other experts have argued in recent weeks that amid concerns about omicron driven surges india should adopt a strategy that seeks to accelerate full vaccination of all adults while simultaneously opening boosters to high risk groups such as healthcare workers and the elderly at risk of severe disease although early evidence suggests that omicron is associated with mild disease experts are concerned that rapid spread across india s large population might overwhelm hospital resources they say there is a need to protect at least the high risk groups from severe disease the likely benefits of boosters for at risk populations greatly outweigh the costs reddy said sanjay rai professor of community medicine at the all india institute of medical sciences new delhi has questioned the decision to provide vaccines to adolescents aged 15 to 18 years i am a great fan of pm modi for his selfless service to the nation and taking right decisions at right time but i am completely disappointed with his unscientific decision on children vaccination he tweeted early on sunday rai said there was no evidence yet for public health benefits arising out of vaccinating children a public health intervention such as vaccination has to have clear objectives either to prevent infections or to avert severe disease rai told this newspaper we know from observations worldwide that the current vaccines do not prevent omicron infections he said we also know that the incidence of severe disease is extremely low in this age group where is the evidence from india or elsewhere in the world that the risk benefit ratio favours vaccines for children in this age group multiple countries australia china japan the uk and the us among others have introduced boosters for adults or vulnerable population groups but vaccine experts say india s unusually large proportion of people already infected with covid 19 and its substantial vaccination coverage necessitates that decisions on boosters are taken with scientific evidence of public health gains the experts said that decisions on boosters need to be country specific and vaccine specific for many indians their first vaccine doses served as their boosters said jayaprakash muliyil a community medicine specialist and chair of the scientific advisory committee of the national institute of epidemiology chennai a nationwide survey by the indian council of medical research had suggested that by the time the country s second wave was receding in early july 67 per cent of the population had already been infected by covid 19 experts believe that over 80 per cent have been infected by now most people in india thus have acquired immunity against covid 19 first from the virus and then from the vaccines muliyil said and in those who had infections after vaccination the virus would have stimulated fresh immune responses while the rationale for boosters is based on observations of falling levels of vaccine induced anti viral antibodies in the blood experts say the body may continue to fight covid 19 through another arm of the immune system called memory t cells although we re seeing a reduction in neutralising antibodies almost all data show that t cells remain intact that is what we really require said abdi mahamud a physician and an infection control specialist at the world health organisation t cells the second pillar of an immune response can prevent severe disease by attacking infected human cells an immunologist said i can t think of any country in a situation like ours most people are already infected and over 60 per cent of our adults are fully vaccinated scientists are hoping that this hybrid immunity triggered by the combination of infections and vaccines will help protect people from severe disease health officials had said on friday that scientific experts were reviewing data on immune responses as well as on hybrid immunity ahead of any decision on boosters while covid 19 has also hit parts of europe and north america hard most people in those continents acquired immunity first from vaccines not from covid 19 infections experts are also wondering which vaccines india would

these companies could make a solid comeback in 2022 skyworks solutions swks 2 67 and chewy chwy 4 85 haven t been the best performers in 2021 as shares of both companies have dipped despite terrific growth in their businesses however these tech stocks could step on the gas in the new year thanks to secular growth opportunities in the industries they operate in let s look at the reasons why skyworks solutions and chewy could go on a bull run and leave this year s disappointing performance behind skyworks solutions skyworks solutions stock has dipped of late thanks to speculation that the demand for apple s nasdaq aapl iphone would take a hit in the holiday season reports suggest that long waiting times arising out of supply chain delays and production constraints have put off customers from upgrading to the latest iphone models that has weighed on skyworks as it supplies wireless chips for the iphone however there are indications that apple s supply chain may be improving morgan stanley analyst katy huberty recenlty increased her forecast for iphone shipments in the december ended quarter to 83 million units from the prior estimate of 80 million units saying that apple s supply chain problems have eased if that estimate is hit it would translate into a year over year increase of 3 million iphone units sold and that would be good for skyworks since it gets most of its revenue by selling chips to apple apple provided 59 of skyworks revenue last fiscal year so increased sales for apple would spell good things for skyworks a report cited by taiwanese publication digitimes points out that apple could sell over 300 million iphones in 2022 a huge increase over this year s estimated iphone shipments of 240 million units that may seem ambitious but it won t be surprising to see apple come close to that target as it is reportedly working on a 5g enabled iphone se that could be launched in 2022 some expect the 5g iphone se to add 30 million units to apple s shipments next year all this indicates that skyworks terrific momentum is here to stay the company s revenue in the recently concluded fiscal 2021 ended on oct 1 increased 52 year over year while adjusted earnings shot up 71 to 10 50 per share analysts estimate skyworks revenue will increase 11 4 in fiscal 2022 while earnings are expected to increase 10 to 11 56 per share the bright prospects of its largest client could help skyworks easily exceed those expectations and skyworks solutions is trading at just 18 times trailing earnings right now as compared to the s p 500 s multiple of 28 chewy chewy stock has been hammered in 2021 even though the company is successfully taking advantage of the increase in online sales of pet food and products the company s revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 24 year over year to 2 21 billion chewy s gross margin increased 90 basis points during the quarter to 26 4 investors however pressed the panic button after chewy s latest results were released on dec 9 as the company s loss of 0 08 per share was greater than wall street s anticipated 0 04 per share loss the company blamed supply chain problems cost inflation and labor shortages for the loss but investors should not miss the forest for the trees as chewy is well on track to benefit from a fast growing market the american pet products association estimates that spending on pet products exceeded 100 billion last year morgan stanley forecasts that pet spending could hit 275 billion by 2030 throw in the fact that 59 of spending on pet products is expected to happen online by 2025 as compared to 30 at the end of last year and it is evident that chewy is operating in a fast growing industry chewy commands a 41 share of online spending on pet products and has a growing customer base that is spending more money on its offerings chewy is positioned to sustain its impressive pace of growth in the long run and the stock is trading at just 2 67 times sales which means that it is available for a discount as compared to the s p 500 s multiple of 3 19 investors looking to add a potential growth stock to their portfolios should take a closer look at chewy

elissa nadworny host earlier this month the new york city council passed a ban on gas powered heat and stove appliances in newly constructed buildings the move makes it the largest city in the country to pass such a ban which will take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories while taller buildings have until 2027 to make the switch some say this could be the beginning of the end of gas powered appliances for home use a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions however critics warn that it may be too early to turn our backs on natural gas and that electrifying buildings only moves carbon emissions upstream to fossil fuel plants to talk more about this we ve invited russell unger to join us he co leads the building electrification initiative at rmi a nonprofit think tank that specializes in clean energy russell unger welcome russell unger thank you nadworny so first i wonder if you could talk about why the ban what s bad about gas powered heat and stove appliances unger math tells us that if we are going to decarbonize our cities our states our country we can t be burning fossil fuels in buildings anymore across the country buildings are responsible for about 40 of u s greenhouse gas emissions and in places like new york where there s not a lot of emissions from transport it s much higher in new york it s about 70 of the carbon emissions so the only way to address our carbon emissions in a big city like that is to stop burning fossil fuels in buildings the only way we re going to get to our goals across the country is to stop that as well nadworny and so tell me about your reaction to the new york city ban it sounds like it s going to make a difference unger it s a huge step i mean this is the largest jurisdiction in the country to make a move like this and it s new york city which is a bellwether for so many things whether it s other policies related to building and energy like requiring buildings to measure their energy performance every year it started outside new york but once new york did it a lot of cities followed suit and it s a bellwether generally for the whole country if you look at other things like stopping smoking inside bars it was only yesterday when that was required and new york went out on a limb it seemed and now you don t get to bars where there s allowed to smoke anymore it s also the first cold climate to enact a policy like that and that s really significant because electrifying a building is quite different in a cold climate than a warm climate like san francisco because we re electrifying heating nadworny well so i m curious because the ban is for new buildings and new york city of course has a lot of old buildings many of which have gas appliances so how does this play into kind of the impact a ban like this would have unger well there s a substantial impact just from the new buildings so according to our analysis we d be saving or new york city would be saving 2 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 that s about the equivalent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by 450 000 cars driving for a year but that s not going to be the limit of the impact so like right now if you live in new york city and you have a home and you call up the company that installed your furnace because you re having a problem and you ask them about a heat pump an electric heat pump no guarantee whether or not they re going to know what those are or recommend them once this law goes into effect every one of those companies will have had experience with heat pumps because they re going to be doing new installs so we ll see the contractors having direct experience with all electric equipment and we ll see the distributors having that in stock readily and you know we ll see cascade effects into the existing buildings as well nadworny so this is about electrification and i wonder why is electrification considered a better alternative to sources like natural gas unger when we re using fossil fuels in our homes and offices we re burning fossil fuels there s no way around it and fossil fuels release carbon emissions and other pollutants and we re contributing to climate change when we electrify we re pulling power off the grid the grid has a mixture of sources we also by using electricity can use types of heating like heat pumps that are you know have multiple folds of efficiency just the way they work by moving the heat so even today in most jurisdictions electrification is going to reduce carbon emissions and then looking forward to the targets that we have around the country that will become like a better and better carbon math nadworny now i ve always kind of been told or thought that gas stoves were better for cooking because they provided more even heating and i can imagine a lot of listeners kind of listening to this and saying is that true is that a misconception because this is a change to a way of life unger well i guess it depends how much you cook and whether you consider it a change to a way of life you know there are you know well known chefs that use induction i mean it is more common to use gas but that s also the result of you know 50 plus years of campaigning by the gas industry which has tested this and found you know what people don t care what powers their hot water heater they don t care what powers their heating system but for some reason they care what s going on in their stove and so that s why when you think about you know gas the kind of classic image is that burner on the stove and that s not an accident that is 50 plus years of very active investment into marketing by the gas industry nadworny yeah well given how serious climate change is do you think a ban like this goes far enough unger it s not going to be all that we you know everything we need to get there eventually we re going to have to change over as you noted equipment in existing buildings but this sets the table for it we re doing it in a place where easiest to do it which is the new buildings we re building a market by having kind of the hvac contractors the designers the distributors kind of poised and ready for this expand

elissa nadworny host earlier this month the new york city council passed a ban on gas powered heat and stove appliances in newly constructed buildings the move makes it the largest city in the country to pass such a ban which will take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories while taller buildings have until 2027 to make the switch some say this could be the beginning of the end of gas powered appliances for home use a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions however critics warn that it may be too early to turn our backs on natural gas and that electrifying buildings only moves carbon emissions upstream to fossil fuel plants to talk more about this we ve invited russell unger to join us he co leads the building electrification initiative at rmi a nonprofit think tank that specializes in clean energy russell unger welcome russell unger thank you nadworny so first i wonder if you could talk about why the ban what s bad about gas powered heat and stove appliances unger math tells us that if we are going to decarbonize our cities our states our country we can t be burning fossil fuels in buildings anymore across the country buildings are responsible for about 40 of u s greenhouse gas emissions and in places like new york where there s not a lot of emissions from transport it s much higher in new york it s about 70 of the carbon emissions so the only way to address our carbon emissions in a big city like that is to stop burning fossil fuels in buildings the only way we re going to get to our goals across the country is to stop that as well nadworny and so tell me about your reaction to the new york city ban it sounds like it s going to make a difference unger it s a huge step i mean this is the largest jurisdiction in the country to make a move like this and it s new york city which is a bellwether for so many things whether it s other policies related to building and energy like requiring buildings to measure their energy performance every year it started outside new york but once new york did it a lot of cities followed suit and it s a bellwether generally for the whole country if you look at other things like stopping smoking inside bars it was only yesterday when that was required and new york went out on a limb it seemed and now you don t get to bars where there s allowed to smoke anymore it s also the first cold climate to enact a policy like that and that s really significant because electrifying a building is quite different in a cold climate than a warm climate like san francisco because we re electrifying heating nadworny well so i m curious because the ban is for new buildings and new york city of course has a lot of old buildings many of which have gas appliances so how does this play into kind of the impact a ban like this would have unger well there s a substantial impact just from the new buildings so according to our analysis we d be saving or new york city would be saving 2 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 that s about the equivalent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by 450 000 cars driving for a year but that s not going to be the limit of the impact so like right now if you live in new york city and you have a home and you call up the company that installed your furnace because you re having a problem and you ask them about a heat pump an electric heat pump no guarantee whether or not they re going to know what those are or recommend them once this law goes into effect every one of those companies will have had experience with heat pumps because they re going to be doing new installs so we ll see the contractors having direct experience with all electric equipment and we ll see the distributors having that in stock readily and you know we ll see cascade effects into the existing buildings as well nadworny so this is about electrification and i wonder why is electrification considered a better alternative to sources like natural gas unger when we re using fossil fuels in our homes and offices we re burning fossil fuels there s no way around it and fossil fuels release carbon emissions and other pollutants and we re contributing to climate change when we electrify we re pulling power off the grid the grid has a mixture of sources we also by using electricity can use types of heating like heat pumps that are you know have multiple folds of efficiency just the way they work by moving the heat so even today in most jurisdictions electrification is going to reduce carbon emissions and then looking forward to the targets that we have around the country that will become like a better and better carbon math nadworny now i ve always kind of been told or thought that gas stoves were better for cooking because they provided more even heating and i can imagine a lot of listeners kind of listening to this and saying is that true is that a misconception because this is a change to a way of life unger well i guess it depends how much you cook and whether you consider it a change to a way of life you know there are you know well known chefs that use induction i mean it is more common to use gas but that s also the result of you know 50 plus years of campaigning by the gas industry which has tested this and found you know what people don t care what powers their hot water heater they don t care what powers their heating

elissa nadworny host earlier this month the new york city council passed a ban on gas powered heat and stove appliances in newly constructed buildings the move makes it the largest city in the country to pass such a ban which will take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories while taller buildings have until 2027 to make the switch some say this could be the beginning of the end of gas powered appliances for home use a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions however critics warn that it may be too early to turn our backs on natural gas and that electrifying buildings only moves carbon emissions upstream to fossil fuel plants to talk more about this we ve invited russell unger to join us he co leads the building electrification initiative at rmi a nonprofit think tank that specializes in clean energy russell unger welcome russell unger thank you nadworny so first i wonder if you could talk about why the ban what s bad about gas powered heat and stove appliances unger math tells us that if we are going to decarbonize our cities our states our country we can t be burning fossil fuels in buildings anymore across the country buildings are responsible for about 40 of u s greenhouse gas emissions and in places like new york where there s not a lot of emissions from transport it s much higher in new york it s about 70 of the carbon emissions so the only way to address our carbon emissions in a big city like that is to stop burning fossil fuels in buildings the only way we re going to get to our goals across the country is to stop that as well nadworny and so tell me about your reaction to the new york city ban it sounds like it s going to make a difference unger it s a huge step i mean this is the largest jurisdiction in the country to make a move like this and it s new york city which is a bellwether for so many things whether it s other policies related to building and energy like requiring buildings to measure their energy performance every year it started outside new york but once new york did it a lot of cities followed suit and it s a bellwether generally for the whole country if you look at other things like stopping smoking inside bars it was only yesterday when that was required and new york went out on a limb it seemed and now you don t get to bars where there s allowed to smoke anymore it s also the first cold climate to enact a policy like that and that s really significant because electrifying a building is quite different in a cold climate than a warm climate like san francisco because we re electrifying heating nadworny well so i m curious because the ban is for new buildings and new york city of course has a lot of old buildings many of which have gas appliances so how does this play into kind of the impact a ban like this would have unger well there s a substantial impact just from the new buildings so according to our analysis we d be saving or new york city would be saving 2 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 that s about the equivalent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by 450 000 cars driving for a year but that s not going to be the limit of the impact so like right now if you live in new york city and you have a home and you call up the company that installed your furnace because you re having a problem and you ask them about a heat pump an electric heat pump no guarantee whether or not they re going to know what those are or recommend them once this law goes into effect every one of those companies will have had experience with heat pumps because they re going to be doing new installs so we ll see the contractors having direct experience with all electric equipment and we ll see the distributors having that in stock readily and you know we ll see cascade effects into the existing buildings as well nadworny so this is about electrification and i wonder why is electrification considered a better alternative to sources like natural gas unger when we re using fossil fuels in our homes and offices we re burning fossil fuels there s no way around it and fossil fuels release carbon emissions and other pollutants and we re contributing to climate change when we electrify we re pulling power off the grid the grid has a mixture of sources we also by using electricity can use types of heating like heat pumps that are you know have multiple folds of efficiency just the way they work by moving the heat so even today in most jurisdictions electrification is going to reduce carbon emissions and then looking forward to the targets that we have around the country that will become like a better and better carbon math nadworny now i ve always kind of been told or thought that gas stoves were better for cooking because they provided more even heating and i can imagine a lot of listeners kind of listening to this and saying is that true is that a misconception because this is a change to a way of life unger well i guess it depends how much you cook and whether you consider it a change to a way of life you know there are you know well known chefs that use induction i mean it is more common to use gas but that s also the result of you know 50 plus years of campaigning by the gas industry which has tested this and found you know what people don t care what powers their hot water heater they don t care what powers their heating system but for some reason they care what s going on in their stove and so that s why when you think about you know gas the kind of classic image is that burner on the stove and that s not an accident that is 50 plus years of very active investment into marketing by the gas industry nadworny yeah well given how serious climate change is do you think a ban like this goes far enough unger it s not going to be all that we you know everything we need to get there eventually we re going to have to change over as you noted equipment in existing buildings but this sets the table for it we re doing it in a place where easiest to do it which is the new buildings we re building a market by having kind of the hvac contractors the designers the distributors kind of poised and ready for this expand

one day in 1994 a pensioner named aurea thornycroft noticed mysterious insects chomping through the walls of her beach side bungalow on the hills above saunton sands near barnstaple in devon when the local pest controller peeled away the wallpaper inside her conservatory he found it teeming with strange white ant like creatures that he d never seen before each measured roughly half a centimetre in length they were found in two timber frame walls heated by pipes the man later recalled the timber was damp and the combination of heat and moisture has produced the perfect micro climate for the insects they have been there for years but it was not until several months later that it emerged mrs thornycroft s chalet style holiday residence was the scene of a bona fide ecological emergency britain s first ever subterranean termite infestation homeowners across america and europe spend billions each year trying to put right the damage caused by the small but voracious creepy crawlies who feast on the timber in buildings no one knew where the creatures had come from though initial speculation later debunked was that they d arrived via a pot plant imported from the canary islands however their usual habitat extends across warm parts of the globe where they are found in a range of habitats including forests and grassland and live in vast colonies existing by devouring cellulose particularly from fallen wood in the wild termites play a crucial role as soil engineers helping to prop up the food chain but when they rub up against mankind or more specifically the villages towns and cities we inhabit they can transform into a terrifying pest known colloquially as the terrorists of the insect world homeowners across america and europe spend billions each year trying to put right the damage caused by the small but voracious creepy crawlies who feast on the timber in buildings in places such as paris and madrid they have in recent decades wreaked havoc removing structurally crucial wooden beams and leaving entire floors of historic properties in danger of collapse the real problem as experts examining mrs thornycroft s bungalow soon realised is that once properly established a subterranean termite population is almost impossible to eradicate no matter how many millions yes millions you succeed in killing a single colony can reach seven metres underground across an area the size of two swimming pools stock image a single colony can reach seven metres underground across an area the size of two swimming pools and even if pest controllers think they ve wiped out the lot should they leave behind just a tiny population sufficient to fill half a small matchbox the tenacious creatures will not just return but swiftly spread far and wide so in a bid to save not just north devon but the entire nation from this apocalyptic home crushing scenario in 1998 the government launched a bold scheme called the uk termite eradication programme its stated aim to use state of the art techniques to contain and then remove these alien invaders from our green and pleasant land so began a 23 year saga involving dozens of scientists and many hundreds of thousands of pounds and last week the grizzled team behind it finally declared victory no termites have been found in saunton for ten years meaning britain is once again officially termite free we are confident that eradication has been successful says dr ed suttie who has run the project since 2003 nobody has ever done this anywhere in the world it s a complete first the result is not just a triumph for british innovation but also for the bulldog spirit of dr suttie and his pioneering team who overcame setbacks and false dawns that would have destroyed less bloody minded bug busters in places such as paris and madrid they have in recent decades wreaked havoc removing structurally crucial wooden beams and leaving entire floors of historic properties in danger of collapse perhaps the most soul crushing was in 2009 when a routine six monthly inspection revealed a handful of termites under a paving slab on mrs thornycroft s patio it was the first time in eight years that they d been spotted and the discovery shattered the cautious optimism of the team who were beginning to believe that the colony had been destroyed when we arrived the soil was alive with the things recalls dr suttie if you dug your hands in they were everywhere we were quite quickly able to reduce the numbers substantially but achieving complete removal has been a labour of love the tenacity of the termites revolves largely around their lifestyle since this particular species the reticulitermes grassei lives deep underground making it impossible to control them by simply dousing an infected area with pesticide or even destroying a building they have infested someone initially asked why can t you just burn the house down explains dr suttie well you could do that but the things would just end up coming back again so in a bid to save not just north devon but the entire nation from this apocalyptic home crushing scenario in 1998 the government launched a bold scheme called the uk termite eradication programme another potential plan to remove thousands of tonnes of topsoil and dump it in the sea was also discounted this time due to impracticality instead the team designed a novel scheme that revolved around a chemical called hexaflumuron a so called insect growth regulator which prevents young termites from maturing if they could persuade foraging insects to carry the stuff back to the colony then its reproductive cycle would quickly be destroyed wooden bait stakes were buried at some 695 sites within a 500 metre radius of mrs thornycroft s bungalow the ones that were eaten were then replaced with plastic tubes containing hexaflumuron but things did not initially go entirely according to plan in a development that sparked headlines about gourmet termites it initially emerged that the insects disliked the taste of the chemical so to persuade them to tuck in dr suttie s team doused the bait sticks in a type of fungus extract that gives off a pheromone termites find particularly attractive coincidentally the same pheromone is found in the blue ink used in ballpoint pens at times the experience was also rather traumatic for both mrs thornycroft who is now in her late 90s and the residents of a neighbouring property which was also found to be infested at the start of the project they were asked to stay away for at least three months and banned from mowing their lawns in case it stopped the insects taking the bait until last month the properties were the subject of a restriction of movement order issued by the forestry commission which banned the removal of soil or wood from the area so began a 23 year saga involving dozens of scientists and many hundreds of thousands of pounds after the 2009 setback with her property effectively condemned due to structural damage mrs thornycroft applied for permission to demolish it and start again but planning permission was denied due to the risk of spreading any remaining insects following an intervention from the then communities secretary eric pickles who cited the potential catastrophic economic environmental and social consequences of such a development mrs thornycroft was however allowed to build a new annexe in the grounds over time thankfully the tide finally began to turn on britain s only termite colony and six monthly inspections from 2011 onwards drew a blank with the things now officially extinct in the uk attention has turned to ensuring the insects never become established here again to that end 19 000 of government funding was announced last week it will be used in part to create an instruction manual to guide authorities in how to eradicate any future bugs that might turn up and last week the grizzled team behind it finally declared victory no termites have been found in saunton for ten years meaning britain is once again officially termite free after all the chances of such a development are high dna analysis has shown saunton s termites are likely to have originally hailed from the south of france suggesting they were probably imported on timber packaging dr robert verkerk who headed the scientific team since the start believes the only reason termite colonies are not yet established in the south east where most of our trade arrives in britain is that they dislike the clay soils in devon the soil is much sandier and the weather is also milder making it more suitable he says it s definitely likely to happen again i think because of human vectoring in other words the way we transport things around the world if you look at how they have spread through europe they follow the canal and road networks in many ways we ve so far been very lucky with travel and trade increasing with each passing year we must therefore hope that future termite arrivals prove equally powerless in the face of hexaflumuron if not then for britain s homeowners of the future it ll be what you might call a bug s life

of efficiency just the way they work by moving the heat so even today in most jurisdictions electrification is going to reduce carbon emissions and then looking forward to the targets that we have around the country that will become like a better and better carbon math nadworny now i ve always kind of been told or thought that gas stoves were better for cooking because they provided more even heating and i can imagine a lot of listeners kind of listening to this and saying is that true is that a misconception because this is a change to a way of life unger well i guess it depends how much you cook and whether you consider it a change to a way of life you know there are you know well known chefs that use induction i mean it is more common to use gas but that s also the result of you know 50 plus years of campaigning by the gas industry which has tested this and found you know what people don t care what powers their hot water heater they don t care what powers their heating system but for some reason they care what s going on in their stove and so that s why when you think about you know gas the kind of classic image is that burner on the stove and that s not an accident that is 50 plus years of very active investment into marketing by the gas industry nadworny yeah well given how serious climate change is do you think a ban like this goes far enough unger it s not going to be all that we you know everything we need to get there eventually we re going to have to change over as you noted equipment in existing buildings but this sets the table for it we re doing it in a place where easiest to do it which is the new buildings we re building a market by having kind of the hvac contractors the designers the distributors kind of poised and ready for this expand so it s the place to start nadworny that was russell unger of the building electrification initiative at rmi that s a think tank that focuses on sustainability thanks so much for being here unger

elissa nadworny host earlier this month the new york city council passed a ban on gas powered heat and stove appliances in newly constructed buildings the move makes it the largest city in the country to pass such a ban which will take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories while taller buildings have until 2027 to make the switch some say this could be the beginning of the end of gas powered appliances for home use a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions however critics warn that it may be too early to turn our backs on natural gas and that electrifying buildings only moves carbon emissions upstream to fossil fuel plants to talk more about this we ve invited russell unger to join us he co leads the building electrification initiative at rmi a nonprofit think tank that specializes in clean energy russell unger welcome russell unger thank you nadworny so first i wonder if you could talk about why the ban what s bad about gas powered heat and stove appliances unger math tells us that if we are going to decarbonize our cities our states our country we can t be burning fossil fuels in buildings anymore across the country buildings are responsible for about 40 of u s greenhouse gas emissions and in places like new york where there s not a lot of emissions from transport it s much higher in new york it s about 70 of the carbon emissions so the only way to address our carbon emissions in a big city like that is to stop burning fossil fuels in buildings the only way we re going to get to our goals across the country is to stop that as well nadworny and so tell me about your reaction to the new york city ban it sounds like it s going to make a difference unger it s a huge step i mean this is the largest jurisdiction in the country to make a move like this and it s new york city which is a bellwether for so many things whether it s other policies related to building and energy like requiring buildings to measure their energy performance every year it started outside new york but once new york did it a lot of cities followed suit and it s a bellwether generally for the whole country if you look at other things like stopping smoking inside bars it was only yesterday when that was required and new york went out on a limb it seemed and now you don t get to bars where there s allowed to smoke anymore it s also the first cold climate to enact a policy like that and that s really significant because electrifying a building is quite different in a cold climate than a warm climate like san francisco because we re electrifying heating nadworny well so i m curious because the ban is for new buildings and new york city of course has a lot of old buildings many of which have gas appliances so how does this play into kind of the impact a ban like this would have unger well there s a substantial impact just from the new buildings so according to our analysis we d be saving or new york city would be saving 2 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 that s about the equivalent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by 450 000 cars driving for a year but that s not going to be the limit of the impact so like right now if you live in new york city and you have a home and you call up the company that installed your furnace because you re having a problem and you ask them about a heat pump an electric heat pump no guarantee whether or not they re going to know what those are or recommend them once this law goes into effect every one of those companies will have had experience with heat pumps because they re going to be doing new installs so we ll see the contractors having direct experience with all electric equipment and we ll see the distributors having that in stock readily and you know we ll see cascade effects into the existing buildings as well nadworny so this is about electrification and i wonder why is electrification considered a better alternative to sources like natural gas unger when we re using fossil fuels in our homes and offices we re burning fossil fuels there s no way around it and fossil fuels release carbon emissions and other pollutants and we re contributing to climate change when we electrify we re pulling power off the grid the grid has a mixture of sources we also by using electricity can use types of heating like heat pumps that are you know have multiple folds

when adam smith was asked whether britain s loss of its colonies in america in the 18th century marked the end of britain as a power he replied with his now famous quote there is a great deal of ruin in a nation what he meant was that it takes a lot certainly more than a single event to destroy a nation human ingenuity cultural dynamism accumulated knowledge and the mere presence of humans means that countries can always give themselves a second chance even after seemingly catastrophic events and smith was right whatever one might think of the propriety of the enterprise britain did go on to build an even bigger empire spanning the globe after the loss of its american colonies this is not an unusual story that countries can pick themselves off the floor after a terrible disaster is not as uncommon as one might think i can never stop thinking about the fact that japan had two mighty atomic bombs dropped on two of its largest cities within three days of each other in august 1945 and yet less than 20 years later it was hosting the olympics in 1964 in the depths of despair humans are often forced to dream up new ideas that help to seed a new future consider some of the companies that came out of america s great depression 7 eleven revlon publix and of course disney all still going strong today some companies which were born well before the depression came up with ideas that helped them weather the storm of the crisis it was during the depression that marvin bower met james mckinsey and persuaded him to start what we now know as management consulting as exemplified by mckinsey in search of new ways to reach hard pressed consumers and convince them to buy its products procter gamble started sponsoring so many radio programmes that a whole new genre soap operas was born nigeria has gone through economic despair in the last six years there is a certain level of economic suffering that is permanent in nigeria certainly in my more than four decades alive but the last few years have been particularly bad with frightening levels of unemployment back to back to economic recessions crushing inflation and a currency that loses every fight it gets into with the dollar add leadership that cannot inspire even cheap hope in anyone and it will take the starriest eyed optimist to make the case for believing in nigeria at this point in time nevertheless allow me to be that guy for a brief moment from a personal point of view i have never made more investments in nigeria than i have in the last couple of years some of it is pure coincidence while some of it is just the fear of missing out on what i see a number of my friends and acquaintances doing but a lot of it is also because i believe that something is happening right now in spite of the conditions of the country and its leadership that might be described as the seeds of the future being sown it is difficult to see maybe because it doesn t exist and the light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train but i imagine it felt the same in the depths of despair in the countries described earlier a phrase i increasingly hear from a number of my friends who are very invested in nigeria is people dey build that is they are daily seeing new companies and ideas being launched to solve various problems in the nigerian economy i am seeing them too there is for sure an enthusiasm and the accompanying possibilities for people to turn their ideas into real businesses nigeria is a poor country so by definition capital will always be scarce but you only need to speak someone who has been around for 10 years or more to know that while raising money remains difficult it is undoubtedly a lot easier in today s nigeria than the one of a few years ago people nigerians and non nigerians are taking bets on the future by putting their money where their mouth is you only need to scan the tech news for a couple of days to see the evidence of this and it s not just tech start ups the last time i put money in nigerian stocks i got burnt so badly i swore never to touch them again over a decade ago there were a number of primary offers and private placements that nigerians rushed into many turned out to be scams or just bad investments and such offers simply dried up over the years i did not even think it was possible for an investment to go down to zero but that is exactly what happened to my investments in nigerian stocks and primary offers there are however many things i have sworn never to do only to end up eating my words i vowed never to wear crocs but i now find myself a witness bearer of their comfort recently i put my money into the new mtn offer and convinced my wife to do the same mtn is no start up given how nigeria s demographics skew very young it might not be an exaggeration to say that it is older than the majority of nigerians alive in the country today but after several near death experiences at the hands of nigerian regulators the company is alive and dominant as nigeria s number one telecommunications outfit it has found a second wind with a new mobile money license that will surely turn many more millions of nigerians into active participants in the country s economy and connect them with the dozens of start ups building things for them because i find myself cautiously optimistic about nigeria s economic future that the seeds for a better tomorrow are being planted today i am also cautiously optimistic on mtn s future and the role it will play in the economy once the current despair is some way behind us people dey build and the shovels they will need to do all that building will come from companies like mtn i also like how the offer has been structured to reward holding the shares for the long term god knows nigeria can do with more people taking a long term view of the country and its prospects the present is depressing enough and if we cannot dare to dream that tomorrow might be better then we might as well pack it in as our job here is done if like me you have you been burnt in the past and swore never again i urge you to take a bet on the future of the country beyond the troubles and bleakness of today in whatever way you can it is hard to make the case for a country with half of it practically at war with inflation running its own race and poverty untrammelled and leadership that cannot bring itself to inspire the country with new ideas but if you can look away from all that for a moment to see what is happening today that might be useful tomorrow then you might be confident enough to take that bet on the country after all there is indeed a great deal of ruin in a nation fawehinmi is a nigerian accountant and investment banker based in the united kingdom and writes publicly on the nigerian

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox today we look back on the year in politics and forward to the midterm election now less than 325 days away because 2021 was so much fun why not live it again please our plague year began in fittingly grim fashion with pro trump insurrectionists overrunning the u s capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election and bring down democracy it was the culmination of an unprecedented effort to thwart the will of voters and subvert america s 244 year old rule of law to recap after joe biden s clear cut victory attorneys for president trump clogged the courts with groundless lawsuits seeking to reverse the election result channeling his inner mob boss trump tried to muscle georgia s secretary of state into finding enough ballots for him to carry the state he pressured vice president mike pence to ignore the constitution and declare trump s reelection by decree when those efforts failed the president s followers turned to violence ugh what came next however was a heroic moment of resolve that will forever shine on the pages of our nation s history huh shocked at the president s contemptible and brazenly autocratic conduct fellow republicans set aside partisanship fiercely condemned trump and joined democrats in voting to impeach the president leaders of the gop then drummed trump out of their party acting to ensure that no president ever again contemplates such an unseemly assault on the country s foundational principles wait what ha ha just wanted to see if you were paying attention actually after an initial short lived wave of condemnation the overwhelming majority of republicans in congress bowed before trump refused to acknowledge biden s victory and allowed the president to perpetuate his dangerous lies about election fraud many gop leaders continue to echo those false claims and act as though the assault on the capitol never happened or is best forgotten and unlike former presidents of the recent past trump remains a commanding force within his party he is at this moment the front runner for the 2024 republican nomination surely the gop will pay a price in 2022 don t be too sure shocking as the assault on the capitol was the rampage has become just another source of partisan division to use a stock market analogy you could say the events are already priced into the midterm election those most outraged by the rioters execrable actions were probably anti trump and thus anti gop to begin with few of those inclined to vote republican are likely to change their minds because of what happened on jan 6 besides if you believe the polling and focus groups most voters have other things on their minds like inflation supply chain problems and the never ending restrictions and upheaval the pandemic has imposed on our daily lives in virginia a state biden carried by 10 percentage points the democratic candidate for governor terry mcauliffe talked nonstop about trump the president campaigned there and suggested republican glenn youngkin was trump with a smile and a fleece vest still youngkin prevailed managing the considerable feat of distancing himself from the ex president without alienating too many of his supporters a bad omen for democrats it would appear so privately strategists say the only question is whether 2022 will be merely a bad year for their party or an epically awful one remind me what s at stake in 2022 control of the house the senate and for all intents the hopes for biden s presidency in the last half of his term what does history tell us that it s exceedingly likely republicans will be in charge of congress starting in january 2023 the party controlling the presidency almost always loses house seats in the midterm election since world war ii the average is 26 seats republican need to gain just five to seize the majority the gop could gain that number just from the congressional districts lines redrawn after the 2020 census and the senate republicans need to gain just a single seat the average loss for the party in the white house is four seats so bye bye democratic majority not necessarily to borrow another phrase from the investment world past performance is no guarantee of future results republicans have blown prime opportunities before in 2010 and 2014 landslide gop years the party nominated a fun house collection of senate candidates who proved either too extreme or too gaffe prone to win several uber trumpy candidates could prove similarly problematic in a general election especially if their fealty to the former president puts his reprehensible behavior front and center part of the reason trump s actions no longer matter as much politically is because he s no longer in the news every moment of every day when is the last time anyone you know covfefed it s been a while exactly what else is there to watch there are 36 gubernatorial contests including one in california though democrat gavin newsom doesn t seem to face much threat after easily beating back an attempted recall there are also several important races around the country for secretary of state normally the position is a campaign afterthought but trump sympathizers are seeking a foothold that would put them in charge of elections in several presidential battlegrounds including arizona michigan nevada and georgia should someone like qanon adherent mark finchem win the arizona lawmaker was just outside the capitol on jan 6 and tweeted his support for rioters the results of the next presidential election could be overturned without a seditious horde turning to violence scary stuff it is and with that happy christmas to all and to all a good night
elissa nadworny host earlier this month the new york city council passed a ban on gas powered heat and stove appliances in newly constructed buildings the move makes it the largest city in the country to pass such a ban which will take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories while taller buildings have until 2027 to make the switch some say this could be the beginning of the end of gas powered appliances for home use a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions however critics warn that it may be too early to turn our backs on natural gas and that electrifying buildings only moves carbon emissions upstream to fossil fuel plants to talk more about this we ve invited russell unger to join us he co leads the building electrification initiative at rmi a nonprofit think tank that specializes in clean energy russell unger welcome russell unger thank you nadworny so first i wonder if you could talk about why the ban what s bad about gas powered heat and stove appliances unger math tells us that if we are going to decarbonize our cities our states our country we can t be burning fossil fuels in buildings anymore across the country buildings are responsible for about 40 of u s greenhouse gas emissions and in places like new york where there s not a lot of emissions from transport it s much higher in new york it s about 70 of the carbon emissions so the only way to address our carbon emissions in a big city like that is to stop burning fossil fuels in buildings the only way we re going to get to our goals across the country is to stop that as well nadworny and so tell me about your reaction to the new york city ban it sounds like it s going to make a difference unger it s a huge step i mean this is the largest jurisdiction in the country to make a move like this and it s new york city which is a bellwether for so many things whether it s other policies related to building and energy like requiring buildings to measure their energy performance every year it started outside new york but once new york did it a lot of cities followed suit and it s a bellwether generally for the whole country if you look at other things like stopping smoking inside bars it was only yesterday when that was required and new york went out on a limb it seemed and now you don t get to bars where there s allowed to smoke anymore it s also the first cold climate to enact a policy like that and that s really significant because electrifying a building is quite different in a cold climate than a warm climate like san francisco because we re electrifying heating nadworny well so i m curious because the ban is for new buildings and new york city of course has a lot of old buildings many of which have gas appliances so how does this play into kind of the impact a ban like this would have unger well there s a substantial impact just from the new buildings so according to our analysis we d be saving or new york city would be saving 2 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 that s about the equivalent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by 450 000 cars driving for a year but that s not going to be the limit of the impact so like right now if you live in new york city and you have a home and you call up the company that installed your furnace because you re having a problem and you ask them about a heat pump an electric heat pump no guarantee whether or not they re going to know what those are or recommend them once this law goes into effect every one of those companies will have had experience with heat pumps because they re going to be doing new installs so we ll see the contractors having direct experience with all electric equipment and we ll see the distributors having that in stock readily and you know we ll see cascade effects into the existing buildings as well nadworny so this is about electrification and i wonder why is electrification considered a better alternative to sources like natural gas unger when we re using fossil fuels in our homes and offices we re burning fossil fuels there s no way around it and fossil fuels release carbon emissions and other pollutants and we re contributing to climate change when we electrify we re pulling power off the grid the grid has a mixture of sources we also by using electricity can use types of heating like heat pumps that are you know have multiple folds of efficiency just the way they work by moving the heat so even today in most jurisdictions electrification is going to reduce carbon emissions and then looking forward to the targets that we have around the country that will become like a better and better carbon math nadworny now i ve always kind of been told or thought that gas stoves were better for cooking because they provided more even heating and i can imagine a lot of listeners kind of listening to this and saying is that true is that a misconception because this is a change to a way of life unger well i guess it depends how much you cook and whether you consider it a change to a way of life you know there are you know well known chefs that use induction i mean it is more common to use gas but that s also the result of you know 50 plus years of campaigning by the gas industry which has tested this and found you know what people don t care what powers their hot water heater they don t care what powers their heating system but for some reason they care what s going on in their stove and so that s why when you think about you know gas the kind of classic image is that burner on the stove and that s not an accident that is 50 plus years of very active investment into marketing by the gas industry nadworny yeah well given how serious climate change is do you think a ban like this goes far enough unger it s not going to be all that we you know everything we need to get there eventually we re going to have to change over as you noted equipment in existing buildings but this sets the table for it we re doing it in a place where easiest to do it which is the new buildings we re building a market by having kind of the hvac contractors the designers the distributors kind of poised and ready for this expand so it s the place to start nadworny that was russell unger of the building electrification initiative at rmi that s a think tank that focuses on sustainability thanks so much for being here unger

the ongoing covid 19 pandemic has brought about changes to the macroeconomic system of each country and also that of the globe inflationary pressure is showing signs of abating while deflation is being seen in parts of the world where money supplies are tightening low interest rates even negative rates in some places are beginning to spread volatility of economic growth has decreased deficits and debt have become long term issues government bond markets have become a major focus within fiscal and monetary policies amid calls for de globalization countries are slowly weakening transnational economic ties all these changes are posing challenges to traditional macroeconomic theories and the expert analyses written about global economic and trade issues this article will mainly discuss issues of global debt china s debt and employment global debt since the 2000s huge amounts of debt have accumulated in advanced economies such as the united states some of the reasons for this are domestic such as long term economic downturns and governments of these countries needing to continuously stimulate the economy through fiscal deficits leading to ever higher debts external factors include a decline in the competitiveness of their own economies resulting in frequent and ballooning current account deficits being in control of the issuance of global reserve currencies these countries can use their own currencies to not only fund trade deficits but also their debts such a mechanism has closely linked global debt and international finance with domestic debt financial operations and even macroeconomic policies of these countries based on this mechanism global debt this century has not seen ups and downs but has instead been peaking all the time and finally resulted in a flood of global liquidity by the end of the second quarter total global debt reached 296 trillion equivalent to 355 percent of global gdp if calculated on the basis of a 7 5 billion world population per capita debt is as high as 39 400 such a high debt intensity fully shows that the efficiency of financial services to the real economy is declining globally how to deal with such huge debt is a big problem to be tackled in the post covid era in october the fed s interest rate meeting pointed out that it will reduce debt purchases monthly starting in november and will stop the practice completely in the first half of 2022 if balance sheet reduction that is the restoration of monetary policy to a state of normalcy is a process stopping debt purchases is only the first step first it will stop increasing its scale as for reducing total debt volume and accompanying interest rate adjustments no arrangements have been made yet however since volume liquidity and price interest rates are linked under the market economy it can be predicted that since debt reduction actions have taken place interest rates will change sooner or later in this regard china must have countermeasures in place if the fed expands its balance sheet the overall impact will not be very negative for the rest of the world because the implementation of the fed s expansionary policy will increase the outflow of capital to other countries which in turn will lead to lower interest rates currency appreciation and firmed up asset prices although it may be accompanied by imported inflation because the availability and cost of funds will be improved the overall impact will be beneficial especially for the vast number of developing countries on the contrary if the fed shrinks its balance sheet a large amount of funds will flow back to the us leading to falling asset prices in other countries the overall result will increase development costs and slow the development pace of these countries the issues above in my opinion are what the country needs to prepare for currently china s debt in the context of global debt overflow china s debt has been expanding as well with leverage rising in tandem thanks to the structural reform moves in the nation in the years prior to the covid 19 outbreak the rising tide of high leverage has been curbed the year 2020 pushed fiscal deficit and loans with the outbreak of covid 19 which led to rises in debt and leverage however the situation has reversed as the gearing ratio of the nonfinancial sector has been declining and the decline has been significant in the first three quarters the leverage issue in my opinion should be a neutral word rather than something we always consider to be harmful to the sound development of the economy this is especially true when the decline in leverage levels in nonfinancial sectors in the first three quarters was due to weak investment sentiment among enterprises this is not the image we want to portray or see and when it comes to the financial sector itself the leverage ratio of the sector over the period whether it is on the debt side or the asset side is falling steeply this situation obviously indicates that financial risk has weakened but also shows that the country s monetary policy has been tight in general since the beginning of this year going further to the local level the problem of mutual spillover between fiscal and financial risk is becoming more and more serious in recent years we have strictly prohibited local governments from borrowing from financial institutions and have gradually replaced a large amount of direct borrowings in the past through the issuance of government bonds this not only regulates the government s lending behavior but also reduces their borrowing costs however what s happening is that local governments do make up for their expenditure gaps by issuing bonds most of the bonds issued are mainly purchased and held by commercial banks the supplier is still a financial institution and the nature of the whole process has not changed how to establish an effective local government deficit financing mechanism and debt restraint mechanism remains a significant task new jobs a few years ago employment officially became a priority in setting out the country s macroeconomic policies which shows the modernization of the macroeconomic control mechanism and national governance system according to data on employment from the national development and reform commission in the first three quarters 10 45 million new jobs were created nationwide achieving 95 percent of the annual target in september the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas nationwide was 4 9 percent a decrease of 0 2 percentage points from the previous month the surveyed unemployment rate in 31 major cities and towns was 5 percent at the end of the third quarter the total number of rural migrant workers was 183 03 million a year on year increase of 2 percent with the scale basically returned to the same level prior to the covid 19 outbreak given that china has not yet fully recovered from covid 19 shocks the situation fully demonstrates the superiority of its system however we also need to underline three aspects in this regard first the pressure on youth employment in the total population is increasing china needs to ramp up efforts to address these concerns especially when a new market economy is emerging the meanings of unemployment and employment have all changed with challenges and opportunities coming up alongside such transformations second the driving force from entrepreneurship is insufficient statistics show that in 2015 the average number of new urban jobs corresponding to each new market entity was 0 9 the figure then declined to less than 0 5 by 2020 indicating either deteriorating quality of entrepreneurship or data collection flaws but still how to enhance the driving force from entrepreneurship should be well studied third the labor market is facing pressure from multiple imbalances and mismatches between supply and demand and this pressure has become more acute this year high emission and high energy consumption industries are gradually shrinking in number they have been crowding out and will continue to do so a large number of employed people in need of rearrangements in the process of rectifying the educational system the once prosperous off campus education and online training industry has been severely impacted the shrinking of real estate sales and intermediary industries is evident as well these changes should sound the alarm for employment policy changes as they are triggered by the development progress toward a new economy it has been repeatedly seen throughout history that to solve the problem of large scale population employment small and medium sized enterprises are the best answer small businesses have always been the mainstay of employment there is no doubt about this small businesses are also the driver of innovation the point has not been well promoted in the past and people s understanding on it varies but in the unfolding fourth industrial revolution characterized by services informatization networking intelligence and platformization the smaller the better small businesses are no longer just supplements to large businesses but have independent existence value and are economic entities that cooperate with large enterprises and complement each other in this context the gig economy may become the mainstay in the future which will greatly change the face of the economy the writer is an academician at the chinese academy of social sciences and chairman of the national finance and development laboratory the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily

with season three of succession now in the books vulture is returning to where it all began with weekly recaps of season one rewatch along with us and check back every sunday night for the next pair of episodes there are many opportunities to talk about the failings of the roy children because that s part of what succession is about a company and a country bequeathed to the dipshit scions of the superelite connor kendall shiv and roman have neither the qualifications nor the wisdom nor the temperament nor the basic competency to run a popsicle stand yet they stand to inherit the world because meritocracy is an idea that may be promoted on atn opinion shows but not in the actual halls of power at waystar even still the siblings inevitably fumble the ball but with all that throat clearing out of the way let us admit this logan roy is lucky to still have a job in the riveting which side are you on kendall and roman s efforts to drum up support for a vote of no confidence against their father result in the expected comedy of errors but the fundamentals of the move are strong logan is certainly feared at his own company but he s also hated and the combination of his weakening health falling stock and uncertainty about his leadership decisions creates the best possible opportunity to knock him off the perch a board vote against him is a clean and well timed way to do it too and kendall and roman have the benefit of old hands like frank and more quietly gerri helping him strategize a coup when the four of them meet in a diner one that does not have a cortado with almond alas they have sound reason to believe that they ll be successful if there isn t some unidentified threat that shuts down the airspace over manhattan the vote likely succeeds if logan recuses himself from the board meeting as he s supposed to do the vote likely succeeds if roman can summon the courage to support his own cause the vote definitely succeeds instead it ends in a tie and all those who voted against logan are ejected from the board and if present from the building it feels like logan got final approval on the cut of which side are you on because kendall s biggest triumph as a vote wrangler is reduced to a wordless montage sequence on the morning of the vote with one maybe hanging in the balance kendall gambles on missing the meeting altogether by driving out to a long island hospital to persuade a crucial board member to join the cause it s possible that this voter ilona who we ve never seen before hasn t spent enough time around kendall to have the proper lack of faith in him but his personal visit turns out to be the right call it s the terrorists who beat him on this day when he cannot catch a quick copter back to headquarters the narrative gods do not want him to win he does his usual best to lose too kendall opens his campaign inauspiciously by mentioning the no confidence vote to stewy who makes no effort to mask his displeasure about the move because he knows that wall street will view such upheaval kindly you re fucking with my money ken but stewy is in the position that many other board members a lot of them future abstainers like him occupy which is that he isn t well served by voting in either direction with typical frankness stewy tells ken i can promise you that i am spiritually and emotionally and ethically and morally behind whoever wins and with typical cluelessness ken counts this as a vote in his favor though again if the winds of change were blowing more favorably the morning of the vote and kendall isn t making his case through traffic tunnels and honking horns and dropped reception then stewy is probably a yes others too it s hard to believe that lawrence who delighted in torturing kendall into an exorbitant fee for vaulter could be listed among the persuadable but his digital outlet is in a lose lose situation at the company vaulter represents the cool new media vision logan s sons are trying to push forward over his ancient legacy media instincts so lawrence is caught between a ceo hostile to his outlet and kendall who he doesn t respect in the least roman sees this as his time to shine however so he persuades kendall to allow him to meet with lawrence to secure his vote to the very reasonable question what s your vision roman launches on what he believes to be the hip cool answer that will impress the hip cool vaulter guy he talks about laughing in the middle of a bookstore with all its hilariously antiquated writing on bound pieces of paper he believes the future is about tasty morsels from groovy hubs like vaulter roman reads the situation hilariously wrong he believes that he s telling lawrence what he wants to hear he believes that the publisher of a groovy hub like vaulter surely has contempt for books and for the exhausting ordeal of reading or writing the paragraphs and pages necessary to bring ideas across roman doesn t pick up on lawrence s wry joke about him going post literate he also thinks they are both disrupter types who share a hunger for newness for its own sake anything to bust up the stodgy old models for profitability in the past though roman and kendall don t agree on much they understand waystar as a vehicle for their own relevancy and status they re embarrassed to be associated with the old man s business of course they re not cool at all that s why which side are you on opens where it does with kendall backstage with stewy at a hip hop show no doubt mentally calculating the amount of time it might take for him to say that he hung out with the talent when a brief greeting proves insufficient kendall wants his assistant to remind the man who pays his checks in the chillest way possible being rich affords you that level of status which is a lesson tom tries to impart on greg by taking him for an evening of illegal birdsong consumption and 2 000 a bottle service at the most exclusive corners of the most exclusive nightclubs with enough money you can shield yourself from the opinions people might have about you the true power is not caring and it belongs entirely to logan he doesn t care that his sons think buying up local news stations isn t cool he doesn t care about honoring the protocol of recusing himself from a board vote especially if it s a fatal threat to his leadership he even openly roots for cancer as an emphatic display about how much he doesn t care the one thing he does care about is winning and in which side are you on he hangs another w on the board stock options the other major subplot in this episode is shiv possibly reviving her working other stuff relationship with nate an ex boyfriend in the political consulting world the two share some fun half nasty half flirtatious banter about the business and their love lives but it isn t folded into the rest of the hour that elegantly tom looks happy and liberated all episode having escaped for now the cruises scandal that had been nipping at his feet it s like this 900 pound gorilla has finally stopped fucking me he says a line made funnier by the fact that shiv can t even give it a third of her attention the exchange between greg and tom over california pizza kitchen is an instant classic demonstrating the money gulf between them it s pretty delicious says greg no replies tom no it isn t the young man living in a youth hostel and tucking office pastries in doggy bags not long ago will have to learn how to be rich ewan coming all the way down from canada again to vote in favor of the brother he hates is almost impressively principled because ewan can see kendall s move as a move rather than an act of concern it s a wanton act of egregious selfishness he says in keeping with everything else i ve come to loathe about this rat s nest of a family poor greg the same night his grandfather makes him eat every bit of a noodle dinner he doesn t want he sits down at a prix fixe restaurant with tom who immediately tells him when i had their monkfish i thought i was gonna shit puke and cum all at once the title of the episode is a protest song written around a mining strike in harlan county kentucky in the 30s that same area would appear in barbara kopple s landmark 1976 documentary harlan county usa about a months long strike that turned violent with kopple herself in the middle of the action bit of an odd touch to include it here frankly but it does offer a jarring perspective

where can you get a rapid covid test in boston right now here s what we know about where to find the suddenly highly sought after tests get a compelling long read and must have lifestyle tips in your inbox every sunday morning great with coffee when it comes to rapid at home covid tests in boston the situation has gotten pretty dire pretty quickly just a few short days ago at least out here in east boston rapid tests were in ample supply my local cvs had at least two full crates of them available for purchase right next to the cash register i grabbed two last week just to be safe and a box of quickvue tests complete with a pair of nose swabs vials of liquid and testing strips now sits on my desk the plan is to save it for christmas eve i can remember watching as supply dwindled in nyc and heard dispatches from friends about lines snaking around the block for the chance to get swabbed but figured such a fate would surely not be possible here then over the weekend reality set in rapid tests our best shot at catching the omicron variant in time to keep us from infecting family members over the holidays have gotten much much harder to find so if you re in a pinch and need a test this week or if you re trying to be as safe as possible about getting together with loved ones this weekend what s a bostonian to do for one supply appears to be a crapshoot at pharmacies and other retail stores and any available tests are flying off the shelves almost immediately pharmacies across boston expecting hordes of shoppers looking for them have begun posting apologetic signs outside their front doors consider asking the staff at your local store when restock day is a colleague says a tip from the staff at a somerville walgreens that they expected to receive new shipments on wednesdays helped her snag one this week so keep your eyes peeled for over the counter options as they emerge they tend to cost around 25 meanwhile boston has begun handing out free at home covid tests across the city at boston public library branches and locations of the boston centers for youth and families the effort is part of a state run campaign to distribute more than 2 million take home tests free of charge ahead of the holiday starting today we are now distributing free rapid covid tests in select locations this pilot program includes the following branches copley brighton codman grove hall east boston mattapan south boston roslindale roxbury learn more boston public library bplboston december 20 2021 according to the boston public health commission website residents are invited to grab up to one box of two tests per household member at the following locations in ten neighborhoods get there early over the past few days libraries have been running out of tests within a couple hours every morning bpl is now suggesting that anyone hoping to secure a test call ahead first experiences will vary from location to location some branches like copley have seen long lines at least in east boston this morning there was no line at all here s which branches to visit back bay boston public library central 700 boylston street brighton bpl brighton branch 40 academy

elsewhere efforts to distribute free covid tests vary community by community nbc10 boston reports revere has been giving out its allotment of 27 000 tests at food distribution centers nonprofits and churches quincy has distributed them at shelters and via the local health department where they can be reserved with a phone call in chelsea the group la colaborativa was embarking on an effort to distribute 8 000 tests in that city boston is also continuing to run testing clinics at multiple locations some of which require appointments and some of which are currently accepting walk ins reports on the ground though show that the lines at these locations have gotten pretty significant update line here in harvard square for covid testing is still wrapped around the block site closes at 6 but they say they ll test everyone who is in line at 6 pm people are rushing to get pcr tests for holiday pic twitter com kor0zjy3vi kathryn sotnik nbc10 boston katnbcboston december 19 2021 as for how the major pharmacies are handling the shortage i m hearing you ll have to be patient due to a recent increase in demand related to a surge of increasing covid 19 cases and to retain community based access to tests in our stores there may be temporary out of stocks for these products online at cvs com a cvs spokesperson says in an email we are committed to providing families with protection and peace of mind during the holiday season and we continue to offer access to lab based testing with results available in 1 2 days or rapid covid 19 testing at more than 4 800 cvs pharmacy locations it was a similar situation at walgreens following thanksgiving and leading into the upcoming holiday week we ve seen an unprecedented increase in demand for rapid otc covid 19 tests across the country and are working with our suppliers to ensure customers have access to self test kits through the holidays a spokesperson says also by email some stores may experience a temporary shortage in rapid otc testing solutions for consumers looking for specific items walgreens com updates with the latest available store inventory information frequently throughout the day walgreens also says it s implementing a new four item purchase limit on tests due to the strain on supply so if your local library can t help you out you may want to keep refreshing those pharmacy sites to check for inventory updates but consider calling to confirm their listed supply is accurate before heading over

elissa nadworny host earlier this month the new york city council passed a ban on gas powered heat and stove appliances in newly constructed buildings the move makes it the largest city in the country to pass such a ban which will take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories while taller buildings have until 2027 to make the switch some say this could be the beginning of the end of gas powered appliances for home use a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions however critics warn that it may be too early to turn our backs on natural gas and that electrifying buildings only moves carbon emissions upstream to fossil fuel plants to talk more about this we ve invited russell unger to join us he co leads the building electrification initiative at rmi a nonprofit think tank that specializes in clean energy russell unger welcome russell unger thank you nadworny so first i wonder if you could talk about why the ban what s bad about gas powered heat and stove appliances unger math tells us that if we are going to decarbonize our cities our states our country we can t be burning fossil fuels in buildings anymore across the country buildings are responsible for about 40 of u s greenhouse gas emissions and in places like new york where there s not a lot of emissions from transport it s much higher in new york it s about 70 of the carbon emissions so the only way to address our carbon emissions in a big city like that is to stop burning fossil fuels in buildings the only way we re going to get to our goals across the country is to stop that as well nadworny and so tell me about your reaction to the new york city ban it sounds like it s going to make a difference unger it s a huge step i mean this is the largest jurisdiction in the country to make a move like this and it s new york city which is a bellwether for so many things whether it s other policies related to building and energy like requiring buildings to measure their energy performance every year it started outside new york but once new york did it a lot of cities followed suit and it s a bellwether generally for the whole country if you look at other things like stopping smoking inside bars it was only yesterday when that was required and new york went out on a limb it seemed and now you don t get to bars where there s allowed to smoke anymore it s also the first cold climate to enact a policy like that and that s really significant because electrifying a building is quite different in a cold climate than a warm climate like san francisco because we re electrifying heating nadworny well so i m curious because the ban is for new buildings and new york city of course has a lot of old buildings many of which have gas appliances so how does this play into kind of the impact a ban like this would have unger well there s a substantial impact just from the new buildings so according to our analysis we d be saving or new york city would be saving 2 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 that s about the equivalent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by 450 000 cars driving for a year but that s not going to be the limit of the impact so like right now if you live in new york city and you have a home and you call up the company that installed your furnace because you re having a problem and you ask them about a heat pump an electric heat pump no guarantee whether or not they re going to know what those are or recommend them once this law goes into effect every one of those companies will have had experience with heat pumps because they re going to be doing new installs so we ll see the contractors having direct experience with all electric equipment and we ll see the distributors having that in stock readily and you know we ll see cascade effects into the existing buildings as well nadworny so this is about electrification and i wonder why is electrification considered a better alternative to sources like natural gas unger when we re using fossil fuels in our homes and offices we re burning fossil fuels there s no way around it and fossil fuels release carbon emissions and other pollutants and we re contributing to climate change when we electrify we re pulling power off the grid the grid has a mixture of sources we also by using electricity can use types of heating like heat pumps that are you know have multiple folds of efficiency just the way they work by moving the heat so even today in most jurisdictions electrification is going to reduce carbon emissions and then looking forward to the targets that we have around the country that will become like a better and better carbon math nadworny now i ve always kind of been told or thought that gas stoves were better for cooking because they provided more even heating and i can imagine a lot of listeners kind of listening to this and saying is that true is that a misconception because this is a change to a way of life unger well i guess it depends how much you cook and whether you consider it a change to a way of life you know there are you know well known chefs that use induction i mean it is more common to use gas but that s also the result of you know 50 plus years of campaigning by the gas industry which has tested this and found you know what people don t care what powers their hot water heater they don t care what powers their heating system but for some reason they care what s going on in their stove and so that s why when you think about you know gas the kind of classic image is that burner on the stove and that s not an accident that is 50 plus years of very active investment into marketing by the gas industry nadworny yeah well given how serious climate change is do you think a ban like this goes far enough unger it s not going to be all that we you know everything we need to get there eventually we re going to have to change over as you noted equipment in existing buildings but this sets the table for it we re doing it in a place where easiest to do it which is the new buildings we re building a market by having kind of the hvac contractors the designers the distributors kind of poised and ready for this expand

the ongoing covid 19 pandemic has brought about changes to the macroeconomic system of each country and also that of the globe inflationary pressure is showing signs of abating while deflation is being seen in parts of the world where money supplies are tightening low interest rates even negative rates in some places are beginning to spread volatility of economic growth has decreased deficits and debt have become long term issues government bond markets have become a major focus within fiscal and monetary policies amid calls for de globalization countries are slowly weakening transnational economic ties all these changes are posing challenges to traditional macroeconomic theories and the expert analyses written about global economic and trade issues this article will mainly discuss issues of global debt china s debt and employment global debt since the 2000s huge amounts of debt have accumulated in advanced economies such as the united states some of the reasons for this are domestic such as long term economic downturns and governments of these countries needing to continuously stimulate the economy through fiscal deficits leading to ever higher debts external factors include a decline in the competitiveness of their own economies resulting in frequent and ballooning current account deficits being in control of the issuance of global reserve currencies these countries can use their own currencies to not only fund trade deficits but also their debts such a mechanism has closely linked global debt and international finance with domestic debt financial operations and even macroeconomic policies of these countries based on this mechanism global debt this century has not seen ups and downs but has instead been peaking all the time and finally resulted in a flood of global liquidity by the end of the second quarter total global debt reached 296 trillion equivalent to 355 percent of global gdp if calculated on the basis of a 7 5 billion world population per capita debt is as high as 39 400 such a high debt intensity fully shows that the efficiency of financial services to the real economy is declining globally how to deal with such huge debt is a big problem to be tackled in the post covid era in october the fed s interest rate meeting pointed out that it will reduce debt purchases monthly starting in november and will stop the practice completely in the first half of 2022 if balance sheet reduction that is the restoration of monetary policy to a state of normalcy is a process stopping debt purchases is only the first step first it will stop increasing its scale as for reducing total debt volume and accompanying interest rate adjustments no arrangements have been made yet however since volume liquidity and price interest rates are linked under the market economy it can be predicted that since debt reduction actions have taken place interest rates will change sooner or later in this regard china must have countermeasures in place if the fed expands its balance sheet the overall impact will not be very negative for the rest of the world because the implementation of the fed s expansionary policy will increase the outflow of capital to other countries which in turn will lead to lower interest rates currency appreciation and firmed up asset prices although it may be accompanied by imported inflation because the availability and cost of funds will be improved the overall impact will be beneficial especially for the vast number of developing countries on the contrary if the fed shrinks its balance sheet a large amount of funds will flow back to the us leading to falling asset prices in other countries the overall result will increase development costs and slow the development pace of these countries the issues above in my opinion are what the country needs to prepare for currently china s debt in the context of global debt overflow china s debt has been expanding as well with leverage rising in tandem thanks to the structural reform moves in the nation in the years prior to the covid 19 outbreak the rising tide of high leverage has been curbed the year 2020 pushed fiscal deficit and loans with the outbreak of covid 19 which led to rises in debt and leverage however the situation has reversed as the gearing ratio of the nonfinancial sector has been declining and the decline has been significant in the first three quarters the leverage issue in my opinion should be a neutral word rather than something we always consider to be harmful to the sound development of the economy this is especially true when the decline in leverage levels in nonfinancial sectors in the first three quarters was due to weak investment sentiment among enterprises this is not the image we want to portray or see and when it comes to the financial sector itself the leverage ratio of the sector over the period whether it is on the debt side or the asset side is falling steeply this situation obviously indicates that financial risk has weakened but also shows that the country s monetary policy has been tight in general since the beginning of this year going further to the local level the problem of mutual spillover between fiscal and financial risk is becoming more and more serious in recent years we have strictly prohibited local governments from borrowing from financial institutions and have gradually replaced a large amount of direct borrowings in the past through the issuance of government bonds this not only regulates the government s lending behavior but also reduces their borrowing costs however what s happening is that local governments do make up for their expenditure gaps by issuing bonds most of the bonds issued are mainly purchased and held by commercial banks the supplier is still a financial institution and the nature of the whole process has not changed how to establish an effective local government deficit financing mechanism and debt restraint mechanism remains a significant task new jobs a few years ago employment officially became a priority in setting out the country s macroeconomic policies which shows the modernization of the macroeconomic control mechanism and national governance system according to data on employment from the national development and reform commission in the first three quarters 10 45 million new jobs were created nationwide achieving 95 percent of the annual target in september the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas nationwide was 4 9 percent a decrease of 0 2 percentage points from the previous month the surveyed unemployment rate in 31 major cities and towns was 5 percent at the end of the third quarter the total number of rural migrant workers was 183 03 million a year on year increase of 2 percent with the scale basically returned to the same level prior to the covid 19 outbreak given that china has not yet fully recovered from covid 19 shocks the situation fully demonstrates the superiority of its system however we also need to underline three aspects in this regard first the pressure on youth employment in the total population is increasing china needs to ramp up efforts to address these concerns especially when a new market economy is emerging the meanings of unemployment and employment have all changed with challenges and opportunities coming up alongside such transformations second the driving force from entrepreneurship is insufficient statistics show that in 2015 the average number of new urban jobs corresponding to each new market entity was 0 9 the figure then declined to less than 0 5 by 2020 indicating either deteriorating quality of entrepreneurship or data collection flaws but still how to enhance the driving force from entrepreneurship should be well studied third the labor market is facing pressure from multiple imbalances and mismatches between supply and demand and this pressure has become more acute this year high emission and high energy consumption industries are gradually shrinking in number they have been crowding out and will continue to do so a large number of employed people in need of rearrangements in the process of rectifying the educational system the once prosperous off campus education and online training industry has been severely impacted the shrinking of real estate sales and intermediary industries is evident as well these changes should sound the alarm for employment policy changes as they are triggered by the development progress toward a new economy it has been repeatedly seen throughout history that to solve the problem of large scale population employment small and medium sized enterprises are the best answer small businesses have always been the mainstay of employment there is no doubt about this small businesses are also the driver of innovation the point has not been well promoted in the past and people s understanding on it varies but in the unfolding fourth industrial revolution characterized by services informatization networking intelligence and platformization the smaller the better small businesses are no longer just supplements to large businesses but have independent existence value and are economic entities that cooperate with large enterprises and complement each other in this context the gig economy may become the mainstay in the future which will greatly change the face of the economy the writer is an academician at the chinese academy of social sciences and chairman of the national finance and development laboratory

the ongoing covid 19 pandemic has brought about changes to the macroeconomic system of each country and also that of the globe inflationary pressure is showing signs of abating while deflation is being seen in parts of the world where money supplies are tightening low interest rates even negative rates in some places are beginning to spread volatility of economic growth has decreased deficits and debt have become long term issues government bond markets have become a major focus within fiscal and monetary policies amid calls for de globalization countries are slowly weakening transnational economic ties all these changes are posing challenges to traditional macroeconomic theories and the expert analyses written about global economic and trade issues this article will mainly discuss issues of global debt china s debt and employment global debt since the 2000s huge amounts of debt have accumulated in advanced economies such as the united states some of the reasons for this are domestic such as long term economic downturns and governments of these countries needing to continuously stimulate the economy through fiscal deficits leading to ever higher debts external factors include a decline in the competitiveness of their own economies resulting in frequent and ballooning current account deficits being in control of the issuance of global reserve currencies these countries can use their own currencies to not only fund trade deficits but also their debts such a mechanism has closely linked global debt and international finance with domestic debt financial operations and even macroeconomic policies of these countries based on this mechanism global debt this century has not seen ups and downs but has instead been peaking all the time and finally resulted in a flood of global liquidity by the end of the second quarter total global debt reached 296 trillion equivalent to 355 percent of global gdp if calculated on the basis of a 7 5 billion world population per capita debt is as high as 39 400 such a high debt intensity fully shows that the efficiency of financial services to the real economy is declining globally how to deal with such huge debt is a big problem to be tackled in the post covid era in october the fed s interest rate meeting pointed out that it will reduce debt purchases monthly starting in november and will stop the practice completely in the first half of 2022 if balance sheet reduction that is the restoration of monetary policy to a state of normalcy is a process stopping debt purchases is only the first step first it will stop increasing its scale as for reducing total debt volume and accompanying interest rate adjustments no arrangements have been made yet however since volume liquidity and price interest rates are linked under the market economy it can be predicted that since debt reduction actions have taken place interest rates will change sooner or later in this regard china must have countermeasures in place if the fed expands its balance sheet the overall impact will not be very negative for the rest of the world because the implementation of the fed s expansionary policy will increase the outflow of capital to other countries which in turn will lead to lower interest rates currency appreciation and firmed up asset prices although it may be accompanied by imported inflation because the availability and cost of funds will be improved the overall impact will be beneficial especially for the vast number of developing countries on the contrary if the fed shrinks its balance sheet a large amount of funds will flow back to the us leading to falling asset prices in other countries the overall result will increase development costs and slow the development pace of these countries the issues above in my opinion are what the country needs to prepare for currently china s debt in the context of global debt overflow china s debt has been expanding as well with leverage rising in tandem thanks to the structural reform moves in the nation in the years prior to the covid 19 outbreak the rising tide of high leverage has been curbed the year 2020 pushed fiscal deficit and loans with the outbreak of covid 19 which led to rises in debt and leverage however the situation has reversed as the gearing ratio of the nonfinancial sector has been declining and the decline has been significant in the first three quarters the leverage issue in my opinion should be a neutral word rather than something we always consider to be harmful to the sound development of the economy this is especially true when the decline in leverage levels in nonfinancial sectors in the first three quarters was due to weak investment sentiment among enterprises this is not the image we want to portray or see and when it comes to the financial sector itself the leverage ratio of the sector over the period whether it is on the debt side or the asset side is falling steeply this situation obviously indicates that financial risk has weakened but also shows that the country s monetary policy has been tight in general since the beginning of this year going further to the local level the problem of mutual spillover between fiscal and financial risk is becoming more and more serious in recent years we have strictly prohibited local governments from borrowing from financial institutions and have gradually replaced a large amount of direct borrowings in the past through the issuance of government bonds this not only regulates the government s lending behavior but also reduces their borrowing costs however what s happening is that local governments do make up for their expenditure gaps by issuing bonds most of the bonds issued are mainly purchased and held by commercial banks the supplier is still a financial institution and the nature of the whole process has not changed how to establish an effective local government deficit financing mechanism and debt restraint mechanism remains a significant task new jobs a few years ago employment officially became a priority in setting out the country s macroeconomic policies which shows the modernization of the macroeconomic control mechanism and national governance system according to data on employment from the national development and reform commission in the first three quarters 10 45 million new jobs were created nationwide achieving 95 percent of the annual target in september the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas nationwide was 4 9 percent a decrease of 0 2 percentage points from the previous month the surveyed unemployment rate in 31 major cities and towns was 5 percent at the end of the third quarter the total number of rural migrant workers was 183 03 million a year on year increase of 2 percent with the scale basically returned to the same level prior to the covid 19 outbreak given that china has not yet fully recovered from covid 19 shocks the situation fully demonstrates the superiority of its system however we also need to underline three aspects in this regard first the pressure on youth employment in the total population is increasing china needs to ramp up efforts to address these concerns especially when a new market economy is emerging the meanings of unemployment and employment have all changed with challenges and opportunities coming up alongside such transformations second the driving force from entrepreneurship is insufficient statistics show that in 2015 the average number of new urban jobs corresponding to each new market entity was 0 9 the figure then declined to less than 0 5 by 2020 indicating either deteriorating quality of entrepreneurship or data collection flaws but still how to enhance the driving force from entrepreneurship should be well studied third the labor market is facing pressure from multiple imbalances and mismatches between supply and demand and this pressure has become more acute this year high emission and high energy consumption industries are gradually shrinking in number they have been crowding out and will continue to do so a large number of employed people in need of rearrangements in the process of rectifying the educational system the once prosperous off campus education and online training industry has been severely impacted the shrinking of real estate sales and intermediary industries is evident as well these changes should sound the alarm for employment policy changes as they are triggered by the development progress toward a new economy it has been repeatedly seen throughout history that to solve the problem of large scale population employment small and medium sized enterprises are the best answer small businesses have always been the mainstay of employment there is no doubt about this small businesses are also the driver of innovation the point has not been well promoted in the past and people s understanding on it varies but in the unfolding fourth industrial revolution characterized by services informatization networking intelligence and platformization the smaller the better small businesses are no longer just supplements to large businesses but have independent existence value and are economic entities that cooperate with large enterprises and complement each other in this context the gig economy may become the mainstay in the future which will greatly change the face of the economy the writer is an academician at the chinese academy of social sciences and chairman of the national finance and development laboratory

wave of the pandemic its staff has begun contacting doctors who had worked there during the first and second waves to check if they were willing to return to work sixteen kilometres away at another jumbo centre in the nesco compound in goregaon trial runs have begun of five new pressure swing adsorption or psa plants that generate oxygen mumbai is gearing up for a surge of covid 19 cases a month after the world health organisation on november 26 designated omicron as a variant of concern the city s daily covid 19 caseload has risen from 200 to over 900 in the past week mirroring the current surge in parts of europe the united states and several african countries the daily test positivity rate has doubled to 2 6 in a week city officials suspect omicron could be driving the recent surge in cases but data is scarce at the moment of the 73 cases of the variant detected in mumbai so far most are connected to international travel officials fear that cases within the community may have gone undetected to check for community spread of omicron between december 21 to december 31 all covid 19 positive cases in the city will be genome sequenced but city authorities aren t waiting for better data to revive the systems that helped mumbai weather the second wave comparatively better than other cities especially the national capital where covid 19 patients died in large numbers as hospital beds and oxygen supplies ran out on december 21 22 the officials of the brihanmumbai municipal corporation held meetings following which they instructed all 24 wards of the city to reopen covid war rooms and jumbo centres stock up on medicines for the next three months and hire more medical staff the authorities in mumbai are aiming to have at least 8 000 more isolation beds ready by january 1 across five jumbo centres we have decided to increase more beds in a phase wise manner said additional municipal commissioner suresh kakani we don t want to hire entire manpower and reactivate all isolation beds all of a sudden once our hospital capacity reaches 30 more beds will be added he said a ward at the bandra kurla complex jumbo centre where cots coolers cabinets and medicine trays have been kept ready tabassum barnagarwala bringing back the staff since the last covid 19 patient at the bandra kurla complex jumbo centre was discharged in mid november a skeletal staff comes to conduct vaccination and run a post covid outpatient department we reduced our staff strength by 80 after the second wave in june said the centre s dean dr rajesh dere dere now plans to hire 300 doctors 300 nurses and around 400 class iv employees for the 2 328 beds including 166 intensive care units the hospital has a list of 400 doctors who worked during the first and the second waves medical officer dr sopan patil said they have started calling up each doctor about half of them have started working somewhere else he said for nurses and class iv employees the jumbo centre has contacted a private agency to hire contractual staff when the first wave of the pandemic had subsided in 2020 the brihanmumbai municipal corporation had let 80 of the staff at jumbo centres go since the patient count had dropped in march 2021 when the second wave surged the civic body had no time to hire and train new staff the bandra kurla complex centre was recording 200 250 admissions every day and was filled to full capacity within a week a medical officer said they had to struggle at a short notice to get doctors for so many patients after the second wave subsided the civic body again decided to terminate 80 of the contractual staff at jumbo centres to save on costs but this time they plan to hire before a third wave hits we realised that we need to prepare in advance we need time to train staff in treatment protocol and fire fighting a senior doctor at the jumbo centre said as hospitalisation is expected to increase in january hiring of medical staff and healthcare workers will be completed by december said officials inside a jumbo centre a paediatric ward was set up during the second wave to treat children intensive care units set up in large containers through corporate social responsibility funding stocking up medicines the bandra kurla complex jumbo centre has also begun purchasing crucial medicines personal protective equipment and daily consumable medical items such as gloves and syringes medical officer dr sopan patil said that during the second wave blood thinners were in short supply due to the high demand every patient on oxygen support requires blood thinners he said as a result the cost of one vial shot up from rs 200 to over rs 400 we could hardly find distributors this time we are stocking for one to two months he added the central purchase department of the brihanmumbai municipal corporation has made note of the requirement of medicines from all civic hospitals for antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir the immunosuppressive drug tocilizumab and the relatively newer monoclonal antibody cocktail the civic body has floated a tender and additional commissioner kakani said stock to last all hospitals another three months will be purchased ramping up oxygen supply mumbai s second covid 19 wave which began in march and subsided by june led to an acute crisis of medical oxygen with the peak demand rising to 275 metric tonnes per day the municipal corporation estimates that the maximum oxygen requirement will increase up to 690 metric tonnes per day during the third wave the corporation has created a storage capacity of 1 150 metric tonnes for liquid medical oxygen additionally 43 pressure swing adsorption plants that can convert atmospheric air into pure oxygen have been sanctioned of them 30 are operational and are undergoing trial runs at the bandra kurla complex jumbo centre five pressure swing adsorption plants will provide 7 500 litres of oxygen per day civic officials believe the oxygen storage and production capacity is sufficient even if the peak requirement during the second wave is exceeded in the future at the nesco jumbo centre 10 pressure swing adsorption plants have been approved of which five have been funded through a corporate social responsibility initiative dean dr neelam andrade said the trial run of five plants is under way they can provide oxygen to 750 out of 2 215 beds in the centre for the rest there are liquid oxygen storage tanks structural and fire audits and inspections of oxygen pipelines to check for leakage are also under way at the jumbo centres the municipal corporation has also notified private hospitals to prepare for an increase in admissions during the second wave 80 of the beds at private hospitals were reserved for government patients with a cap on maximum charges currently none of the beds are reserved we have informed hospitals we can acquire their beds if cases rise kakani said the municipal staff have also prepared a list of hotels dharamshalas lodges and community halls which can be converted into covid care centres at short notice new pressure swing adsorption plants are undergoing trial runs in mumbai of 43 sanctioned plants 30 have been set up stepping up surveillance in kurla in eastern mumbai medical officer dr jeetendra jadhav said he is seeing an uptick in daily cases of covid 19 from five to 15 in a week most are restricted to the residents of high rise apartments we don t know why but most cases continue to come from non slum areas he said an analysis of the small pool of omicron cases in mumbai shows that most of those infected remain asymptomatic and none have a severe infection while the positive cases under jadhav s watch had not been confirmed to be omicron infections he noted that 90 of them remained asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms up from 80 during the second wave this made the task of detecting covid 19 cases even more challenging since most people remain asymptomatic they do not opt for a test until they show symptoms or are close contacts of an infected person to detect more cases we will have to conduct more random tests jadhav said we have increased surveillance i have also instructed my health workers to test 20 contacts of every covid 19 positive case simultaneously the civic body is also trying to rapidly cover the entire population with both doses of the vaccines the city has administered the first dose to 100 of the eligible adult population and second dose to over 80 every day around 50 000 people are vaccinated a non governmental organisation has tied up with the municipal corporation to raise awareness about vaccination in kurla slums a team of doctors and nurses vaccine people by the road in this vehicle the central government on sunday approved vaccination for teenagers aged 15 18 years and a booster shot for health workers frontline workers and senior citizens with co morbidities from january 10 2022 immunisation officer dr sheela

critical analysis print this chinese agression by caitlin johnstone and john pilger from caitlinjohnstone com â chinese aggressionâ is just china responding to us aggression itâ s an especially dumb day for anti china propaganda the biden administration has imposed trade restrictions on 34 chinese institutions on the unsubstantiated allegation that they are developing â brain control weaponryâ a claim the mass media have been all too happy to uncritically pass on to the public between that and the ridiculous reporting on russian havana syndrome ray guns itâ s like theyâ re literally trying to get everyone to wear tinfoil hats then thereâ s the tucker carlson guest who just told carlsonâ s massive audience that the us military needs to be full of â type a men who want to sit on a throne of chinese skulls â itâ s highly disturbing how much the mass media have been talking about war with china like itâ s a foregone conclusion lately almost as though theyâ re working to normalize that horrifying idea thereâ s also this new article for the hill hilariously titled â â alliesâ china and russia are ganging up on americaâ about how the poor widdle us empire is being bullied by mean old xi and putinâ s increasingly tight knit collaboration it is authored by gordon chang who has been wrongly predicting the imminent collapse of china for decades and is plainly absurd because the moscow beijing alignment is in reality nothing other than the natural consequence of two nations realizing the need to work together against the globe spanning power structure that is trying to bully them into submission the us military budget has once again increased despite the us ending a war this year and despite its facing no real threats from any nation to its easily defended shores the increase has been largely justified by the need to â counter chinaâ and includes billions in funding for the ongoing construction of long range missile systems on the first island chain near the chinese mainland explicitly for the purpose of threatening china one need only imagine what would happen if china began constructing a chain of long range missile systems off a us coastline to understand who the actual aggressor is between these two powers fox guest we don t need a military that s woman friendly we don t need a military that s gay friendly we need type a men who want to sit on a throne of chinese skulls pic twitter com jztfzkpyyrâ brendan karet bad_takes december 18 2021 in reality concern trolling from the western political media class about things china is doing both internationally and domestically has pretty consistently been about actions that china has taken in response to aggressions from the us and its allies such concern trolling is generally framed as opposition to alleged human rights abuses and the need to protect chinaâ s neighbors from â chinese aggressionâ but in reality itâ s done to facilitate the agenda to make china weaker and smaller by any means necessary the actual source of tensions between the us and china never actually has anything to do with â human rightsâ or â protectingâ anyone thatâ s just the narrative overlay pinned on top of the actual agenda the actual source of those tensions is always the fact that it is in the us empireâ s interests to make china smaller and weaker and it is in chinaâ s interests to be big and strong the us resolved after the fall of the soviet union to prevent the rise of any other rival superpower and all of the grievances we see aired about alleged chinese abuses are really just justifications for aggressions geared toward undermining subverting threatening out maneuvering and balkanizing china to make it weaker and smaller pretty much everything china gets slammed for by the imperial media is actually a response to western aggressions whether youâ re talking about xinjiang hong kong taiwan territorial disputes over borders or ocean waters or domestic authoritarianism the us is consistently the aggressor and china is consistently responding defensively to those aggressions only an absolute moron would believe the us and its allies actually care about muslims in xinjiang after they just spent the last two decades slaughtering muslims by the millions in their post 9 11 wars of aggression the propaganda narratives focus on human rights but the real reason is that xinjiang is a very geostrategically valuable region that us imperialism would benefit from carving away from china and beijing would benefit from keeping take this excerpt from a 2017 sbs article about chinaâ s belt and road initiative bri to illustrate an example of one significant bri project that has multiple purposes is the creation of an overland route from xinjiang in chinaâ s far west through pakistan to its deep water gwadar port on the arabian sea us 54 billion of infrastructure is planned for this stretch despite some of the route passing through territory disputed by india and pakistan this route gives china cargo overland access to the arabian sea will spur investment in xinjiang and opens up a new route into china for energy imports from the middle east â a route that is not vulnerable to us maritime power like its east coast sea lanes this map says more than any article you ll ever see in corporate media about why western imperialist countries that have spent decades killing muslims suddenly pretend to care about uyghurs in xinjiang china they want to break china up and stop its belt and road initiative pic twitter com mhwssrtsiu â ben norton benjaminnorton july 25 2020 to engage in a us style campaign of mass military slaughter against these groups until they were defeated to find some alternative to 1 and 2 to allow a violent uprising of what would inevitably become western backed jihadists as they had just seen in libya and syria carve away a geostrategically crucial part of china to be exploited by the us and its allies or to find some alternative to 1 and 2 beijing went with option number three and the alternative it found was the aggressive deradicalization campaign it ended up implementing and the re education facilities it has been so widely criticized for this move would surely have entailed many of the abuses youâ d expect from a mass scale police action and dramatic escalation of authoritarian policies but claims that it constituted â genocideâ have been soundly discredited by independent research groups and by members of the public using publicly available information while the most egregious allegations of abuse have been shown to be subject to manipulation and riddled with major plot holes you can criticize beijing for how it went about its dilemma in xinjiang all you want but it was plainly universes less draconian than the us approach of killing millions and displacing tens of millions in its barbaric â war on terrorâ and unlike the â war on terrorâ beijingâ s approach actually worked which even western media have been forced to grudgingly concede as tourism surges in xinjiang i would like to think that maybe in the future people will be slightly more skeptical about sensationalist claims about human rights in official enemy countries but that s probably being optimistic â rob robrousseau october 12 2021 the west has understood for a very very long time that it needs to keep china weak and small to retain supremacy thatâ s why so many narratives revolve around â liberatingâ balkanizing parts of china from beijing hereâ s a winston churchill quote from over a century ago i think we shall have to take the chinese in hand and regulate them i believe that as civilized nations become more powerful they will get more ruthless and the time will come when the world will impatiently bear the existence of great barbaric nations who may at any time arm themselves and menace civilized nations i believe in the ultimate partition of chinaâ i mean ultimate i hope we shall not have to do it in our day the aryan stock is bound to triumph this pattern of working to make china weaker and smaller is the same with hong kong where the us was actively working to facilitate the balkanization of that area before beijing shut down its interventionist operations itâ s the same with taiwan which has served as a us proxy for decades has previously housed us nuclear weapons is currently hosting us troops is the subject of an astonishingly virulent western propaganda campaign and plays a major role in us geostrategic interests itâ s the same with the militarization of the south china sea xi jinping had been offering a mutual demilitarization of the sea and instead obama ramped up tensions with the still ongoing â pivot to asiaâ which has seen a continuous buildup of us and allied military activity in the area as former un security council president kishore mahbubani explained in an interview last year â i quote a former american ambassador to china stapleton roy who told me â kishore when xi jinping made an offer to demilitarize the south china sea america should have grabbed that offer and agreed to stop all our military activities in the south china sea that would have pushed the chinese out â of course the americans would be out too but the south china sea is much more important to china than it is to america if america steps out the chinese military steps out and thatâ s a win for america right instead the u s navy responded by sending naval vessels so xi said â okay you reject my offer so be it â â itâ s the same even with the authoritarian domestic policies for which china is frequently criticized by the western world we learned in a recent bloomberg article that us spies are finding it hard to conduct operations against the chinese government because its strict policies make it impossible for them to function â cia officers in china face daunting challenges posed by chinaâ s burgeoning surveillance state which has blanketed chinese cities with surveillance cameras and employs sophisticated facial recognition software to track threats â claim the articleâ s authors bloomberg explains that chinaâ s anti corruption measures have made it much harder to recruit cia assets writing â xiâ s broad anti corruption campaign which has punished more than 1 5 million officials has also led to greater scrutiny of chinese officialsâ income making payments to potential sources far more problematic two former officials said â â those efforts were detailed extensively in 2017 by the new york times which said as many as a dozen u s sources were executed by china with others jailed in what represented one of the worst breaches ever of american spying networks â the article also notes â those efforts were detailed extensively in 2017 by the new york times which said as many as a dozen u s sources were executed by china with others jailed in what represented one of the worst breaches ever of american spying networks â the article also notes as john pilger documented in his prescient â the coming war on chinaâ the us has been surrounding the prc with military bases and weaponry building a â nooseâ around that nation which now includes the aforementioned long range missile systems currently under construction through the first island chain if any foreign power were doing this to the united states it would be considered an act of war and war would be declared immediately but it somehow never enters westernersâ heads that china could be the one who is responding defensively to an aggressor none of this means that china is run by innocent little girl scouts who never do anything wrong it just means itâ s clearly not the aggressor in these conflicts and that the picture we are presented with in the western empireâ s frenzied campaign to manipulate public thought about china is not based in reality the propaganda campaign is so pervasive and forceful that even people who are aware itâ s happening still commonly fall for its lies and distortions just because thereâ s so much of it coming from so many different directions the propaganda campaign against china is not going to go away itâ s going to get far louder crazier and more aggressive with each new shrill narrative that comes up research it with the question â how is this geared toward making china weaker and smaller â in mind youâ ll find something there every time it doesnâ t have to be this way thereâ s no good reason nations canâ t collaborate with each other toward the common good instead of squandering all their energy and resources in this insane struggle of us hegemonic conquest the word â detenteâ never enters into mainstream discourse because it does not serve the interests of the western imperialists who rule us but it does serve everyone else

e conomic development generally follows the pattern stated hereinafter initially there is the primary stage of an economy which comprises of activities that involve extraction production and selling of raw materials as economic growth obtains momentum the economy moves towards the next level known as the secondary stage the secondary stage is built on industrialisation saving and producing where more value has been added in the production moreover as an economy continues its journey and transforms into an advanced stage it moves from the secondary and to the tertiary stage the tertiary phase of an economy is where a country transforms from a developing to a developed economy at the tertiary stage the economic development brings with it a higher per capita income this means that in the tertiary stage people have higher purchasing power a higher standard of living and increased propensity to consume the economy also increases its reliance on imports because they are cheaper than homemade goods however not all economies follow this path necessarily in particular several countries may suffer from a premature de industrialisation stage where the share of commodity producing sector may begin to plunge without reaching its full potential in 1947 pakistan was indeed a preeminent agrarian underdeveloped and a newly independent nation with fewer industries few services and no substructure it was the windfall profits made by the mercantile group during the korean war in 1952 that eased the way to build a foundation between 1947 1952 the average gdp growth of pakistan gdp was 3 percent however when the aforesaid war broke out and the overall demand for commodities increased worldwide pakistan made the most of it with the gdp rising at a rate of 10 22 percent in 1953 that was the era during which we did not borrow a single penny later there was a worldwide slump when the war had ended nonetheless the pakistani economy was rapidly revitalised under ayub khan s era and in hindsight it has turned out to be the decade with the best performance as the average gdp growth stood at 6 8 percent in this phase one cannot underestimate the role of pakistan industrial development corporation pidc which provided financial and technical assistance and set up those industries where most of the private sector was reluctant to invest during this era pakistan progressed systematically towards industrialisation and because of that the pakistani economy moved from the primary stage to its secondary stage however soon after entering its secondary stage the pakistani economy received a rude shock in the shape of nationalisation it is considered a rude shock because the economy of pakistan took a vicious beating due to nationalisation as our gdp growth decreased from 6 8 percent to 4 4 percent in that period and simultaneously the role of the pidc shrunk at that time huge investors who were also known as the 22 rich families who had thrived during the 60s were brushed aside by the wave of nationalisation the trust of these huge investors was shattered and investment from all sectors started to decrease at an alarming pace due to this huge trust deficit a massive outflow of capital was witnessed in pakistan if it was not for the nationalisation era we might have continued the good trajectory our economy was headed towards and therefore we could also have had business magnates such as jeff bezos the ambanis and the mittals etc in pakistan nationalisation had a huge contribution in stopping the pakistani economy from entering into its tertiary stage in real terms unfortunately after that wave of nationalisation we again transited towards the wrong direction due to an economic burst because of the afghan war spill over for pakistan war brought much harm to our society and politics as pakistan went through unsettling affects due to the war in afghanistan due to our close proximity to afghanistan nevertheless pakistan is still even four decades down the line feeling the ferocious effects of the war in afghanistan pakistan s democratic transition after the death of general zia in 1988 was matched by the introduction of a new economic chain wherein inter alia pakistan joined the world of structural adjustment programme s in 1992 pakistan adopted the protection of economic reforms act pera with an aim to facilitate financial liberalisation however pera was misused by wrongdoers to amass wealth and ended up creating a huge parallel economy base the unfortunate bit is that the pakistani economy is still suffering from the repercussions of the pera due to the flourishing of the notorious hawala and hundi business speaking of unfortunate tales let me move on to another bad policy which was introduced in 1994 this policy was the policy for the independent power producers ipps fair to say that it has at least in my humble view transpired to be the worse economic decision that was opted for in the past three decades the said policy included private investors being allowed to build power generation projects at very attractive rates and any rise in the cost of fuels was to only be borne by consumers resultantly pakistan produced expensive power which gave rise to circular debt and made pakistan vulnerable to potential fuel crises aside from the aforesaid blundersome ipp policy let me candidly state one of the worst kept secrets of pakistan which is that it has been under the tutorship of multilateral lending institutions such as the international monetary fund imf and the world bank henceforth almost every decision bearing any consequences taken by the several regimes that have been in power was pre ordained by these multilateral lending agencies and pakistan has merely followed their decree during the 90s despite having nominal growth pakistan failed to build a strong growth foundation this had an adverse effect in the late 90s and early 2000s particularly in the commodity producing sector it was only after the tragedy of 9 11 that the growth rates in industries capital investment and of the economy picked up under pakistan s third autocratic government the economic impact during the years following the tragedy of 9 11 was similar to the economic impact that the afghanistan war had on pakistan to the extent that huge foreign aid facilitated pakistan s economy after pakistan declared its support to the usa as a non nato ally in the war in iraq and afghanistan furthermore pakistan witnessed a sudden rise in the frequency of terrorist attacks when pakistan began playing its role as a frontline country against terrorism in the aftermath of these terrorist attacks pakistan incurred a cost to the tune of 126 79 billion annexure iv economic survey 2017 18 indicating the economic impact of the war on terror faced by pakistan and that the growth rates of the economy investment and manufacturing dropped sharply the boom of the musharraf era was built upon the wrong foundations which included largely consumer led growth and investments in stock market sectors speculation with remittances and as stated above foreign aid driving the growth the missing link for then was a long term strategy and route to guide this money being spent in to better and productive sectors the pakistan people s party ppp in 2008 acquired countless problems created by musharraf and the caretaker governments as the average gdp growth during 2008 12 was 2 81 percent while the total debt and liabilities stood at a staggering at 66 6 percent of the gdp by the end of ppp s democratic regime moreover numerous external factors such as the oil and food prices that rose financial crisis in developed countries the security concern s due to the war on terror and damaging floods all added to the difficulties of the aforesaid democratic regime one must wonder as to what went wrong with the robust growth of the 1960s nationalisation of the 1970s structural adjustment of 1988 the 90s 2000s and onwards an unusual answer is that pakistan s efforts seem to be more tilted towards an economic bonanza rather than structural reforms additionally it may also be noted that pakistan s political economy is more dependent on external factors rather than internal factors as a result whenever pakistan s economy reached the secondary level we received windfall profits and we switched our economic priorities from produce and sell to borrow and consume without achieving the full potential of our secondary stage which translates into premature de industrialisation and hence real sectors ie growth driving sectors started to shrink under this premature de industrialisation our borrowing rises and it perishes the economic outlook of pakistan the government has not done any work for stabilisation recently they have been in talks to negotiate with the imf but the process has been really haphazard despite political stability and exceptional support from all the relevant quarters the government will not lift the economy to a proper balanced growth path unfortunately the economic policies are also based on the wrong premise whereby full potential is created in the secondary stage of our economy however the country jumps directly to the tertiary level just recently pakistan had pursued a car financing scheme driven by a low borrowing cost and low down payment at 15 percent which caused automobile financing to rise by 46 8 percent on year on year basis due to this policy the automobile financing hit an all time high of rs326 billion in august 2021 which raised our import bill however the sbp subsequently jammed their brakes on the financing of imported vehicles in order to slow down the deterioration in the trade and current account balance albeit a bit too late one can say is it necessary for pakistan to opt for such policies which is causing macroeconomic vulnerabilities such as a hike in inflation the widening of the current account deficit and the weakening of the currency parity similarly taking into account the fact that the unstable situation in afghanistan was likely to inflict more damage on the pakistan economy one wonders as to why this policy car financing scheme was introduced in the first place and what particularly was the rationale behind it the economy could go back to the stop go cycle moreover the recipe of the economy for that should be the following i the government must contain the secondary stage of their economy till five to ten years until they fully capitalise on industrialisation and gradually move toward a balanced growth path instead of endorsing any fancy policies ii keep the rate of interest rate low because it will help the government to reduce debt servicing in the short medium and long term low interest rates will also give a boost to businesses to operate on optimum level furthermore a lower interest rate will also facilitate bringing down inflation given the fact of rising commodity prices iii it is recommended to have a stable rate of currency parity which will facilitate the exporters in taking a long term view of their businesses and iv furthermore it is also suggested that stringent exchange controls shall be imposed on luxurious imports and abnormal trading of foreign exchange besides that the government will have to chalk on creating a long term policy plan for import substitution through encouraging domestic production of raw materials and resolving grave issues in the economy to become self sufficient which may help the country to improve its balance between international payments and receipts the writer is a senior tax consultant

it s not what the fed thinks it is by robert reich last week the fed s policy committee announced it would both end its bond buying program and likely raise interest rates sooner than had been expected inflation is more persistent and higher and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown fed chair jerome powell explained translated powell and the fed are about to slow the economy even though we re still at least 4 million jobs short of where we were before the pandemic and even though as a result millions of american workers won t get the raises they deserve that s a big mistake powell s medicine has nothing to do with the real reason for inflation the increasing concentration of the american economy into the hands of a relative few corporate giants with the power to raise prices if markets were competitive companies would keep their prices down in order to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers but they re raising prices even as they rake in record profits how can this be the answer is they have so much market power they can raise prices with impunity the underlying problem is not inflation it s lack of competition corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits in april procter gamble announced it would start charging more for consumer staples ranging from diapers to toilet paper citing rising costs for raw materials such as resin and pulp and higher expenses to transport goods that was rubbish p g continues to rake in huge profits in the quarter ending september 30 after its price increases went into effect it reported a whopping 24 7 percent profit margin it even spent 3 billion during the quarter buying back its own stock the reason it could raise prices and rake in more money is p g faces almost no competition the lion s share of the market for diapers to take one example is controlled by just two companies p g and kimberly clark which coordinate their prices and production it was hardly a coincidence that kimberly clark announced price increases similar to p g s at the same time p g announced its own price increases or consider another consumer product duopoly pepsico the parent company of frito lay gatorade quaker tropicana and other brands and coca cola in april pepsico announced it was increasing prices blaming higher costs for some ingredients freight and labor that was pure baloney the company didn t have to raise prices it recorded 3 billion in operating profits through september if pepsico faced tough competition it could never have gotten away with it consumers would have deserted it for lower priced competitors but pepsico clearly colluded with its only major competitor coca cola which announced similar price increases at about the same time as pepsico and has increased its profit margins to 28 9 percent half of the recent rise in grocery prices is from meat products beef pork and poultry just four large conglomerates control most meat processing they re raising their prices and coordinating their price increases even as they re scoring record profits here again they re using inflation as an excuse you see the same pattern all over the american economy since the 1980s two thirds of all american industries have become more concentrated monsanto now sets the prices for most of the nation s seed corn wall street has consolidated into five giant banks airlines have merged from 12 carriers in 1980 to four today which now control 80 percent of domestic seating capacity the merger of boeing and mcdonnell douglas has left the us with just one large producer of civilian aircraft boeing three giant cable companies dominate broadband comcast at t and verizon a handful of drug companies control the pharmaceutical industry pfizer eli lilly johnson johnson bristol myers squibb and merck all this concentration gives corporations the power to raise prices because it makes it easy for them to coordinate price increases with the handful of other companies in their same industry without risking the possibility of losing customers who have no other choice in sum inflation isn t driving these price increases corporate power is driving them fed chair powell worries about the specter of wage price inflation in which wage hikes force corporations to raise their prices which in turn eat up the wage increases and hence cause workers to demand higher wages but corporations aren t being forced to raise their prices they re enjoying record profits they can easily absorb any wage increases without their raising prices the sole reason they re raising prices and eating away whatever wage increases they ve provided their workers is they face little or no competition so what s the appropriate government response not slowing down the economy this will only hurt millions of workers who are just beginning to get the raises they deserve the problem at the heart of the economy is amenable to only one thing the aggressive use of antitrust laws to bust up monopolies this will take time perhaps years in the meantime biden and the democrats could do something with a more immediate effect enact a windfall profits tax applicable to any large corporation that raises its prices during the same quarter its profits have risen robert reich s writes at robertreich substack com his latest book is the system

last week her government in london announced a list of settlements applying for a change in their entirely arbitrary civic status this is supposed to be a good thing towns which fancy being cities include storied st andrews dumfries dunfermline greenock oban ayr and elgin and the erm perhaps less historic livingston i only mention this short list for the benefit of voters who might want to ask their councillors why they are wasting their efforts on this meaningless nonsense sorry this sounds mean spirited a contest for city status is usually seen as a fun distraction a harmless enough little manifestation of british weirdness sorry eccentricity and i suppose somebody will pop along in a moment to argue that city status will be a boost for tourism sure maybe but no apart from anything else these periodic royal to dos elevating towns to cities must baffle our fellow europeans after all most of them get by without just the one word for both town and city the latter usually being translated as a big version of the former americans at least make a bit more sense when they say cities they mean settlements with self government and that of course is not the case for any of the towns in britain or her last remaining imperial possessions vying to be cities new town livvy might be about to become a tourist mecca with city status thanks to her maj but it is not going to be deemed fit to run its own street cleaning or make its own planning decisions that will still be up to west lothian council for me this is the rub all the places in scotland which want to be cities are great towns but cannot run any of their own affairs residents i am sure will be quick to point out that these communities are not perfect and that is certainly true and some are far more prosperous and successful than others but these are strong distinct communities me i think we should be celebrating them as towns and thinking about how we restore local democracy rather than just civic pride in scotland eyes will roll at the prospect of another round of local government reform there is not much appetite for changing council borders in scotland fair enough but that does not mean we should not be looking at how to empower communities especially towns in recent years there has been a real focus on cities on large conurbations as engines of economic activity education and creativity this comes with funding for example for city region growth funds planners will say that makes sense and i am sure they have a point but are we at risk of leaving towns and villages behind we might be take housing there was a time when any picture editor wanting a stock picture of poverty substandard homes basically would dispatch a photographer to a glasgow council scheme now they would aim for a former pit village in the central belt just before christmas i was in the falkirk braes where old local authority homes from the outside look stout inside residents including young children and the elderly were freezing why doors and windows had not been replaced for decades and heating systems were ill suited and terrifyingly expensive and not just for the many residents who depend on stingy welfare payments on the last saturday before christmas distressed and distraught residents picketed the local authority hq there were people there whose electricity bills were hitting 150 a week power executives told the local mp that some council house residents were using as much electricity as mansions with heated pools these homes are just not fit for the 21st century campaigners have bandied together to form a group called falkirk s forgotten villages they are making life very difficult for council chiefs they might be cold in the braes but they have real community spirit but the name of their campaign has real resonance across europe there are small towns and villages which are forgotten perhaps because a local employer closed or simply because young people are sucked in to bigger cities and never come back in spain greece and croatia for example local authorities have looked to scotland of all places for lessons in preserving remote communities they of course are thinking about efforts in the highlands and islands such as community ownerships the uhi and h i development and air and ferry subsidies northern scots often scoff at such interest pointing out that swathes of their region are still depopulating but scotland by international standards looks like a relative success take inverness it is now practically a boom town sorry boom city the highland capital got a status upgrade but no powers a while back indeed highland council is now bidding for inverness s provost to become a lord as part of jubilee celebrations we really do have forgotten towns and villages in the lowlands we could waste our time in royal fripperies or we could start to champion these places and give voice and power to those that live there that might mean better local democracy more tenant control of public housing or just better buses but should it involve pinning our hopes on arbitrary royal whims about meaningless civic status britain is weird but we can choose not to be our

the consensus remains that all paths to congress go through mar a lago that to succeed in washington you had to kiss the ring in palm beach flattering trump and his ultra loyal base of tens of millions of ardent devotees republican politicians who fail to toe the line know they risk a public dressing down and primary challenge at best and death threats to their families if his supporters were particularly inflamed despite losing his social media megaphone his endorsements still energize grassroots supporters drive donations and in some cases clear away competitors and force retirements tommy goodwin a washington based political consultant and lobbyist told afp some prominent republicans are seizing on the recent governors races to call for a course correction however navigating around trump and his big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him by the democrats all time low in virginia republican multimillionaire glenn youngkin won by far exceeding trump s 2020 showing in the suburbs especially among independents and women trump immediately took credit but in reality youngkin soft pedaled the former reality tv star s support and did all he could in the

scott olson getty images north america afp file in new jersey too republican jack ciattarelli started out very pro trump even speaking at a stop the steal rally in 2020 but distanced himself from the ex president during the campaign proper the suburbs are likely to be the key battlegrounds again next year when the stakes will be control of the house of representatives and senate and 36 governorships yet trump is far less popular there than in the countryside the takeaway for many republicans is that borrowing heavily from trump s playbook while assiduously avoiding the man himself could be the key the former president s approval sank to an all time low of 34 percent after the january 6 insurrection when thousands of his supporters stormed the us capitol to stop lawmakers certifying joe biden s victory trump has since issued a number of statements praising the insurrectionists and defending their threats on the life of his vice president mike pence senate minority

a crying child in the candy aisle of a packed grocery store demanding more soda while he throws bags of candy bars at other children peter loge an associate professor at george washington university told afp it is difficult to imagine him demurring so that others can have their turn in the spotlight the past is never dead trump s bully pulpit isn t what it was before social media bans effectively curbed his day to day influence and in any case his electoral secret sauce was never as powerful as he claimed republicans did fairly well down ballot in 2020 keeping their senate loss to the narrowest possible margin and almost taking the house but stumbled at the presidential level president donald trump pictured at a pittsburgh campaign rally in september 2020 remains a hero to the millions of disaffected new voters he brought to the republican cause in 2016 mandel ngan afp file and trump is the first president since herbert hoover nearly a century ago to lose the house the senate and the white house during a single term so far trump endorsed candidates haven t fared particularly well said sam nelson associate professor and chair of the university of toledo s political science department while republican primary candidates actively seek his endorsement valuable in republican races that same endorsement can be somewhat dangerous in a general election in that it motivates democrats to turn out to vote against the trump supported candidate loge believes challengers who think they have nothing to lose may emerge alongside others concerned about the future of the republican party and the country the 2022 midterm elections will also go a long way to determining trump s level of support in 2024 loge told afp if trump backed candidates win primary and general

elissa nadworny host earlier this month the new york city council passed a ban on gas powered heat and stove appliances in newly constructed buildings the move makes it the largest city in the country to pass such a ban which will take effect in 2023 for buildings under seven stories while taller buildings have until 2027 to make the switch some say this could be the beginning of the end of gas powered appliances for home use a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions however critics warn that it may be too early to turn our backs on natural gas and that electrifying buildings only moves carbon emissions upstream to fossil fuel plants to talk more about this we ve invited russell unger to join us he co leads the building electrification initiative at rmi a nonprofit think tank that specializes in clean energy russell unger welcome russell unger thank you nadworny so first i wonder if you could talk about why the ban what s bad about gas powered heat and stove appliances unger math tells us that if we are going to decarbonize our cities our states our country we can t be burning fossil fuels in buildings anymore across the country buildings are responsible for about 40 of u s greenhouse gas emissions and in places like new york where there s not a lot of emissions from transport it s much higher in new york it s about 70 of the carbon emissions so the only way to address our carbon emissions in a big city like that is to stop burning fossil fuels in buildings the only way we re going to get to our goals across the country is to stop that as well nadworny and so tell me about your reaction to the new york city ban it sounds like it s going to make a difference unger it s a huge step i mean this is the largest jurisdiction in the country to make a move like this and it s new york city which is a bellwether for so many things whether it s other policies related to building and energy like requiring buildings to measure their energy performance every year it started outside new york but once new york did it a lot of cities followed suit and it s a bellwether generally for the whole country if you look at other things like stopping smoking inside bars it was only yesterday when that was required and new york went out on a limb it seemed and now you don t get to bars where there s allowed to smoke anymore it s also the first cold climate to enact a policy like that and that s really significant because electrifying a building is quite different in a cold climate than a warm climate like san francisco because we re electrifying heating nadworny well so i m curious because the ban is for new buildings and new york city of course has a lot of old buildings many of which have gas appliances so how does this play into kind of the impact a ban like this would have unger well there s a substantial impact just from the new buildings so according to our analysis we d be saving or new york city would be saving 2 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 that s about the equivalent of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released by 450 000 cars driving for a year but that s not going to be the limit of the impact so like right now if you live in new york city and you have a home and you call up the company that installed your furnace because you re having a problem and you ask them about a heat pump an electric heat pump no guarantee whether or not they re going to know what those are or recommend them once this law goes into effect every one of those companies will have had experience with heat pumps because they re going to be doing new installs so we ll see the contractors having direct experience with all electric equipment and we ll see the distributors having that in stock readily and you know we ll see cascade effects into the existing buildings as well nadworny so this is about electrification and i wonder why is electrification considered a better alternative to sources like natural gas unger when we re using fossil fuels in our homes and offices we re burning fossil fuels there s no way around it and fossil fuels release carbon emissions and other pollutants and we re contributing to climate change when we electrify we re pulling power off the grid the grid has a mixture of sources we also by using electricity can use types of heating like heat pumps that are you know have multiple folds of efficiency just the way they work by moving the heat so even today in most jurisdictions electrification is going to reduce carbon emissions and then looking forward to the targets that we have around the country that will become like a better and better carbon math nadworny now i ve always kind of been told or thought that gas stoves were better for cooking because they provided more even heating and i can imagine a lot of listeners kind of listening to this and saying is that true is that a misconception because this is a change to a way of life unger well i guess it depends how much you cook and whether you consider it a change to a way of life you know there are you know well known chefs that use induction i mean it is more common to use gas but that s also the result of you know 50 plus years of campaigning by the gas industry which has tested this and found you know what people don t care what powers their hot water heater they don t care what powers their heating system but for some reason they care what s going on in their stove and so that s why when you think about you know gas the kind of classic image is that burner on the stove and that s not an accident that is 50 plus years of very active investment into marketing by the gas industry nadworny yeah well given how serious climate change is do you think a ban like this goes far enough unger it s not going to be all that we you know everything we need to get there eventually we re going to have to change over as you noted equipment in existing buildings but this sets the table for it we re doing it in a place where easiest to do it which is the new buildings we re building a market by having kind of the hvac contractors the designers the distributors kind of poised and ready for this expand so it s the place to start nadworny that was russell unger of the building electrification initiative at rmi that s a think tank that focuses on sustainability thanks so much for being here unger thanks so much for having me transcript provided by npr copyright npr

the coronavirus pandemic continues to test humanitarian responses while the world faces questions about how to ensure equal access to vaccines as of december 2021 8 billion covid 19 vaccine doses had been administered around the world but the majority have been in high income and upper middle income countries according to the world health organization it s unclear when and in some cases how vaccines will be widely available for people caught in crisis zones the covid 19 pandemic is driving record breaking humanitarian needs global aid response plans willl reach more than 41 billion in 2022 below you ll find data exploring coronavirus trends and vaccine issues in key crisis areas a table showing the worldwide picture and a global map with select stories data trends in key crises news vaccine access data the global picture map global coverage the pandemic doubled the number of people who needed humanitarian aid worldwide in 2020 according to the un setting up a record 35 billion appeal in 2021 covid 19 continues to contribute to record setting humanitarian costs with a 41 billion price tag set for 2022 beyond the immediate humanitarian impacts the cost of helping the world s most vulnerable 10 percent facing covid 19 s socio economic repercussions could total 90 billion according to un estimates the world bank estimates the pandemic pushed between 119 million and 124 million new poor into extreme poverty there s a clear divide in who has access to coronavirus vaccines warnings of vaccine nationalism hoarding and queue jumping came to fruition as wealthier countries scooped up early supplies repeat waves and dangerous new variants have festered amid the uneven vaccine distribution most of the 8 billion doses administered globally as of december 2021 were in high and upper middle income countries according to the world health organization we all know that this incredible achievement has been marred by horrific inequity said the who s director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus the who inked agreements to reserve some 1 3 billion doses for 92 low and middle income countries under the covax programme which was created with the goal of ensuring equal vaccine access including doses for at least 20 percent of countries populations but wealthier countries circumvented covax by signing dozens of bilateral deals with manufacturers driving up prices and delaying covax deliveries countries began receiving their first covax doses in late february and early march initial planning called for some 330 million doses enough to cover 3 3 percent of participating countries populations in the first half of 2021 in march india restricted exports to deal with its worsening second wave adding to global shortages india s serum institute was slated to supply 70 percent of covax s initial pipeline dose deliveries picked up speed in july and august as wealthier nations that bought up early supplies began donating excess jabs there are many factors driving global vaccine shortfalls and slow rollouts there s also a worldwide shortage of the raw materials needed to produce vaccines which has affected all manufacturers for example trade barriers export controls and logistics have created bottlenecks that restrict global supply and distribution despite having access to limited stocks some countries have struggled to get their rollouts off the ground because of weak healthcare infrastructure inadequate funding or vaccine hesitancy most jabs donated by wealthier countries are also close to expiry with a shelf life of less than three months making it harder to conduct vaccine rollouts on short notice there s not enough focus on how to distribute vaccines once they arrive moving doses from airport tarmacs and into people s arms the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies warns beyond vaccine access at the country level there are fears that marginalised groups often left out of government health planning at the best of times migrants refugees and other people in crises for example are at the very back of the queue some 60 to 80 million people live in areas controlled by non state armed groups the international committee of the red cross estimates those living in humanitarian emergencies or in settings that are not under the control of national governments are at risk of being left behind and must be part of covid 19 vaccination efforts warned the inter agency standing committee an umbrella group for humanitarian responders some 167 million people worldwide could be excluded from covid 19 vaccination programmes the iasc estimates at least 91 of 162 countries monitored by the un s refugee agency had started vaccinating refugees or asylum seekers as of late june jordan nepal rwanda and serbia were among countries where refugees were receiving covid 19 vaccines on an equal footing to citizens the unhcr said in april at least 123 countries include refugees in their immunisation plans on paper but in practice vaccine shortages shorthanded health systems red tape or fear of arrest also keep refugees and migrants on the outside the covax programme includes plans for a humanitarian buffer which would see five percent of the total doses stockpiled for acute outbreaks or for use by humanitarian groups the buffer was formally approved by the board of gavi the global vaccine alliance on 23 march the buffer is a last resort for people with no access to vaccines especially in areas controlled by armed groups that are out of reach of government health systems countries can apply for vaccines from the buffer as can humanitarian groups including un agencies red cross and red crescent societies local and international ngos and civil society groups assuming covax secures its goal of two billion doses in 2021 the humanitarian buffer would equate to 100 million doses the costs of actually delivering vaccines from this stockpile aren t clear current global humanitarian appeals do not include vaccine rollout costs drug manufacturers also want aid groups to take on legal liabilities if they source vaccines through the buffer an early stumbling block in getting the would be stockpile up and running other vaccine news rohingya in bangladesh s camps received their first covid 19 vaccines on 10 august nearly five months after the government postponed rollouts for refugees rohingya are meant to be included in bangladesh s national vaccine plans but the government postponed a march start date in the camps because it hadn t received any deliveries from the covax vaccine sharing scheme national rollouts were launched in january with jabs that were bought or donated the unhcr said some 48 000 rohingya older than 55 are eligible for the initial vaccine drive the camps have a population of roughly 900 000 this comes as the delta variant continues its surge in bangladesh and beyond the rohingya camps recorded more than 2 500 cases as of early august but test positivity rates were higher in the surrounding cox s bazar district and nationwide people in these camps are living in the shadow of the global vaccine divide said hrusikesh harichandan of the ifrc widespread vaccinations are critical to contain this deadly virus haiti which has seen recent spikes in covid 19 cases received its first delivery of 500 000 vaccines in july haiti is one of the last countries in the americas to start its vaccination campaign which initially targeted workers in clinics and hospitals earlier in the year it rejected a shipment of astrazeneca vaccines pfizer and biontech announced plans to manufacture their covid 19 vaccine at south africa s biovac institute the first doses will be produced in 2022 and will be available exclusively to african countries however médecins sans frontières described the deal as restrictive and said it wouldn t be enough to achieve vaccine independence on the african continent the united states plans to donate half a billion covid 19 vaccine doses around the globe but north korea won t be on the gift list we do not currently have plans to share vaccines with the dprk a state department spokesperson said on 22 july using an abbreviation of the country s full name we very much remain concerned about the human rights situation north korea has claimed it has no covid 19 cases though many are sceptical its borders have been mostly closed since early 2020 and the country is veering toward food shortfalls later this year analysts warn north korea has rejected astrazeneca vaccines through the covax sharing scheme reuters reported though it may be considering donations from russia the health agencies behind covax have inked supply deals with chinese manufacturers sinovac and sinopharm expanding the vaccine sharing scheme s pipeline amid global shortages the agreements would see 110 million doses made available between july and september with an option for millions more through early 2022 while still struggling with late deliveries and global shortfalls covax has expanded its longer term pipeline to more than 2 8 billion doses largely through pledges from wealthier nations who scooped up early supplies and rolled out vaccines first however severe short term shortages continue in most countries that are buckling under new outbreak waves covax is also warning countries and donors to prepare health systems to handle what could be a sudden jump in vaccine supplies in late 2021 vaccine scepticism is frustrating covid 19 immunsiation plans around the globe but there s nuance behind the doubt hesitancy about vaccines is high in papua new guinea for example despite outbreaks that triggered a national emergency and aid pledges one june survey suggested most respondents wouldn t take a vaccine rather than clear opposition however many are still making up their minds a separate poll of university students allowed respondents to choose unsure rather than simply yes or no and nearly half did so many said they were influenced by social media debates and a shortage of clear information from the government this suggests that opposition to vaccines isn t so clear cut and that better information and public health campaigns that build trust can put a dent in the hesitancy many minds are not made up on the issue of vaccination researcher rohan fox said writing on the pacific focused devpolicy blog red tape onerous registration systems long distances and language barriers still keep vaccines from refugees and asylum seekers the unhcr said on 24 june most countries the agency monitors explicitly include refugees and asylum seekers in their covid 19 vaccination plans though only 91 of 162 countries had started vaccinating these groups as of late june what does better inclusion look like for starters breaking down registration roadblocks and making it easier to get jabs moldova and serbia for example brought vaccines directly to people in asylum centres the unhcr said while senegal and cameroon let refugees register in nearby health centres there s a glaring gender divide in the covid 19 vaccine rollout in indian administered kashmir more men than women are getting vaccinated a medical officer working on kashmir s immunisation campaign told the new humanitarian health workers attribute this in part to rampant rumours tying vaccines to infertility though there s no evidence to support a link vaccine hesitancy has been exacerbated by widespread mistrust of the central government in a heavily militarised region facing surging infections a battered health system and vaccine shortages afghanistan s covid 19 caseload has risen to alarming levels the un said in a 1 july briefing afghanistan s government asked its ambassadors to seek help to obtain emergency oxygen supplies on 4 june amnesty international said both oxygen and vaccines are urgently needed afghanistan is one of dozens of countries facing vaccine shortages due to global supply failures and export restrictions in india as of 1 july some 898 000 people had been vaccinated with at least one dose about 2 3 percent of the population global vaccine shortages are costing lives as coronavirus waves surge in under immunised areas but some countries are also lagging behind on rollouts with doses they ve already received at least 14 countries in africa have used up all or most of their vaccine stocks but at least 23 others have used less than half their doses the who said on 17 june roughly 1 25 million astrazeneca doses in 18 countries are set to expire by the end of august the agency said g7 countries have pledged to share at least 870 million vaccine doses with at least half to be delivered by the end of the year the who said many countries will need help to ensure their health systems can conduct large scale rollouts with the expected deliveries it urged multilateral banks to urgently release promised funding uganda has exhausted its vaccine supply but faces an exponential rise in cases with an overwhelmed health system aid group mercy corps warned on 18 june only 2 percent of the population has been vaccinated said the group s country director edward simiyu we have no way to know how far the virus has spread in uganda because of the low testing capacity in the country he said the health systems are overwhelmed and sooner or later there will be no space or adequate healthcare staff to admit severely ill patients who need emergency and critical care services it s a ticking time bomb plans to allocate up to 100 million covid 19 vaccine doses to humanitarian troublespots by the end of 2021 could be derailed because neither drug companies nor aid groups want to shoulder the risk of potential lawsuits covax has opened up applications to aid groups wanting vaccine stocks from its so called humanitarian buffer a planned stockpile of emergency doses but humanitarian agencies including the world health organization unicef the red cross movement and médecins sans frontières say they worry they won t be able to apply for or administer the vaccines if they re expected to take on legal liability if things go wrong their concerns were summed up in a 2 june position paper written by a working group of health agencies and obtained by the new humanitarian we cannot vaccinate the world through donations alone nor will donations address the underlying systemic flaws that landed us in this dire situation of vaccine inequity the united states will supply 500 million more vaccine doses through covax on top of 80 million previously announced president joe biden said on 11 june deliveries are expected to start in august 2021 the united kingdom will also donate 100 million excess doses within the next year prime minister boris johnson announced these doses would dwarf the covax programme s current supplies essentially turning a programme meant to ensure equal global access into a vehicle for donations aid group médecins sans frontières said the donations were welcome but not urgent enough sharing vaccine doses is the most expeditious way to save lives right now but we cannot vaccinate the world through donations alone nor will donations address the underlying systemic flaws that landed us in this dire situation of vaccine inequity said carrie teicher director of programmes for msf in the us it will take years to control covid 19 in latin america and the caribbean without a boost in vaccine supplies the pan american health organization warned on 9 june in countries like guatemala honduras and trinidad and tobago less than 1 percent of the population has been vaccinated the inequities in vaccination coverage are undeniable said paho director carissa f etienne unfortunately vaccine supply is concentrated in a few nations while most of the world waits for doses to trickle out the us laid out plans to share 19 million vaccine doses through covax it s part of a cache of 80 million doses the us plans to donate to other countries three quarters of this through the un backed sharing scheme the us has repeatedly said it will not use vaccines to secure favors from other countries an apparent shot at so called vaccine diplomacy bilateral donations employed by countries like china and russia still the us has picked where the first 19 million doses will go and donations will be branded to convey that they are from the american people a us state department official said on 4 june we have identified the countries we want these vaccines to go to and we ll work with covax to have them delivered the us is also reserving six million doses for regional priorities and partner recipients the who approved the sinovac vaccine for emergency use on 1 june the second chinese made jab to get the green light easy storage could make the vaccine a valuable addition to covax s barren pipeline a chinese government spokesperson said the first batch of sinopharm the other vaccine rolled off production on 31 may though neither sinopharm nor sinovac have distribution deals with covax vaccine shipments to africa have ground to a near halt even as several countries are facing rising cases the who said on 3 june covid 19 vaccine shipments continue to slow down the health agency said bangladesh received 100 000 pfizer biontech vaccine doses on 1 june the country s first shipments through the covax programme the government earlier suspended vaccination plans for rohingya refugees citing shortages bangladesh had been scheduled to receive nearly 11 million astrazeneca doses by the end of may but india s coronavirus crisis and export restrictions have depleted covax stocks it s still unclear when vaccinations for refugees will begin among the rohingya refugees in the camps in bangladesh not a single vaccine has been administered yet given the scarcity of supplies in the country the unhcr said in a 1 june statement which warned of vaccine shortages in countries hosting millions of refugees countries in africa need 20 million astrazeneca doses within six weeks to complete immunisations the who warned on 27 may calling for urgent vaccine sharing amid global shortages the who also called for another 200 million doses of any kind in order to vaccinate 10 percent of the region s population the global agencies behind covax the vaccine sharing programme are urging countries with surpluses or higher coverage rates to share their doses and swap places in supply queues if we do not address the current urgent shortfall the consequences could be catastrophic they said in a statement the programme had planned to secure 1 3 billion doses for lower income countries by the end of 2021 as of late may it had delivered about 5 5 percent of this target in india a stark digital divide determines who has better access to vaccines as surging caseloads expose shortfalls and overwhelm hospitals activists say onerous online procedures have turned vaccine access into an exclusionary often lottery like process in a country where about half the population lacks internet access we want to get vaccinated but we have no idea how to go about it no one has reached out to us sarfaraz ahmed a driver in mumbai told the new humanitarian by the end of may india s second wave started to stabilise in cities like delhi but activists fear the divides could grow even more acute as the pandemic swells in rural areas where health systems and resources are more fragile and internet connectivity more sporadic people are forgetting a basic fact that vaccination is to be carried out by healthcare workers not by it engineers said srinivas kodali a researcher with the free software movement of india sri lanka is short 600 000 astrazeneca doses needed to finish a second covid 19 vaccination round the un reported on 24 may the island nation received a quarter million doses through covax in march with another 1 1 million doses expected by the end of may but vaccine shortages and export restrictions in india where the serum institute manufactures the bulk of early covax supplies have triggered shortfalls across the globe like several south asian nations sri lanka faces a rapid rise in infections india s serum institute won t restart vaccine exports including to the covax programme until the end of the year the manufacturer said in a 18 may statement the announcement from the world s largest vaccine manufacturer and the main supplier for the covax pipeline comes as global shortages hit predominantly lower income countries struggling with soaring covid 19 caseloads the serum institute s missed deliveries means covax will have a vaccine shortfall of 190 million doses by the end of june unicef said on 17 may the un backed scheme is rushing to get other vaccines into its pipeline but the vast majority of these doses won t be available until late 2021 or next year the who has urged manufacturers to prioritise covax and move deliveries forward to 2021 we need doses right now said tedros the who s director general also on 17 may the us pledged to share 80 million vaccine doses for global use as people living in richer countries hit the reset button this summer and their lives start to look normal in africa our lives will stay on hold global bottlenecks could dangerously stall vaccine plans in africa in the coming months but funding shortages are also delaying larger rollouts in countries that have supplies the who said on 20 may eight countries have used up all their initial vaccine doses after india stopped vaccine exports but at least 20 have administered less than half their stocks the who said some 3 billion is needed to actually get vaccines into people s arms from hiring and training vaccinators to logistics and better communication to combat vaccine hesitancy but most countries on the continent have financial plans to cover rollouts to only three percent of their populations the agency said however there s still a clear shortage of vaccines the continent received only a quarter of 66 million projected covax doses between february and may as people living in richer countries hit the reset button this summer and their lives start to look normal in africa our lives will stay on hold said dr matshidiso moeti the who s director for africa government policies are blocking access to vaccines for migrants in at least 53 countries the un s migration agency iom said on 18 may many nations have promised to include refugees asylum seekers migrants and other groups in their vaccine rollouts but red tape and bureaucracy are frequent roadblocks basic issues like requiring national identification or residence permits in order to register for vaccines are common the iom found discrimination may block transgender women in indonesia from getting vaccinated the international commission of jurists warned on 17 may indonesians will need an electronic identity card to enrol in vaccine rollouts planned for july but many trans women lack the family cards needed to register if they have fled their homes due to violence and persecution health organisations working in myanmar s ethnic border areas are calling for international support for covid 19 prevention testing and vaccines the ethnic health committee which comprises several groups delivering healthcare in areas controlled or contested by ethnic armed organisations said they re facing growing medical shortages and rising displacement since myanmar s 1 february coup in a 6 may statement the committee called for increased international support directly to who bear responsibility for the growing displaced populations in their areas while combating the pandemic the statement asked neighbouring china bangladesh india and thailand to allow covid 19 vaccines into border areas as a humanitarian gesture myanmar s public health system has virtually collapsed since the coup aid groups say and coronavirus testing and treatment has been severely disrupted refugees and asylum seekers in serbia are receiving their first covid 19 vaccine doses the who said on 12 may many countries have promised to include these groups in vaccination rollouts but far fewer have followed through a who advisory committee recommends countries include displaced people refugees asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants among priority groups in countries vaccine planning often after frontline health workers and older people there is a rush to diversify the covax pipeline amid india s supply shortages a who committee approved the chinese made sinopharm vaccine for emergency use on 7 may adding another candidate that could be included in global rollouts the who approved the us made moderna vaccine on 30 april and gavi announced it had struck a deal to buy 500 million doses for covax but the first 34 million moderna jabs aren t expected to be available until the last quarter of 2021 on 6 may gavi also announced an agreement to buy 350 million doses of the novavax vaccine candidate which hasn t yet received emergency approval from the who the who approved the single shot johnson johnson vaccine in march though these jabs are still pending a supply agreement and wouldn t be available until the second half of the year the gavi spokesperson said current covax stocks comprise only three vaccines two versions of astrazeneca including the serum institute s and the pfizer biontech jab the us will support temporarily waiving intellectual property rights on covid 19 vaccines officials announced on 5 may advocates for a so called people s vaccine believe trade protection is a major barrier to widespread availability the who called it a bold move to end the pandemic as quickly as possible oxfam india said a waiver will open up production to more manufacturers in the global south and help us end the current vaccine apartheid but a pharmaceutical industry group said that waiving patents will not address other problems trade barriers supply chain bottlenecks global shortages of raw materials and a willingness by rich countries to start sharing doses with poor countries india s covid 19 burden has direct repercussions for global vaccine rollouts from postponed vaccinations in refugee camps to shortages in dozens of countries still waiting for doses india is the leading vaccine supplier to much of the world through covax and touted generous donations as part of its vaccine diplomacy push now it s struggling to vaccinate its own population amid shortages and the world s fastest rising covid 19 caseload in recent weeks it has fast tracked foreign made vaccines and restricted exports delaying covax deliveries to many countries almost entirely reliant on the un backed programme with india s vaccine supply shortages some countries worry that second doses could be missed which would limit vaccine effectiveness nepal for example may not have enough stock to complete vaccinations for some 1 3 million people who already received their first jab the kathmandu post reported countries almost entirely dependent on covax supplies are seeing their early stocks dwindle ten countries in africa have used up more than two thirds of their supplies a who official said in april on 3 may the who said 20 million doses are urgently needed to cover interruptions in supply triggered by increased demands for vaccines in india rohingya refugees so far are the only group in bangladesh society which is yet to benefit from the vaccination another sign of how india s vaccine problems reverberate facing rising caseloads and vaccine shortfalls bangladesh has postponed covid 19 vaccinations for some 900 000 rohingya refugees until covax supplies arrive according to the unhcr vaccinations had been slated to launch in the refugee camps on 27 march no new date has been announced rohingya refugees so far are the only group in bangladesh society which is yet to benefit from the vaccination a unhcr spokesperson told the new humanitarian on paper rohingya are still included in bangladesh s national vaccination plans there have been relatively few covid 19 cases among rohingya refugees about 571 as of early may but infections and test positivity rates are rising in the wider cox s bazar district the who says pushing health workers to double down on prevention measures frontline workers and refugees older than 40 are to be prioritised when vaccines reach the camps according to government plans the refugee camps have a young population more than half of residents are under 18 there are an estimated 30 000 people older than 60 on paper many countries have committed to including refugees migrants and other frequently neglected groups in covid 19 vaccination plans but there are plenty of obstacles in pakistan some 1 4 million afghans who hold refugee cards will be included the unhcr reported in april but it s unclear whether unregistered afghans numbering in the hundreds of thousands will be in neighbouring iran the government says it will include both refugees and undocumented afghans but like many countries it s reliant on covax and donations for early stocks and supplies are limited roughly 80 afghans and iraqis in iran have received their first doses the unhcr reported on 13 may some countries require government issued documents to get vaccines the unhcr said it s asking authorities in india to let refugees use unhcr issued documents amnesty international said vulnerable groups across south asia including dalits ethnic minorities day labourers refugees and migrants are often excluded partly due to lack of documentation or online access and because of poor communication marginalised groups across south asia have been effectively locked out by practical barriers amnesty s yamini mishra said who you are and where you live should not determine access to the vaccine there s a widening covid 19 vaccine gap between richer and poorer countries in europe only 0 4 percent of people in low income countries like kyrgyzstan moldova and ukraine have been vaccinated while richer european countries have immunised about 17 7 percent of their populations the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies said on 21 april ukraine received its first 117 000 doses through covax on 16 april jordan has launched what the unhcr says are the world s first vaccination centres in refugee camps vaccination centres opened in zaatari camp in february and in azraq camp in mid march jordan was already one of the world s first countries to begin coronavirus vaccinations for refugees some 3 500 refugees in jordan have received a covid 19 vaccine as of 16 april the unhcr reported and more than 10 percent of camp residents have registered for vaccinations the us hit pause on its rollout of the johnson johnson vaccine on 13 april before declaring it safe and effective days later in a move that could have repercussions for countries with spiralling covid 19 infections but few vaccine options the us centers for disease control and prevention reviewed the vaccine produced by j j after six people from more than 6 8 million doses administered developed rare blood clots it s unclear what caused the blood clots which can occur naturally and can also be caused by covid 19 itself soon after south africa paused its j j rollout as a precautionary measure before also lifting the suspension days later several countries previously paused use of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine for similar reasons though europe s drugs regulator and a who committee later declared the vaccine safe the covax equity scheme which is supplying much of the world s vaccines is heavily reliant on both vaccines precautionary suspensions are unnecessarily eroding vaccine confidence in countries where there are no other options said ayoade alakija co chair of the african union s africa vaccine delivery alliance people are saying if you don t want it out there why are you saying we should take it this is the problem we are running into she told the bbc people are saying if you don t want it out there why are you saying we should take it decades worst flooding in timor leste hit the country s covid 19 vaccination plans just as they were getting underway severe floods and landslides triggered by days of heavy rain killed at least 45 people at least 12 000 people were displaced there has been extensive damage to health facilities including covid 19 quarantine and isolation centres the un said as well as a medical supply facility where vaccines were to be kept the country s first covid 19 vaccines were delivered on 5 april and 16 700 doses had been administered amid the flood s aftermath as of 21 april many essential staff set to work on covid 19 programmes are now at the front line of the floods response the un said parts of indonesia were also deeply affected including the western part of timor island which was directly hit by cyclone seroja in early april indonesia has recorded at least 163 deaths with dozens more missing venezuelan healthcare students and the country s medicine and science academies are urging the government to speed up vaccination plans reuters reported amid a rise in infections and deaths of frontline health workers at least 440 healthcare staff have died from covid 19 as of 5 april according to médicos unidos de venezuela a diaspora group the country has received about 750 000 vaccine doses from russia and china for a population of about 28 million venezuela is eligible for vaccines through the covax programme which had distributed 38 million doses around the world as of 8 april but president nicolás maduro has said the country will not approve the astrazeneca vaccine which forms the bulk of covax supplies bloomberg reported that venezuela wants to buy the single shot vaccine made by johnson johnson but these vaccines may not be available through covax until at least july refugees and migrants are being left behind in lebanon s vaccine rollout human rights watch said on 6 april non lebanese comprise 30 percent of the country s population but less than 3 percent of those who have been vaccinated according to government statistics a third of the population risks being left behind in the vaccination plan said nadia hardman an hrw researcher health officials have said palestinian refugees and all the other residents on lebanese territory will be included in vaccination planning but rights groups have warned of mixed signals in january lebanon inked a deal with the world bank to fund vaccines for two million people under a programme set up specifically for countries hosting refugees afghanistan is planning a covid 19 vaccine rollout stretching to the farthest corners of a nation that the government doesn t fully control the health ministry s target is to vaccinate 20 percent of its population this year and 60 percent by the end of 2022 to do this health officials are relying on local and international humanitarian groups to go where the government cannot including taliban controlled areas officials told the new humanitarian groups prioritised for vaccines include displaced people between 30 and 50 years old some of the hundreds of thousands of yearly returnees from neighbouring iran and pakistan people in urban slums and people older than 50 living in hard to reach districts like many countries afghanistan has been entirely dependent on donors and on covax for its vaccine supply as of 8 april afghanistan had enough doses to fully vaccinate fewer than half a million people about 1 3 percent of the population but the un warns there is also a low demand for vaccines among health workers who comprise about 8 percent of afghanistan s covid 19 cases vaccine uptake remains slow the un said some 497 000 people including 108 000 health workers had been vaccinated with at least one dose as of 20 may vaccine uptake remains slow nearly all covid 19 testing and treatment has stopped in myanmar since a 1 february military coup the un says and it s unclear how coronavirus vaccine rollouts started just before the coup will continue violent crackdowns on protests and a civil disobedience movement have shut down myanmar s economy and pushed its health sector to the brink of collapse deliveries of vaccines produced by india s serum institute will be delayed officials with the un backed covax scheme confirmed on 25 march as india struggles with rising covid 19 infections the announcement deals a blow to lower income countries which are almost entirely reliant on covax to fuel their initial rollouts the serum institute s version of the astrazeneca vaccine known as covishield represents nearly 60 percent of covax supplies through the end of may in late march india severely restricted vaccine exports as it struggled with a surge in coronavirus cases in february the head of the serum institute said the company had been directed to prioritise the huge needs of india and warned of delays to global supplies the institute was slated to deliver at least 110 million doses to covax by the end of may covax says it had received 28 million doses as of 25 march nepal was the first country in asia to give covid 19 vaccines to refugees the unhcr said on 19 march as of mid month 72 refugees including 65 people from bhutan had received their first doses nepal s vaccination campaigns started in january and people older than 55 and people with co morbidities between 40 and 54 are a second priority after health staff and other frontline workers refugees who meet these conditions will be included the unhcr said there are at least 19 500 refugees and asylum seekers in nepal including people from bhutan tibet pakistan and myanmar central african republic aims to start covid 19 vaccinations in april the un says the country is slated to receive 312 000 doses by the end of may through the covax scheme but recent surveys by ground truth solutions have also reported negative personal opinions and misinformation about vaccines among religious and community leaders most countries have national vaccination plans in place but fewer than a third have developed plans for training vaccinators or for public information campaigns to combat vaccine hesitancy an 18 march world bank study found given worrying vaccine hesitancy strategies to generate confidence acceptance and demand for vaccines are urgently needed the report warned wealth and geography are determining where global vaccine stocks are going not public health or human need a 17 march editorial in the bmj medical journal warned the coronavirus the editorial s authors said is disproportionately affecting black and ethnic minority communities they have been excluded from accessing the benefits of science the authors said the covax targets of supplying countries with enough vaccines to cover 3 percent of populations by mid year or 20 percent by the end of the year are unacceptably low the astrazeneca vaccine is safe to use and its benefits outweigh the risk of side effects according to separate investigations by europe s drugs regulator and a who committee several european countries had temporarily suspended use of the vaccine after a handful of people reportedly developed blood clots the democratic republic of congo also delayed its vaccine rollout but the european medicines agency said an investigation found no evidence tying the vaccine to an increased risk of blood clots which can occur naturally echoing findings from other health agencies astrazeneca is the main vaccine available to covax meaning that the bulk of the world s lower income countries are relying on it to drive vaccination plans halving the number of injections needed to reach last mile populations is no small thing the who approved the one shot johnson johnson vaccine for emergency use on 11 march clearing the way for it to be included in covax rollouts médecins sans frontières is urging the company to prioritise lower income countries rather than sell its stocks to the highest bidder j j has signed tentative agreements to distribute 100 million doses this year through the covax scheme but msf says most of j j s stocks are already pledged to wealthy countries the j j vaccine requires only one dose most currently available vaccines need two it can also be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures making rollouts a game changer according to duke university researchers halving the number of injections needed to reach last mile populations is no small thing if there were one vaccine we wanted to prioritise for manufacturing and distribution to countries this is the one papua new guinea is imposing nationwide lockdowns as surging coronavirus cases threaten to overwhelm a meagre health system while vaccine imports are still weeks away on 17 march australia announced it would donate 8 000 doses of the astrazeneca vaccine to target frontline health workers who have high rates of infections doses from the covax scheme aren t expected to arrive until late april at the earliest the spiralling outbreak is another sign of the world s deeply unequal vaccine rollout amnesty international s kate schuetze said in a statement north korea slated to receive at least 1 7 million vaccine doses through the covax scheme should grant full and unimpeded access to medical and humanitarian staff the un s special rapporteur for the country tomás ojea quintana said in a march report to the human rights council north korea says it has zero coronavirus cases a claim many observers reject but its economy has struggled amid closed borders sanctions and extensive agricultural damage caused by floods and storms in 2020 deaths by starvation have been reported as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them quintana said at the same time humanitarian access and programmes are at a near standstill aid groups warn there are only three international humanitarian workers in the entire country quintana said in his report the

without school for far too long pandemic school closures increase the risk of child marriage and exploitation and drive dropouts among girls in particular the ngo said there must be clear firewalls between countries vaccination plans and immigration enforcement in order to reach migrant communities the un s human rights body ohchr said on 8 march nobody should be afraid to seek the care they need rights officials said dozens of countries explicitly include migrants and refugees in their vaccination plans but red tape and other roadblocks could prevent people from actually receiving doses advocates warn a red cross report said that many migrants struggled to get basic health services during pandemic lockdowns especially if they didn t have national id numbers this same invisible wall could block them from accessing vaccines even if permitted by law the report said nobody should be afraid to seek the care they need parts of central and south america have become pandemic epicentres but they re at the back of the queue for vaccines the paho warned on 3 march areas with large indigenous populations in particular are struggling with overloaded clinics and health systems on the verge of collapse yet many parts of the americas are behind on vaccinations because most countries cannot access the doses they need through bilateral agreements with the manufacturers the health organisation said clinics providing the only healthcare available to 19 000 people a month in gedo southern somalia likely won t receive vaccines until 2022 the head of irish aid group trócaire said we don t anticipate receiving any covid vaccines not even for our doctors nurses and midwives until next year at best caoimhe de barra the organisation s ceo said in a blog post on vaccine inequality the world has begun to distribute covid vaccines but places like somalia are being left behind ghana received 600 000 covid 19 vaccine doses on 24 february becoming the first country to receive vaccines through the un backed covax programme who and unicef officials called it a momentous occasion but the first doses in a scheme meant to ensure equal vaccine access came two months after people in wealthier countries started receiving doses it s a very small late start when what we need right now is a massive injection of doses to many more countries said kate elder vaccine policy advisor with médecins sans frontières the united kingdom is calling for vaccine ceasefires across the globe so that people trapped in conflict zones can be protected against covid 19 un secretary general antónio guterres made similar calls last year as the coronavirus pandemic surged at the time a handful of ceasefires were announced though many were quickly broken aid group oxfam called global peace efforts during the pandemic a catastrophic failure the who gave a green light to two versions of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine on 15 february clearing the way for the vaccine s global rollout through

pipeline through mid 2021 covax is distributing the first vaccine approved by the who for emergency use the pfizer biontech vaccine to only a handful of countries this is partly due to limited supplies and the difficulties of shipping and storing the vaccine which requires ultra low temperature freezers the oxford astrazeneca vaccine can be used in countries where troubling new variants are taking hold a who panel recommended on 10 february days earlier south africa suspended its rollout of the vaccine after one study suggested it was minimally effective at preventing mild or moderate cases caused by a covid 19 variant the who panel said the south africa study was unable to determine the vaccine s effect on severe cases the known and potential benefits outweigh the risks the panel

480 yen for men 4 380 yen for women 3 280 yen for elementary school aged children and 2 200 yen for children aged 3 to before elementary school there is no time limit so feel free to relax and eat at your own pace how to make the most out of all you can eat sushi there are over 100 different types of sushi available at tsukiji tama sushi ginza core this includes fish shellfish cooked or fried food gunkan sushi sushi rolls and more while there s no specific order you need to try them in we recommend starting with light ingredients moving on to fatty rich ingredients and then returning to something lighter at the end this will allow you to eat more and relish a pleasant aftertaste however as the store manager says if you want to eat a lot of sushi we recommend this order however you should always feel free to eat the kind of sushi you like as you please eating expensive premium ingredients like fatty otoro tuna alongside fresh seasonal ingredients and creative sushi renditions seems the best way to go incidentally according to the store manager tsukiji tama sushi is the origin of the sushi roll which has become one of the most popular japanese foods in the world they apparently sold it for the first time during their ginza store opening roughly 50 years ago if this is the kind of sushi you like you ll be pleased to know that there s a stellar lineup available to order each person will write what they want on their individual order sheet you can order one of each kind at a time with a maximum of 10 pieces in a single order most people will generally eat between 35 40 pieces of sushi before calling it a night making us feel pressure to at least match this with our mouths watering we began to choose our first round the best ingredient of the day and the rare sea urchin are limited to two pieces per person if you wish to order the sea urchin you ll need to pass your ticket over to the staff this system unfortunately had to be implemented due to the steeply rising price of sea urchin however doing this means that they ve been able to continue serving the good stuff there is also the sushi of the day which isn t written on the photo menu along with a plethora of additional limited edition ingredients you can learn what to get by asking the chefs about their stock and what s currently in season there s also lots of salmon to enjoy including raw salmon alongside grilled and marinated we ve challenged ourselves to two different courses for this article one for beginners and one for seasoned sushi lovers let s dig in recommended sushi for beginners focusing on the classics seeing as we finally had the chance to devour as much sushi as we wanted we first decided to follow the all you can eat sushi trick by starting with lighter ingredients for this we recommend white fleshed fish shiny skinned fish and shellfish we opted for ten different ingredients salmon striped jack sea bream squid shrimp dotted gizzard shad mackerel horse mackerel japanese halfbeak and japanese scallop the strangely named dotted gizzard shad is one of tsukiji tama sushi s top 3 recommendations and boasts a nuanced taste flavored with the potent rind of yuzu tsukiji tama sushi always pays extra attention to serving their ingredients with optimal flavorings such as soy sauce for horse mackerel and irizake for japanese halfbeak in particular the irizake an ancient japanese condiment made by boiling down pure rice sake with pickled plum kombu and bonito flakes is the perfect accompaniment to light dishes like white fleshed fish and shellfish complemented by a few extra light offerings such as red tuna and egg we moved onto the next stage in the battle against our stomachs to fatty and rich sushi here popular ingredients include sea urchin medium fatty tuna seared tuna and engawa sushi we also naturally chose to order several sushi rolls which originated at the store including a salmon roe roll shrimp cucumber roll and eel cucumber roll the amount of sushi rice used was also small making it easy to stuff into our mouth to eat more overall this is also true for the sushi rolls which were tightly rolled with only a little rice compared with most continuing we ordered a round of salmon avocado rolls scallop roasted scallop fatty salmon and crab meat the scallop comes both raw and roasted with the roasted version exuding a flavorful fragrance with the soft aroma of yuzu making it a particular delight these rolls also follow the current japanese trend of moedan which are colorful cross cut sushi and more designed to be visually appealing eating these in between the regular sushi provides a great accent to your all you can eat lineup for the final round we went back to the lighter sushi for this i definitely recommend getting the eel salt which is one of the top 3 sushi selections and the finishing favorite for many regular customers while the standard tare sauce version is absolutely delicious the salted eel is out of this world you can thoroughly taste the natural sweetness of the eel that is usually hidden by the rich tare culminating in an unforgettable gourmet experience being lightly seared it is also highly fragrant and a treat for the senses sushi beginner kumiko ordered the following salmon striped jack sea bream squid shrimp dotted gizzard shad mackerel horse mackerel japanese halfbeak japanese scallop red tuna egg sea urchin medium fatty tuna seared tuna engawa roasted scallop fatty salmon salmon avocado roll salmon roe roll crab shrimp avocado eel avocado eel with tare eel with salt next up we ll allow a seasoned sushi connoisseur to choose and eat in their own unique way recommended sushi for sushi lovers eat what you like while relishing tsukiji tama sushi specialities as sushi fans will already possess a thorough understanding of what kind of sushi they like we recommend ordering your favorites first before your stomach becomes too full being all you can eat you can order freely without the fear of ruining your meal so why not take the chance and try something a little special or an ingredient you usually don t eat first up we ordered sea urchin red tuna roasted salmon with spring onion tare sauce roasted engawa lemon salt dotted gizzard shad pilchard with soy sauce and the in season limited edition autumn mackerel with kombu blood clam and whelk in terms of shellfish blood clam and whelk are apparently the next most popular after scallops tsukiji tama sushi ginza recommends ordering fatty ingredients roasted roasting melts away excess fat yielding a melt in your mouth texture and divine fragrance in particular the roasted engawa boasts a topping of lemon salt to weave together further an invigorating aftertaste it s surprisingly easy to eat making it equally ideal for beginners too continuing on we ordered a round of tsukiji tama sushi rolls including a salmon roe roll shrimp roll medium fatty tuna roll tuna pickled daikon radish roll spring onion mackerel roll and the super california roll the sushi rolls wrapped in crunchy nori seaweed are the most delicious we recommend ordering them 1 2 at a time to match a regular eating pace during our store coverage the manager made us a plate of sushi containing all his recommended ingredients it consisted of marlin roasted engawa medium fatty tuna greater amberjack autumn mackerel with kombu marinated tuna marinated greater amberjack and eel in addition to roasted ingredients the inclusion of marinated sushi truly showcased the breadth of styles offered at tsukiji tama sushi all you can eat at tsukiji tama sushi also includes unlimited rounds of miso soup the oceany aromas pair perfectly with the sushi if you re bringing young children the staff can also make an adorable mini salmon roe sushi roll in children s sizes in addition to the remarkable ingredients the comfortable atmosphere and environment of the store ensure that you thoroughly enjoy your time here sushi lover maki ordered the following sea urchin red tuna roasted salmon roasted engawa dotted gizzard shad pilchard autumn mackerel with kombu blood clam whelk salmon roe roll shrimp roll medium fatty tuna roll tuna pickled daikon radish roll spring onion mackerel roll super california roll salmon roe gunkan roll marlin roasted engawa medium fatty tuna greater amberjack autumn mackerel with kombu marinated tuna marinated greater amberjack eel with warm hospitality and a playful atmosphere there s much to enjoy at tsukiji tama sushi ginza core when leaving the store we were also given several cards featuring the japanese names of sushi cleverly drawn into the shape of the sushi itself on the back are some special deals to use for the next time we visit we couldn t believe our ears when we first heard that the average amount of sushi eaten is between 35 40 pieces however we managed to down more than 30 pieces each in the end we achieved this through the sushi ordering plan outlined above so try to follow our lead and see if you can do as many as us however be careful not to order too many at once as the store doesn t allow takeout and any leftovers will go to waste through the scrumptious sushi and warmth of the store manager the all you can eat course at tsukiji tama sushi ginza core ensured we left with both our stomachs and hearts full next time you re craving sushi in japan use this
