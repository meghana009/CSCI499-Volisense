by doug sandler cfa head of global strategy summary we believe concentrated positions can make portfolios more susceptible to lightning strikes concentrated positions in the stock of one s employer can be especially dangerous in our view the more a concentrated position underperforms the more difficult it becomes to execute a well devised investment plan in our view market volatility presents opportunity to address a major portfolio risk in our view in our opinion concentrated positions present one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of an investor achieving their long term investment goals the most sophisticated financial planning tools and the most capable portfolio management teams cannot insulate an investor from the risks presented by these positions while many investors would prefer to address a concentrated position tomorrow when share prices are higher or their tax status is more favorable it is important to recognize that time is not always on the investor s side in this day of 24 hour news the fortunes of any company can change rapidly without warning alarms we have seen too many investors losing too much money over the years due to an unexpected event impacting a concentrated position in their portfolios content continues below advertisement what is a concentrated position the term concentrated position could mean different things to different people we define concentration as any single position that is three or more times larger than an average position in a portfolio our definition does not apply to mutual funds exchange traded funds or other potentially diversified investment vehicles concentrated positions can end up in a portfolio for many different reasons they can come from a successful investment they can be inherited from a parent or grandparent or they can represent a percentage of ownership in a current or former employer why concentrated positions can be dangerous concentrated positions can make portfolios more susceptible to lightning strikes a concentrated position can be like a tall tree in a lightning storm while this risk may be obvious what might surprise investors is the frequency at which portfolio lightning strikes occur the risk that a single position couldunderperform the market by a significant margin say 15 annually is not insignificant for example over the last 25 years on average 27 of the companies comprising the current s p composite 1500 index have underperformed the index by more than 15 percentage points in a single year chart above in fact in years like 1998 1999 and 2020 more than 40 of companies underperformed by that margin this is one of the many reasons that concentrated positions are often not permitted in the institutional management world and can be viewed as a potential breach of fiduciary duty concentrated positions in the stock of one s employer can be especially dangerous in our view we invest for many reasons but one of the primary objectives is to protect against an uncertain future we believe a properly structured investment portfolio can act as an income supplement during periods of wage softness or unemployment for this reason we think a concentrated position in the stock of an employer is especially dangerous there is typically a strong correlation between the performance of a company s stock and the compensation and job security of that company s employees during those periods when job security is low and compensation is most under pressure an investor with a portfolio dominated by the stock of their employer could likely find their financial hardships exacerbated in the last twenty years ex employees of some of america s most well known companies have had to learn this lesson the hard way concentrated positions can force sub optimal strategies generally speaking an investment plan with significant limitations and restrictions is more likely to produce sub optimal risk adjusted performance in our view investors who ask their financial advisors to manage around or ignore a concentrated position are making a choice to hold a potentially inferior portfolio and accept inferior risk adjusted returns the more a concentrated position underperforms the more difficult it becomes to execute a well devised investment plan a 20 position in a stock that underperforms the market by 20 in a single year costs the entire portfolio 400 basis points concentrated positions also present the greatest risk to those investors who regularly rely on withdrawals from their portfolio to supplement their income an investor who takes systematic withdrawals will be forced to increasingly eat into the healthy portions of their portfolio to compensate for the decline in their concentrated position diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss lessening concentrated position risk in 4 steps accept the situation the first step of any treatment plan typically involves the acceptance that there is a problem concentrated positions present significant portfolio risk where the upside opportunity rarely outweighs the downside risk we believe that recognizing the controlling risk is a must and not a nice to have will make the next three steps easier create a plan hope is not a strategy and without a plan concentrated position risks can be compounded this is where a financial advisor can help a well structured plan should address the position but also include additional measures that can be taken to further address portfolio risk for example eliminating a portfolio s allocation to other highly correlated assets like other stocks in the same industry can reduce the portfolio s susceptibility to the concentrated position in our view execute the plan the intent of an execution plan is to reduce the risk of bad timing the best execution plans in our view are to incorporate a immediacy b opportunism and c gradualism behavioral finance pitfalls like high water marks and or low cost bases should be considered but not impede addressing concentrated positions value added solutions such as tax management or tax transition overlay services can further assist in execution adjust the plan volatile market environments lead to changing investment landscapes as the landscapes change so should the execution plan for example periods of significant market weakness often provide windows to accelerate execution plans for tax sensitive portfolios since capital losses in the portfolio can be netted against capital gains in the concentrated position any reduction in taxes would depend on an investor s tax situation important disclosure information the comments above refer generally to financial markets and not riverfront portfolios or any related

former owners of country classic cars in staunton which they opened in 1999 after starting the business on the family farm in rural edwardsville the humble beginnings of the business can be traced back to the mid 1990s when russ bought his first classic car advertisement article continues below this ad we have a little place at gillespie lake and my wife and i were up there with our daughters and we decided to take the girls to town for breakfast and to visit some yard sales said russ who is 78 we were driving to a yard sale and we saw an old car so i told my wife i would like to check it out i went to the house and knocked on the door and i asked the owner if it was for sale and he said it really wasn t but he said he might go ahead and sell it because he hadn t run it in a few years i looked at it and it didn t have a back seat the owner said he bought it from an old man who bought it new and that s the way it was russ bought the car which was a 1957 chevrolet coupe for 350 lower than the initial asking price of 500 he brought the car home and got it running but by then it was time to get the crops in so he parked the car in the barn he eventually found out the car was a rarity known as a salesman s special and built with a platform where the back seat would normally be he advertised the car and sold it for a profit to a buyer that transaction put russ and his wife on their way to a career in classic car sales advertisement article continues below this ad pretty soon we had half a dozen cars here at the farm and we were up to 40 some cars by 1998 russ said we ended up selling 280 cars off the farm on a dead end road we operated here for a few years and we got a dealer s license after we had about 10 cars anita added at that point we were starting to think that this was a little more than a hobby after he found himself on the road buying cars when he needed to be working on the farm russ knew it was time to get out of farming and turn country classic cars into a full time business he called a local farmer who to this day still rents farmland on a shares basis instead of cash rent from the noels in may of 1999 country classic cars opened at the staunton location on russ birthday advertisement article continues below this ad it was a cornfield and we put up a building with an office which is still there russ said we could put a few cars inside and i told my wife i d like to have 80 or 90 cars and she told me i was crazy it wasn t long before the business easily surpassed russ initial goal and by the time the covid 19 pandemic hit in april 2020 country classic cars had 675 cars in stock by that point i was thinking about cutting back so that turned to be a blessing in disguise said russ who noted that country classic cars sold 650 cars last year on aug 2 the couple sold the business to josh and candi laurent advertisement article continues below this ad we listed the business for sale in the spring of 2021 and found a nice young man laurent who was interested in buying it we liked him and his wife i and think it s going to be good for the business russ said as part of the sale all eight of the noels employees will be working for the new owners we had four full time salesmen a detail guy a mechanic and two secretaries plus me and my wife said russ who has sold classic cars to buyers all around the u s and overseas our employees never leave because we treat them right and they treat us right traveling around the nation to car sales was one of the most enjoyable parts of the job for russ who likens those road trips to family reunions advertisement article continues below this ad i would go about 800 miles north south east and west russ said i have a hauler named kelly who lives in texas and i ve been working with her for more than 20 years it s nice when you can depend on somebody like that i would go as far north as minnesota and as far south as florida and i would go out to oklahoma you never know when you go how many cars you re going to get it s been a great hobby that turned into a great business country classic cars survived a pair of disasters a major fire in one of its storage buildings in august of 2017 that destroyed dozens of cars and a tornado nearly 18 months later that also damaged buildings and cars luckily we had good insurance and we were worried that the insurance company was going to cancel after two big claims but they didn t said russ who added that 143 cars were lost in the fire with more than 130 lost to the tornado our employees came in and helped us after the fire with cleanup advertisement article continues below this ad we had the fire on a tuesday and by wednesday before noon the phone company had our phones up and running in another building we sold three cars the day after the fire dealing with two such catastrophic events though may have hastened the noels decision to see the business and retire both of those things were really mountainous and they took a toll on us anita said we were optimistic and every day we put one foot in front of the other and did what we had to do it gave you a weird sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop i don t think it hit russ as bad because he s more resilient but it was hard we re getting older and if one of us dies the other couldn t manage alone to run the business advertisement article continues below this ad russ was born and raised in bunker hill anita is from bethalto and graduated from civic memorial high school the couple who have been married 46 years have three daughters and one son and 11 grandchildren i ve always been a mechanic and i used to work for volkswagen years ago russ said when i was 24 years old i went into business for myself so i d been doing it for 54 years it s kind of a change not working but we re getting used to it now that they have the time russ and anita hope to do more traveling the kind that doesn t involve buying classic cars my wife has three friends from high school and one of them lives in chicago and has a place on lake michigan so we go up there once a year russ said we have a chevy cruze that gets good mileage and we want to drive around the country and visit some friends

mikhail gorbachev who has died aged 91 was the most important world figure of the last quarter of the 20th century almost singlehandedly he brought an end to 40 years of east west confrontation in europe and liberated the world from the danger of nuclear conflagration it was not the objective he set himself when he was elected general secretary of the soviet communist party in march 1985 nor did he predict or plan the way the cold war would end the haemorrhaging of the communist party the withdrawal of soviet troops from eastern europe the reunification of germany or the break up of the soviet union itself what distinguished gorbachev from previous soviet leaders was that he started a process of reform and did not try to reverse it once it threatened to spin out of control the great facilitator he carried on even to the point of resigning with dignity as his power faded away in the aftermath of his downfall as his successor boris yeltsin stumbled into market economics it became fashionable in the west to sneer at gorbachev as just another communist at heart he was called a failure because he had not been willing to liberalise state controlled prices privatise industry and open the soviet economy to outside forces as fast as the emerging russian elite or yeltsin s rightwing western advisers wanted he was ridiculed for trying to reform communism when he should have recognised that it was dead view image in fullscreen the authority of soviet president mikhail gorbachev being challenged by boris yeltsin right as president of russia at the russian federation parliament in moscow on 23 august 1991 photograph boris yurchenko ap the charges were unfair as well as inaccurate since they characterised gorbachev as an ideologue when he was in fact one of the great pragmatists of modern russian history the only part that was true was that he tried to reform life for russians he sought to maintain some form of democratic socialism with a continuing role for government intervention and a foundation of social justice compared with the crony capitalism and chaotic collapse of public services that marked the first years of post communism in russia his goals seem admirable there were a variety of avenues for developing democracy and introducing a market economy and his view that the process should be done gradually was legitimate and honourable gorbachev was not alone in failing to predict the demise of the communist system none of his contemporaries saw the situation any more clearly than he did nor did western politicians or analysts as late as 1988 only three years before the end yeltsin was pleading with the communist party to rehabilitate him and give him another chance after he had resigned from the politburo rightwing western politicians among them ronald reagan and margaret thatcher later claimed that they had brought about the collapse by standing up to totalitarianism but the record suggests that the system self destructed communism in practice was never a monolith it was constantly evolving during the 1930s joseph stalin knocked away the last props of consent and used terror as the central pillar of regime stability but in the years of leonid brezhnev s rule from 1964 to 1982 terror vanished the system s stability still rested partly on repression but also on its ability to provide a secure material environment for the overwhelming majority and a slowly improving standard of living much of it was paid for by the export of plentiful oil and gas reserves but it could have continued under gorbachev for another 10 or 20 years there was no overriding urgency for the process of perestroika restructuring or transformation that he set in train the system was not as efficient as it should have been and soviet citizens were not as happy as the propaganda alleged but nor were they on the verge of revolt five years after the soviet collapse 40 of russian voters were still willing to support the communist party candidate in the 1996 presidential election view image in fullscreen mikhail gorbachev with the uk prime minister margaret thatcher in london in 1984 photograph gerald penny ap the story of gorbachev in fact is a fine example of the occasional importance of the personal factor in human history as general secretary he was one of the world s most powerful men he could have remained in office for years had he not chosen the path of reform the son of maria nee gopkalo and sergey gorbachev he was born in the village of privolnoye in the stavropol region of southern russia his paternal grandfather was chairman of the area s first collective farm and an early party member his father was a tractor driver misha as mikhail was known was educated locally and helped out in the summer with the harvest a bright and ambitious boy on leaving school he applied to enter the law faculty of the prestigious moscow state university the five years he spent there from 1950 marked him out as something of an intellectual although a contemporary with whom he shared rooms the czech zdenek mlynar remembered that a favourite gorbachev phrase came from hegel truth is always concrete he used the expression to highlight the gap between what lecturers said about soviet life and the reality on the ground stalin s death occurred on 5 march 1953 halfway through gorbachev s time at university although both his grandfathers had been arrested in the 1930s one of them was sent to a siberian labour camp for sabotaging socialism gorbachev reacted to the event like most of his contemporaries deeply moved he spent all night queuing to see the dictator s body lying in state the thaw that followed made his lecturers more open and interesting he wrote in his autobiography but it was not enough to turn him off an orthodox career pattern the post of first secretary of the stavropol party organisation was a post akin to governor general he had been active in the komsomol the young communist league while at university and on graduation in 1955 he went back to stavropol to work in the local agitation and propaganda department he moved into the party proper and made a rapid rise through its ranks within 15 years he was first secretary of the stavropol regional party organisation in the top down hierarchical structure it was a post akin to governor general orders were received from above and handed on below without any serious or open discussion of other options the job gave the holder an almost automatic seat on the party s central committee in theory the main policy making organ at 40 gorbachev was one of its youngest members stavropol was a relatively rich and agriculturally efficient area and gorbachev as the top regional man got to know his predecessors mikhail suslov and yuri andropov by then close to the pinnacle of the soviet system he also knew fyodor kulakov the man in charge of soviet agriculture who seemed destined for the top job general secretary of the central committee but kulakov died suddenly in 1978 and gorbachev was given the agriculture portfolio a job that also gave him candidate membership in the central committee s inner cabinet the politburo he was now close to the seat of power himself and the youngest member of an increasingly ageing team of men he saw the semi senile brezhnev consumed by vanity and refusing to retire take the fateful decision with the veteran foreign minister andrei gromyko and the defence minister dmitri ustinov to invade afghanistan in 1979 without consulting the politburo whatever he thought gorbachev was too good an official to oppose the decision the man he admired was andropov who succeeded brezhnev in 1982 and tried to accelerate economic growth by raising the rate of investment and giving enterprises limited permission to retain some of their profits andropov also hoped to channel investment away from the military industrial complex by putting a cap on the arms race but his health collapsed and he died in 1984 after only 14 months in office gorbachev should have been the obvious successor but the politburo chose another ailing figure konstantin chernenko the old guard thought gorbachev was still too young when chernenko died a year later gorbachev s turn as general secretary was almost inevitable he did not come to power with a plan telling some colleagues that things could not continue as they were his colleagues had no idea that he would set off a chain of dramatic reforms but nor did he he did not come to power with a plan he had told some contemporaries such as eduard shevardnadze whom he was to appoint as foreign minister that things could not continue as they were what he was referring to was the economy where defence spending was growing faster than any other sector at first he continued on the andropov path of controlled reform or uskorenye acceleration but there were two differences gorbachev was aware that a swath of younger people in the middle ranks of the party s central apparatus in moscow as well as in the academic institutes thought like him he could rely on their support he decided to become more open about the problems of soviet society travelling the country admitting to difficulties and listening to ordinary people complain uskorenye changed to perestroika the hope was that soviet people in return for the leadership s new honesty would join a new social contract and work harder and more efficiently the gorbachev ideologues described it as the human factor an echo of the 1968 prague spring when czech and slovak reformers tried to introduce socialism with a human face he also sought to win greater consent by allowing writers and journalists to reopen many taboo issues the blanks in official soviet history such as the stalinist purges and the full horror of the gulag could be filled in contemporary problems such as drunkenness prostitution homelessness crime and corruption could be aired in the press known as glasnost this policy meant the end of censorship unlike andropov gorbachev also resolved to take unilateral steps towards disarmament and accept the demands of western peace activists to dismantle the new generation of medium range soviet rockets targeted on western europe which had provoked a matching deployment of us cruise missiles in western europe targeted on the soviet union in 1986 this policy was put into the context of a new international philosophy gorbachev and his close ally alexander yakovlev argued that the world was interdependent and that because of the horror of nuclear annihilation the universal values of mankind outweighed any divisions on class lines this meant in essence that the clash between capitalism and socialism was no longer the fundamental principle of soviet policy it also suggested that the concept of nuclear deterrence on which the cold war was based had lost its validity it won gorbachev massive support among ordinary people in the west politicians such as reagan and thatcher were forced onto the defensive also in 1986 just a year after coming to power he signalled that he wanted to withdraw from afghanistan a year later in 1987 he was saying that eastern european states were free to develop their own roads to socialism view image in fullscreen us president ronald reagan left one of the western leaders whom mikhail gorbachev forced on the defensive with his bold approach to nuclear deterrence 1985 photograph bob daugherty ap the weak part of perestroika was the failure of his economic reforms and his refusal to tackle agriculture in the field of consumer goods and services he went beyond andropov in allowing individuals to start small businesses though these often fell foul of local bureaucrats who refused to give them licences frustrated he increasingly saw the problem as coming from party officials resisting or sabotaging his reforms he sacked a number of lower level officials and senior politburo members though it took him three years to understand that they were being replaced by equally obstructive clones this was what led to the second stage of the gorbachev reforms as he decided that the system had to change and not just the men who ran it i must tell you frankly he told the polish parliament in 1988 in the beginning we did not understand the need or rather the inevitability of reforming the political system our experience during the first stage of perestroika brought us to it the vehicle chosen was a new soviet parliament or congress of people s deputies gorbachev summoned a special party conference in june 1988 and persuaded it to accept the idea of a new elected chamber he wanted the government to be answerable to the new body rather than the party thus preventing the party from interfering in day to day government issues and confining it to a strategic role you can t have two bears in the same cave he explained later two thirds of the parliament s members would be directly elected in a competitive poll inevitably this meant that candidates would be free to campaign and that the old restrictions on freedom of assembly and speech would have to be lifted in 1989 gorbachev s revolution from above turned into a revolution from below between january 1989 and the elections in march soviet citizens suddenly found themselves free to heckle debate shout abuse and criticise the party and government this was the moment when gorbachev s revolution from above turned into a revolution from below as thousands took to the streets at least 30 senior party members failed to get elected the new congress when it met in may produced extraordinary debates numerous independents and several anti communists such as the dissident physicist andrei sakharov were elected for two weeks people were glued to their television sets hearing unprecedented criticism of the old system among the reformers a key demand soon became the abolition of article six of the constitution which guaranteed the communist party s monopoly on power having conceded the right of independents to be elected to the congress it was hard for gorbachev to resist the idea of letting them form their own parties the 1989 congress was the turning point after which gorbachev was no longer in control of events increasingly too he became squeezed between those who wanted to move faster and those who resisted change his troubles grew worse when the newly elected deputies from the baltic republics backed up by mass movements started to call for economic autonomy and political independence in eastern europe similar movements were emerging starting in poland with the old solidarity trade union which was relegalised and won elections in june 1989 gorbachev reacted in amazingly relaxed fashion to the changes in eastern europe none of his advisers had predicted that this would be the result of their strategy of non intervention they had imagined that reformers within each country s communist party would be the main beneficiaries of change but in eastern europe the local parties had come overwhelmingly to be seen as traitors to their nations since they had gone along with soviet invasions in the 1950s and 60s thus in the first flush of electoral democracy the communists did badly with hindsight gorbachev s views can be seen as naive his merit was not to try to prevent the changes even when they started to produce a complete rout of the soviet position when the berlin wall came down in november 1989 when chancellor helmut kohl of west germany insisted on rapid reunification and the absorption of what had been east germany into nato the following year gorbachev acquiesced by then he was beset on so many fronts that he had no chance to reconsider his policies he was simply swept along by events as a russian nationalist it seemed that gorbachev could not understand the psychology of other nations the same was true inside the soviet union which he cared about far more than the future of eastern europe he foolishly tried to resist the baltic states drive to independence instead of seeing that if he accepted they were a special case he might prevent the independence bug from spreading to the other 12 soviet republics as a russian nationalist it seemed that he could not understand the psychology of other nations he was particularly shocked when the overwhelming majority in ukraine voted to leave the soviet union in december 1991 just as the first three years of gorbachev s time as soviet leader illustrated the occasional importance of an individual in history the same was true of the last two years now however the key personality was yeltsin indeed had it not been for this one man s driving ambition gorbachev might have saved the soviet union but yeltsin became his bete noire in a retrospective interview with me in 2011 gorbachev regretted he had not got yeltsin out of the way before he became a direct rival i was probably too liberal and democratic as regards yeltsin i should have sent him as ambassador to great britain or maybe a former british colony he told me a contemporary and like him a former regional party secretary yeltsin did not enjoy being part of the gorbachev team he first irritated gorbachev when in 1987 he asked gorbachev to be allowed to resign from his position as moscow party boss on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the october revolution an event gorbachev wanted to celebrate with an image of unity yeltsin was fiercely attacked at a subsequent central committee meeting and became gorbachev s mortal enemy but the new congress of people s deputies provided him with a platform in 1989 campaigning as a populist critic of party privilege and criticising perestroika for failing to improve the economy he swept to a landslide victory as the moscow delegate on the congress and a seat on the supreme soviet then as independence fervour grew in the baltics yeltsin and his supporters saw the potential for developing an alternative power centre inside russia itself they were not the first to seize on what was known as the russian idea as gorbachev s reforms accelerated party conservatives looked for a way of supplanting him they pressed for the setting up of a russian communist party arguing somewhat bizarrely that russians had also suffered inside the union that the country s national identity had been submerged into the concept of soviet man deciding to have himself elected president by the soviet parliament proved to be a double mistake as resistance to reform grew within the party gorbachev decided in march 1990 to create an executive presidency which would allow him to bypass the party altogether some advisers urged him to go for direct elections but he was afraid he had himself elected by the soviet parliament instead it turned out to be a double mistake yeltsin had just been elected to the new russian parliament picked as chairman in early 1991 he followed gorbachev s example and created an executive presidency this time for russia alone but yeltsin made sure there were direct elections which he won by a landslide in june suddenly yeltsin looked a more democratic leader than gorbachev as yeltsin began to outflank him gorbachev reacted indecisively in september 1990 pressures from the radicals to move towards a market economy grew massively for a moment gorbachev seemed to accept their views but the prime minister nikolai ryzhkov persuaded him to resist even though perestroika had not produced real consumer benefits he also appeared indecisive on reforming the soviet union sections of the army and the kgb were furious with his failure to stop the tide of baltic independence and in january 1991 troops mounted a provocative raid on the television tower in the lithuanian capital vilnius killing 14 demonstrators the hardliners backed by the land forces commander general valentin varennikov hoped the incident would provoke gorbachev into declaring a state of emergency and clamping down the violence shocked the liberals around gorbachev although he himself took 10 days to react publicly he refused to take the tough action the hardliners wanted but did not denounce them either it was yeltsin who took the initiative by rushing to offer support to the baltic leaders when gorbachev eventually re emerged it was clear that baltic independence could not be halted he now embarked on a frenzied round of negotiations for a looser soviet structure in the hope that this would satisfy the growing calls for autonomy but known as the novo ogaryovo process from the country house outside moscow where the talks were held the talks brought together only nine of the 15 republics the three baltic states plus armenia georgia and moldova declined to take part within the party criticism of gorbachev s leadership grew from all sides and at a central committee plenary meeeting in april 1991 he threatened to resign the move provoked a crisis the hardliners had no obvious alternative and the plenum voted to withdraw the issue of his future from the agenda in his 2011 interview gorbachev said he had erred in not resigning from the communist party and forming a new political party at that time had that happened he argued he might have saved the union gorbachev left for a holiday in the crimea and hardliners fearing the end of the soviet union attempted a coup gorbachev left for a holiday in the crimea planning to return to moscow on 20 august to sign the new union treaty his novo ogaryovo process had produced but the hardliners thought it amounted to the end of the soviet union and eight of them including the kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov the defence minister dmitry yazov and varennikov resolved to arrest him and mount a military coup a delegation sent to his villa at foros demanded he cede his powers on the grounds of ill health gorbachev refused and even threatened to kill himself as he told a small group of journalists who talked to him in foros as soon as the coup collapsed the plotters claimed gorbachev was ill and his place was being taken by the vice president gennady yanayev they ordered tanks to take up key positions in moscow but it was all hopelessly ill conceived and hastily planned and crucially the plotters failed to arrest yeltsin the directly elected russian president his defiance split the army and on the second day of the coup the junta began to fall apart gorbachev was soon freed and brought back to moscow when he returned however he failed to understand how high yeltsin s stock had risen during the coup and how poorly the party leadership had behaved no one for example had denounced the seizure of power so when gorbachev used his first press conference to talk about renewing the party most people felt he was out of touch four days later he came to recognise the new situation resigning as general secretary and calling on the central committee to disband itself but by then yeltsin had already issued decrees seizing the soviet communist party assets and suspending the newly formed russian communist party the plotters far from saving the soviet union and the communist parties had only hastened their demise on 25 december 1991 gorbachev resigned as president and the red flag was lowered from the kremlin from then on gorbachev was doomed yeltsin put the kgb and the soviet foreign ministry under russian control in early december he met the leaders of the other two slav republics ukraine and belarus in a hunting lodge near the polish border they declared the soviet union dead three weeks later on 25 december 1991 gorbachev resigned as president and the red flag was lowered from the kremlin signifying the end of the soviet union gorbachev s years in retirement were energetic and dignified although yeltsin stripped him of his limousine and pegged his pension at a figure that hyperinflation reduced to a few pence a month he never denounced yeltsin in personal or vindictive terms he formed the gorbachev foundation funded largely by his book royalties to conduct research he made an ill starred effort to run in the 1996 russian presidential election but was shut out of the state television channels and got few votes like other great reformers in history he ended up in isolation condemned by some for doing too much and by others for doing too little for the world beyond russia his great service lay in allowing the cold war to come to an end it did not end as he had hoped in a grand reconciliation between east and west indeed in retirement he criticised western leaders for expanding nato to take in several of the former soviet republics which he thought was unnecessary and provocative inside russia his economic reforms failed though not as catastrophically as those that followed under yeltsin yeltsin s circle blamed gorbachev for the miserable legacy they inherited gorbachev for his part blamed the legacy of stalinism for the situation he took over he will be remembered as the man who consigned the one party system to oblivion and gave russians room to breathe yeltsin s successor vladimir putin treated gorbachev with respect despite gorbachev s occasional criticisms of the slide back towards authoritarianism in 1953 he married raisa titarenko she died in 1999 their daughter irina survives him mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev politician and statesman born 2 march 1931 died 30 august 2022

have you ever left a dining experience genuinely confused by what you had just experienced it s not just that the food was lacking it s not just that the ambiance left you wanting more it s not just that the service bordered on offensive and condescending it s that in combination the things that the walt disney company is supposed to be fundamentally good at were so absent that it left our party as diners and as guests unsatisfied uncomfortable and profoundly disappointed in how we spent our time and money at enchanté during our recent journey aboard disney cruise line s newest ship the disney wish we splurged on the upcharge dinner experience at enchanté like remy aboard the disney dream and disney fantasy enchanté intends to deliver a service focused high end tasting menu experience the cuisine is contemporary french devised by chef arnaud lallement and focuses on classic french ingredients and preparations enhanced by modern presentations chef lallement has earned three michelin stars for his l assiette champenoise restaurant in france however he has seemingly traded those michelin stars at least in principle in order to participate in enchanté a venture that falls far short of a fine dining experience interior in terms of ambiance enchanté is themed after lumiere the candelabra from disney s beauty and the beast in fact a not so hidden lumiere is featured in the passageway into the dining area which itself is decorated with a variety of candelabra curiously the theme of the restaurant is also inspired by champagne with a central feature of the dining space being a chandelier that resembles champagne bubbles and has the added and likely unintentional benefit of constantly shaking and vibrating as a result of transferred vibration through the ship unfortunately this same intense vibration has caused a number of the fittings in the dining space to have already fallen off during our cruise exposing the unfinished bolts and fasteners that ostensibly held these decorative elements together somewhat surprising was our server s decision to blame these missing features on prior guests who had allegedly removed them during test cruises i guess it s easier to blame the conduct of the guests on the media and cast test cruises than to question the design and craftsmanship of the newly minted disney wish the experience in earlier cruises the dining experience at enchanté was progressive in nature meaning that guests moved from area to area in the dining room as the dinner unfolded we had heard that guests were welcomed to the restaurant in the lounge area and seated at circular tables there for the amuse bouche and a glass of champagne to begin the meal and then they moved into the main dining room for the rest of their tasting menu experience in our case though we were informed that this progressive dinner model had already been scrapped such that we were left sitting at cocktail tables in the foyer of the restaurant for our entire tasting menu meanwhile our allegedly intimate dining experience was enhanced by a parade of visitors taking photos with the champagne themed chandelier directly next to us the entire time here s what the main dining room we never ate in looks like the menu in addition to a la carte options there are two tasting menus guests are encouraged to order at enchante first there is the passion menu which is a five course meal for 125 per person consisting of a selection of dishes listed on the a la carte menu second there is the collection which is a nine course meal priced at 195 per person which purports to be a surprise for diners that is based on the freshest and most seasonal ingredients available to the chef there are also champagne and wine pairings available with the tasting menus 140 per person for champagne and 115 per person for wine we opted for the nine course collection menu in order to get a complete understanding of what enchanté has to offer though listed as nine surprise courses that take advantage of seasonal and available ingredients we found that this was little more than the five course option somewhat randomly augmented by four additional dishes most of which are already listed on the à la carte menu as such it was not so much of a surprise as a there you go as a result the courses and flavors never really made sense or told a comprehensive story in how they were coursed but instead seemed to be a tasting menu with some additional bells and whistles the fact that a member of our party chose to add the wine pairing made this there you go approach all the more apparent in our case the wine pairing available was only based on the five course passion tasting menu and resulted in five sporadic pours of wines that arrived at equally sporadic times throughout the meal in some cases the wine was provided halfway or even three quarters of the way through the dish that it was purportedly paired with this is the sort of lapse in service that our party had never experienced aboard the disney cruise line and certainly something that we would never hope to experience in a restaurant that purported to be as service focused as enchanté advertises itself to be bread service we were provided with bread and butter for the table both of which were lovely we particularly enjoyed the smoked sea salt provided along with the butter indeed if the meal had culminated with bread and butter it may have been for the best collection prix fixe menu amuse bouche tartlet trio the amuse bouche consisted of three pairs of small bites an herb tartlet a tartlet with shaved cheese curls and a falafel bite the herb tartlet was particularly sharp and not something that one would call an inspiring introduction to the tasting course the falafel with a citrus reduction was our favorite of the three but was utterly forgettable and we ve certainly had better falafel finally the shaved cheese tartlet presented beautifully with soft curls of cheese that resembled the delicate finishing of a dessert this too was fairly basic in flavor and tasted much like you would think bits of cheese in a small crispy shell should taste beeswax with lemon accompaniment next up was a crisp piece of beeswax and lemon accompaniment topped with edible flowers as a garnish the accompaniment was sort of soup like it was lemony and light the beeswax was more like a cracker and did little to add to the experience soil grown tomatoes 12 hour butter poached tomato confit bread and tomato vinaigrette tomato water we were next provided with the soil grown tomatoes dish that is listed on the á la carte menu this dish consists of three preparations of tomatoes 1 a 12 hour butter poached tomato confit 2 a tomato vinaigrette served with a hearty slice of bread for dipping and 3 a glass of tomato water served in stemware the butter poached tomato a classic french preparation is where the lack of skill of the kitchen at enchanté became truly apparent what should be a tender buttery explosion of savory tomato flavor was in fact tough chewy acidic and generally awful we were tremendously disappointed by this dish the tomato vinaigrette was neither significantly different in its flavor nor much better in its preparation it was instead a tomato soup like dish only far more acidic and lacked the complexity that well selected vinegar could add to the dish finally though the tomato water proved a surprise highlight for the table this savory herbal flavor bomb is delightfully masked behind a nearly clear liquid and we would have happily traded a multitude of courses for another glass it was everything good about the best dill pickle the best bloody mary and the freshest bites of garden produce that you have ever experienced all rolled into one sip it was simple fun and genuinely good definitely the best dish of the night caviar smoked haddock fondant potatoes the next course was caviar on top of sour cream vodka chive and onion base topped with yes you guessed it a warm potato sea foam admittedly this dish was one of the better ones of the evening combining caviar that was of sufficient quality with the familiar crème fraiche style accompaniment as our second foam of the evening we began to question whether we had missed a memo as to the return of foam to fine dining restaurants from a decade ago stone crab tartlet langoustine jelly continuing with the tartlet theme for the tasting menu the next course was a stone crab tartlet covered in a langoustine jelly and topped with stone crab mayonnaise edible flowers and microgreens this salute to new french cuisine circa 1995 simply didn t make sense as a dish the pastry base was tough and overcooked the stone crabs despite being a local ingredient for a ship that spends its time in the caribbean were of mediocre quality and the langoustine jelly was quite simply inedible the flavors and textures of this dish didn t work and were not aided by the addition of a seemingly random sauce in homage to my father maine lobster next the dinner progressed to more substantial dishes beginning with a dish titled in homage to my father this is one of chef lallement s more personal dishes though judging by the quality of the lobster that was served it s apparent that the chef may not actually like his father very much the dish consisted of an open lobster ravioli and a piece of lobster meat again topped with microgreens and edible flowers it was enhanced by the tableside addition of you guessed it again lobster stock foam in this case the ravioli was tough bordering on inedible if only they had asked the pasta makers at palo for a pointer or two the lobster itself was shockingly bitter having none of the sweet or bright seafood quality that one would expect from maine lobster wild halibut onion confit and vermouth a wild halibut dish was next the fish was accompanied by onion three ways including onion confit an onion gratin and a sprig of spring onion on top it was completed with the tableside addition of a vermouth reduction the fish in this dish was exceptionally well cooked tender on the inside and crispy on the outside however the dish overall was incredibly salty don t get us wrong we typically love salty flavors but this one overwhelmed an otherwise nicely executed dish squab pigeon fermiere puff pastry with dried tomato foie gras pigeon and turnip relish a squab pigeon fermiere was presented as our main course this modern take on a rustic style savory pastry pie included dried tomato spinach pancetta foie gras and pigeon inside a pastry shell and was accompanied by turnip three ways the turnip three ways was forgettable and that makes it hands down the best part of this dish since the rest was truly awful as an aside this table of diners has experienced squab foie gras and a number of other exotic ingredients before while the waitstaff was eager to explain away certain flavors in this dish as exotic interesting and not for everyone that was simply not the case here rather what was presented in this squab pie was nearly impossible to choke down the squab was gamey to the point of being bitter the foie gras was of such middling quality that it presented an almost chemical aftertaste and the spinach and tomato were dry and at times overpowering even if the ingredients here were good on their own which they certainly were not the flavors of the pie as a whole senselessly competed with one another in an unorchestrated fashion this was the worst dish of the night salad with brisket fortunately the truly random combination of ingredients that came next was a distraction though not necessarily a pleasant one we were presented with a dish consisting of approximately a tablespoon of braised beef topped with a random handful of greens covered in a champagne vinaigrette the beef was akin to barbecue and was not altogether unpleasant though the combination of it with an overdressed side salad made little sense thankfully it was served in such a small quantity that one need not think about it for long in order to complete the what the heck is this portion of the meal it was accompanied by what was described as chinese bread with a mango puree served on a separate plate the bread was overtoasted and tough to the point of needing a knife to cut it and the puree s only purpose seemed to be to add a little bit of moisture and distraction from the rest of the dish if you drunkenly stumbled into the kitchen in the middle of the night looking for a snack this is what you might come up with cheese cart our next course consisted of a visit from the cheese cart if you ve been to remy you surely have fond memories of the cheese cart and its limitless array of delicious french cheeses enchanté s take on the cheese course is not substantially different though our service experience with the cheese cart left something to be desired in this case minuscule crumbs of cheese were served up with a healthy dose of condescension each diner is permitted to select up to 6 different types of cheese which are accompanied by a selection of dried fruits and honeycomb the cheeses themselves were predictably delicious but the question from our server at the conclusion of the course do you like french cheese now fell predictably flat it would be helpful in the future for enchanté s dining staff not to approach each diner with the assumption that he or she has lived under a rock prior to miraculously emerging for a voyage on the disney wish in order to experience french cheese for the first time petit fours coffee tartlet lemon dome olive oil white chocolate dome raspberry jelly roll up we finally made it to dessert immediately preceding dessert though was a combination of petit fours served in round basket like plates these consisted of a coffee tartlet a lemon dome an olive oil white chocolate dome with hidden mickeys on the bottom and a raspberry jelly roll up all of the petit fours were well flavored and a welcome relief dessert the pleasant upswing of the petit fours did not last long and did not prepare us for the dessert that was to come served in three parts on three separate plates were a combination of genuinely questionable flavors and terrible textures the main part of the dessert course was a honeycomb flavored cake like dish that was most reminiscent of styrofoam while the flavor was inoffensive the texture was off putting at best the dish was enhanced by the addition of fresh raspberries and a raspberry reduction served tableside these were the sourest raspberries anyone at our table had ever tasted clearly enchanté is not procuring the finest raspberries to use in this dessert the next phase of dessert was a raspberry sorbet accompanied by our last dose of foam for the evening the sorbet was tart but nevertheless served as a welcome reprieve from the jarringly sour raspberries finally the last component of dessert consisted of a hexagonal honeycomb shaped base with a crispy rolled wafer on top again garnished with edible flowers this was truly the surprise of the evening and not in a good way what resembled a delightful honeycomb cookie was actually some sort of wet thin layer of custard or mousse its flavor was equally thin and left us all wishing for the cookie that could have been overall our takeaway is quite simply that there are better upcharge experiences available to guests aboard the disney wish than enchanté presently provides if this was your first foray into french cuisine or fine dining it would most certainly be your last the walt disney company s knack for making cuisine comfortable approachable elegant and ultimately satisfying is sadly entirely absent here instead the

washington reuters u s job openings increased in july and data for the prior month was revised sharply higher pointing to persistently strong demand for labor that is giving the federal reserve cover to maintain its aggressive interest rate increases the labor department s job openings and labor turnover survey or jolts report on tuesday showed there were two jobs for every unemployed person last month pointing to extremely tight labor market conditions it suggested that fears the economy was in recession after two straight quarterly declines in gross domestic product were greatly exaggerated the fed has front loaded its monetary restraint this year to an unprecedented degree and the economy isn t giving them any reason to hold back said christopher rupkey chief economist at fwdbonds in new york the labor market is strong as a bull two jobs out there for the unemployed to choose from job openings a measure of labor demand increased 199 000 to 11 239 million on the last day of july data for june was revised higher to show 11 040 million job openings instead of the previously reported 10 698 million economists polled by reuters had forecast 10 450 million vacancies there were an additional 81 000 job openings in the transportation warehousing and utilities industries last month job openings increased by 53 000 in the arts entertainment and recreation sector while the federal government had 47 000 more openings and state and local government education had an additional 42 000 unfilled jobs ahead of the new school year but job openings decreased by 47 000 in the durable goods manufacturing industry there were more job openings in the west while the south and midwest saw small gains vacancies fell in the northeast the fed is trying to cool demand for labor and the overall economy to bring inflation down to its 2 target fed chair jerome powell warned last week that americans were headed for a painful period of slow economic growth and possibly rising unemployment as the u s central bank aggressively raises interest rates in a bid to bring supply and demand back into balance the fed has raised its policy rate by 225 basis points since march the job openings rate climbed to 6 9 last month from 6 8 in june hiring slipped to 6 382 million from 6 456 million in june keeping the hiring rate unchanged at 4 2 the jobs workers gap rose to 3 4 of the labor force from 3 1 in june layoffs dropped to 1 398 million from 1 400 million in june there were decreases in leisure and hospitality professional and business services as well as finance activities these offset a surge in trade transportation and utilities industries about 4 179 million people quit their jobs down from 4 253 million in june the quits rate viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence dipped to a 14 month low of 2 7 from 2 8 in june still confidence in the labor market remains high a separate report from the conference board on tuesday showed its so called labor market differential derived from data on respondents views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get edged down to 36 6 this month from a reading of 36 8 in july this measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the labor department u s stocks fell on the data the dollar was steady versus a basket of currencies u s treasury prices were mixed consumer confidence rebounds markets will misread this report as an indication that the fed will hike rates more than expected said jamie cox managing partner at harris financial group in richmond virginia the fed is prone to mistakes and there is a very good chance that inflation comes down for reasons other than rate increases the conference board s overall consumer confidence index rebounded to 103 2 this month from 95 3 in july ending three straight monthly declines economists had forecast the index would climb to 97 7 consumers inflation expectations over the next 12 months fell to 7 0 from 7 4 in july despite the high inflation expectations the share of consumers planning to go on vacation over the next six months surged to an eight month high there were also increases in the shares of consumers planning to buy motor vehicles as well as major household appliances like refrigerators washing machines dryers and televisions over the next six months which could keep consumer spending supported in the third quarter and the economy growing gross domestic product fell at a 0 6 annualized rate last quarter after contracting at a 1 6 pace in the january march quarter recession talk hasn t gone away but it certainly got a little more quiet lately said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto higher mortgage rates resulting from the fed s aggressive monetary policy posture did not discourage potential homebuyers in august as more consumers planned to buy a house over the next six months likely encouraged by sellers lowering asking prices that is slowing the pace of monthly house price inflation a third report on tuesday showed the s p corelogic case shiller national home price index increased 0 3 in june after accelerating 1 3 in may that lowered the annual increase to 18 0 from 19 9 in may prices slowed considerably in the west with monthly declines in seattle and san francisco cooling monthly house price growth was evident in a fourth report from the federal housing finance agency showing prices gained 0 1 after increasing 1 3 in may in the 12 months through june prices rose 16 2 after surging 18 3 in may with supply still tight house price growth was likely to persist though with some months of negative readings even with a few months of outright declines however home prices will likely finish the year solidly in positive territory said mark vitner a senior economist at wells fargo in charlotte north carolina reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao and andrea ricci

archived document may contain errors real education reform for the 1990s by chester e finn jr as just about everyone now realizes there s been a big education reform movement these past seven years seven that is if you trace its origin to a nation at risk the famous 1983 report of the national commi ssion on excellence in education we ve been at it more like ten to twelve years ifyou locate its origin irrthe stiffing visible in many states in the late seventies that gave rise to high school proficiency tests minimum competancy tests for teach e rs and the like the impulse to reform american schools arises from sources not the least bit obscure people looked about themselves and saw student test scores falling on many gauges per haps most visibly the scholastic aptitude test they observed i n disputable evidence of young people getting high school diplomas who were barely literate they heard employers including such large scale public sector employers as the armed services complaining about the shoddy preparedness of their new recruits m o re generally they saw a country with faltering economic productivity and mounting anxiety about its international competi tiveness the vitality of its culture even its national security as i reconstruct the sequence the excellence commission gave v oice to a widespread public anxiety and the remarkable reception given its report was due in no small part to the fact that americans were ready for someone to utter this message tle commission declared us a nation at risk and did so in uncommonly eloq u ent and forceful terms it was promptly echoed in some cases actually preceded by dozens of other reports studies manifestos and the like all coming to essentially the same conclusions our well being as a society is menaced by the weak education th a t most of our young people are acquiring the result has been this period of extraordinary ferment change and reform in american education it began in the high schools but has since lapped over into elementary schools to some extent into early childho o d education and in slightly different and less forceful terms even into higher education return to civilian control it has been nationwide but decentralized with its epicenter at the state level of our federal structure not in washington and not i n most instances in cities and towns history i am certain is going to regard the 1980s as a time in which american public education became far less a local endeavor than it had been and much more the aggregation of fifty statewide systems i believe h i story will also judge the eighties as the decade when education was returned to civilian control nough there are important individual exceptions by and large the reform impulse had not come from within the education profession but from the laity from busi ness leaders elected officials especially governors community groups newspaper editors chester e finn jr is director of the education excellence network and professor of education and public policy at vanderbilt university he spoke at the heritage foundation on february 23 1990 issn 0272 1155 01990 bythe heritage foundation and others who in an earlier time would have felt they had no proper role intruding into the center of the education enterprise while th eir impulse has its civic and cultural dimen sions the great driving force behind it has been the desire for economic growth and com petitiveness both for the country as a whole and for regions and individual states the most dramatic examples of this have been a half dozen southern governors who looked about them and asked whether arkansas or south carolina or georgia was fated always to be in the economic cellar and just what would have to be different to attract high tech manufac tadu turing and se r vice i str4esr without exception they concluded and the south has been much helped in this by a worthy organization called the southern regional education board that serious economic growth hinged at least in part on major improvements in their sch o ols and colleges i cannot count the number of times i heard former tennessee gover nor lamar alexander begin a talk about education reform with the statement better schools mean better jobs for tennessee the reform movement has included a great dea l of activity a lot of states passing what they judged to be comprehensive education improvement legislation and many localities with their own versions of the same public attention and concern have also been sustained for a remarkably long period sev e n years is an extraordinary life span for a domestic policy issue and as of yet this one shows no sign of going away public investment has increased greatly too by some 29 per cent in constant dollars when measured in terms of per pupil expenditure n o demonstrable gain what do we have to show for all this fuss and bother all this con cern and effort all this outlay and enthusiasm alas not nearly enough i won t try here to recapitulate the data most of which are spread across the newspapers we e k after week me main thing to be said is that when measured in terms of student achievement which is the only gauge that finally matters and the measure that got us into the reform effort in the first place we can see virtually no demonstrable gain f o r the county as a whole sure we cite exceptions california for example has some statistics suggesting that as many as a third of their students are learning more than they were learning a decade ago there has been a welcome improvement in the nation a l assessment scores of black and hispanic youngsters though they re still too low we ve seen a slight gain in high school graduation rates there are also some indicators of changes that may turn out to be associated with further modest boosts in achie v ement such as the number of high school students taking academic courses public satisfaction with the schools is up a little and of course there are scads of quantitative measures in which we look good though that was also true before the current ro u nd of school reform began i refer to such in dicators of changes as the percentage of high school graduates who go on to college if i were ben wattenberg in search of good news i could cite a dozen measures that one might say suggest decent performanc e on the part of our education system but they are not nearly so persuasive as the manifold evidence that the system s perfor mance remains woefully weak in terms of learning outcomes educators may call them cognitive outcomes others would say skills a nd knowledge it was mainly to achieve those outcomes that we created an education system in the first place yet they re mighty drab national assessment scores are basically flat sat scores after regaining in the early 1980s 16 of the 90 points that t he average score had lost between 1965 and 1980 are also virtually 2 level we lag well behind most other industrial nations according to every available measure of student achievement at a time when european leaders are seriously consider ing requi ring every secondary graduate to demonstrate competency in three foreign lan guages we find that only about a quarter of our eleventh graders can satisfactorily compose a piece of persuasive prose in english unprepared for higher education as for thos e stupendous numbers of young americans who go on to higher ievels of educationi it is indeed the case that almost 70 per cent of our high school graduate s make their way into 611ege andbther kiiids of post secondary institutions within a few years b ut there is a great deal of evidence i won t restate it here suggesting that a large and growing proportion of those entering college are not really ready for higher education and that a mounting share of what occurs on many of the nation s college c lassrooms might be best termed remedial in effect furnishing students with the secondary education they didn t get in high school of course they did not get a secondary education there partly because they did not receive a proper elementary education i n the earlier grades i will not dwell here on the woebegone evidence of educational preparedness that busi ness and government leaders continue to report among their new employees or the im mense sum their employers are spending more or less like th e colleges just mentioned to provide the people with the education they should have received in school ne upshot is that we are still not doing very well it s premature to declare the excellence movement a washout but i can cite few signs that it is i n the process of becoming a real suc cess why one naturally wants to know are we accomplishing so little and what should we be doing differently let me recount four large mistakes we made in the course of the reforms of the late 1980 s first most a m ericans appear to believe that somebody else s part of the nation is at risk not their part we acknowledge that there are big problems with education in general but we don t think they involve ethan or tawanna or rachel or the school down the street i c ould cite ample evidence and research findings for the moment suffice it to say that while most americans students parents teachers and administrators alike acknow ledge that we re living amid what could be termed a wholesale education catastrop h e the problem does not somehow make it down to the retail level hence few individuals feel any strong impulse to modify their own behavior or that of their children or the staff of the neighborhood school yet if we don t achieve behavior alterations i n millions of individual cases it is clear that our aggregates and averages aren t going to change there is consider able aptness for american education in 1990 to be drawn from pogo s insight that we have met the enemy and he is us second despite a ll reform efforts we haven t really changed some key variables of which perhaps the most important is the amount of time that young americans spend learning things of an academic sort tlere is no shortage in the time they spend learning other sorts of things many of which we d just as soon they didn t the first great finding of education research and common sense and everyday experience is that you tend to learn that which 3 you study and to learn it in rough proportion to the amount of time yo u spend studying it yet american youngsters have shorter school days and years than anyone else in the in dustrial world in general they have less homework they do less reading they watch more television and they are more apt at the secondary level to consume gobs of time in after school jobs to me it s pretty clear even if sad that few of them will volunteer their lives to matters academic to me that says we must either oblige them to or devise ways of making it worth their while to date ho w ever we haven t done either third on the matter of making it worth their while there is mucfi evidence that american society gives essentially the same treatment to high school graduates who took easy courses got poor grades and didn t learn much a s it provides to high school graduates who took difficult courses studied hard earned high marks and learned a great deal dis regard the small fraction of the population that is competing for admission to yale and berkeley and consider the vast majori t y of high school graduates whether they did poorly or superbly in school they still get into college wherever they want to matriculate ordinari ly into the only college they apply to they get financial aid if they need it and perhaps even if they do n t if they d rather start a job they can get one of those too and because the employer sel dom looks at their transcript asking only whether they got a diploma they will get the same job and the same pay whether they were outstanding students or sl a ckers what is more ac cording to some revealing research by cornell s jon bishop for as long as the first ten years out of high school their earnings will be the same whether they did well or poorly in school why kill yourself studying when there ar e essentially no tangible rewards for anything greater than going through the motions putting in your time much as i would like to live in a society in which people learn a great deal for the sheer joy of it in truth i think we need to entangle people s self interest with their educational attainment and this for most people we haven t done fourth we haven t been clear about our goals and objectives in industrial terms we ve never written the specifications for the educational product we hope to s e e emerge at the other end of the project if you have a clear product design no matter what line of work you are in practically everything else falls into place in education you can readily figure out the details of the curriculum how to balance teac h er supply and demand what uses to make of technology what textbooks to assign what sorts of accountability systems to devise or how best to allocate resources conversely when you cannot describe the product you want you are bound to go through a gr e at deal of wasted motion what would an adequate ly educated young american actually know and be able to do what would a really satisfac tory education system look like we haven t been able to give satisfactory answers to such queries instead we ve b een tinkering with the process absent any clear concept of the project of the four problems i ve sketched there have been serious efforts to solve only the last and these are of recent vintage i refer primarily to the national goal setting exercise th a t the president and the governors have been engaged in beginning at their charlottesville education summit in september 1989 after much pulling and hauling they finally set tled on six education goals for the nation 71bese were reviewed by the pres ident in one of the less stirring segments of his state of the union speech and with slight modifications and a lot of amplification were formally adopted at the winter meeting of the national 4 governor s association in late february 1990 they are beginning to be accompanied by myriad sub objectives strategies and plans for tracking systems and for issuing annual reports on progress the goals themselves are mostly fine in the sense that if we achieved them our schools and our kids would be t he envy of the industrial world instead of its laughing stock what s more most of them read better than they sounded in the state of the union mes sage goal three for example says that by he y r a 2000 american students will leave grades four eight and twelve having demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter including english mathematics science history and geography tough questions i think that s terrific of course it begs some tough questions such as the meaning of co m petency and challenging the mode of demonstration and the tricky matter of who chooses the subject matter granted it like the other five conveniently spans the whole decade by the end of which neither bush nor any incumbent governor will be in of f ice but if we re to have education goals this is a good one and i ve already made clear my view that reform efforts in the absence of goals are mainly wasted motion i also find no significant fault with the three goals having to do with drug free sch o ols dropouts and literate adults two others are more problematic however one of them about our kids leading the world in science and math just because it is so wildly am bitious that no one is likely to take it seriously the other about all yo u ngsters starting school ready to learn because it sounds terrific but will largely be interpreted as a man date to shift ever more responsibility for child rearing to the state so i m not totally san guine about all six goals still our stalled eff o rts to move the education system are apt to be far more productive if we know our destination kidnapped by the establishment moments after bush outlined them however the goals were kidnapped and held for ransom by the education establishment and a lot of congres sional democrats beginning that night with speaker tom foley and continuing over the next several days every time an educator or congressman opened his mouth this message emerged we won t take your goals seriously unless you put a heap o f extra federal dollars on the table first and while you re at it mr president you d better come up with a federal strategy to achieve those goals a strategy we can scrutinize before we decide whether to lift a finger i could supply two dozen quotes from figures prominent in the educational and political worlds that convey this basic message regrettably some of the democratic governors were doing much the same before the winter nga meeting was over i could also note a few ex ceptions perhaps mo s t honorably gordon ambach head of the council of chief state school officers one implication of course is that education progress is something to be bought with money rather than effort another is that the heavy lifting is somehow the responsibility of the federal government but what is most lamentable is that people talking like this are in effect staking out an excuse ten years ahead of time for not achieving these or any other goals and in doing so they have signaled that perhaps they don t even intend to try very hard that s what can happen to goals even good ones we have an unbelievably stodgy smug doctrinaire and inertia filled education system looking at it one recalls the original mean ing of conservative as disinclined to ch ange established ideas and practices i note in 5 passing that a lot of us who these days are sometimes called conservatives are actu ra i cals when it comes to education the larger point however is that this is not a self correct ing system it responds mainly to external pressure incentive reward and punishment for a time in the bennett years i thought perhaps it also responded to sustained argumenta tion i now believe that it wasn t the eloquence or persuasiveness of the arguments i t was the likelihood perhaps the fear that real political pressure would follow if a steamed up populace took action this administiation seem s disinchneato steam up the public though ind even less dis posed to alienate the education system an d its barons this means there have been no effec tive replies to the kinds of statements that many establishment figures and politicians have been making about the new national goals the absence of a clear strong and articulate reply in this sort of p olicy arena always leaves the political and rhetorical advantage with those who spoke last and loudest i certainly am not declaring the goal setting effort a failure i have considerable faith in the ability of governors to muster public support at the s tate level and to leverage real policy change the more so when they enlist the business community in their efforts and governors a re only just beginning to play their part but i am discouraged by the stance that the education community has taken and b y the administration s muted response vast undertaking if we can t be persuasive about goals how will we root out the other three big problems i described how will we muster the gumption and steadfastness to look john q public in the eye and tell him t hat he and his child and the school down the street are failing how can we generate the public fervor that will be needed to overcome the in nate resistance of young people and many of their parents to being obliged to study more than they do now how will we ever be able to persuade employers to handle the good stu dents among their new hires differently from the weak ones or the colleges to treat well prepared applicants differently from those who scraped through school with the minimum these are vast undertaking the kinds that require basic shifts in the cultural assumptions and ingrained practices of large institutions and millions of people i am none too sanguine about our capacity to make those changes that s what we should be focusing on n o w those cultural values and institutional prac tices even as we also set forth the particulars of our education reform agenda ile latter is no small task in its own right of course we ll start with clear goals a first rate information feedback syst e m by which to monitor progress toward them and consequences tied to the feedback system such that good things happen when goals are reached and when they are not some sort of intervention occurs lest the failure repeat itself elaborating this into a f u ll policy agenda will entail ten or a dozen significant changes and we ll have to knit them together with care but none of them is bizarre or unprecedented for most we would cite current examples of places now trying them albeit one by one not in the combinations we d need i d draw curriculum for example from california and ac countability for south carolina and new jersey choice from minnesota school site management and parent control from chicago and miami alternate certification of teachers from new jersey school level report cards from california or illinois teacher career ladders from tennessee and cincinnati no pass no play rules from texas parent education from missouri increasingly hard nosed business involvement from several 6 places and so on we will argue about key particulars such as how large the core cur riculum should be and whether the choice plan will include private schools but eventually we could settle on a pretty solid reform plan that would really work for th e united states in the 1990s and that is not to waste time with redesigns but how can we ever see it put into place ab sent from those changes we first need to make in the cultural attitudinal and political en vironment within which the reforms will b e installed there are half a dozen signs of what i have come to think of as the radicalization of the school reform effort and if the governors and the business community stick to their guns we may see more such in the next few years i m not despairing i m wary of the silver bullet though the panacea type remedies whether labelled privatization or professionalism or restructuring or accountability or choice each of those five ideas as well as some others will have a place of honor in a thorough l y redesigned education system but none of them alone will do the job in this i differ from friends and associates who are disposed to say that if only we d do this one thing often whichever happens to be their thing then everything else will straight e n itself out to commit a particular heresy in the environs of the heritage foundation given the extent to which parents seem content with their own children s education and disinclined to alter their behavior i have no confidence that em powering mom a nd dad through a choice system will itself result in more learning i am more optimistic about a choice scheme that incorporates clear information by which parents can see if johnny or buffy and their schools are or aren t meeting certain standards spe a king the unpleasant truth there s a missing element though which i will describe as an organized national movement for better education something that would harness the impulses of the governors and the business community and a lot of other frustrated and ex asperated people i would have to operate primarily outside washington both because federal policy is an education sideshow not the main ring and because congress in par ticular is frozen into a set of 25 year old ideas about education that i think are hopeless to defrost and it would have to operate on several fronts political cultural and economic we do not have any such entity today recall the extraordinary work of the committee on the present danger during the most naive days of fore i gn policy appeasement looking around the world today we see evidence not only that the committee on the present danger was right but also that its strategic advice once taken has made a huge difference in the international sphere the key to its contr i bution it seems to me was for influential and respected individuals to speak the unpleasant truth in plain language in a loud but steady voice even though it flew in the face of conventional wisdom and political prudence we would be well served if we had such an entity now on the education front but the as signment is even harder jimmy carter at least could be voted out of office and brezhnev had the decency to die nothing in the education system will be changed that easily 7

sora o doherty b c forbes once said there is more credit and satisfaction in being a first rate truck driver than a tenth rate executive fortunately lawrence siegel doesn t have to choose being the very satisfied owner of a business cuesta antiques and a vintage truck his prized diamond t if you missed it in orinda s 2022 fourth of july parade you ll have another chance to view this elegant truck in the 18th orinda classic car show on saturday sept 10 from 10 a m to 2 p m the show will feature vintage pickup trucks stock and custom or resto mod there will also be all other types of vehicles including some exotic electric vehicles this year s theme keep on truckin is well embodied by siegel s lovingly restored vintage vehicle siegel acquired his truck about a decade ago at the time he saw it advertised in hemmings auto trade vintage book the truck which was located in glenwood springs colorado was about 60 restored but had no wood and no hubcaps the man who had begun the restoration had died and his son needed money for college siegal bought the diamond t for 35 000 and reckons that he has invested that much and more in completing the restoration although he notes restoration of a vintage vehicle is always ongoing siegel and his wife own and run cuesta antiques in lafayette and you can often find the diamond t parked near whole foods siegel says the truck attracts a lot of business for the shop siegal has always had a vintage vehicle of some type he s participated in many car shows including every one that has been held in orinda we like to participate in the community he said siegel and his wife have lived in orinda for 35 years the truck stays pretty close to home the farthest siegel has driven it was to napa to work on the truck s unique bed made of wine barrel slats which he installed over the original steel bed the bed is made of french oak while the wooden sides are sapele mahogany from brazil siegel kept the original commercial license plates on the iowa farm truck while ford and chevrolet had pickup trucks back in the day that carried loads of a half or three quarters of a ton the diamond t hauled an amazing one ton to cope with that heavy load the truck originally had springs so firm siegel says your teeth would chatter he made adjustments to soften the ride he was able to find original coker replica tires and restored the original wheel rims and hub caps the diamond t now has a 1995 chevy corvette engine which replaced the original hercules engine it runs on premium 91 octane gasoline and the tank holds 15 gallons siegel loves the art deco appearance of the truck which is he says proudly a chick magnet really the truck is a people magnet with folks always stopping to admire the handsome truck most don t recall diamond t trucks siegel s model 4116 was manufactured between 1939 and 1948 the company was later bought by freightliner in 1969 diamond ts were farm trucks and so are rare in california siegel says there are perhaps 15 or 20 in good condition in the u s he s had offers but isn t ready to part with his diamond t the cadillac of trucks as it was known the t in the name of the truck is for its designer the founder of the chicago company c a tilt most of the trucks were painted fire engine red but siegel s truck had the california option which features paint in moleskin tan and rootbeer brown siegel who for many years had a successful luggage business crafted a leather valise that he has attached to the running board of the truck for extra storage it fits with the look of the truck perfectly the old truck has some unique features no longer found on modern vehicles for example the split windshield opens for ventilation in addition to side vents siegel grew up in piedmont and met his wife sarah at piedmont high sarah is an artist specializing in the plein air style when he was young siegel and his friend would go to emeryville and look at all the truck dealerships i saw the diamond t there he says and i thought it was the best looking truck of all the car show is the orinda association s primary fundraiser for orinda seniors around town which provides a variety of

the weights for the wacc w d and w s were cal culated by averaging the companies total debt to asset and total common equity to asset ratios respectively from 1997 to 2001 the cost of debt k d was estimated by averaging the firms interest expense to debt ratio from 1997 to 2001 when a company s interest expense to debt ratio was not reported an average of the 3 month aa financial commercial paper rate from june 2001 through march 2003 as published by the federal reserve was used instead the average marginal corporate tax rate was estimated using where available the average from 1997 to 2001 ratio of the firm s cash paid in taxes to net operating cash flow when these data were unavailable a corporate tax rate of 35 per cent was used this method resulted in a mean average marginal tax rate for the 12 firm sample of 38 percent and a median rate of 35 percent since the corporate tax rate is used only for the debt component of the wacc a component which does not change under the bush proposal the difference between the current law wacc and the post bush plan wacc is unaffected by this esti mate to estimate the dividend component d 1 of the cost of equity capital k s an average dividend was calculated using the mean cash dividend paid dur ing the period 1997 to 2001 the purchase price of the stock p 0 was estimated as the 1997 average quarterly price and was calculated by dividing the firms quarterly market value by its quarterly num ber of common shares outstanding the equity growth rate g was estimated as the mean of the monthly moody s seasoned aaa corporate bond yield as published by the federal reserve both the statutory personal tax rate for debt holders t d and the statutory personal tax rate on dividends t div were assumed to be 27 percent the effective personal tax rate on capital gains t effcg was estimated as follows t effcg t scg p 1 p 0 p 0 where t scg is the statutory tax rate on capital gains p 1 is the 2001 average share price and p 0 is the 1997 average share price the statutory tax rate on capital gains t scg was assumed to be 20 percent the 2001 share price p 1 was calculated in the same manner as the 1997 average share price see above to estimate the cost of equity capital k s under the bush plan the excludable distribution amount eda was estimated for each company the amount of the eda determines the amount of cash that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends that can be excluded from their adjusted gross income the amount of the eda also deter mines the amount of retained cash that can be used to provide shareholders with a basis adjust ment any amount of cash less than or equal to the eda that is retained in the firm can be used to provide a basis adjustment based on proposed u s treasury rules all companies would assume a corporate tax rate of 35 percent and would calcu late their eda as follows eda u s income taxes 0 35 u s income taxes where u s income taxes paid the prior year are used to calculate the eda for the current year to estimate the eda for the 12 companies in the sample income tax expense as reported on the income statement was used as an estimate for u s income taxes the amount of the excludable div idend was then estimated as the eda divided by the average number of common shares outstand ing for the given year the average number of shares outstanding was estimated by averaging the number of shares outstanding for each fiscal quar ter the basis adjustment was then estimated by subtracting the per share excludable cash dividend from the per share eda the eda divided by the average number of shares outstanding using these eda calculations the cost of equity capital k s was estimated for all the companies in the sample for those dividend paying companies distributing less than their eda the term in the wacc equation simplifies to signifying the bush plan s per sonal dividend exclusion for non dividend pay ing firms as well as those firms with an eda greater than their cash dividends paid the cost of equity capital was lowered to reflect a basis adjust ment the basis adjustment is estimated as the eda less total cash dividends paid divided by the num ber of shares outstanding for a given fiscal year under the bush proposal the annual basis adjust ment can be carried over to subsequent years this cumulative total or cumulative retained earnings basis adjustment creba can be added to the basis of a stock when it is sold thus lowering the effective capital gains tax rate to estimate the effect of the basis adjustment the effective tax rate on capital gains t effcg t scg p 1 p 0 p 0 was calculated by adding the per share creba to the purchase price of the stock p 0 all investors were assumed to buy their shares in 1997 and hold them through the end of 2001 effective personal dividend tax rates we used heritage s individual income tax micro simulation model to estimate the effective personal dividend tax rates for childless married joint filer taxpayers in the first five income tax brackets the current law tax brackets for 2003 the results highlighted in this cda report are the effective dividend tax rates for married couples with

mea sure was calculated for each fiscal year from 1990 through 2001 see table 5 since the average ratio for the 11 year period was 24 75 per cent an estimated corporate tax rate of 25 percent was used to calculate the effective personal tax rates the total dividends received by taxpayers d was grossed up to a pre corporate tax amount by divid ing the dividends received by the complement of the estimated corpo rate tax rate d 1 0 25 the amount of the corporate tax paid on the dividends was then calculated as the corporate tax rate 0 25 multi plied by the pre tax corporate divi dend d 1 0 25 the personal tax on dividend income was calculated by multiplying d by the statutory tax rate corresponding to the taxpayer s taxable income the effective personal tax rate on dividends was then calculated by dividing the combined tax corporate plus personal on the dividend income by the pre tax corporate divi dend d 1 0 25 footnotes these levels of income are approximately equal to the taxable income midpoints of the respective tax brackets and assume a corporate tax rate of 25 percent despite providing shareholders with a basis adjustment for retained funds the personal dividend exclusion component of the president s plan has garnered most of the media attention from an economic standpoint however the basis adjust ment which lowers shareholders effective capital gains tax

an international tribunal ordered south korea to pay the us private equity firm lone star funds 216 5 million officials said wednesday bringing an end to a decadelong legal battle surrounding its sell off of a local bank the washington dc based international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid delivered the verdict in the investor state dispute settlement suit that lone star filed in 2012 to demand 4 68 billion in compensation from south korea s government according to the justice ministry the decision is seen as a victory for south korea as the amount is only 4 6 percent of lone star s demand separately however the icsid ordered south korea to pay accumulated interest in accordance with the us 1 month treasury rate calculated from dec 3 2011 until the payment is completed according to ministry officials the texas based firm claimed its 2007 plan to sell a controlling stake in the now defunct korea exchange bank to global banking giant hsbc fell through because seoul s financial regulatory authorities delayed approval of the deal lone star which acquired the keb stake for 1 38 trillion won 1 02 billion in 2003 had planned to sell off the stake to hsbc for about 5 94 trillion won but eventually ended up selling it to seoul based hana financial group for some 3 9 trillion won in 2012 lone star claimed that south korea deliberately delayed approval of the deal with hsbc and pressured it to lower the price in the deal with hana financial group depriving the firm of fair and equitable treatment and other protections guaranteed in the investment treaty south korea rejected the claims arguing it treated lone star equally and fairly as in the case of domestic entities in accordance with international laws and local regulations the seoul government has also maintained there were legitimate reasons to hold up the deal with hsbc pointing out that legal issues involving the firm were ongoing at the time including allegations of stock manipulation in the course of lone star s acquisition of keb s credit card unit in another issue lone star claimed korean tax authorities applied inconsistent standards seeking to claim back the taxes it paid on the proceeds from selling off its assets because it was technically its subsidiaries based in either belgium or luxembourg that carried out the transactions the firm claims it should be exempt from taxes under investment treaties south korea has with the european nations but south korea says the subsidiaries are paper companies and should not be protected by investment treaties the icsid s decision is unlikely to be reversed though there is a process to seek its cancellation according to legal experts south korea can file an application for annulment within 120 days after the verdict is awarded according to the icsid it marked the first time for south korea to compensate millions of won in the investor state dispute in 2018 the icsid ruled in favor of the iranian family the dayyanis and ordered seoul to pay 73 billion won in compensation over a failed takeover of daewoo electronics the ruling could also affect five other investor state suits involving south korea the ruling was closely watched in south korea not only because of the amount of money involved but also the alleged involvement of several incumbent high ranking officials in the issue allegations arose earlier this year that prime minister han duck soo was paid a total of 150 million won between november 2002 and july 2003 as an adviser for the local law firm kim chang which represented lone star at the time lone star s entry into and exit from south korea has been a target of criticism in south korea amid widespread public perceptions that the firm made huge profits by taking advantage of the country s economic difficulties in the wake of the asian financial crisis in the late 1990s yonhap

corporate social responsibility csr is a form of self regulation that reflects a company s commitment to be socially accountable to itself its stakeholders and the public csr s purported goal is to contribute to the well being of communities through a positive impact on all aspects of society including economic social and environmental while critics question csr s lofty and sometimes unrealistic expectations and view it as mere window dressing its appeal and overall goal are easy to understand however what happens when csr becomes corporate social irresponsibility in july 2021 ben jerry s independent board announced their decision to boycott israel and cease their relations with american quality products aqp and its owner avi zinger who has been representing them there for over 30 years the board consciously succumbed to the bds campaign singling out the jewish state for economic cultural and academic strangulation a press release on their behalf stated that ben jerry s operation in israel was inconsistent with their values this decision led to severe backlash what exactly are those values when and how should these values be activated in a business environment and to what extent if the answer is not clear to you don t feel like you re alone in an interview with axios shortly after the announcement the co founders of ben jerry s themselves ben cohen and jerry greenfield who supported the company s decision seemed baffled by the very same question advertisement during the interview axios s alexi mccammond questioned the two you guys are big voting rights proponents why do you still sell ice cream in georgia texas abortion bans why are you still selling there aa refrigerator bearing the ben jerry s logo is seen at a food store in the jewish settlement of efrat july 20 2021 credit reuters ronen zevulun i don t know cohen answered and laughed with embarrassment i think you ask an excellent question and i think i d have to sit down and think about it for a bit he added by that reasoning we should not sell any ice cream anywhere i ve got issues with what s being done in almost every state and country how should a decision be made on such issues and by whom especially as they pertain to a complicated conflict such as the one in the middle east the demand made by ben jerry s of zinger not to sell in certain areas of israel and the palestinian territories would have put zinger in violation of israeli law prohibiting such boycotts moreover the negative implication of their decision would mean hundreds of families and thousands of people losing their livelihoods are those the actual values of ben jerry s over the years zinger has been the poster child of what ben jerry s loved to see as a manifestation of their social conscience he was the first manufacturer in israel who conducted his business according to the principles set forth by fairtrade international he has supported many co existence projects over the years between israelis and palestinians as a result of ben jerry s inexplicable move last year zinger had to drop his financial and professional support from these endeavors thus undermining the very cause ben jerry s supposedly uphold themselves but the question at hand exceeds only the moral one in the months following ben jerry s announcement lawsuits were filed over the illegal termination of their contract with ben jerry s israel additionally multiple us states began divesting pension funds from unilever including new york and illinois where boycotting israel is unlawful as a result unilever s stock suffered a significant blow in the financial markets advertisement in june 2022 unilever announced it settled with zinger and stated it rejects completely and repudiates unequivocally any form of discrimination or intolerance the company added that antisemitism has no place in any society we have never expressed any support for the boycott divestment sanctions bds movement and have no intention of changing that position but the story did not end there the independent board in vermont was quick to take the unprecedented and legally questionable move of suing its parent corporation to keep its illegal and harmful ban on israel they based their claim on a somewhat strange and unique clause in both companies merger agreement of 22 years ago providing the independent board with primary responsibility over the ben jerry s social mission and brand integrity they further claimed that if left unaddressed unilever s actions will undermine our social mission and the essential integrity of the brand which threatens our reputation and ultimately our business as a whole but the truth of the matter is the exact opposite it was the board s ill made decision that undermined the company s social mission and integrity and it was their decision that threatened the business as a whole causing the company almost irreparable damage ben jerry s attempt to undermine unilever s agreement with zinger failed and the court rejected their claim it is further evidence of the lack of good judgment by the independent board they had shown a lack of character and misjudgment by being duped into supporting bds their decision was morally wrong and its impact continues to damage and blur whatever social mission the company may profess to stand for yet beyond the social mission we must contend with the question of the financial damages suffered by every shareholder as a result of the board s unfortunate decision the current legal proceedings allow unilever to set boundaries for the board and define the scope of its independence furthermore these proceedings open the door for a more significant discussion which should draw a line between dangerous shenanigans and csr and finally answer a few fundamental questions under what circumstances should a company be allowed to undermine its shareholders financially how should it be done by whom and on what terms and conditions

release of woodside energy s wds earnings result which showed a 400 jump in profit and a tripling of its dividend the result was worth only a 1 5 gain for the stock but it s a big stock as is rival santos sto which also rose 1 5 in sympathy the energy sector gained 1 4 underpinned by a jump in oil prices overnight but oil prices tanked last night so today will be a different picture woodside seemingly gave the asx200 the courage to take a run back up to the 7000 level which it did hitting 7020 with about half an hour to go but late selling pared that back leading the index to a close of 6998 a pivot point alas wall street has not played ball overnight and our futures are down 58 points this morning technology led the bounce back yesterday 1 8 despite more weakness in the nasdaq overnight outside of energy and tech other sectors all rebounded modestly by less than 1 after monday s tumbles materials nevertheless closed flat earnings report winner on the day was omni bridgeway

some big names so we ll be handicapped from the start technical breach news came through early on wall street that taiwan had fired a warning shot at a chinese drone circling a taiwanese island causing some nervousness the conference board s consumer confidence index for august came out at 103 2 up from 95 7 in july when economists had forecast 97 4 not only was this the first increase in four months anything over 100 signals optimism steadily falling us gasoline prices are cited as the cause right now wall street doesn t want a confident consumer because the fed doesn t want a confident consumer as it is a headwind to bringing down inflation so good news is bad a too strong labour market is also a headwind also rising for the first time in four months were us job openings up to 11 2m from 11 0m in july when economists had forecast a fall to 10 2m more job openings than the number of those looking for work implies higher wages which are also inflationary it was this data update that really spooked wall street last night note that at the same time snap announced it would lay off 20 of its workforce a 5 5 fall in the wti crude price did not help stock indices either even though this is good news on the inflation front the dow was down 450 points at its low but more ominously the s p500 fell through the 4000 mark this is technically significant in itself but also happens to be where the 50 day moving average is currently sitting an attempt was made to recover lost ground in the last hour but this failed in the last half hour and the s p500 closed at 3986 any talk of technical support has now evaporated the s p has also now given back more than 50 of the rally off the june low which was in itself a 50 retracement of the 2022 fall to that point since the rally began the bears have insisted the s p will ultimately have to retest the low but as the market became more complacent there were many who suggested a pullback was likely but not as far as a retest now sentiment has swung bearish again and the june low is back in sight that was 3636 another 8 7 down from last night s close tonight we ll see the adp private sector jobs number followed

conservatives often see prospective presidential contender gavin newsom as a tool of the far left and as such politically doomed by the seemingly endless crises afflicting california yet the golden state governor is a more formidable candidate than this portrayal suggests rather than being a progressive windup doll the 54 year old is in fact a skilled political opportunist with far less dogmatically left wing views than most of his party s legislative delegation he would have no qualms abandoning unpopular progressive stances to pursue the goal of succeeding a doddering president joe biden in just the last week newsom provided two indicators of his flexibility he vetoed a bill that would have legalized shooting alleys so called safe drug injection sites in san francisco los angeles and oakland many of his progressive allies who favor such programs denounced the veto they may be untroubled by rising street crime and drug overdoses but newsom knows that disorder in california s major cities offers a devastating talking point for his opponents especially those to his right even more striking was newsom s recent turnaround on california s last nuclear plant and even its gas plants the green constituency in california detests both forms of energy production and even seeks to ban gas stations gas heaters and anything else tainted by fossil fuels california s green policies have helped make its energy prices among the nation s highest and have created conditions likely to cause massive energy shortages on the power grid large scale blackouts and brownouts could also become fodder for anti newsom political ads in 2024 newsom s recent moves on public safety and energy have outraged california progressives particularly the powerful green lobby which denounced his energy move as incredibly dangerous california s greenhouse gas emissions are statistically meaningless next to those of china which emits more carbon than all other industrial countries combined newsom knows that green pronunciamentos about the distant future for example the recently announced ban on the sale of new gas cars after 2035 and the goal set in 2018 by his predecessor of relying on a zero carbon electric grid in 2045 make better politics than trying to shut down an economy that still depends on fossil fuels today newsom spokesman anthony york suggested that the alternative policies proposed by greens feels like fantasy and fairy dust yet none of newsom s recent moves should be surprising he is after all not the product of the radical social justice crowd but the anointed candidate of the bay area s uber class he generally backs causes embraced by silicon valley and the heirs of inherited wealth on gay marriage gender abortion gun control and climate change rather than those focused on expropriating the wealth of the tech entertainment and financial elites who have financed his career indeed compared with jerry brown his far more interesting and sometimes more intellectually driven predecessor newsom tends to bend with changing conditions as mayor of san francisco he ran as a dogmatic fiscal conservative and a social liberal who moved ahead of the pack on issues like gay marriage but also proved friendly to the tech firms that transformed the city during his reign after winning election as lieutenant governor in 2011 newsom ventured to texas to witness firsthand that state s thriving economy a move many saw as implicit criticism of then governor brown as he eyes a white house campaign in the event biden doesn t seek reelection newsom faces some homegrown obstacles including the presence of his fellow californian vice president kamala harris in the biden administration but harris generates little enthusiasm these days even among california progressives and many expect her to be bought off by a plum private sector job or perhaps an appointment to the supreme court yet even if harris leaves on demand newsom will still have to cope with the negatives associated with his patrician profile ultimately newsom s fate is tied to california s the golden state did not fare well in the pandemic and its prime source of funding the capital gains enjoyed by the rich is now shrinking state finances have relied increasingly on past gains in tech stocks and the ipo market and on rising property values these too show signs of weakening in silicon valley today therapy is the big growth industry though state officials and their media amplifiers enthuse about california s nearly 100 billion surplus the legislative analyst s office predicts the return of budget deficits in flush times newsom could hand out thousands of dollars in goodies to households and direct massive subsidy programs for housing and health care for the poor and the underemployed but now the state looks poised to see a repeat of the last recession which ended in 2009 back then it took california five years to bring revenue back up to pre downturn levels and the government had to cut state programs by roughly 45 billion to compensate for the deficit california also has the fifth highest long term debt of any state more than 500 billion and that will increase with higher interest rates in his reelection campaign for governor this fall newsom will not run on increasing taxes preferring to position himself as a fiscally conscious moderate but after november his political allies notably the public employee unions will likely respond to a new budget crisis with calls to raise the state s income tax already the nation s highest and to add new payroll taxes to pay for universal health care even worse news for newsom politically are progressive plans for a wealth tax that would apply even to some of those who move out of the state such proposals could drive more high profile billionaires to flee as elon musk and larry ellison have already done there s even a proposal to reduce the work week to 32 hours spread over four days with all additional work counted as overtime and a host of bills meant to regulate small businesses such as fast food outlets meantime california pushes policies that limit contract labor contributing to work stoppages at the port of oakland and causing distress at the much larger ports of long beach and los angeles which have resisted automation and are losing market share newsom s prospects could also suffer from california s lagging new investment compared with states like ohio florida and texas as well as its severe underperformance compared with its rivals in areas like construction manufacturing and professional and business services it s hard to sell the california model when such a high percentage of all jobs created in the state pay below the median income more embarrassing yet is the fact that tech the last great driver of california prosperity is increasingly leaving the state according to the widely regarded comptia cyberstates projections most of the top ten states for tech growth by 2032 will be red ones including utah nevada florida and texas texas has now even passed california in terms of creating new tech jobs the biden initiatives favoring high tech and green energy may not be of too much help to california though much of the semiconductor industry is currently headquartered in the state the new surge of chip production is taking place almost entirely in places like ohio new mexico arizona and texas similarly most new electric vehicle and battery plants are located either in the heartland the south or other locations east of the sierra nevada and newsom also will have to answer for california s enormous level of inequality california now has the nation s worst cost adjusted poverty rate and remarkably the highest rate of functional illiteracy when the last california governor to become president ronald reagan entered the oval office the state s allure was still strong but as newsom gears up for a possible presidential run the magic is gone particularly for young families the new californian on average is young and single and even immigrants are starting to avoid the state population growth already slowing in the last decade has now turned negative for the first time in modern california s history and yet amid this storm of woes it would be a mistake to underestimate either newsom or california the state still has a way of reinventing itself and projecting its story onto the rest of the country it remains well positioned in the critical fields of software medical equipment manufacturing trade and space all industries with bright long term futures even if the country suffers a recession next year california could emerge at least in aggregate as a plausible success story given the apparent need among democrats for a viable alternative candidate to biden in 2024 newsom could prove the most alluring option to face off against florida governor ron desantis or better for his chances donald trump newsom could like bill clinton seek to connect with voters by shifting toward the center right republican presidential hopefuls who dismiss newsom for his blow dried hair or his shifting convictions do so at their own peril if replacements for biden are in the offing in 2024 newsom s name will be near or at the top of the list photo by brian van der brug los angeles times via getty images

it is possible to eliminate the monkeypox outbreak in europe world health organization officials said on tuesday highlighting evidence that case counts are slowing in a handful of countries there are encouraging signs of a sustained week on week decline in the onset of cases in many european countries including france germany portugal spain and britain as well as a slowdown in some parts of the united states despite scarce vaccine supplies we believe we can eliminate sustained human to human transmission of monkeypox in the european region said who regional director for europe hans kluge to move towards elimination we need to urgently step up our efforts the rollout of bavarian nordic s monkeypox vaccine has been affected by limited supply of the shot which is also approved to prevent smallpox although regulators are taking steps to stretch out existing stocks u s european union and british regulators have backed changing the way the vaccine is administered by injecting a smaller amount of the shot intradermally which increases by fivefold the doses that can be used from one vial in addition to the vaccine supply crunch given the time it takes to deploy the vaccine and for it to take effect the significant factors behind the slowdown appear to be earlier detection which leads to patients isolating themselves sooner and behavioural changes catherine smallwood senior emergency officer and monkeypox incident manager at who europe said in a press briefing we do have some pretty good anecdotal evidence that people particularly men who have sex with men who are in particular risk groups are much more informed about the disease more than 47 600 confirmed cases in 90 countries where monkeypox is not endemic have been reported since early may the who has declared the outbreak a global health emergency covid polio meanwhile cases of covid 19 and other respitory viruses are also expected to see an uptick this autumn and winter as is typically the case in the cooler months who officials said the preventative measures that kept seasonal flu at bay in 2021 and 2020 for instance are no longer in place so it may not be a typical flu season this year smallwood said separately polio a deadly disease that used to paralyze tens of thousands of children every year is spreading in london new york and jerusalem for the first time in decades spurring catch up vaccination campaigns the cases appear to be linked to so called vaccine derived polio which rarely stems from the use of an oral polio vaccine containing weakened live virus after children are vaccinated they shed virus in their faeces for a few weeks in under vaccinated communities this can lead to a spread of the disease which may mutate back to a harmful version of the virus while countries like britain and the united states no longer use this live vaccine others do particularly to stop outbreaks which allows for polio to spread globally the evidence suggests the polio virus detected in all three locations appears to be genetically linked said who europe s vaccination expert siddhartha datta but what remains to be investigated is whether there are links around the cases he said
