this story is from texas monthly s archives we have left the text as it was originally published to maintain a clear historical record read more here about our archive digitization project what is most striking about robert benton s new film nadine which is set in austin in 1954 is that texas doesn t mean anything here is a texas filmmaker revisiting the same era that gave us giant hud and the last picture show all movies that draw deeply from the wellsprings of texas past and texas future but as i watched nadine a halfhearted murder story and get rich quick mystery about the wife of a bar owner who is failing in business and love what i felt most strongly was the absence of consequence nadine kim basinger and vernon jeff bridges hightower are true texans all right but one does not read in them the death of the frontier or the coming of the oil boom or the rise of urban culture the currents of history do not stir now of course why should they in hollywood until recently texas was not a real place it was a symbol for the unbridled west where men are free to be myths it was a playground for the american frontier legend made over again and again in the westerns of john ford and howard hawks texas was an arena of the mind where a man came face to face with death and destiny it was the same emotional territory as the wilderness of judea only in texas god was absent and man was left to fend alone seeing those movies made me feel special as a texan but in a fraudulent sort of way i imagine that every texan at least every texas man has experienced the dissonance of not being who he is supposed to be of failing to live up to the legend one goes through life being john wayne jr i had the chance to reflect on this phenomenon once in egypt when i went horseback riding near the pyramids i was given a rearing arabian stallion that was brought to me by three terrified handlers the horse s name in arabic was murderer and he hadn t been ridden in two years because i was from texas the handlers assumed i could ride him which i did about halfway to libya popular videos previous next more the kennedy assassination abruptly ended the heroic era of texas after that the state became a symbol for what hollywood felt was wrong with america it was violent hateful crude and alarmingly dangerous texas was slim pickens as major king kong riding the hydrogen bomb to apocalypse in dr strangelove texas was the rednecks in easy rider who couldn t tolerate hippies and lamented jack nicholson liked to cut their hair now when the movies came to my state they weren t looking for the good they were looking for the evil in the zoroastrian universe of hollywood texas was all one or all the other it wasn t until hud in 1963 and midnight cowboy in 1969 that the movies found the texas i knew i was teaching english at the american university in cairo when midnight cowboy came out and i took my class to see it the movie opens on the big tex drive in in big spring where joe buck jon voight has absorbed his dose of the myth which he tries to live out by wearing movie cowboy clothes and then by seeking stardom in new york to me midnight cowboy was exactly about the neurosis of wanting to live up to the myth i came out of the movie recharged and excited but i noticed my students were spiritually shaken almost despairing for the first time i realized how much the rest of the world valued texas what a rich legacy it was how universally appealing was the myth texas has its own geography which figures into the mythical dimension when we re in texas the actual film may be shot in monument valley utah stagecoach the searchers or in the rolling canadian wheat fields days of heaven in the alamo san antonio is perched on the banks of the rio grande paris texas is in the pastoral red river country but paris texas lies in the barren western desert the disjunction between movie texas and real texas continues even in modern trash such as the swarm in which a train crosses a range of mountains to enter houston the antimythic texas movies make a point of showing just how plain the place is how spare and forbidding and yet the odd truth is that the real texas landscape on film is evocative and even mythic despite itself the scene at the stock tank in the last picture show in which sam the lion is talking to sonny about how beautiful this godforsaken landscape is jumped off the screen into my subconscious i too could see the beauty it wasn t pretty but it was haunting in a way the now familiar ironed flat prairie of tender mercies 1918 places in the heart and the trip to bountiful all shot near waxahachie has become an existential tablet upon which man works out his spiritual needs perhaps texas really is a place that exists more fully on film than in life no doubt that is one reason there are scarcely any exterior shots in nadine and only one brief glance at the countryside it is a way of smothering the myth as a viewer i ve come to expect that when a movie is set in texas there must be a darn good reason it is either playing into the myth or playing against it but nadine is only the latest example in a series of films in which texas is nowhere in 1974 the first texas movie appeared that had nothing to do with texas it was benji which was written directed and produced by joe camp of dallas after being turned down by every major film distributor camp distributed the film himself and wound up making more than 30 million in 1975 alone benji was the beginning of the native film industry in texas twelve years later despite oscars for tender mercies places in the heart terms of endearment and the trip to bountiful and despite hundreds of films made or set or financed in the state benji is still the benchmark of the texas cinema in the hollywood mind where money is all that counts the only other movie mentioned in the same breath is the texas chainsaw massacre the ironic development of the third coast is that it is the texas filmmakers who have reduced the state to its neutral status where texas once stood for large scale life and death drama the texas seen through the native eye is almost perversely small i don t think there is another school of cinema outside of czechoslovakia with such a bloated corpus of small arty films it is odd to me that in a culture that values money as much as texas does the movies it chooses to make are such fragile intensely focused personal stories as raggedy man 1918 on valentine s day blood simple and last night at the alamo they are the sort of movies that get enthusiastically reviewed by the new york times but live most of their lives on videocassettes and in film school seminars they are playing in other words to highbrows the best of that genre tender mercies and the trip to bountiful both written by horton foote showcased oscar winning performances by robert duvall and geraldine page foote himself received an oscar for tender mercies and a nomination for the trip to bountiful when i first saw tender mercies a revolutionary artistic sensibility seemed to be at work spare controlled uncompromised utterly real i also admired robert benton s places in the heart for which sally field won an academy award yet the smallness of these stories leaves me gasping for air nadine is another in this series of texas miniatures except that it isn t even arty as nadine and vernon plot how to get rich outwit the cops and cancel their impending divorce they act out a story that but for texas accents could just as easily have been set in illinois what is missing in these movies is scale sweep a sense of history moving underfoot one has the feeling with benton s movies that growing up in texas was a fond but incidental part of his personal history he sees the state nostalgically good important movies can be made in and about texas the legend of gregorio cortez and true stories are fine examples but texas filmmakers are so set on avoiding mythology that they have reduced themselves to a level that is smaller than life as a texan i appreciate the realism the closely observed details of ordinary life but as a moviegoer i find i m longing for texas several years ago i was in archer city larry mcmurtry s hometown and i noticed a bulldozer razing a building on the town square the building turned out to be the movie house the same place that had inspired mcmurtry s novel the last picture show and the movie that was made from it i picked up one of the bricks from the rubble and thought about the wonderful scene in that movie where sonny and duane and billy the retarded kid are watching red river i remember feeling a powerful sense of identification with those boys who were living in texas but whose imaginations at that moment were with john wayne and montgomery clift in the greatest texas movie ever made larry mcmurtry has written numerous screenplays but his novels are what get made into movies hud the last picture show and terms of endearment have over the last three decades marked the changes in texas better than any other works i thought about how mcmurtry must have sat in that theater feeling the ambivalence every texan has felt when the myth looms over him the last picture show captured that ambivalence now is it ironic or simply inevitable that mcmurtry s greatest book lonesome dove would take place in texas he has reclaimed a legacy that all texans share that is the legendary texas of their imaginations maybe it is time texas filmmakers returned to that territory with a native eye and made it our own
what in the world are barack obama and john boehner thinking economic collapse dec 18 2012 barack obama and john boehner both seem absolutely determined to drive u s government finances off a cliff the mainstream media would have you believe that there are vast ideological differences between the two of them and that they are bitter enemies but that is simply not the case both of them say that tax increases are necessary but they disagree over the details both are seeking about a trillion dollars of spending cuts and about a trillion dollars of new revenue but they don t see eye to eye on how to get there but overall they are both definitely playing in the same ballpark and those numbers certainly do sound impressive until you realize that they are talking about a time span of ten years personally i would love to see federal spending cut by a trillion dollars this year but that will never happen a trillion dollars over the course of a decade breaks down to about 100 billion dollars per year that still sounds like a lot of money until you put it up next to the trillion dollar deficits that we have been running for four years in a row even if somehow those spending cuts turned out to be real which they aren t they would still only put a very small dent in our yearly budget deficits obama and boehner both want to continue to have a gigantic federal government that showers people with government money and both of them want to continue to pass much of the burden for paying for this gigantic government on to future generations and both of them want to continue to steal more than 100 million dollars an hour from our children and our grandchildren in order to maintain the false bubble of debt fueled prosperity that we are enjoying right now this is incredibly foolish and they are leading us down a path that will lead to national ruin sadly even the pathetically small budget cut and new revenue figures that they are floating around turn out to be quite hollow when you inspect them more closely read morewhat in the world are barack obama and john boehner thinking

introduction while many u s equities are highly valued german real estate stocks are currently very attractively valued a good investor broadens his horizons and looks for opportunities outside the united states why german or european stocks due to the interest rate hikes by the fed the dollar has risen sharply against the euro now the ecb is raising interest rates evenly so i expect the euro dollar to remain stable or the value of the euro to rise slightly the rising euro is beneficial for u s investors who manage their money in dollars and buy european stocks they then enjoy an additional currency return i have chosen 3 german real estate stocks that offer an attractive dividend real estate stocks are all down about 50 since the third quarter and thus offer a stable dividend of more than 5 the german real estate stocks i prefer are these real estate companies all focus on the rental management and maintenance of homes mainly in germany the shares are available on the german stock exchange and have sufficient liquidity alternatively the otc stock can be bought but be aware of low liquidity 1 grand city properties 7 1 yield strong recurring profits and shareholder value creation gyc 2021 annual presentation my 1st pick is grand city properties the company rents manages and maintains residential real estate mainly in germany but also in the united kingdom london the real estate allocation is divided between the areas as follows the capital berlin 24 north rhine westphalia 20 london 19 dresden leipzig halle 13 and other metropolises in germany what i find important about real estate companies are leverage ratios and debt maturities grand city properties loan to value ratio is very low at 35 and below their 45 target the maturities of the debts and the size of the debts give a good idea of the growth potential of the company the average debt maturity of grand city properties is 6 years with 97 of the debt hedged at a fixed interest rate debt maturity schedule gyc 3q22 investor presentation adjusted ebitda was â 299 million for the year 2021 adjusted ebitda shows recurring operating profit before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and excluding capital gains revaluations and other non operating income if we compare their debt repayment schedule with adjusted ebitda we see that the company has to refinance its debt maturing in the years 2026 2027 and 2028 there are ample opportunities to refinance the debt so that the repayment takes place after 2029 interest rates are currently higher which will affect the company s profits the dividend should be safe for years to come and new investors will enjoy their fat 7 1 dividend yield 2 leg immobilien 5 2 yield leg immobilien rents out manages and maintains residential real estate and offers its tenants value added services such as wohnservice energieservice technikservice and lws plus the company mainly rents out in wilhelmshaven aurich norden bremen 48 and other metropolises in germany here too we look at the leverage ratio and debt the loan to value ratio is slightly higher than grand city properties at 42 but still below management s target of 45 the average maturity of the debts is 7 years and significant maturities will only occur from 2024 94 of their debts are debts with fixed interest rates well balanced financial profile leg h1 investor presentation adjusted ebitda for 2021 was â 512 million the debt repayment schedule shows that leg immobilien must refinance its debts for the coming years at a higher interest rate another option is to repay debt with proceeds from divestments the investment portfolio is â 19 billion so there is quite a bit of room for deleveraging a small caveat to the valuation of the investment portfolio is that house prices can fall if interest rates rise sharply for now i think their investment portfolio offers a strong margin of safety i consider the dividend stable investors can enjoy their return of 5 25 3 vonovia 6 2 yield my 3th pick is vonovia vonovia rents out manages and maintains residential properties and offers value added services for residential properties in germany but also in austria and sweden the portfolio breakdown of the real estate is as follows berlin 9 rhine main area 6 south rhine area 6 rhineland 5 dresden 5 hamburg 4 etc the good diversification ensures stability in the property portfolio the loan to value ratio is 43 below management s target of 45 the average maturity of the debt is 7 years and 96 of the debt is hedged with a fixed interest rate debt structure vonovia h1 investor presentation vonovia s total adjusted ebitda after the consolidation of deutsche wohnen for the year 2021 is â 2 269 million after 2023 the debts can no longer be covered which means that vonovia will have to refinance its debts this is possible at an interest rate of 2 5 for secured debts and 3 5 for unsecured debts for 8 years another option is to pay off debt with proceeds from divestments or a combination of both the fair value of real estate is â 93 billion which means there is plenty of room to pay off their debts the first debt maturity will be in 2023 and vonovia will sell some portions of its non core assets to meet the obligations as a result i expect a stable dividend and new investors can enjoy their solid 6 2 dividend yield reasons why the stocks have dropped there are a few reasons why these stocks have fallen including investors are concerned that real estate companies will face difficulties in refinancing their debt german 10 year yields rose sharply from the third quarter of 2021 making refinancing more expensive own interpretation refinancing is indeed more expensive if the rental yield is lower than the interest yield on debt it is not economically justified to let through capital must be redistributed and properties with a low rental yield must be sold investors fear that residents will no longer be able to pay their energy bills due to the sharp rise in energy costs own interpretation this is not a landlord tenant problem people who live in their own homes are also affected by increased energy costs this is a social issue and the german government provides relief by offering them subsidies increasing housing allowance and other measures the three stocks are down 50 but there is no need to panic yes there can be a small drop in profits when their debts are paid with asset disposal but it doesn t seem logical that just for this reason stocks have fallen by half stocks fall so sharply when a recession is imminent in most cases for solid companies this should be a perfect buying opportunity as we have seen in the years 2000 2008 and 2020 so enjoy the fat dividends conclusion investing in europe is beneficial when the value of the euro rises against the dollar the ecb is gradually raising interest rates making it interesting to take a closer look at european equities there are 3 german real estate stocks that are attractive because of their high dividends combined with their solid dividend security option 1 concerns grand city properties the stock has been heavily penalized and as a result is trading at a strong 7 1 dividend yield while their debt maturities and cash flows look good for years to come option 2 concerns leg immobilien this stock is also heavily penalized and offers a solid 5 2 dividend yield my pick 3 is vonovia the dividend yield of this stock is a solid 6 2 i see grand city properties as a very safe investment as it can easily meet their debt payment schedule both leg and vonovia will have to sell investment properties and shift their maturities this can put pressure on the dividend but the dividend is well covered by their large quality real estate portfolio all stocks trade very cheaply and equity gains can still be made when the maturity of their debts seems more favorable causing the stock to rise the shares are worth buying enjoy the fat dividends

ukraine has relied heavily on turkish made bayraktar drones to fight the russian invasion on tuesday the cofounder of the company that makes the drones confirmed that ukraine is supplying engines for the drones manufactured by the famed motor sich corporation which ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky prevented russia s ally china from taking over in february 2021 selcuk bayraktar chief technology officer and cofounder of turkey s baykar company responded to a direct question about drone engines by confirming the ukrainians are already supplying and they have already supplied components for the very same drones kyiv is purchasing to use against the russians will ukraine be able to supply turkish fighter uav kizilelma s engines on time despite the ongoing war we asked baykar cto selcuk bayraktar they are already supplying and they have already supplied pic twitter com qlf1yriq5o gdh defence gdhdefence august 30 2022 selcuk bayraktar is not only an executive at the corporation but also one of the engineers who designed the bayraktar drones which have become one of the hottest military products in the world he is also the son in law of turkish president recep tayyip erdogan which is one reason why russia s complaints about a turkish company supplying devastatingly effective weapons to ukraine have been relatively muted turkey s daily sabah reported in november that baykar signed a contract with top ukrainian manufacturer ivchenko progress to purchase ai 322f turbofan engines for combat drones baykar ceo haluk bayraktar selcuk s brother said his company was already procuring engines from ivchenko progress for earlier drone models he described the contract as a joint deal with ivchenko progress and motor sich and said baykar signed separate deals with motor sich as well with the new contract we will install the ai 322f engine produced jointly by ivchenko progress and motor sich in our unmanned fighter aircraft i hope that this deal will further the strategic cooperation between the two countries he said the ai 322f engine will be used in a next generation baykar drone known as the mius a turkish acronym that translates to unmanned combat aircraft system in english baykar has also marketed the upcoming system under the more colorful nickname kizilelma which means red apple a name chosen because red apples represent bold visions in turkish mythology the mius is advertized as an aggressive air combat platform with stealth characteristics capable of reaching supersonic speeds operating for up to five hours at a stretch and launching from the deck of turkey s new amphibious assault carrier the tcg andalou the mius is scheduled to begin flight testing before the end of this year daily sabah quoted ukrainian sources who said over 500 engines would be exported to baykar over the next ten years with a total value of over 600 million motor sich is a venerable aerospace company founded in 1907 and long considered one of the largest suppliers of aircraft engines in the world the company was one of the most important assets controlled by ukraine when it became independent in 1991 because it was the primary source for the collapsing soviet union s helicopter engines and a vital part of the supply chain for many other aircraft parts ivchenko progress is a ukrainian state owned enterprise that works closely with motor sich in essence ivchenko progress designs engines that motor sich builds in early 2021 a group of chinese corporations attempted to take control of motor sich headed up by a firm called skyrizon aviation with links to the chinese military skyrizon managed to buy a controlling stake in motor sich under the previous ukrainian president petro poroshenko but current president volodymyr zelensky blocked skyrizon and its partners from completing the takeover zelensky enraged the chinese communist government by slapping sanctions on skyrizon in february 2021 a move the chinese foreign ministry denounced as a potential violation of international law while skyrizon itself accused zelensky s administration of barbaric robbery zelensky insisted he was not trying to pick a fight with china or get drawn into the cold war between china and the united states but was merely trying to protect the vital national asset of motor sich from being controlled by any foreign entity the chinese companies did not back down from their efforts to take over motor sich so in march 2021 the ukrainian government seized the corporation ostensibly to return it to the ukrainian people motor sich executives accused the would be chinese buyers of failing to pay for the shares of stock they acquired a charge the chinese companies angrily denied the chinese consortium in turn threatened to file lawsuits in ukrainian chinese and international courts the u s embassy in kyiv supported zelensky s actions warning that skyrizon s predator investments and technology acquisitions in ukraine created an unacceptable risk of diversion to military end use by china invading russian forces have attacked motor sich facilities in ukraine on several occasions most recently on monday when russian airstrikes hit a motor sich factory that was repairing helicopters

havre twenty five miles south of havre and an ocean away from birnam wood shakespeare s macbeth and banquo charged through a thicket of trees on horseback and turned a northern montana forest into a theater stage they encountered a trio of old witches chanting in an eerie tone fair is foul and foul is fair hover through the fog and filthy air the witches warned macbeth and banquo played by montana actors theatre cast members grant olson and jay pyette so foul and fair a day i have not seen macbeth said echoing the words of the witches as he sat mounted before an audience of 500 people sitting on blankets and camping chairs bard lovers flocked to havre last weekend for a three show production of macbeth on horseback the weekend s plays were put on by the montana actors theatre at the lions campground near beaver creek park it was the first time that the mat had organized a play with live animals on stage including a one ton war horse that spanned over 20 hands high many of the actors had never interacted with horses before olson is mat s artistic director and oversees production of plays for the mat he said this weekend s series of shows was a big first both for him and the theater team for as long as he can remember this was a show that he d been wanting to do for a while after years of living on a cattle ranch south of havre macbeth mentions horses all the time and it has a whole bunch of horse imagery but usually in productions you can t bring a horse on stage olson said this play was one that always stuck out to me since i grew up with horses the mat is a community based performing arts organization in havre it was first founded in 1992 in havre by current executive director pyette and macbeth show director mike zook it became the official resident theater of msu northern in 2002 and has put up classic plays such as edmond rostand s cyrano de bergerac and shakespeare s hamlet and a midsummer night s dream in 2003 the mat was invited to stage a production of the dead of winter with a cast of 18 montana actors at the union theater in london under olson s direction after he completed his master s at the england royal academy of dramatic art bringing macbeth to life on horseback was no easy task the last time olson had worked on the play was in 2009 when he directed the production at the crystal theater in missoula this time it meant bringing the play to life at an outdoor venue with live horses on set in front of hundreds of people some of the chainmail and armor that we got for that little production at the crystal has since moved into this show because it was stuff we had in stock olson said these are two completely different productions back then the crystal could maybe seat a hundred people in a tiny little space now we re outdoors with live horses i keep laughing at that the production crew had to bring a stunt coordinator and an equine coordinator horse trainer to help actors get accustomed to acting around horses they rehearsed for almost eight weeks learning to ride horses while memorizing their lines the macbeth production team had to figure out how attendees would hear the actors words outside they figured out a wireless sound system that would deliver crystal clear audio into the audience while keeping a safe distance from the crowd zook said that for 20 years he had been corresponding with olson starting when olson was still in graduate school at the royal academy of dramatic art about putting together an outdoor production of macbeth in havre with live horses after years of hashing out a plan zook and olson finally put their idea to work and began casting for the play back in may the pair spent weeks casting people in and around havre some of whom had never had any acting experience they settled on a cast of 20 people including horseback riders who are all from northern montana we ve got elementary and high school students and people that are in college a former military intelligence officer teachers both retired and currently working farmers and ranchers and small business owners zook said it s just an amazing plethora of people it s really a mishmash of different personalities and viewpoints which all adds to the creative process diversity is important chrystal kerr a 25 year resident of havre came to the lions campground with her daughter sister nieces and her mother to experience something out of the ordinary in the area kerr attended msu northern where she took theater and costume design classes she was thrilled to see the crowd that showed up to see macbeth near her hometown we like to dress up and do fun things together as a family she said it sounded like a lot of fun and it s different for our area the weather was perfect and there were so many people which was really exciting to see since the mat s founding in the late 90s its core mission has been to foster montana s performing arts talent especially up on the hi line the mat spearheaded the creation of kidsmat a youth and children s theater programs for kids which has since become a statewide touring youth production program it expanded its operations across the state producing the rocky horror show live at the wilma in missoula every year since 2006 as well as producing plays in great falls after merging with the center stage theatre company in 2010 despite that the mat still remains true to its mission to continue inspiring the next generation of acting talent up on the hi line we ve set the bar high in terms of the professionalism that we demand of our actors and with most we train as we go zook said i think because of that we ve had many of our native montana actors that have moved on to the national level when i come to havre the amount of talent work and the dedication that we have from actors here always blows my mind olson added havre has this amazing bit of talent and the mat has always been able to foster that photos montana actors theatre brings shakespeare to the hi line
north carolina s highest court is expected to rule later this year on how much detail debt buyers must provide to consumers about the amount of money they allegedly owe the state supreme court heard oral arguments tuesday in a case involving portfolio recovery associates which is one of the country s largest debt buyers consumer advocates say that a pro consumer ruling in the suit could make it difficult for debt buyers operating in north carolina to churn out a high volume of lawsuits which frequently lead to default judgments against borrowers a case heard this week by north carolina s supreme court hinges on the interpretation of a 2009 state law that set consumer debt collection rules adobe stock this has the potential for disrupting the assembly line because the debt buyer is held to a higher standard nadine chabrier senior policy and litigation counsel at the center for responsible lending said in an interview wednesday the case involves a 13 year old north carolina law that was meant to increase consumer protections lawyers for the two sides offered opposing interpretations of the 2009 law during tuesday s court hearing jason pikler who represents a borrower from whom portfolio recovery associates sought to recover charged off debt argued that the law requires debt buyers to provide an itemization of the debt they have purchased but john berkelhammer a lawyer for portfolio recovery associates contended that the itemization required by the law applies only to charges incurred after the debt s purchase the lawsuit grew out of an hsbc credit card account that a consumer named pia townes opened back in 2006 townes stopped making payments in june 2012 after hsbc had sold its credit card business to capital one financial mclean virginia based capital one sold the charged off account to portfolio recovery associates in 2013 according to records cited in the litigation in 2015 portfolio recovery associates sued to collect the debt attaching to its lawsuit a spreadsheet that listed both a charge off amount of 1 354 65 and a final statement balance of 1 866 90 the suit sought payment of the latter amount portfolio recovery associates initially obtained a default judgment against townes but a district court later set aside that judgment then after the debt collection company voluntarily dismissed its collection action townes sued for alleged violations of the 2009 state law including a failure to reasonably verify the amount owed with an itemized accounting in a 2020 appeals court ruling townes prevailed setting the stage for an appeal by portfolio recovery associates to the state supreme court a spokesperson for portfolio recovery associates said in an email wednesday that the company does not comment on pending litigation portfolio recovery associates has previously found itself in hot water with regulators in connection with its litigation practices in 2015 the consumer financial protection bureau found that the company collected payments by pressuring consumers with false statements and filing lawsuits without verifying the debt then in 2021 and again early this year portfolio recovery associates disclosed that the cfpb had informed the company that the agency believed it may have violated provisions in the 2015 consent order regulation and compliance industry scrambles to prepare for cfpb debt collection rules banks credit card issuers and debt collectors all supported the consumer financial protection bureau s revised regulations but they face a steep learning curve in complying with the rules which take effect nov 30 october 11 joann needleman a lawyer at clark hill who represents financial institutions in compliance matters said in an interview that itemization requirements have become widespread for debt collectors under both state and federal regulations but these rules typically require debt buyers to itemize any fees added to the charge off balance needleman said she argued that requiring debt collectors to show how the creditor arrived at the charge off balance as consumer advocates argue is mandatory in north carolina is onerous consumer advocates contend that debt buyers abuse the court system by filing a large volume of cases that rely on borrowers failure to appear which allows them to obtain default judgments without providing the evidence that would otherwise be required the high profitability of debt buyer litigation depends on limited consumer involvement with economies of scale making even low value claims worth pursuing the center for responsible lending and other consumer groups wrote in an amicus brief filed in the case

rochester as food banks and shelves struggle to meet rising demand for food they are advocating for bolstering the federal nutrition safety net that has begun to fray as food insecurity rises in particular they are focusing on the farm bill although commonly associated with agriculture policy and rural development the package of legislation known as the farm bill is really a misnomer the lion s share of farm bill spending goes to nutrition programs in the 2018 farm bill for example the last one to be enacted three quarters of its spending went to nutrition programs as food insecurity has risen food shelves are being thrown into the breach and are struggling to meet the need as food supplies decline a key source of food for food shelves and food banks is the emergency food assistance program that is part of the farm bill but commodity support for food banks and shelves from the program has dropped dramatically within the last year advertisement channel one regional food bank in rochester for example has seen a 60 reduction in government commodities from tefap over the past year at the same time channel one has seen a 45 rise in the number of shoppers said virginia merritt executive director of channel one just speaking from my own perspective it feels really high stakes now because the number of people coming through our doors has increased we re seeing numbers now in the summer of 2022 like nothing we ever saw during any point of the pandemic merritt said one problem is that there is simply less food in the system now than there was a couple of years ago when the u s sanctioned china for its unfair trade practices under then president trump there was an increase in tefap deliveries but that increase in food has gone away we re expecting food and it s just not showing up merritt said experts attribute the surge in food shelf shoppers to a perfect storm of factors covid stimulus money has dried up for many of them at the same time inflation and rising fuel and food costs have taken a bigger bite out of family budgets all of this is happening at the same time said dom korbel executive director of community pathways of steele county which includes a food shelf there were always a lot of families who were kind of on the edge of needing help but could just make it and all of these other factors pushed them over the edge korbel said demand for food assistance has doubled at steele county s food shelf in the last year from 250 families on average last year to 506 families now the need has never been greater korbel said advertisement it s not that food shelves are empty but there is less food and variety at channel one merritt said our shelves are half full she said the olmsted county board earlier this month stepped in with 90 000 to help stock food shelves on top of the 50 000 a year it provides to build up support for a farm bill with stronger nutrition programs second heartland harvest a brooklyn park based food bank has been hosting a series of listening sessions across the state on wednesday it held one in the 1st congressional district in albert lea the farm bill is reauthorized once every five years the last bill passed in 2018 most food shelves in minnesota are facing a food crunch but some are better able to weather the storm rachel sosnowchik a spokeswoman for second harvest heartland said food shelves in bigger counties often have bigger budgets to cushion demand one story that aired at a listening session was how a food shelf went directly to a grocery store to buy badly needed items straight off the shelves that s a particularly dramatic example she said but it shows the kind of lengths that people are going to meet the need advertisement tefap is one of a triad of nutrition programs in the farm bill that experts on food insecurity hope to see strengthened the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap is another often referred to as food stamps beneficiaries use an electronic benefits transfer card to access their monthly benefits much like using a debit card snap benefits families and communities in a number of ways food bank executives say it helps families buy and put food on their tables the money flows into local economies an especially important consideration for rural grocery stores and it takes pressure off of food shelves merritt said an estimated 460 000 minnesotans and 40 million people nationwide are enrolled in the program sosnowchik said advocates say they would like to see snap benefits and beneficiaries increase as well as changes in the rules to make enrollment easier right now the process is complicated and time consuming current rules can also be a barrier to enrollment the current snap benefit for the highest income earners is only 16 very little benefit for the bureaucratic red tape they just say it s not even worth it sosnowchik said she said second heartland harvest also wants to see changes in the commodity supplemental food program which serves low income seniors each month beneficiaries receive a box of food items hunger is complex and it takes multiple programs and all of us to deal with food in security merritt said the no 1 thing that we hope that people do is apply for snap if they re eligible and then if they have children signing them up for school lunch and then our food shelf a lot of what our food shelf does is stand in the gap for the working poor

the ptab decision or reversal of district court decision regarding the 793 patent morrisville n c aug 31 2022 globe newswire liquidia corporation nasdaq lqda announced today that a ruling was issued by judge andrews who is presiding over the litigation filed by united therapeutics corporation utc in the united states district court for the district of delaware under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act hatch waxman act that alleges liquidia infringes u s patent no 9 593 066 066 patent u s patent no 10 716 793 793 patent and u s patent no 9 604 901 901 patent the company

conference code 4265646 a webcast of the call will be available on liquidia s website at taking today s ruling together with prior ptab decisions liquidia has now demonstrated in at least one forum that all claims asserted against it are invalid or not infringed based on the arguments presented at trial the court ruled that 5 of 6 asserted claims of the 066 patent are invalid and that the only valid claim is not infringed by liquidia judge andrews also found liquidia would induce infringement of the 5 asserted claims in the 793 patent the court s decision does not affect the ptab s prior decision that all claims in the 793 patent are unpatentable the 901 patent was not addressed in the ruling because utc previously stipulated that liquidia does not infringe any of the asserted claims based on the court s construction of certain terms in the patent roger jeffs chief executive officer of liquidia said we are pleased that all three patents asserted against us have been found to be either invalid or not infringed among the different legal proceedings while we are disappointed with the court s decision on the 793 patent we are optimistic that the ptab s favorable decision will be affirmed on appeal thereby unlocking the path to potential approval of yutrepia by mid 2024 if not earlier we will aggressively pursue the appeals process including an appeal of judge andrews decision in hope of bringing the final resolution sooner while this is not the perfect outcome we had hoped for it is incrementally positive as it does provide us with a definitive path to resolving the patent dispute and making yutrepia available as a treatment option for patients which is our singular focus utc has stated in district court filings that it will appeal the ptab s decision regarding the 793 patent to the court of appeals for the federal circuit if the ptab denies utc s request for rehearing the ipr accordingly liquidia s ability to seek final approval for yutrepia treprostinil inhalation

originally posted by karl denniger on market ticker org jackson cornholed would be the term for friday s sell off for the last couple of months there has been this recurring theme including in places where insanity usually doesn t make much of an appearance like my forum the fed will not keep raising rates it can t the fed will not let the stock housing bond market fall they will cut rates qe will be back in 1 month 2 months before the winter well as i pointed out wrong why because structural inflation is being embedded into the economy and i ve pointed out why that s happening as well congress has believed for the last couple of decades it can spend without limit and not have it happen the reason is trade sequestration in short all the emitted dollars are rapidly gobbled up overseas and while much of that is transient if the absolute size of foreign trade where this is happening goes up then even if it is transient the amount sequestered rises as well only funds that are available to spend here in the united states here and now cause inflation in the united states it s basic inflation is simply more available spending power between previously earned funds money and credit which looks like money but isn t in comparison to the things you spend it on productivity improvement that is doing more with less should produce a mild deflation that is if i can produce 3 more this year than last with the same inputs because i m smarter i learned things and applied them i should see my standard of living rise 3 because the price of what got produced falls by that amount all things being equal this too is math and thus always happens this by the way is good for you if you do more with less that is you re more productive you should have the ability to keep that and thus improve your standard of living in real terms it doesn t happen in the real world because the congress immediately spends all of that and more buying votes they have been taught if you will despite it being a mathematical impossibility that they can do all of this and not have inflation explode in their face you for your part as americans have all bought into the myth that rising prices so long as they are centered in certain areas are good when in fact they re always bad if instead you keep your productivity improvement the number of dollars you have would not go up materially but what they buy would increase and thus your standard of living would be much better than it is today well we cut off trade sequestration essentially all at once when the russia ukraine dust up started by seizing and freezing assets of all sorts we declared that anything that is in international trade and thus can be seized might be and you have no way as a businessperson to prevent that all you have to do is be on the wrong side of some line or political disagreement at the wrong time and everything you have out in such trade balances is gone the us has done this sort of thing on a onesie twosie basis for a long time and nobody got exercised about it after all what does iran produce that we buy other than oil and by the way the oil belongs to the nation state so the risk to an ordinary merchant was tiny this time however nearly the entire world went along with it and it was not limited to the asset of a nation state russia in this instance it was extended to anyone who was too close to the leadership with that being an entirely arbitrary line and extending to those people s and firms personal assets even though they had nothing to do with shooting anyone or bombing anything as soon as that started the door slammed instantly and irrevocably on using foreign exchange as a holding for trade particularly dollars and euros because now the risk is real it is general and there is no way to defend against it other than to demand payment in your local currency as a producer and that it be tendered before the product leaves your nation we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us as a result all of the emitted credit by our congress now immediately comes right back into our economy as inflation exactly as it did more or less in the 1970s before such trade sequestration existed in material amount and exactly as it has this time and will this time and thus the only remedy in the end is for congress to cut it out and until they do the fed will raise rates to a level required to neuter the congressional money spigot they have to they will house and stock prices are going to come down not a little either a lot maybe by as much as 2 3rds or more congress has its work cut out for it as i ve also pointed out for more than ten years the only place you can realistically get the funds to drive deficits below the rate of productivity growth and into surplus for several years to reverse the inflation congress has caused over the last 20 years through its handouts is by destroying the medical monopolists that s simple math if you look at the current treasury statement you will find that cms medicare and medicaid are 1 669 trillion dollars out of 4 83 trillion or 34 6 of the total spend dwarfing any other category and more than twice the operating deficit run rate if congress does not do this and they won t unless we the people force them to you need only look at all the ads on tv and social media to see why there is no way out as at a run rate of more than 700 billion in the hole through july which is about one trillion a year since there are two more months in the fiscal year inflation will continue to run well above fed target and thus the fed will continue to raise rates until it does not and no this won t be a dip that is recovered in a short period of time either because the pricing you ve seen wasn t driven by innovation and advancement it was driven by a deliberate effort within our government on both sides of the aisle to hand out something for nothing in the belief that the trade sequestration would hold forever without consequence and thus they could do it and get away with it it never could work because that which can t be sustained won t be we merely argue over when not what when is now originally posted

by jessefelder a little over a year ago i had the pleasure of interviewing michael oliver in person at his home in colorado listen to that interview here while he shared a great deal about his unique methods the main focus of our discussion was the massive momentum structure that had been building for years in the stock market specifically in the nasdaq 100 index below is an updated version of that chart which plots the index on a monthly timeframe along with another plot of the index relative to its 36 month moving average it is this second chart which isolates the price momentum of the index that has formed a long term structure of some significance we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us during the bull market that dated back to the 2009 low the nasdaq 100 index formed a clear momentum range between roughly 40 above the 36 month moving average on the high side and 10 on the low side the post covid rally saw a breakout above the upper end of that range which represents the final blow off phase of the bull market this year s reversal is notable in that not only did momentum fail to hold support at the 10 level for the first time in over a decade it also failed to hold the 0 level a declarative first leg of decline in michael s words and even to the untrained eye it should be quite obvious that a major change in character is now underway

things aren t looking good on wall street at the moment with us stocks finishing august in decline for the fourth straight day this represents the weakest performance in seven years as powell s friday warning of more monetary policy pain reverberated and sell offs were underway in new york we saw the dow 0 9 the s p 500 0 8 and the nasdaq 0 6 all finish lower by less than a per cent and there were no real winners among the big stocks with atlassian nasdaq team 1 5 apple 1 1 and amazon 1 5 all down by more than a per cent the mercurial netflix bucked the trend up 1 3 over the month the dow lost

down as much as 72 points or 1 04 to 6836 points early this morning aussie jobs on the agenda there is some cause for optimism amid the doom and gloom as the much anticipated jobs and skills summit kicks off today this week s jobs and skills summit is the talk of the business world at the moment said creditorwatch chief economist anneke thompson there is strong hope among all sectors of the economy that some real immediate actions can be taken to help fill some of the 480 000 jobs that are currently available in australia led by the prime minister and treasurer and supported by other key ministers the summit will recommend immediate actions and opportunities for medium and long term reform but will it be just another talkfest or will it broker new partnerships such as the unlikely alliance between the australian council of trade unions actu and the business council of australia bca over paid parental leave this summit will be critical for australia s future economic outcomes as the lack of workers is impacting many businesses particularly small businesses ability to operate at full capacity thompson said australia is enjoying a 3 4 unemployment rate the lowest since 1974 the number of job vacancies now outstrips the number of unemployed people so far so good but are we seeing peak employment we may be seeing early signs that some heat is coming out of the labour market as the total number of people employed dropped for the first time since october 2021 thompson said the reason the unemployment rate also dropped was that the participation rate the proportion of australians currently in the job market also declined there is also concern about the impact of inflation on wages and vice versa the abs wage price index data tells us that real wages have been in decline since june 2021 the high savings rate has meant many australians have not felt the impact of this drop immediately however the total savings rates of australians are now also starting to drop this means that many people are now using their savings pool to meet higher interest repayments and the general higher cost of living thompson said also high on the agenda at the summit will be the gender pay gap including the poor bargaining position of those in feminised labour such as aged care and child care workers the care economy who are some of the lowest paid people in the country the actu is pushing for greater collective bargaining in these low paid industries while groups from both sides of the aisle including the bca are keen to see better paid parental leave and child care subsidies policies which pay for themselves by freeing women up to join the job market and alleviating the labour shortage in the process opposition leader peter dutton will not attend the summit but nationals leader david littleproud plans to be there he says he is attending to ensure that regional australia is not forgotten russia puts the freeze on the west in worrying news for europe russia s

oregon state economists on wednesday delivered their most serious warning in years the state s surging revenue growth is about to end even if the state and country don t experience a recession in the next year a possibility economists say is extremely plausible recent tax receipts that officials have variously described as shocking unbelievable and stunning are about to come back to earth state economist mark mcmullen told lawmakers even if we don t go into a recession unfortunately not all of this revenue boom is sustainable mcmullen said we are due for a hangover according to mcmullen and another state economist josh lehner that hangover has not yet arrived in their quarterly presentation the pair diverged from their typical practice of offering lawmakers only a baseline forecast that they feel is most likely to play out in coming years on wednesday they also delivered a picture of what a recession might look like mcmullen told lawmakers it s virtually a coin flip for which scenario comes to pass and warned a recession if it arrives could be deeper than economists have supposed but in either scenario the state s short term revenue outlook is positive taxes on business income and gains realized in the stock market have not slowed and personal income taxes are still strong under the more optimistic baseline forecast economists say oregon will see 600 million more in the current two year budget cycle than they anticipated just three months ago an increase largely driven by personal income taxes that would result in oregonians receiving a record 3 46 billion back in the form of the kicker the unique oregon policy that returns personal income taxes if they come in at least 2 higher than initial forecasts the numbers to date have not weakened whatsoever mcmullen told lawmakers of corporate taxes but this is terrifying along with capital gains this is our most volatile part of the revenue forecast the more optimistic scenario is less bullish in future years when it predicts revenue growth will be much slower than expected in may economists now say each of the next three two year budget cycles could see revenues more than 600 million lower than projected earlier just as likely economists said is the possibility that oregon will enter into a mild recession toward the end of 2023 the risk lehner said is that surging wages driven by an unsustainably hot labor marketwill continue to drive inflation which could prompt the federal government to further increase interest rates triggering a downturn and a big increase in the state s low unemployment rate we need to see the labor market cool lehner said if oregon does enter into a recession economists say oregon will still see roughly 50 million more than previously expected in the budget cycle that runs through june 2023 but they say revenues for the next two biennial budgets come in at 1 2 billion and 1 4 billion lower than previous estimates should this unfold it would mean large program cuts mcmullen said it would be unavoidable the question for lawmakers who will craft a new two year budget in next year s legislative session is how to incorporate the competing forecasts mcmullen and lehner suggested they operate under the more optimistic version for now reasoning that unnecessarily chopping state services is not ideal we kind of have to wait until we see the white of the recession s eyes before we put in these kinds of drastic revenue reductions mcmullen said but underestimating a potential revenue cliff brings its own risks long time state sen lee beyer said the looming scenario reminded him of 2002 when lawmakers met in five special sessions to continuously revise the budget amid a tanking economy from past experience i think it s time that people who will be there need to take a cautionary look at it said beyer who is retiring when his term expires at the end of the year oregon is better shielded against the bruises of a downturn in 2022 than it was two decades ago the state holds record budget reserves that are expected to top 2 billion by june 2023 and oregon is currently sitting on 3 7 billion in revenue that it held off spending in the current budget if lawmakers leave that money untouched it could help offset future downturns democrats on wednesday reacted to the deeply uncertain forecast by emphasizing that the economy is currently strong thanks to the fiscally responsible decisions the state of oregon has made over the last several years we are well positioned with significant reserves to weather any economic challenges that lie ahead gov kate brown said in a statement now we must continue to make investments to benefit oregon s working families so that all oregonians can feel the benefits of our strong economic recovery we should invest in our communities carefully and stay on our toes senate president peter courtney d salem said in a statement if there is a downturn oregon will be ready house speaker dan rayfield a corvallis democrat and former chief budget writer said the legislature would keep investing in things like housing mental health and addiction and abortion access republicans meanwhile signaled they are ready to take out the budget knives the legislature must be prepared to make the same difficult choices to reduce wasteful spending and reform broken government senate minority leader tim knopp r bend said in a statement senate republicans are prepared to make prudent fiscally responsible choices that focus on protecting core government functions oregonians rely on every day instead of growing government beyond our means which approach the state takes will depend not only on how severe a pinch is coming to oregon s coffers but whether democrats can maintain their grip on the legislature and governor s office in an election year that presents their party with some significant challenges copyright 2022 oregon public broadcasting to see more visit oregon

people look at exchange rates in buenos aires argentina on july 26 2022 as the us and other advanced economies substantially raise interest rates to curb the rampant inflation emerging markets and developing economies are suffering a collateral damage economic stagflation unsustainable debt currency depreciation and financial turbulence some are even running into serious economic and social crisis such as the recent economic collapse in sri lanka ringing the alarm bell for the whole world it reminds us once again of the old curse imposed by western capital on developing countries unlike the west depending on colonial plundering and exploitation to accumulate raw capital most developing countries as latecomers had to borrow money particularly from the western dominated multilateral financial institutions to finance their development however loans were oftentimes offered on harsh conditions of the so called neo liberal economic restructuring the prescriptions given by the western countries are known as the washington consensus an economic tool to exploit and control the developing countries under the disguise of economic reform step one shatter your shield although the west preaches that capital liberalization increases liquidity and market dynamism the reality is without capital control fragile financial systems of developing countries easily lose their brakes when providing loans to countries in need of funds the world bank required them to deepen economic reform and open up their financial markets to foreign capital which then flooded into those countries to speculate in the real estate stock and currency markets when crisis struck the hot money would take flight and the foreign exchange reserves of the affected countries would be sucked dry in a matter of days or even hours the imf s conditions for rescue include tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates to absurd levels of up to 80 percent such high interest rates would only destroy local industrial production and exploited the wealth of ordinary local people it is precisely because of the imf s rescue plan that in mid 1998 thailand s non performing assets accounted for 48 percent of the total credit step two control your lifelines neo liberalism dictates to developing countries to privatize their enterprises on the ground that privileged state owned giants will lead to market failure the result is that the core industries of debtor countries which is their lifeline fall into the hands of foreign capital documents disclosed by former world bank chief economist joseph stiglitz show that the world bank asked countries receiving emergency aid to sign as many as 111 secret clauses including the sale of the recipient countries core assets water electricity natural gas railways telecommunications oil banking etc leaders of recipient countries would receive a large sum of money through their secret accounts in swiss banks if they agree to sell those assets at bargain prices multinationals in developed countries would then take the advantage to conduct mergers and acquisitions at particularly favorable prices in the second half of 1997 shortly after the outbreak of the asian financial crisis the transaction volume of us companies purchases of companies in indonesia thailand the philippines malaysia and south korea alone skyrocketed from 542 million us dollars in the first half of the year to 2 billion dollars an increase of nearly 300 percenet step three loot your people the washington consensus persuades developing countries into market pricing arguing that the invisible hand of market can optimize the allocation of resources but this is just a fantasy out of reach in developing countries the price of daily necessities such as food drinking water and natural gas could rise sharply because of supply shortage when the sovereign debt crisis swept across latin america the regional average inflation rate tripled to 150 percent in 1984 1985 at the end of 1984 the inflation rate in argentina was close to 700 percent and reached a peak of 1128 percent in june 1985 the inflation rate in brazil exceeded 200 percent in 1985 and that in peru reached 150 percent in 1987 for ordinary people such hyperinflation caused by market pricing equals killing especially when the economy is in recession in 1998 mass riots broke out in indonesia as the imf cut subsidies for food and fuel rising water prices in bolivia resulted in protests known as water wars ecuador suffered from social chaos due to soaring gas prices all these were in the calculation of western bankers local capital quickly fled social unrest leaving behind extremely cheap assets western companies have long coveted in the end the money people paid for their bills went into the pockets of foreign capitalists as former un secretary general kofi annan put it the development of the west is based on the underdevelopment of the non west and the prosperity of the west is conditioned on the impoverishment of the non west the conditional helping hands offered by international financial institutions controlled by the west are nothing but daggers hidden in smiles the

a building on google s mountain view campus at google and other tech companies workers are feeling the effects of a post pandemic slowdown in spending a year into the pandemic evan spiegel was flying high the chief executive of snap said annual revenue growth of 50 or more was a steady state opportunity for the social media company requiring no additional gains in audience or innovation these days things are heading in a different direction an ex employee freshly let go from the company s research and development wing offered this apocalyptic view of its current status sinking and on fire on tuesday spiegel announced that the parent company of the snapchat app would be cutting about 20 of positions making good on layoff plans that leaked to the media in early august facing the chopping block are investments in gaming third party services and original content as well as the company s camera equipped drones and glasses two stand alone apps the company owns zenly and voisey are also winding down tough day we ve parted with some damn great people at snap who feel more like family than just coworkers pouring one out for team zenly especially a cheeky vodka ricard or two godspeed team keep those heads high i can t wait to see what s next danny trinh dtrinh august 31 2022 advertisement for spiegel whose wealth forbes estimated in may at 3 1 billion it s not an immediate personal crisis the ceo just bought a house the former r d staffer who asked to remain anonymous wrote wednesday via direct message so he s doing good but for employees lower in the corporate hierarchy things aren t so rosy in the cafeteria of the company s santa monica headquarters wednesday morning employees could be heard discussing the layoffs a worker who wasn t authorized to speak with the media said the atmosphere was downcast with everyone knowing colleagues who would be affected snap isn t the only tech firm where workers are currently taking a beating meta platforms the umbrella company that owns facebook instagram and whatsapp has implemented a hiring freeze in certain divisions as has google microsoft netflix and twitter have all gone even further and laid off staff though none has cut its workforce as sharply as snap and tech stocks which are part of many employees compensation packages are sinking it s a dramatic fall from grace for an industry that was all things considered a pretty great one to work in during the pandemic with humanity abruptly thrown into an era of zoom calls doordash deliveries and peloton rides software engineers and designers found their talents being sought after accommodated and remunerated as never before work from home went from a common part time perk to obligatory a hiring surge spurred by demand for digital products and e commerce left software engineers picking between competing job offers or even working multiple gigs at once while tech firms desperate to woo high skilled staffers promised ever more generous perks benefits and bonuses all the while tech stocks shot skyward yet now with belt tightening on the rise at snap and elsewhere that charmed lifestyle faces an uncertain future has the golden age of the tech job started to wane a great deal of talented creative kind people were let go at snap today it is with heavy hearts to say that they will be missed if you are looking to hire some of the best in the industry impacted by the layoffs with other opportunities kindly respond below joe darko joe_darko august 31 2022 i think the economic conditions are certainly starting to favor management over workers said nataliya nedzhvetskaya a uc berkeley doctoral candidate whose research has looked at employee activism in the tech sector one indicator recent efforts by big tech companies to push their employees back into brick and mortar offices apple will soon begin requiring workers to show up in person three days a week some are resisting other companies have adopted even stricter policies eliminating remote work altogether tech mogul elon musk has taken a hard line stance at tesla and says he ll be only slightly more lenient with twitter employees if he ends up acquiring their company working from home can now even mean taking a pay cut a norm that tech giants such as google and twitter led the charge on a vaccine policy statement is posted on the door of a google office in mountain view calif brian contreras los angeles times advertisement it s very specific to the individual worker the role they re in the skill set that they have in terms of the leverage they might have in their work from home situation nedzhvetskaya said i don t think you can say that s the same across the board for all workers in tech but i certainly think there s more concern over job stability than there was even you know six months ago at tech firms where telework is set to stick around permanently managers are cracking down on other fronts meta has been relatively vocal about embracing remote work in the long term chief executive mark zuckerberg is currently pivoting the company toward building a metaverse of immersive virtual worlds and virtual offices are one of his favorite use cases to talk up some types of work especially software engineering you can do pretty well from a lot of different places zuckerberg remarked during a recent interview with podcaster joe rogan sometimes it s actually better to not be in the office because then people aren t bugging you yet amid economic struggles of its own a recent earnings report revealed a first ever year over year drop in quarterly revenue meta has cracked down on other covid niceties bonus vacation days introduced during the pandemic are now being phased out and the free laundry and dry cleaning services it once offered employees are long gone in an internal call reviewed by the verge zuckerberg warned that many employees haven t been working as hard as they ll soon need to be there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn t be here he told staff adding that he ll now be turning up the heat advertisement those workplace changes reflect a shifting economic landscape at many tech companies once skyrocketing stock prices are falling back to earth recent earnings reports from twitter and snap proved disappointing and funding for start ups has started to evaporate investor sentiment in silicon valley is the most negative since the dot com crash venture capitalist david sacks tweeted in may so many amazing people were laid off from snap today my heart is in a million pieces tomorrow will be weird and our team will never truly be the same again if you re actively hiring i d love to share your job postings with those who were affected tessa kriesel tessak22 august 31 2022 yet even as a pandemic induced period of prosperity and flexibility wanes tech remains broadly an industry with a lot of upside for workers many chalk that up to simple economics there s a lot of demand for high skill techies but relatively limited supply john chadfield a secretary with united tech and allied workers a branch of the united kingdom s communication workers union said that the deficit in american tech workers gives them significant power to make demands about for instance whether they work from a cubicle versus a couch unemployment for these kinds of workers is still very very low agreed louis hyman director of cornell university s institute for workplace studies maybe they can t choose between google and amazon but they could choose google and ge if all companies now are software companies which is not true entirely but kind of true there s still lots of opportunities company bikes sit outside an office building on google s mountain view campus brian contreras los angeles times fundamentally he added labor power comes from whether or not you can easily be replaced yet the industry isn t homogenous even if software engineers working at name brand tech companies or brandishing impressive college degrees still enjoy some leverage their counterparts on lower rungs of the industry ladder occupy a substantially more precarious position the tech sector is very stratified said ron hira an associate professor in howard university s political science department who studies labor dynamics despite what pop culture might suggest he added not every google employee is hanging out all day playing ping pong most of the people who work for google are going to be contract workers hira said if they had agency and had power they wouldn t be contractors they d rather work directly for google a large scale chess set in a gardened area of the google campus in mountain view brian contreras los angeles times for the time being google employees are required to show up to the office three times a week but on a sunny friday in late august there was not much evidence of that policy at the company s flagship mountain view calif campus empty parking spots were everywhere the oversized chess sets dotting various manicured gardens appeared untouched among the sparse blend of staffers contractors and interns who were wandering the office park a little after lunchtime some said the return to office mandate isn t being consistently enforced hanwen ling a recent college graduate who started working for google ads earlier this summer said the prospect of hybrid work was part of what drew him to the company in the first place i don t really like full remote ling said i kind of like this hybrid google employees are nominally expected in the office three days a week but on a sunny friday afternoon the flagship campus remained relatively sleepy brian contreras los angeles times another employee who asked to remain anonymous said that nobody is really adhering to the three day rule it s really up to the discretion of the manager but this person added the company has begun rolling back stipends to help employees set up at home offices google did not respond to an email inquiring about the home office stipends meanwhile the slowdown in hiring has changed the texture of the job with fewer new hands to share in tasks the employee said the way it s impacted me is i feel we re very understaffed advertisement it s a complaint that post layoffs may also soon be heard at snap and as the sector continues to constrict probably other companies as well

there are two things you don t want to do when there s an energy crisis one is to suppress prices which makes the shortage of energy even worse because consumers have less incentive to conserve and producers have less incentive to produce the other is to hoard the limited supply of energy so you have plenty but others are left dry unfortunately we re seeing signs of both behaviors in capitals ranging from athens to oslo and washington d c the emerging energy crisis that s centered in europe would be bad enough even if policy were perfect vladimir putin s russia is restricting the supply of natural gas apparently to punish europe for supporting ukraine against putin s invasion and for aiming to wean itself off russian gas in the long run a prolonged drought in europe has reduced the supply of hydroelectric power forced nuclear plants to cut back for lack of cooling water and reduced the traffic of barges carrying coal several french nuclear plants are down for maintenance and repairs germany s last remaining nuclear plants are scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of this year how bad is it daniel yergin a longtime energy expert pointed out to me that natural gas in europe briefly got so expensive earlier this month that if oil were as expensive in terms of the cost per unit of energy content it would have cost more than 560 a barrel and people consider 100 a barrel high that s an eye popping number said yergin who is vice chairman of s p global and the author most recently of the new map energy climate and the clash of nations bad energy policy makes everything worse though the greek government is so intent on insulating its citizens from high energy prices that it s devoting more than 3 percent of the nation s gross domestic product to subsidies according to data from the international monetary fund see chart 14 b here france italy and spain which matter more because they re bigger are devoting about 1 percent of gross domestic product to measures that impede price pass through per the i m f suppressing the price of fuel helps even people who don t need help the rich exacerbates shortages and tends to continue long after a crisis is over because people don t want to give up their subsidies

click to enlarge kuala lumpur corporate earnings for the recent second quarter have overall been within expectations but they may progressively slow in the second half of the year 2h22 thus far according to analysts it has been a mixed bag in the second quarter with some companies within the same sector reporting varied performances namely property food and beverage f b manufacturing and plantation rakuten trade head of research kenny yee told starbiz that banks plantation firms and real estate investment trusts have been the obvious winners in the second quarter while the underperformers have mainly been in the manufacturing sector that has been unable to cope with rising costs he cautioned that rising material costs would be the key challenge for companies in 2h22 it has been a mixed bag but overall earnings thus far are within expectations said yee on a positive note uob kay hian research head of research vincent khoo said stocks under its coverage posted a slightly positive trend quarter on quarter with a lower percentage reporting disappointing earnings and a higher percentage surpassing expectations positive earnings surprises were mostly linked to the consumers sector that saw robust demand amid higher average selling prices asps we are also expecting the banking sector to outperform due to lower than expected provisions leading to reduced net credit cost sector wise disappointments were mostly related to the glove sector due to soft asps and property sector that saw labour shortage issues and material supply chain disruption he added however khoo foresees corporate earnings momentum to slow in 2h22 due to domestic consumption slowdown from the tapering of the employees provident fund s special withdrawal scheme as well as a cut in consumption by businesses and consumers in view of the high inflation and bearish global economy sector wise we may see corporate earnings slowdown in the domestic oriented and cyclical businesses for example properties and autos he said another key drag to the earnings in 2h22 would be the cumulative cost inflation eating into the profit margins of businesses added khoo in addition to slowing corporate earnings growth which also reflects slowing external demand he said other corporate headwinds anticipated in 2h22 include a rising overnight policy rate and a globally tightening financial liquidity but he pointed out there are economic bright spots for manufacturers that would benefit from the successful recruitment and replenishment of foreign workers which raises capacity utilisation productivity and profit margins meanwhile he expects the ringgit to moderately depreciate against the greenback in 2h22 and through 2023 mainly reflecting the aggressive rate hikes by the united states throughout 2023 as such khoo said a softer ringgit would be negative for import dependent sectors such as f b and for companies with high us dollar denominated debt adding that it would be positive to export oriented sectors such as commodities and technology sharing similar views johns hopkins university professor of international economics michael plummer predicts the ringgit would continue to weaken but only marginally to about 4 60 against the us dollar over the next few months this is mainly due to the economic uncertainty in the global economy with economic downturns in key economies like the united states china and european union countries moreover the us federal reserve fed has most likely not stopped increasing interest rates with inflation still at high rates though future ones may well be smaller than the past two increases of 75 basis points the european central bank will no doubt continue to tighten as well these will lead to small but notable increase in the value of the us dollar vis a vis currencies in the emerging markets and elsewhere he said he expects the ringgit to depreciate to rm4 67 against the greenback by year end weakening to a further 5 given the effects of decreases in global demand on malaysian exports he said there are forecasts for a downturn in the us market in part the result of the significant monetary contraction initiated by the fed to reduce inflation the eu is also slowing down and china has big challenges including its zero covid policy which has led to major lockdowns he added with a slowing or contracting global economy there will be less demand for exports including of malaysia s hence its exports will slow this will lead to a reduction in the supply of foreign exchange us dollar to malaysia and thus a slight depreciation in the currency the depreciation in turn will help offset the decline in exports over time he noted meanwhile rakuten s yee projects that the local bourse could see a better performance in the next two quarters due to improved liquidity with a possibility of interest rate hike relented so far the market has performed credibly amid the heightened volatility on wall street he said

election peltola topped republican former gov sarah palinafter ballots were tallied and votes for third place gop candidate nick begich iii were redistributed to his supporters second choices peltola a yup ik former state lawmaker who calls bethel home is now slated to be the first woman to hold alaska s lone u s house seat if results are confirmed as expected by the state review board later this week she will succeed u s rep don young the republican who held the office for nearly five decades since before peltola was born the special election was triggered by young s death in march i feel like i need to catch my breath for a minute peltola said in the moment after results were announced in a live videoby state election officials in juneau peltola was surrounded by family and campaign staff at an anchorage office what s most important is that i m an alaskan being sent to represent all alaskans yes being alaska native is part of my ethnicity but i m much more than my ethnicity she said it is an outcome largely seen as an upset peltola would be the first democrat to join alaska s three person congressional delegation since u s sen mark begich lost reelection in 2014 and she defeated two republicans to do so combined palin and begich nephew of mark begich and grandson of former u s rep nick begich commanded nearly 60 of first place votes the special election held aug 16 with mail in ballots counted over the past two weeks and the ranked choice standings announced wednesday determines who will serve out the remainder of young s term which ends in january another election in november will determine who holds the seat for the full two year term that begins in january peltola palin and begich said after results were announced wednesday that they intend to remain in the november race no candidate exceeded the 50 first choice threshold needed to win under alaska s ranked choice voting system begich was in third place the second choice votes of begich s supporters were then tallied in what is called an instant runoff only half of begich s voters ranked palin second not enough for her to overtake peltola peltola had 39 7 of the first choice votes to palin s 30 9 in the instant runoff peltola ended up with 91 206 votes to palin s 85 987 or 51 47 to 48 53 a small number of additional ballots have not yet been counted by election officials likely

results bill roth adn u s house candidate sarah palin at her campaign headquarters in south anchorage after the rank choice ballots were counted on wednesday palin vowed to fight on to november and repeatedly called on fellow republican begich to drop out her greatest scorn though was reserved for alaska s weird ranked choice voting system which she said had disenfranchised too many alaskans and by sending peltola to congress effectively empowered president joe biden and house speaker nancy pelosi to lock up our state we can t be disheartened in fact i think god prepared me for an outcome like this believe it or not she said i think god has kind of given me peace all along no matter what the outcome was we re running to expose the strange things going on in our politics that are harming our nation and our state two dozen or so campaign volunteers friends and family members gathered at palin s south anchorage headquarters to watch the tabulation process play out with a large cake emblazoned with sarah for alaska in icing the candidate herself was still on her way from the dena ina center downtown when the results were released there was initial confusion at what the numbers meant followed by disbelief and then anger how is that possible one campaign volunteer shouted when it became clear that palin would lose arriving a few minutes later to loud applause she was defiant i feel like we ve only just begun to fight for alaska she said to shouts of amen bill roth adn former gov sarah palin at her campaign headquarters in south anchorage after the rank choice ballots were counted on wednesday after a short speech and hugs she cut the cake and handed out slices to her well wishers palin who needed begich supporters second choice votes to come from behind and defeat peltola was dismissive of the new election system saying that the task in front of me is to explain to alaskans why ranked choice voting is not in the public s best interest she remained personally fond of peltola and said the two had a great relationship since she was governor and peltola was a state legislator she was heavily critical of begich whom she accused of negative campaigning and splitting the gop vote i don t even know the dude i ve lived here all my life i don t know who he is why is he taking all these pot shots palin said pro fish peltola ran a largely positive campaign as begich and palin traded barbs in the final weeks before the aug 16 special election emerging as the victor with a platform that highlighted her position as the only candidate on the ballot who supports abortion access an issue that has become important to voters with the recent u s supreme court decision removing federal protections for access to the procedure the procedure remains protected under the alaska constitution peltola has also said she is pro fish and emphasized her plans to protect subsistence fisheries in alaska as salmon stocks decline in the region where she has fished throughout her life loren holmes adn sarah palin left and mary peltola stand on stage before a u s house candidate forum at the alaska oil and gas association conference on wednesday as the results came in a handful of campaign staffers her husband gene peltola jr and her stepdaughter kaeli peltola huddled around peltola as she watched the livestream from a laptop once the room realized peltola won they erupted with cheers after the initial celebration the campaign team s festivities were fairly modest as peltola spoke with reporters peltola whose 49th birthday was on wednesday said she planned to spend the night with her family eating akutaq with handpicked berries peltola was raised in rural villages and lives in bethel she is a mother of four stepmother of three and grandmother of two she served in the state house between 1999 and 2009 representing the bethel region during her time in the legislature she led the bush caucus bringing together lawmakers representing communities in alaska off the road system and building a reputation as someone who can work across party lines while in the legislature peltola s path overlapped with palin s as governor both politicians were pregnant while in office they traded friendly text messages on election day earlier this month an hour before results were announced peltola and palin were set to take the stage together for a candidate forumput on by an oil industry organization the two women embraced and spoke for a few minutes before answering questions on natural resource development marc lester adn sarah

candidate forum with sarah palin who was escorted by ron duguay at the alaska oil and gas association conference on wednesday aug 31 2022 at the dena ina civic and convention center in anchorage results showing peltola as the winner were announced shortly after the forum i take a lot of pride in getting along with people and those of us on the campaign trail know exactly how hard it is on families and your support group peltola said after results were out so i think i feel a lot of camaraderie and fraternity with the people that i m in the race with not just state history but national history after leaving the state house peltola worked in community relations for donlin gold a mining project on the kuskokwim river before announcing her congressional bid she worked on fisheries management and rural food security as executive director of the kuskokwim river inter tribal fish commission peltola emerged as the winner from an original field of 48 primary race candidates which included several sitting and former lawmakers alaska native leaders and santa claus peltola is now set to head to washingtonfor just four months serving out the rest of young s term on wednesday she said she remains focused on the november race and winning the two year seat she said she would prioritize setting up constituent services for alaska s lone u s house office that were discontinued in recent weeks in addition to reaching out to future colleagues in the house and to alaska republican sens lisa murkowski and dan sullivan she said she did not yet have an itinerary for traveling to the nation s capital murkowski and sullivan both congratulated peltola for her victory murkowski who is running for reelection this year said in a statement wednesday that peltola made history the two worked together in the state legislature not just state history but national history as the first alaska native woman elected to congress while it will be impossible for alaska to replace congressman young mary has a long track record for public service murkowski said among those congratulating peltola was president joe biden who called her after results were announced marc lester adn mary peltola right answers a question during a u s house candidate forum at the alaska oil and gas association annual conference held at the dena ina center in anchorage on wednesday big wake up call political observers believe the outcome of the special election will shape the november race after just a few weeks to prove her legislative might in washington peltola will enter the november election as the incumbent with the associated fundraising advantages and visibility republicans will likely be galvanized to hone their messaging under the ranked choice voting system which was narrowly approved by voters through a 2020 ballot measure and encourage their supporters to rank both gop candidates on the ballot sarah erkmann ward a political consultant who ran a campaign to encourage republicans to rank the red meaning all republican candidates on the ballot said the results could be a big wake up call to republicans today s results should illustrate to republicans very clearly that when they choose not to rank there s a good possibility that when their favorite candidate is eliminated then their vote will no longer be in the mix that appears to be what happened here she said a certain segment of republicans elected not to rank that s the consequence of not continuing on down your ballot political consultant john henry heckendorn who worked on peltola s campaign said that a rank the red message can only go so far and that peltola won thanks to her positivity and uniquely alaska platform the primary reason she won is because a bunch of begich voters were willing to pick a democrat second that s not supposed to happen heckendorn said that says a lot about alaska and it also says a lot about mary more than a quarter of begich voters ranked peltola second crossing party lines one fifth of his voters did not rank any candidate as their second choice palin who ran with an endorsement from former president donald trump and spent some of her campaign in the lower 48 has consistently attacked ranked choice voting as a whack system that must be changed begich had the support of many alaska republican party insiders and attacked palin for her decision to quit as governor in 2009 palin responded by calling into question begich s republican bona fides pointing to his support for his democratic uncle s senate campaigns in 2008 and 2014 marc lester adn sarah palin and mary peltola on wednesday before a u s house candidate forum at the alaska oil and gas association annual conference at the dena ina convention center in anchorage the animus between palin and begich was on full display in the candidate forum held just before results were announced begich attacked palin for a policy she advanced as governor that increased taxes on oil companies palin called him negative nick and said he s what s wrong with politics today in a written statement after results were out begich said the biggest lesson from the results is that a vote for sarah palin is in reality a vote for mary peltola he said he would continue his campaign for the two year term making the case that this election is about a choice between mary peltola and nick begich sarah palin cannot win a statewide race because her unfavorable rating is so high he said polling before the election showed palin to be a polarizing figure three in five alaskans had a negative view of her according to more than one poll but her fame name recognition and harnessing of republican messaging on oil drilling propelled palin ahead of begich who was running his first statewide campaign for public office after building a career in private business gotta love alaska results were announced by election officials in a live video wednesday after the candidate forum the candidates didn t linger after the forum ended they exited through a side door and soon the stage was cleared as candidates drove to their gatherings to await results in the meantime conference goers including members
